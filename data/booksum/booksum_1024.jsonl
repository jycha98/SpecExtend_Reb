Cyrano, at great risk to his life, has found a way to get across the lines and he does so in order to send \"Christian's\" letters to Roxane. The reason that he does not bring food on any of these trips is that it would be too bulky for him to carry and still be able to evade the Spaniards. Cyrano says that he thinks there must be a change soon, that the company will either eat or die: the Spanish are planning something."}

When De Guiche arrives in mask, Cyrano swings down and lands between him and the door, pretending to be a lunatic who has fallen from the moon. He keeps De Guiche engaged with his chatter about \"six ways to violate the virgin sky\" and get to the moon. Throughout this dialogue Cyrano speaks with a Gascon accent and keeps his nose concealed with the brim of his hat in order to hide his identity from De Guiche. When the newly married Roxane and Christian emerge from the house, De Guiche grasps the situation. He acknowledges Roxane's cleverness and Cyrano's powers of invention in keeping him occupied. Wanting revenge, however, De Guiche orders that all the cadets must join the regiment and leave for Arras immediately. The distraught Roxane begs Cyrano to ensure Christian's safety, comfort and fidelity. She also asks for regular letters, which Cyrano promises."}

The gaoler replies that he has orders not to allow visitors. Paulina then requests a chance to speak to one of the queen's ladies, Emilia if possible. The gaoler agrees to bring Emilia to Paulina if she dismisses her attendants, and if he himself can attend the conference. Paulina cooperates, but she expresses in asides the building fury that she feels about her good queen's imprisonment. Emilia reports that Hermione is doing as well as one \"so great and so forlorn\" might expect in her situation. Blaming the fears and sadnesses that weigh upon the queen, Emilia reports the premature delivery of a daughter. In spite of the \"dangerous unsafe lunes i' the king,\" Paulina decides to show Leontes his infant daughter, and she pledges a blistering advocacy for the queen. If Hermione will trust her with the infant, Paulina feels that the sight of the innocent baby will persuade Leontes to change his attitude toward the queen. Emilia praises Paulina as the most suitable woman to undertake the brave errand. In fact, she says, Hermione had thought of the same plan but had rejected it because she feared that anyone whom she might ask to do so would turn her down. When Emilia exits to ask for the baby, the gaoler tells Paulina that he cannot allow the baby to leave the prison unless he sees a warrant. Paulina convinces him that the baby entered the prison as an innocent in her mother's womb and therefore needs no warrant in order to leave. This argument easily sways the simple gaoler, but Paulina further soothes his fears by pledging to stand between him and any danger from Leontes."}

The Lion Becomes the King of Beasts.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\nAfter climbing down from the china wall the travellers found\nthemselves in a disagreeable country, full of bogs and marshes and\ncovered with tall, rank grass. It was difficult to walk far without\nfalling into muddy holes, for the grass was so thick that it hid them\nfrom sight. However, by carefully picking their way, they got safely\nalong until they reached solid ground. But here the country seemed\nwilder than ever, and after a long and tiresome walk through the\nunderbrush they entered another forest, where the trees were bigger\nand older than any they had ever seen.\n\n\"This forest is perfectly delightful,\" declared the Lion, looking\naround him with joy; \"never have I seen a more beautiful place.\"\n\n\"It seems gloomy,\" said the Scarecrow.\n\n\"Not a bit of it,\" answered the Lion; \"I should like to live here all\nmy life. See how soft the dried leaves are under your feet and how\nrich and green the moss is that clings to these old trees. Surely no\nwild beast could wish a pleasanter home.\"\n\n\"Perhaps there are wild beasts in the forest now,\" said Dorothy.\n\n\"I suppose there are,\" returned the Lion; \"but I do not see any of\nthem about.\"\n\nThey walked through the forest until it became too dark to go any\nfarther. Dorothy and Toto and the Lion lay down to sleep, while the\nWoodman and the Scarecrow kept watch over them as usual.\n\nWhen morning came they started again. Before they had gone far they\nheard a low rumble, as of the growling of many wild animals. Toto\nwhimpered a little but none of the others was frightened and they kept\nalong the well-trodden path until they came to an opening in the wood,\nin which were gathered hundreds of beasts of every variety. There were\ntigers and elephants and bears and wolves and foxes and all the others\nin the natural history, and for a moment Dorothy was afraid. But the\nLion explained that the animals were holding a meeting, and he judged\nby their snarling and growling that they were in great trouble.\n\nAs he spoke several of the beasts caught sight of him, and at once\nthe great assemblage hushed as if by magic. The biggest of the tigers\ncame up to the Lion and bowed, saying,\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Welcome, O King of Beasts! You have come in good time to fight our\nenemy and bring peace to all the animals of the forest once more.\"\n\n\"What is your trouble?\" asked the Lion, quietly.\n\n\"We are all threatened,\" answered the tiger, \"by a fierce enemy which\nhas lately come into this forest.

It has eight of these long legs, and as the monster\ncrawls through the forest he seizes an animal with a leg and drags it\nto his mouth, where he eats it as a spider does a fly. Not one of us is\nsafe while this fierce creature is alive, and we had called a meeting\nto decide how to take care of ourselves when you came among us.\"\n\nThe Lion thought for a moment.\n\n\"Are there any other lions in this forest?\" he asked.\n\n\"No; there were some, but the monster has eaten them all. And,\nbesides, they were none of them nearly so large and brave as you.\"\n\n\"If I put an end to your enemy will you bow down to me and obey me as\nKing of the Forest?\" enquired the Lion.\n\n\"We will do that gladly,\" returned the tiger; and all the other\nbeasts roared with a mighty roar: \"We will!\"\n\n\"Where is this great spider of yours now?\" asked the Lion.\n\n\"Yonder, among the oak trees,\" said the tiger, pointing with his\nfore-foot.\n\n\"Take good care of these friends of mine,\" said the Lion, \"and I\n\n### Summary:\n\n", "answer": "The travelers are over the wall and in a nasty country filled with wetlands.

Result of the Ideas of the King, and the Ideas of\n\nD'Artagnan.\n\nThe blow was direct. It was severe, mortal. D'Artagnan, furious at\nhaving been anticipated by an idea of the king's, did not despair,\nhowever, even yet; and reflecting upon the idea he had brought back from\nBelle-Isle, he elicited therefrom novel means of safety for his friends.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said he, suddenly, \"since the king has charged some other\nthan myself with his secret orders, it must be because I no longer\npossess his confidence, and I should really be unworthy of it if I had\nthe courage to hold a command subject to so many injurious suspicions.\nTherefore I will go immediately and carry my resignation to the king.\nI tender it before you all, enjoining you all to fall back with me upon\nthe coast of France, in such a way as not to compromise the safety of\nthe forces his majesty has confided to me. For this purpose, return all\nto your posts; within an hour, we shall have the ebb of the tide. To\nyour posts, gentlemen! I suppose,\" added he, on seeing that all prepared\nto obey him, except the surveillant officer, \"you have no orders to\nobject, this time?\"\n\nAnd D'Artagnan almost triumphed while speaking these words. This plan\nwould prove the safety of his friends. The blockade once raised, they\nmight embark immediately, and set sail for England or Spain, without\nfear of being molested. Whilst they were making their escape, D'Artagnan\nwould return to the king; would justify his return by the indignation\nwhich the mistrust of Colbert had raised in him; he would be sent back\nwith full powers, and he would take Belle-Isle; that is to say, the\ncage, after the birds had flown. But to this plan the officer opposed a\nfurther order of the king's. It was thus conceived:\n\n\"From the moment M. d'Artagnan shall have manifested the desire of\ngiving in his resignation, he shall no longer be reckoned leader of the\nexpedition, and every officer placed under his orders shall be held to\nno longer obey him. Moreover, the said Monsieur d'Artagnan, having lost\nthat quality of leader of the army sent against Belle-Isle, shall set\nout immediately for France, accompanied by the officer who will have\nremitted the message to him, and who will consider him a prisoner for\nwhom he is answerable.\"\n\nBrave and careless as he was, D'Artagnan turned pale. Everything had\nbeen calculated with a depth of precognition which, for the first time\nin thirty years, recalled to him the solid foresight and inflexible\nlogic of the great cardinal. He leaned his head on his hand, thoughtful,\nscarcely breathing. \"If I were to put this order in my pocket,\" thought\nhe, \"who would know it, what would prevent my doing it? Before the king\nhad had time to be informed, I should have saved those poor fellows\nyonder. Let us exercise some small audacity! My head is not one of those\nthe executioner strikes off for disobedience. We will disobey!\" But at\nthe moment he was about to adopt this plan, he saw the officers around\nhim reading similar orders, which the passive agent of the thoughts of\nthat infernal Colbert had distributed to them. This contingency of his\ndisobedience had been foreseen--as all the rest had been.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said the officer, coming up to him, \"I await your good\npleasure to depart.\"\n\n\"I am ready, monsieur,\" replied D'Artagnan, grinding his teeth.\n\nThe officer immediately ordered a canoe to receive M. d'Artagnan and\nhimself. At sight of this he became almost distraught with rage.\n\n\"How,\" stammered he, \"will you carry on the directions of the different\ncorps?\"\n\n\"When you are gone, monsieur,\" replied the commander of the fleet, \"it\nis to me the command of the whole is committed.\"\n\n\"Then\n\n### Summary:\n\n", "answer": "D'Artagnan is furious that the King has anticipated him. He decides to go with the fallback plan. D'Artagnan announces his intention to resign, and says that the fleet must return to Nantes with him. With the blockade raised, his friends will have time to escape. When he asks if anyone objects to this plan, an officer stands up and hands D'Artagnan yet another order signed by the King. Should D'Artagnan attempt to resign, says the order, he is to be relieved of command and taken as a prisoner back to France. D'Artagnan is shocked at the King's foresight and wile. He has anticipated D'Artagnan's every move. D'Artagnan's last thought is to simply take the order and hide it in his pocket, but he soon realizes that all the men on the ship have been given a copy of the order. There is no more hope; D'Artagnan allows himself to be taken prisoner by one of his men. D'Artagnan hears canon shots when he reaches the coast of France."}

They had nearly reached\nthe first rock when they heard a rough voice cry out,\n\n\"Keep back!\"\n\n\"Who are you?\" asked the Scarecrow. Then a head showed itself over\nthe rock and the same voice said,\n\n\"This hill belongs to us, and we don't allow anyone to cross it.\"\n\n\"But we must cross it,\" said the Scarecrow. \"We're going to the\ncountry of the Quadlings.\"\n\n\"But you shall not!\" replied the voice, and there stepped from behind\nthe rock the strangest man the travellers had ever seen.\n\nHe was quite short and stout and had a big head, which was flat at the\ntop and supported by a thick neck full of wrinkles.

So he said,\n\n\"I'm sorry not to do as you wish, but we must pass over your hill\nwhether you like it or not,\" and he walked boldly forward.\n\nAs quick as lightning the man's head shot forward and his neck\nstretched out until the top of the head, where it was flat, struck\nthe Scarecrow in the middle and sent him tumbling, over and over,\ndown the hill. Almost as quickly as it came the head went back to the\nbody, and the man laughed harshly as he said,\n\n\"It isn't as easy as you think!\"\n\nA chorus of boisterous laughter came from the other rocks, and\nDorothy saw hundreds of the armless Hammer-Heads upon the hillside,\none behind every rock.\n\nThe Lion became quite angry at the laughter caused by the Scarecrow's\nmishap, and giving a loud roar that echoed like thunder he dashed up\nthe hill.\n\nAgain a head shot swiftly out, and the great Lion went rolling down\nthe hill as if he had been struck by a cannon ball.\n\nDorothy ran down and helped the Scarecrow to his feet, and the Lion\ncame up to her, feeling rather bruised and sore, and said,\n\n\"It is useless to fight people with shooting heads; no one can\nwithstand them.\"\n\n\"What can we do, then?\" she asked.\n\n\"Call the Winged Monkeys,\" suggested the Tin Woodman; \"you have still\nthe right to command them once more.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" she answered, and putting on the Golden Cap she uttered\nthe magic words. The Monkeys were as prompt as ever, and in a few\nmoments the entire band stood before her.\n\n\"What are your commands?\" enquired the King of the Monkeys, bowing low.\n\n\"Carry us over the hill to the country of the Quadlings,\" answered\nthe girl.\n\n\"It shall be done,\" said the King, and at once the Winged Monkeys\ncaught the four travellers and Toto up in their arms and flew away\nwith them. As they passed over the hill the Hammer-Heads yelled with\nvexation, and shot their heads high in the air; but they could not\nreach the Winged Monkeys, which carried Dorothy and her comrades\nsafely over the hill and set them down in the beautiful country of\nthe Quadlings.\n\n\"This is the last time you can summon us,\" said the leader to\nDorothy; \"so good-bye and good luck to you.\"\n\n\"Good-bye, and thank you very much,\" returned the girl; and the\nMonkeys rose into the air and were out of sight in a twinkling.\n\n\n\n### Summary:\n\n", "answer": "Having emerged from the forest, our travelers encounter a steep hill.

When the Guardian of the\nGate saw them again he wondered greatly that they could leave the\nbeautiful City to get into new trouble. But he at once unlocked their\nspectacles, which he put back into the green box, and gave them many\ngood wishes to carry with them.\n\n\"You are now our ruler,\" he said to the Scarecrow; \"so you must come\nback to us as soon as possible.\"\n\n\"I certainly shall if I am able,\" the Scarecrow replied; \"but I must\nhelp Dorothy to get home, first.\"\n\nAs Dorothy bade the good-natured Guardian a last farewell she said,\n\n\"I have been very kindly treated in your lovely City, and everyone\nhas been good to me. I cannot tell you how grateful I am.\"\n\n\"Don't try, my dear,\" he answered. \"We should like to keep you with\nus, but if it is your wish to return to Kansas I hope you will find a\nway.\" He then opened the gate of the outer wall and they walked forth\nand started upon their journey.\n\nThe sun shone brightly as our friends turned their faces toward the\nLand of the South. They were all in the best of spirits, and laughed\nand chatted together. Dorothy was once more filled with the hope of\ngetting home, and the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman were glad to be\nof use to her. As for the Lion, he sniffed the fresh air with delight\nand whisked his tail from side to side in pure joy at being in the\ncountry again, while Toto ran around them and chased the moths and\nbutterflies, barking merrily all the time.\n\n\"City life does not agree with me at all,\" remarked the Lion, as they\nwalked along at a brisk pace. \"I have lost much flesh since I lived\nthere, and now I am anxious for a chance to show the other beasts how\ncourageous I have grown.\"\n\n[Illustration: \"_The branches bent down and twined around him._\"]\n\nThey now turned and took a last look at the Emerald City. All they\ncould see was a mass of towers and steeples behind the green walls,\nand high up above everything the spires and dome of the Palace of Oz.\n\n\"Oz was not such a bad Wizard, after all,\" said the Tin Woodman, as\nhe felt his heart rattling around in his breast.\n\n\"He knew how to give me brains, and very good brains, too,\" said the\nScarecrow.\n\n\"If Oz had taken a dose of the same courage he gave me,\" added the\nLion, \"he would have been a brave man.\"\n\nDorothy said nothing. Oz had not kept the promise he made her, but he\nhad done his best, so she forgave him. As he said, he was a good man,\neven if he was a bad Wizard.\n\nThe first day's journey was through the green fields and bright\nflowers that stretched about the Emerald City on every side. They\nslept that night on the grass, with nothing but the stars over them;\nand they rested very well indeed.\n\nIn the morning they travelled on until they came to a thick wood. There\nwas no way of going around it, for it seemed to extend to the right and\nleft as far as they could see; and, besides, they did not dare change\nthe direction of their journey for fear of getting lost. So they looked\nfor the place where it would be easiest to get into the forest.\n\nThe Scarecrow, who was in the lead, finally discovered a big tree\nwith such wide spreading-branches that there was room for the party\nto pass underneath. So he walked forward to the tree, but just as he\ncame under the first branches they bent down and twined around him,\nand the next minute he was raised from the ground and flung headlong\namong his fellow travellers.\n\nThis did not hurt\n\n### Summary:\n\n", "answer": "The gang leaves the Emerald City.

The Scarecrow tries to enter under the branches of a big tree, but the tree wallops him good. Even so, the Scarecrow's fine. He tries to pass under another tree and gets tossed again. Dang, these trees are violent! The Tin Woodman goes back to the first tree that assaulted the Scarecrow and gives it a good hack with his axe.

Then he\nentered the back room and took up a measure of bran, which he mixed\nwith a great many pins and needles. Having shaken them together\nthoroughly, he filled the top of the Scarecrow's head with the mixture\nand stuffed the rest of the space with straw, to hold it in place. When\nhe had fastened the Scarecrow's head on his body again he said to him,\n\n\"Hereafter you will be a great man, for I have given you a lot of\nbran-new brains.\"\n\nThe Scarecrow was both pleased and proud at the fulfillment of his\ngreatest wish, and having thanked Oz warmly he went back to his friends.\n\nDorothy looked at him curiously. His head was quite bulging out at\nthe top with brains.\n\n\"How do you feel?\" she asked.\n\n[Illustration: \"_'I feel wise, indeed,' said the Scarecrow._\"]\n\n\"I feel wise, indeed,\" he answered, earnestly. \"When I get used to my\nbrains I shall know everything.\"\n\n\"Why are those needles and pins sticking out of your head?\" asked the\nTin Woodman.\n\n\"That is proof that he is sharp,\" remarked the Lion.\n\n\"Well, I must go to Oz and get my heart,\" said the Woodman. So he\nwalked to the Throne Room and knocked at the door.\n\n\"Come in,\" called Oz, and the Woodman entered and said,\n\n\"I have come for my heart.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" answered the little man. \"But I shall have to cut a hole\nin your breast, so I can put your heart in the right place. I hope it\nwon't hurt you.\"\n\n\"Oh, no;\" answered the Woodman. \"I shall not feel it at all.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nSo Oz brought a pair of tinners' shears and cut a small, square hole\nin the left side of the Tin Woodman's breast. Then, going to a chest\nof drawers, he took out a pretty heart, made entirely of silk and\nstuffed with sawdust.\n\n\"Isn't it a beauty?\" he asked.\n\n\"It is, indeed!\" replied the Woodman, who was greatly pleased. \"But\nis it a kind heart?\"\n\n\"Oh, very!\" answered Oz. He put the heart in the Woodman's breast and\nthen replaced the square of tin, soldering it neatly together where\nit had been cut.\n\n\"There,\" said he; \"now you have a heart that any man might be proud\nof. I'm sorry I had to put a patch on your breast, but it really\ncouldn't be helped.\"\n\n### Summary:\n\n", "answer": "It's morning and the Scarecrow is beside himself as he waits to go collect his new brain. Finally, it's time. Oz removes his head and stuffs it with bran, pins, and needles. Sounds like a breakfast cereal for robots, but guess what? Instant intelligence. The Scarecrow is thrilled. Time for the tin man to collect his heart. Oz cuts a whole in his chest and puts in a silk heart that's stuffed with sawdust. Next is the Lion. Oz gives him a dish filled with \"courage\" to drink. The Lion instantly feels very brave. After everyone has left the throne room, Oz wonders how on earth he's going to help Dorothy. He didn't do anything to actually help the rest of the gang; they just thought he did. Their belief was enough to make the trick work."}

The Cyclone.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\nDorothy lived in the midst of the great Kansas prairies, with Uncle\nHenry, who was a farmer, and Aunt Em, who was the farmer's wife.\nTheir house was small, for the lumber to build it had to be carried\nby wagon many miles. There were four walls, a floor and a roof,\nwhich made one room; and this room contained a rusty looking cooking\nstove, a cupboard for the dishes, a table, three or four chairs,\nand the beds. Uncle Henry and Aunt Em had a big bed in one corner,\nand Dorothy a little bed in another corner. There was no garret at\nall, and no cellar--except a small hole, dug in the ground, called a\ncyclone cellar, where the family could go in case one of those great\nwhirlwinds arose, mighty enough to crush any building in its path. It\nwas reached by a trap-door in the middle of the floor, from which a\nladder led down into the small, dark hole.\n\nWhen Dorothy stood in the doorway and looked around, she could see\nnothing but the great gray prairie on every side. Not a tree nor a\nhouse broke the broad sweep of flat country that reached the edge of\nthe sky in all directions. The sun had baked the plowed land into a\ngray mass, with little cracks running through it. Even the grass was\nnot green, for the sun had burned the tops of the long blades until\nthey were the same gray color to be seen everywhere. Once the house had\nbeen painted, but the sun blistered the paint and the rains washed it\naway, and now the house was as dull and gray as everything else.\n\n[Illustration: \"_She caught Toto by the ear._\"]\n\nWhen Aunt Em came there to live she was a young, pretty wife. The\nsun and wind had changed her, too. They had taken the sparkle from\nher eyes and left them a sober gray; they had taken the red from her\ncheeks and lips, and they were gray also. She was thin and gaunt,\nand never smiled, now. When Dorothy, who was an orphan, first came\nto her, Aunt Em had been so startled by the child's laughter that\nshe would scream and press her hand upon her heart whenever Dorothy's\nmerry voice reached her ears; and she still looked at the little girl\nwith wonder that she could find anything to laugh at.\n\nUncle Henry never laughed. He worked hard from morning till night and\ndid not know what joy was. He was gray also, from his long beard to\nhis rough boots, and he looked stern and solemn, and rarely spoke.\n\nIt was Toto that made Dorothy laugh, and saved her from growing as\ngray as her other surroundings. Toto was not gray; he was a little\nblack dog, with long, silky hair and small black eyes that twinkled\nmerrily on either side of his funny, wee nose. Toto played all day\nlong, and Dorothy played with him, and loved him dearly.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nTo-day, however, they were not playing. Uncle Henry sat upon the\ndoor-step and looked anxiously at the sky, which was even grayer than\nusual. Dorothy stood in the door with Toto in her arms, and looked at\nthe sky too. Aunt Em was washing the dishes.\n\nFrom the far north they heard a low wail of the wind, and Uncle\nHenry and Dorothy could see where the long grass bowed in waves\nbefore the coming storm. There now came a sharp whistling in the\nair from the south, and as they turned their eyes that way they saw\nripples in the grass coming from that direction also.\n\nSuddenly Uncle Henry stood up.\n\n\"There's a cyclone coming, Em,\" he called to his wife; \"I'll go look\nafter the stock.\" Then he ran toward the sheds where the cows and\nhorses were kept.\n\nAunt Em dropped her work and came to the door. One glance told her of\nthe danger close at hand.\n\n\"Quick, Dorothy!\"\n\n### Summary:\n\n", "answer": "Meet Dorothy, an all-American gal who lives with her Uncle Henry and Aunt Em in Middle-of-Nowhere, Kansas. They live on a rickety farm that sounds like it would get terrible reviews on Airbnb. Farm tour: it won't take long, because there's only one room. Well, two, if you count the cyclone cellar, which we have a feeling is about to be put to good use. Prairie tour: literally everything is gray, including the land, the farm, Aunt Em, and Uncle Henry. Kansas sounds like a total bummer so far. Oh, here's Toto! He is Dorothy's dog, and he's clearly the life of this party. His interests include playing and more playing. Uncle Henry looks up at the sky and realizes a big storm's a-coming. The cyclone comes on fast. Everyone's flying down into the cyclone cellar except for Toto, the idiot, who's under the bed. Before Dorothy and Toto make it into the cellar, the house itself gets swept up into the cyclone. Looks like Dorothy's about to go on an unexpected vacation. The house is in the center of the cyclone. Dorothy's pretty chill about it, all things considered, but Toto is freaking out--so much so that he almost flies out of the trapdoor. Dorothy saves him, though. They've been in the cyclone so long now that Dorothy decides to go to bed. Night, Dorothy."}

How the Balloon was Launched.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nFor three days Dorothy heard nothing from Oz. These were sad days\nfor the little girl, although her friends were all quite happy and\ncontented. The Scarecrow told them there were wonderful thoughts in\nhis head; but he would not say what they were because he knew no one\ncould understand them but himself. When the Tin Woodman walked about\nhe felt his heart rattling around in his breast; and he told Dorothy\nhe had discovered it to be a kinder and more tender heart than the\none he had owned when he was made of flesh. The Lion declared he was\nafraid of nothing on earth, and would gladly face an army of men or a\ndozen of the fierce Kalidahs.\n\nThus each of the little party was satisfied except Dorothy, who\nlonged more than ever to get back to Kansas.\n\nOn the fourth day, to her great joy, Oz sent for her, and when she\nentered the Throne Room he said, pleasantly:\n\n\"Sit down, my dear; I think I have found the way to get you out of\nthis country.\"\n\n\"And back to Kansas?\" she asked, eagerly.\n\n\"Well, I'm not sure about Kansas,\" said Oz; \"for I haven't the\nfaintest notion which way it lies. But the first thing to do is to\ncross the desert, and then it should be easy to find your way home.\"\n\n\"How can I cross the desert?\" she enquired.\n\n\"Well, I'll tell you what I think,\" said the little man. \"You see,\nwhen I came to this country it was in a balloon. You also came\nthrough the air, being carried by a cyclone. So I believe the best\nway to get across the desert will be through the air. Now, it is\nquite beyond my powers to make a cyclone; but I've been thinking the\nmatter over, and I believe I can make a balloon.\"\n\n\"How?\" asked Dorothy.\n\n\"A balloon,\" said Oz, \"is made of silk, which is coated with glue to\nkeep the gas in it. I have plenty of silk in the Palace, so it will\nbe no trouble for us to make the balloon. But in all this country\nthere is no gas to fill the balloon with, to make it float.\"\n\n\"If it won't float,\" remarked Dorothy, \"it will be of no use to us.\"\n\n\"True,\" answered Oz. \"But there is another way to make it float,\nwhich is to fill it with hot air. Hot air isn't as good as gas, for\nif the air should get cold the balloon would come down in the desert,\nand we should be lost.\"\n\n\"We!\" exclaimed the girl; \"are you going with me?\"\n\n\"Yes, of course,\" replied Oz. \"I am tired of being such a humbug. If I\nshould go out of this Palace my people would soon discover I am not a\nWizard, and then they would be vexed with me for having deceived them.\nSo I have to stay shut up in these rooms all day, and it gets tiresome.\nI'd much rather go back to Kansas with you and be in a circus again.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"I shall be glad to have your company,\" said Dorothy.\n\n\"Thank you,\" he answered. \"Now, if you will help me sew the silk\ntogether, we will begin to work on our balloon.\"\n\nSo Dorothy took a needle and thread, and as fast as Oz cut the strips\nof silk into proper shape the girl sewed them neatly together. First\nthere was a strip of light green silk, then a strip of dark green and\nthen a strip of emerald green; for Oz had a fancy to make the balloon\nin different shades of the color about them. It took three days to\nsew all the strips together, but when it was finished they had a big\nbag of green silk more than twenty feet long.\n\nThen Oz painted it on the inside with a coat of thin glue, to make it\nair-tight, after which he announced that the balloon was\n\n### Summary:\n\n", "answer": "Dorothy doesn't hear anything for three days and she's getting discouraged.

Dorothy's okay with the plan, so they set about making the balloon. Oz tells his kingdom that he's going to visit his brother, who lives in the clouds. They think that sounds legit. Also, he leaves the Scarecrow in charge. The balloon is about to leave, but Dorothy can't find Toto. He's off chasing a kitten in the crowd. Dorothy finds him and heads back, but she doesn't make it. The balloon takes off without her! The people are devastated because their leader is gone, and Dorothy is devastated because she missed her ride. Basically, everyone's bummed."}

The Rescue\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe Cowardly Lion was much pleased to hear that the Wicked Witch\nhad been melted by a bucket of water, and Dorothy at once unlocked\nthe gate of his prison and set him free. They went in together to\nthe castle, where Dorothy's first act was to call all the Winkies\ntogether and tell them that they were no longer slaves.\n\nThere was great rejoicing among the yellow Winkies, for they had\nbeen made to work hard during many years for the Wicked Witch, who\nhad always treated them with great cruelty. They kept this day as\na holiday, then and ever after, and spent the time in feasting and\ndancing.\n\n\"If our friends, the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman, were only with\nus,\" said the Lion, \"I should be quite happy.\"\n\n\"Don't you suppose we could rescue them?\" asked the girl, anxiously.\n\n\"We can try,\" answered the Lion.\n\nSo they called the yellow Winkies and asked them if they would help\nto rescue their friends, and the Winkies said that they would be\ndelighted to do all in their power for Dorothy, who had set them free\nfrom bondage. So she chose a number of the Winkies who looked as if\nthey knew the most, and they all started away. They travelled that\nday and part of the next until they came to the rocky plain where the\nTin Woodman lay, all battered and bent. His axe was near him, but the\nblade was rusted and the handle broken off short.\n\nThe Winkies lifted him tenderly in their arms, and carried him back\nto the yellow castle again, Dorothy shedding a few tears by the way\nat the sad plight of her old friend, and the Lion looking sober and\nsorry. When they reached the castle Dorothy said to the Winkies,\n\n\"Are any of your people tinsmiths?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; some of us are very good tinsmiths,\" they told her.\n\n\"Then bring them to me,\" she said. And when the tinsmiths came,\nbringing with them all their tools in baskets, she enquired,\n\n[Illustration: \"_The Tinsmiths worked for three days and four\nnights._\"]\n\n\"Can you straighten out those dents in the Tin Woodman, and bend\nhim back into shape again, and solder him together where he is\nbroken?\"\n\nThe tinsmiths looked the Woodman over carefully and then answered\nthat they thought they could mend him so he would be as good as ever.\nSo they set to work in one of the big yellow rooms of the castle and\nworked for three days and four nights, hammering and twisting and\nbending and soldering and polishing and pounding at the legs and body\nand head of the Tin Woodman, until at last he was straightened out into\nhis old form, and his joints worked as well as ever. To be sure, there\nwere several patches on him, but the tinsmiths did a good job, and as\nthe Woodman was not a vain man he did not mind the patches at all.\n\nWhen, at last, he walked into Dorothy's room and thanked her for\nrescuing him, he was so pleased that he wept tears of joy, and\nDorothy had to wipe every tear carefully from his face with her\napron, so his joints would not be rusted. At the same time her own\ntears fell thick and fast at the joy of meeting her old friend again,\nand these tears did not need to be wiped away. As for the Lion, he\nwiped his eyes so often with the tip of his tail that it became quite\nwet, and he was obliged to go out into the court-yard and hold it in\nthe sun till it dried.\n\n\"If we only had the Scarecrow with us again,\" said the Tin Woodman,\nwhen Dorothy had finished telling him everything that had happened,\n\"I should be quite happy.\"\n\n\"We must try to find him,\" said the girl.\n\nSo she called the W\n\n### Summary:\n\n", "answer": "The Lion is psyched to hear the witch is dead.

Dorothy wonders if they can be rescued. They ask the Winkies to help. The Winkies are more than happy to oblige because they're so grateful to Dorothy. A special team of Winkies heads into the forest to retrieve the Tin Woodman. He's pretty banged up. Luckily the Winkies have a whole team of tinsmiths that sets to work to restore the tin man. Soon enough he's good as new. The tin man is so happy to have come back to life that he cries. Dorothy wipes away his tears so he won't rust.

A road near the SHEPHERD'S cottage\n\nEnter AUTOLYCUS, singing\n\n      When daffodils begin to peer,\n        With heigh! the doxy over the dale,\n      Why, then comes in the sweet o' the year,\n        For the red blood reigns in the winter's pale.\n\n      The white sheet bleaching on the hedge,\n        With heigh! the sweet birds, O, how they sing!\n      Doth set my pugging tooth on edge,\n        For a quart of ale is a dish for a king.\n\n      The lark, that tirra-lirra chants,\n        With heigh! with heigh! the thrush and the jay,\n      Are summer songs for me and my aunts,\n        While we lie tumbling in the hay.\n\n    I have serv'd Prince Florizel, and in my time wore\nthree-pile;\n    but now I am out of service.\n\n      But shall I go mourn for that, my dear?\n        The pale moon shines by night;\n      And when I wander here and there,\n        I then do most go right.\n\n      If tinkers may have leave to live,\n        And bear the sow-skin budget,\n      Then my account I well may give\n        And in the stocks avouch it.\n\n    My traffic is sheets; when the kite builds, look to lesser\nlinen.\n    My father nam'd me Autolycus; who, being, I as am, litter'd\nunder\n    Mercury, was likewise a snapper-up of unconsidered trifles.\nWith\n    die and drab I purchas'd this caparison; and my revenue is\nthe\n    silly-cheat. Gallows and knock are too powerful on the\nhighway;\n    beating and hanging are terrors to me; for the life to come,\nI\n    sleep out the thought of it. A prize! a prize!\n\n                            Enter CLOWN\n\n  CLOWN. Let me see: every 'leven wether tods; every tod yields\npound\n    and odd shilling; fifteen hundred shorn, what comes the wool\nto?\n  AUTOLYCUS.  [Aside]  If the springe hold, the cock's mine.\n  CLOWN. I cannot do 't without counters. Let me see: what am I\nto\n    buy for our sheep-shearing feast? Three pound of sugar, five\n    pound of currants, rice- what will this sister of mine do\nwith\n    rice? But my father hath made her mistress of the feast, and\nshe\n    lays it on. She hath made me four and twenty nosegays for the\n    shearers- three-man song-men all, and very good ones; but\nthey\n    are most of them means and bases; but one Puritan amongst\nthem,\n    and he sings psalms to hornpipes. I must have saffron to\ncolour\n    the warden pies; mace; dates- none, that's out of my note;\n    nutmegs, seven; race or two of ginger, but that I may beg;\nfour\n    pound of prunes, and as many of raisins o' th' sun.\n  AUTOLYCUS.  [Grovelling on the ground]  O that ever I was born!\n  CLOWN. I' th' name of me!\n  AUTOLYCUS. O, help me, help me! Pluck but off these rags; and\nthen,\n    death, death!\n  CLOWN. Alack, poor soul! thou hast need of more rags to lay on\n    thee, rather than have these off.\n  AUTOLYCUS. O sir, the loathsomeness of them offend me more than\nthe\n    stripes I have received, which are mighty ones and millions.\n  CLOWN. Alas, poor man! a million of beating may come to a great\n    matter.\n  AUTOLYCUS.

He interrupts his song to announce that he was once a well-dressed servant to Prince Florizel, but he is now out of service. Now, he collects odds and ends. There are hints that he steals them. With the help of harlots and dice, he has acquired his current attire. His favorite source of income, he says, \"is the silly cheat,\" because he fears punishments for committing truly violent crimes. His spirits soar as he spots a prize! -- who is none other than the kind-hearted clown. The shepherd's son is struggling with calculations on the income from the wool of 1,500 sheep and with his responsibility to buy supplies for the sheep-shearing feast. All the details of this transaction arc mixed with thoughts about his family, particularly about his \"sister,\" who is to be the \"queen\" of the feast. Obviously, they are preparing to entertain a large number of people. Autolycus goes to work. He grovels on the ground and begs the shocked clown to tear the rags off his back. But the clown protests that Autolycus needs more on his back, not less. Autolycus insists that the loathsome rags offend him more than his scars from many beatings. He claims that he was beaten and robbed by a footman who forced him to put on these detestable garments. The gentle, gullible clown assists Autolycus to his feet. However, as Autolycus winces to avoid aggravating his non-existent wounds, he picks the pocket of the clown. When the clown offers him money, Autolycus must, of course, refuse; so, he holds off the clown's charity by insisting that a nearby kinsman will aid him. Pressed for a description of his robber, Autolycus describes himself. The clown protests against this thief who \"haunts wakes, fairs, and bear-baitings.\" Declaring himself well enough to walk to his relative's home, Autolycus sends the clown on to complete his errands. As soon as the good man exits, the rogue flaunts the stolen purse, mocks the clown's attempt to buy supplies without money, and declares that he will also cheat the guests at the sheep-shearing festival. Autolycus leaves as he entered, singing."}
