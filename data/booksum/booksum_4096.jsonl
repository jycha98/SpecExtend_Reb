The Last Supper.\n\n\nThe superintendent had no doubt received advice of the approaching\ndeparture, for he was giving a farewell dinner to his friends. From\nthe bottom to the top of the house, the hurry of the servants bearing\ndishes, and the diligence of the _registres_, denoted an approaching\nchange in offices and kitchen. D'Artagnan, with his order in his hand,\npresented himself at the offices, when he was told it was too late\nto pay cash, the chest was closed. He only replied: \"On the king's\nservice.\"\n\nThe clerk, a little put out by the serious air of the captain, replied,\nthat \"that was a very respectable reason, but that the customs of the\nhouse were respectable likewise; and that, in consequence, he begged the\nbearer to call again next day.\" D'Artagnan asked if he could not see\nM. Fouquet. The clerk replied that M. le surintendant did not interfere\nwith such details, and rudely closed the outer door in the captain's\nface. But the latter had foreseen this stroke, and placed his boot\nbetween the door and the door-case, so that the lock did not catch, and\nthe clerk was still nose to nose with his interlocutor. This made him\nchange his tone, and say, with terrified politeness, \"If monsieur wishes\nto speak to M. le surintendant, he must go to the ante-chambers; these\nare the offices, where monseigneur never comes.\"\n\n\"Oh! very well! Where are they?\" replied D'Artagnan.\n\n\"On the other side of the court,\" said the clerk, delighted to be free.\nD'Artagnan crossed the court, and fell in with a crowd of servants.\n\n\"Monseigneur sees nobody at this hour,\" he was answered by a fellow\ncarrying a vermeil dish, in which were three pheasants and twelve\nquails.\n\n\"Tell him,\" said the captain, laying hold of the servant by the end\nof his dish, \"that I am M. d'Artagnan, captain of his majesty's\nmusketeers.\"\n\nThe fellow uttered a cry of surprise, and disappeared; D'Artagnan\nfollowing him slowly. He arrived just in time to meet M. Pelisson in\nthe ante-chamber: the latter, a little pale, came hastily out of the\ndining-room to learn what was the matter. D'Artagnan smiled.\n\n\"There is nothing unpleasant, Monsieur Pelisson; only a little order to\nreceive the money for.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Fouquet's friend, breathing more freely; and he took the\ncaptain by the hand, and, dragging him behind him, led him into the\ndining-room, where a number of friends surrounded the surintendant,\nplaced in the center, and buried in the cushions of a _fauteuil_. There\nwere assembled all the Epicureans who so lately at Vaux had done the\nhonors of the mansion of wit and money in aid of M. Fouquet. Joyous\nfriends, for the most part faithful, they had not fled their protector\nat the approach of the storm, and, in spite of the threatening heavens,\nin spite of the trembling earth, they remained there, smiling, cheerful,\nas devoted in misfortune as they had been in prosperity. On the left\nof the surintendant sat Madame de Belliere; on his right was Madame\nFouquet; as if braving the laws of the world, and putting all vulgar\nreasons of propriety to silence, the two protecting angels of this\nman united to offer, at the moment of the crisis, the support of\ntheir twined arms. Madame de Belliere was pale, trembling, and full of\nrespectful attentions for madame la surintendante, who, with one hand on\nher husband's, was looking anxiously towards the door by which Pelisson\nhad gone out to bring D'Artagnan. The captain entered at first full\nof courtesy, and afterwards of admiration, when, with his infallible\nglance, he had divined as well as taken in the expression of every face.\nFouquet raised himself up in his chair.\n\n\"Pardon me, Monsieur d'Artagnan,\" said he, \"if I did not myself receive\nyou when coming in the king's name.\" And he pronounced the last words\nwith a sort of melancholy firmness, which filled the hearts of all his\nfriends with terror.\n\n\"Monseigneur,\" replied D'Artagnan, \"I only come to you in the king's\nname to demand payment of an order for two hundred pistoles.\"\n\nThe clouds passed from every brow but that of Fouquet, which still\nremained overcast.\n\n\"Ah! then,\" said he, \"perhaps you also are setting out for Nantes?\"\n\n\"I do not know whither I am setting out, monseigneur.\"\n\n\"But,\" said Madame Fouquet, recovered from her fright, \"you are not\ngoing so soon, monsieur le capitaine, as not to do us the honor to take\na seat with us?\"\n\n\"Madame, I should esteem that a great honor done me, but I am so\npressed for time, that, you see, I have been obliged to permit myself to\ninterrupt your repast to procure payment of my note.\"\n\n\"The reply to which shall be gold,\" said Fouquet, making a sign to his\nintendant, who went out with the order D'Artagnan handed him.\n\n\"Oh!\" said the latter, \"I was not uneasy about the payment; the house is\ngood.\"\n\nA painful smile passed over the pale features of Fouquet.\n\n\"Are you in pain?\" asked Madame de Belliere.\n\n\"Do you feel your attack coming on?\" asked Madame Fouquet.\n\n\"Neither, thank you both,\" said Fouquet.\n\n\"Your attack?\" said D'Artagnan, in his turn; \"are you unwell,\nmonseigneur?\"\n\n\"I have a tertian fever, which seized me after the _fete_ at Vaux.\"\n\n\"Caught cold in the grottos, at night, perhaps?\"\n\n\"No, no; nothing but agitation, that was all.\"\n\n\"The too much heart you displayed in your reception of the king,\"\nsaid La Fontaine, quietly, without suspicion that he was uttering a\nsacrilege.\n\n\"We cannot devote too much heart to the reception of our king,\" said\nFouquet, mildly, to his poet.\n\n\"Monsieur meant to say the too great ardor,\" interrupted D'Artagnan,\nwith perfect frankness and much amenity. \"The fact is, monseigneur, that\nhospitality was never practiced as at Vaux.\"\n\nMadame Fouquet permitted her countenance to show clearly that if Fouquet\nhad conducted himself well towards the king, the king had hardly done\nthe like to the minister. But D'Artagnan knew the terrible secret. He\nalone with Fouquet knew it; those two men had not, the one the courage\nto complain, the other the right to accuse. The captain, to whom the\ntwo hundred pistoles were brought, was about to take his leave, when\nFouquet, rising, took a glass of wine, and ordered one to be given to\nD'Artagnan.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said he, \"to the health of the king, _whatever may happen_.\"\n\n\"And to your health, monseigneur, _whatever may happen_,\" said\nD'Artagnan.\n\nHe bowed, with these words of evil omen, to all the company, who rose as\nsoon as they heard the sound of his spurs and boots at the bottom of the\nstairs.\n\n\"I, for a moment, thought it was I and not my money he wanted,\" said\nFouquet, endeavoring to laugh.\n\n\"You!\" cried his friends; \"and what for, in the name of Heaven!\"\n\n\"Oh! do not deceive yourselves, my dear brothers in Epicurus,\" said the\nsuperintendent; \"I do not wish to make a comparison between the most\nhumble sinner on the earth, and the God we adore, but remember, he gave\none day to his friends a repast which is called the Last Supper, and\nwhich was nothing but a farewell dinner, like that which we are making\nat this moment.\"\n\nA painful cry of denial arose from all parts of the table. \"Shut the\ndoors,\" said Fouquet, and the servants disappeared. \"My friends,\"\ncontinued Fouquet, lowering his voice, \"what was I formerly? What am\nI now? Consult among yourselves and reply. A man like me sinks when\nhe does not continue to rise. What shall we say, then, when he really\nsinks? I have no more money, no more credit; I have no longer anything\nbut powerful enemies, and powerless friends.\"\n\n\"Quick!\" cried Pelisson. \"Since you explain yourself with such\nfrankness, it is our duty to be frank, likewise. Yes, you are\nruined--yes, you are hastening to your ruin--stop. And, in the first\nplace, what money have we left?\"\n\n\"Seven hundred thousand livres,\" said the intendant.\n\n\"Bread,\" murmured Madame Fouquet.\n\n\"Relays,\" said Pelisson, \"relays, and fly!\"\n\n\"Whither?\"\n\n\"To Switzerland--to Savoy--but fly!\"\n\n\"If monseigneur flies,\" said Madame Belliere, \"it will be said that he\nwas guilty--was afraid.\"\n\n\"More than that, it will be said that I have carried away twenty\nmillions with me.\"\n\n\"We will draw up memoirs to justify you,\" said La Fontaine. \"Fly!\"\n\n\"I will remain,\" said Fouquet. \"And, besides, does not everything serve\nme?\"\n\n\"You have Belle-Isle,\" cried the Abbe Fouquet.\n\n\"And I am naturally going there, when going to Nantes,\" replied the\nsuperintendent. \"Patience, then, patience!\"\n\n\"Before arriving at Nantes, what a distance!\" said Madame Fouquet.\n\n\"Yes, I know that well,\" replied Fouquet. \"But what is to be done there?\nThe king summons me to the States. I know well it is for the purpose of\nruining me; but to refuse to go would be to evince uneasiness.\"\n\n\"Well, I have discovered the means of reconciling everything,\" cried\nPelisson. \"You are going to set out for Nantes.\"\n\nFouquet looked at him with an air of surprise.\n\n\"But with friends; but in your own carriage as far as Orleans; in your\nown barge as far as Nantes; always ready to defend yourself, if you are\nattacked; to escape, if you are threatened. In fact, you will carry your\nmoney against all chances; and, whilst flying, you will only have obeyed\nthe king; then, reaching the sea, when you like, you will embark for\nBelle-Isle, and from Belle-Isle you will shoot out wherever it may\nplease you, like the eagle that leaps into space when it has been driven\nfrom its eyrie.\"\n\nA general assent followed Pelisson's words. \"Yes, do so,\" said Madame\nFouquet to her husband.\n\n\"Do so,\" said Madame de Belliere.\n\n\"Do it! do it!\" cried all his friends.\n\n\"I will do so,\" replied Fouquet.\n\n\"This very evening?\"\n\n\"In an hour?\"\n\n\"Instantly.\"\n\n\"With seven hundred thousand livres you can lay the foundation of\nanother fortune,\" said the Abbe Fouquet.\n\n\"What is there to prevent our arming corsairs at Belle-Isle?\"\n\n\"And, if necessary, we will go and discover a new world,\" added La\nFontaine, intoxicated with fresh projects and enthusiasm.\n\nA knock at the door interrupted this concert of joy and hope. \"A courier\nfrom the king,\" said the master of the ceremonies.\n\nA profound silence immediately ensued, as if the message brought by this\ncourier was nothing but a reply to all the projects given birth to a\nmoment before. Every one waited to see what the master would do. His\nbrow was streaming with perspiration, and he was really suffering from\nhis fever at that instant. He passed into his cabinet, to receive the\nking's message. There prevailed, as we have said, such a silence in the\nchambers, and throughout the attendance, that from the dining-room could\nbe heard the voice of Fouquet, saying, \"That is well, monsieur.\" This\nvoice was, however, broken by fatigue, and trembled with emotion. An\ninstant after, Fouquet called Gourville, who crossed the gallery amidst\nthe universal expectation. At length, he himself re-appeared among his\nguests; but it was no longer the same pale, spiritless countenance they\nhad beheld when he left them; from pale he had become livid; and from\nspiritless, annihilated. A breathing, living specter, he advanced with\nhis arms stretched out, his mouth parched, like a shade that comes to\nsalute the friends of former days. On seeing him thus, every one cried\nout, and every one rushed towards Fouquet. The latter, looking at\nPelisson, leaned upon his wife, and pressed the icy hand of the Marquise\nde Belliere.\n\n\"Well,\" said he, in a voice which had nothing human in it.\n\n\"What has happened, my God!\" said some one to him.\n\nFouquet opened his right hand, which was clenched, but glistening\nwith perspiration, and displayed a paper, upon which Pelisson cast a\nterrified glance. He read the following lines, written by the king's\nhand:\n\n\"'DEAR AND WELL-BELOVED MONSIEUR FOUQUET,--Give us, upon that which you\nhave left of ours, the sum of seven hundred thousand livres, of which we\nstand in need to prepare for our departure.\n\n\"'And, as we know your health is not good, we pray God to restore you,\nand to have you in His holy keeping. \"'LOUIS.\n\n\"'The present letter is to serve as a receipt.'\"\n\nA murmur of terror circulated through the apartment.\n\n\"Well,\" cried Pelisson, in his turn, \"you have received that letter?\"\n\n\"Received it, yes!\"\n\n\"What will you do, then?\"\n\n\"Nothing, since I have received it.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"If I have received it, Pelisson, I have paid it,\" said the\nsurintendant, with a simplicity that went to the heart of all present.\n\n\"You have paid it!\" cried Madame Fouquet. \"Then we are ruined!\"\n\n\"Come, no useless words,\" interrupted Pelisson. \"Next to money, life.\nMonseigneur, to horse! to horse!\"\n\n\"What, leave us!\" at once cried both the women, wild with grief.\n\n\"Eh! monseigneur, in saving yourself, you save us all. To horse!\"\n\n\"But he cannot hold himself on. Look at him.\"\n\n\"Oh! if he takes time to reflect--\" said the intrepid Pelisson.\n\n\"He is right,\" murmured Fouquet.\n\n\"Monseigneur! Monseigneur!\" cried Gourville, rushing up the stairs, four\nsteps at once. \"Monseigneur!\"\n\n\"Well! what?\"\n\n\"I escorted, as you desired, the king's courier with the money.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well! when I arrived at the Palais Royal, I saw--\"\n\n\"Take breath, my poor friend, take breath; you are suffocating.\"\n\n\"What did you see?\" cried the impatient friends.\n\n\"I saw the musketeers mounting on horseback,\" said Gourville.\n\n\"There, then!\" cried every voice at once; \"there, then! is there an\ninstant to be lost?\"\n\nMadame Fouquet rushed downstairs, calling for her horses; Madame de\nBelliere flew after her, catching her in her arms, and saying: \"Madame,\nin the name of his safety, do not betray anything, do not manifest\nalarm.\"\n\nPelisson ran to have the horses put to the carriages. And, in the\nmeantime, Gourville gathered in his hat all that the weeping friends\nwere able to throw into it of gold and silver--the last offering, the\npious alms made to misery by poverty. The surintendant, dragged along by\nsome, carried by others, was shut up in his carriage. Gourville took the\nreins, and mounted the box. Pelisson supported Madame Fouquet, who had\nfainted. Madame de Belliere had more strength, and was well paid for\nit; she received Fouquet's last kiss. Pelisson easily explained this\nprecipitate departure by saying that an order from the king had summoned\nthe minister to Nantes.\n\n\n### Summary:\n\n", "answer": "Fouquet is giving a farewell supper. D'Artagnan has some difficulty being received, but eventually he gains entrance to the dining room, where all the Epicureans are assembled with Fouquet. They have remained loyal to their patron. Everyone is scared to see D'Artagnan, convinced he has come to arrest Fouquet. D'Artagnan puts them at ease, saying he is there only to collect money. It's clear that Fouquet is really ill and his friends blame the King. D'Artagnan receives his money and leaves. After his departure, Fouquet confesses he thought D'Artagnan was there to arrest him. His friends protest and Fouquet compares their current meal to Jesus' last supper. Fouquet is quite sad. He points out that he no longer has very much - only powerless friends and powerful enemies. Pelisson tells Fouquet to think clearly. How much money does he have left? Fouquet has only seven hundred thousand pounds. Pelisson suggests that he flee to someplace like Switzerland. Fouquet decides to stay. He is consoled by the thought of Belle-Isle. He must first go to Nantes with the King, however, and his friends suggest that he depart immediately and with all haste. He can justify his trip to Nantes with the King's impending trip to the city. Everyone is happy with this plan when a courier knocks on the door with a note saying that the King has taken the seven hundred thousand pounds to prepare for his departure to Nantes. Fouquet is ruined. His friends toss various valuable jewelry in a hat so he can have some type of funds."}

The Fellow of Delicacy\n\n\nMr. Stryver having made up his mind to that magnanimous bestowal of good\nfortune on the Doctor's daughter, resolved to make her happiness known\nto her before he left town for the Long Vacation. After some mental\ndebating of the point, he came to the conclusion that it would be as\nwell to get all the preliminaries done with, and they could then arrange\nat their leisure whether he should give her his hand a week or two\nbefore Michaelmas Term, or in the little Christmas vacation between it\nand Hilary.\n\nAs to the strength of his case, he had not a doubt about it, but clearly\nsaw his way to the verdict. Argued with the jury on substantial worldly\ngrounds--the only grounds ever worth taking into account--it was a\nplain case, and had not a weak spot in it. He called himself for the\nplaintiff, there was no getting over his evidence, the counsel for\nthe defendant threw up his brief, and the jury did not even turn to\nconsider. After trying it, Stryver, C. J., was satisfied that no plainer\ncase could be.\n\nAccordingly, Mr. Stryver inaugurated the Long Vacation with a formal\nproposal to take Miss Manette to Vauxhall Gardens; that failing, to\nRanelagh; that unaccountably failing too, it behoved him to present\nhimself in Soho, and there declare his noble mind.\n\nTowards Soho, therefore, Mr. Stryver shouldered his way from the Temple,\nwhile the bloom of the Long Vacation's infancy was still upon it.\nAnybody who had seen him projecting himself into Soho while he was yet\non Saint Dunstan's side of Temple Bar, bursting in his full-blown way\nalong the pavement, to the jostlement of all weaker people, might have\nseen how safe and strong he was.\n\nHis way taking him past Tellson's, and he both banking at Tellson's and\nknowing Mr. Lorry as the intimate friend of the Manettes, it entered Mr.\nStryver's mind to enter the bank, and reveal to Mr. Lorry the brightness\nof the Soho horizon. So, he pushed open the door with the weak rattle\nin its throat, stumbled down the two steps, got past the two ancient\ncashiers, and shouldered himself into the musty back closet where Mr.\nLorry sat at great books ruled for figures, with perpendicular iron\nbars to his window as if that were ruled for figures too, and everything\nunder the clouds were a sum.\n\n\"Halloa!\" said Mr. Stryver. \"How do you do? I hope you are well!\"\n\nIt was Stryver's grand peculiarity that he always seemed too big for any\nplace, or space. He was so much too big for Tellson's, that old clerks\nin distant corners looked up with looks of remonstrance, as though he\nsqueezed them against the wall. The House itself, magnificently reading\nthe paper quite in the far-off perspective, lowered displeased, as if\nthe Stryver head had been butted into its responsible waistcoat.\n\nThe discreet Mr. Lorry said, in a sample tone of the voice he would\nrecommend under the circumstances, \"How do you do, Mr. Stryver? How do\nyou do, sir?\" and shook hands. There was a peculiarity in his manner\nof shaking hands, always to be seen in any clerk at Tellson's who shook\nhands with a customer when the House pervaded the air. He shook in a\nself-abnegating way, as one who shook for Tellson and Co.\n\n\"Can I do anything for you, Mr. Stryver?\" asked Mr. Lorry, in his\nbusiness character.\n\n\"Why, no, thank you; this is a private visit to yourself, Mr. Lorry; I\nhave come for a private word.\"\n\n\"Oh indeed!\" said Mr. Lorry, bending down his ear, while his eye strayed\nto the House afar off.\n\n\"I am going,\" said Mr. Stryver, leaning his arms confidentially on the\ndesk: whereupon, although it was a large double one, there appeared to\nbe not half desk enough for him: \"I am going to make an offer of myself\nin marriage to your agreeable little friend, Miss Manette, Mr. Lorry.\"\n\n\"Oh dear me!\" cried Mr. Lorry, rubbing his chin, and looking at his\nvisitor dubiously.\n\n\"Oh dear me, sir?\" repeated Stryver, drawing back. \"Oh dear you, sir?\nWhat may your meaning be, Mr. Lorry?\"\n\n\"My meaning,\" answered the man of business, \"is, of course, friendly and\nappreciative, and that it does you the greatest credit, and--in short,\nmy meaning is everything you could desire. But--really, you know, Mr.\nStryver--\" Mr. Lorry paused, and shook his head at him in the oddest\nmanner, as if he were compelled against his will to add, internally,\n\"you know there really is so much too much of you!\"\n\n\"Well!\" said Stryver, slapping the desk with his contentious hand,\nopening his eyes wider, and taking a long breath, \"if I understand you,\nMr. Lorry, I'll be hanged!\"\n\nMr. Lorry adjusted his little wig at both ears as a means towards that\nend, and bit the feather of a pen.\n\n\"D--n it all, sir!\" said Stryver, staring at him, \"am I not eligible?\"\n\n\"Oh dear yes! Yes. Oh yes, you're eligible!\" said Mr. Lorry. \"If you say\neligible, you are eligible.\"\n\n\"Am I not prosperous?\" asked Stryver.\n\n\"Oh! if you come to prosperous, you are prosperous,\" said Mr. Lorry.\n\n\"And advancing?\"\n\n\"If you come to advancing you know,\" said Mr. Lorry, delighted to be\nable to make another admission, \"nobody can doubt that.\"\n\n\"Then what on earth is your meaning, Mr. Lorry?\" demanded Stryver,\nperceptibly crestfallen.\n\n\"Well! I--Were you going there now?\" asked Mr. Lorry.\n\n\"Straight!\" said Stryver, with a plump of his fist on the desk.\n\n\"Then I think I wouldn't, if I was you.\"\n\n\"Why?\" said Stryver. \"Now, I'll put you in a corner,\" forensically\nshaking a forefinger at him. \"You are a man of business and bound to\nhave a reason. State your reason. Why wouldn't you go?\"\n\n\"Because,\" said Mr. Lorry, \"I wouldn't go on such an object without\nhaving some cause to believe that I should succeed.\"\n\n\"D--n _me_!\" cried Stryver, \"but this beats everything.\"\n\nMr. Lorry glanced at the distant House, and glanced at the angry\nStryver.\n\n\"Here's a man of business--a man of years--a man of experience--_in_\na Bank,\" said Stryver; \"and having summed up three leading reasons for\ncomplete success, he says there's no reason at all! Says it with his\nhead on!\" Mr. Stryver remarked upon the peculiarity as if it would have\nbeen infinitely less remarkable if he had said it with his head off.\n\n\"When I speak of success, I speak of success with the young lady; and\nwhen I speak of causes and reasons to make success probable, I speak of\ncauses and reasons that will tell as such with the young lady. The young\nlady, my good sir,\" said Mr. Lorry, mildly tapping the Stryver arm, \"the\nyoung lady. The young lady goes before all.\"\n\n\"Then you mean to tell me, Mr. Lorry,\" said Stryver, squaring his\nelbows, \"that it is your deliberate opinion that the young lady at\npresent in question is a mincing Fool?\"\n\n\"Not exactly so. I mean to tell you, Mr. Stryver,\" said Mr. Lorry,\nreddening, \"that I will hear no disrespectful word of that young lady\nfrom any lips; and that if I knew any man--which I hope I do not--whose\ntaste was so coarse, and whose temper was so overbearing, that he could\nnot restrain himself from speaking disrespectfully of that young lady at\nthis desk, not even Tellson's should prevent my giving him a piece of my\nmind.\"\n\nThe necessity of being angry in a suppressed tone had put Mr. Stryver's\nblood-vessels into a dangerous state when it was his turn to be angry;\nMr. Lorry's veins, methodical as their courses could usually be, were in\nno better state now it was his turn.\n\n\"That is what I mean to tell you, sir,\" said Mr. Lorry. \"Pray let there\nbe no mistake about it.\"\n\nMr. Stryver sucked the end of a ruler for a little while, and then stood\nhitting a tune out of his teeth with it, which probably gave him the\ntoothache. He broke the awkward silence by saying:\n\n\"This is something new to me, Mr. Lorry. You deliberately advise me not\nto go up to Soho and offer myself--_my_self, Stryver of the King's Bench\nbar?\"\n\n\"Do you ask me for my advice, Mr. Stryver?\"\n\n\"Yes, I do.\"\n\n\"Very good. Then I give it, and you have repeated it correctly.\"\n\n\"And all I can say of it is,\" laughed Stryver with a vexed laugh, \"that\nthis--ha, ha!--beats everything past, present, and to come.\"\n\n\"Now understand me,\" pursued Mr. Lorry. \"As a man of business, I am\nnot justified in saying anything about this matter, for, as a man of\nbusiness, I know nothing of it. But, as an old fellow, who has carried\nMiss Manette in his arms, who is the trusted friend of Miss Manette and\nof her father too, and who has a great affection for them both, I have\nspoken. The confidence is not of my seeking, recollect. Now, you think I\nmay not be right?\"\n\n\"Not I!\" said Stryver, whistling. \"I can't undertake to find third\nparties in common sense; I can only find it for myself. I suppose sense\nin certain quarters; you suppose mincing bread-and-butter nonsense. It's\nnew to me, but you are right, I dare say.\"\n\n\"What I suppose, Mr. Stryver, I claim to characterise for myself--And\nunderstand me, sir,\" said Mr. Lorry, quickly flushing again, \"I\nwill not--not even at Tellson's--have it characterised for me by any\ngentleman breathing.\"\n\n\"There! I beg your pardon!\" said Stryver.\n\n\"Granted. Thank you. Well, Mr. Stryver, I was about to say:--it might be\npainful to you to find yourself mistaken, it might be painful to Doctor\nManette to have the task of being explicit with you, it might be very\npainful to Miss Manette to have the task of being explicit with you. You\nknow the terms upon which I have the honour and happiness to stand with\nthe family. If you please, committing you in no way, representing you\nin no way, I will undertake to correct my advice by the exercise of a\nlittle new observation and judgment expressly brought to bear upon\nit. If you should then be dissatisfied with it, you can but test its\nsoundness for yourself; if, on the other hand, you should be satisfied\nwith it, and it should be what it now is, it may spare all sides what is\nbest spared. What do you say?\"\n\n\"How long would you keep me in town?\"\n\n\"Oh! It is only a question of a few hours. I could go to Soho in the\nevening, and come to your chambers afterwards.\"\n\n\"Then I say yes,\" said Stryver: \"I won't go up there now, I am not so\nhot upon it as that comes to; I say yes, and I shall expect you to look\nin to-night. Good morning.\"\n\nThen Mr. Stryver turned and burst out of the Bank, causing such a\nconcussion of air on his passage through, that to stand up against it\nbowing behind the two counters, required the utmost remaining strength\nof the two ancient clerks. Those venerable and feeble persons were\nalways seen by the public in the act of bowing, and were popularly\nbelieved, when they had bowed a customer out, still to keep on bowing in\nthe empty office until they bowed another customer in.\n\nThe barrister was keen enough to divine that the banker would not have\ngone so far in his expression of opinion on any less solid ground than\nmoral certainty. Unprepared as he was for the large pill he had to\nswallow, he got it down. \"And now,\" said Mr. Stryver, shaking his\nforensic forefinger at the Temple in general, when it was down, \"my way\nout of this, is, to put you all in the wrong.\"\n\nIt was a bit of the art of an Old Bailey tactician, in which he found\ngreat relief. \"You shall not put me in the wrong, young lady,\" said Mr.\nStryver; \"I'll do that for you.\"\n\nAccordingly, when Mr. Lorry called that night as late as ten o'clock,\nMr. Stryver, among a quantity of books and papers littered out for the\npurpose, seemed to have nothing less on his mind than the subject of\nthe morning. He even showed surprise when he saw Mr. Lorry, and was\naltogether in an absent and preoccupied state.\n\n\"Well!\" said that good-natured emissary, after a full half-hour of\nbootless attempts to bring him round to the question. \"I have been to\nSoho.\"\n\n\"To Soho?\" repeated Mr. Stryver, coldly. \"Oh, to be sure! What am I\nthinking of!\"\n\n\"And I have no doubt,\" said Mr. Lorry, \"that I was right in the\nconversation we had.

The Fellow of Delicacy\n\n\nMr. Stryver having made up his mind to that magnanimous bestowal of good\nfortune on the Doctor's daughter, resolved to make her happiness known\nto her before he left town for the Long Vacation. After some mental\ndebating of the point, he came to the conclusion that it would be as\nwell to get all the preliminaries done with, and they could then arrange\nat their leisure whether he should give her his hand a week or two\nbefore Michaelmas Term, or in the little Christmas vacation between it\nand Hilary.\n\nAs to the strength of his case, he had not a doubt about it, but clearly\nsaw his way to the verdict. Argued with the jury on substantial worldly\ngrounds--the only grounds ever worth taking into account--it was a\nplain case, and had not a weak spot in it. He called himself for the\nplaintiff, there was no getting over his evidence, the counsel for\nthe defendant threw up his brief, and the jury did not even turn to\nconsider. After trying it, Stryver, C. J., was satisfied that no plainer\ncase could be.\n\nAccordingly, Mr. Stryver inaugurated the Long Vacation with a formal\nproposal to take Miss Manette to Vauxhall Gardens; that failing, to\nRanelagh; that unaccountably failing too, it behoved him to present\nhimself in Soho, and there declare his noble mind.\n\nTowards Soho, therefore, Mr. Stryver shouldered his way from the Temple,\nwhile the bloom of the Long Vacation's infancy was still upon it.\nAnybody who had seen him projecting himself into Soho while he was yet\non Saint Dunstan's side of Temple Bar, bursting in his full-blown way\nalong the pavement, to the jostlement of all weaker people, might have\nseen how safe and strong he was.\n\nHis way taking him past Tellson's, and he both banking at Tellson's and\nknowing Mr. Lorry as the intimate friend of the Manettes, it entered Mr.\nStryver's mind to enter the bank, and reveal to Mr. Lorry the brightness\nof the Soho horizon. So, he pushed open the door with the weak rattle\nin its throat, stumbled down the two steps, got past the two ancient\ncashiers, and shouldered himself into the musty back closet where Mr.\nLorry sat at great books ruled for figures, with perpendicular iron\nbars to his window as if that were ruled for figures too, and everything\nunder the clouds were a sum.\n\n\"Halloa!\" said Mr. Stryver. \"How do you do? I hope you are well!\"\n\nIt was Stryver's grand peculiarity that he always seemed too big for any\nplace, or space. He was so much too big for Tellson's, that old clerks\nin distant corners looked up with looks of remonstrance, as though he\nsqueezed them against the wall. The House itself, magnificently reading\nthe paper quite in the far-off perspective, lowered displeased, as if\nthe Stryver head had been butted into its responsible waistcoat.\n\nThe discreet Mr. Lorry said, in a sample tone of the voice he would\nrecommend under the circumstances, \"How do you do, Mr. Stryver? How do\nyou do, sir?\" and shook hands. There was a peculiarity in his manner\nof shaking hands, always to be seen in any clerk at Tellson's who shook\nhands with a customer when the House pervaded the air. He shook in a\nself-abnegating way, as one who shook for Tellson and Co.\n\n\"Can I do anything for you, Mr. Stryver?\" asked Mr. Lorry, in his\nbusiness character.\n\n\"Why, no, thank you; this is a private visit to yourself, Mr. Lorry; I\nhave come for a private word.\"\n\n\"Oh indeed!\" said Mr. Lorry, bending down his ear, while his eye strayed\nto the House afar off.\n\n\"I am going,\" said Mr. Stryver, leaning his arms confidentially on the\ndesk: whereupon, although it was a large double one, there appeared to\nbe not half desk enough for him: \"I am going to make an offer of myself\nin marriage to your agreeable little friend, Miss Manette, Mr. Lorry.\"\n\n\"Oh dear me!\" cried Mr. Lorry, rubbing his chin, and looking at his\nvisitor dubiously.\n\n\"Oh dear me, sir?\" repeated Stryver, drawing back. \"Oh dear you, sir?\nWhat may your meaning be, Mr. Lorry?\"\n\n\"My meaning,\" answered the man of business, \"is, of course, friendly and\nappreciative, and that it does you the greatest credit, and--in short,\nmy meaning is everything you could desire. But--really, you know, Mr.\nStryver--\" Mr. Lorry paused, and shook his head at him in the oddest\nmanner, as if he were compelled against his will to add, internally,\n\"you know there really is so much too much of you!\"\n\n\"Well!\" said Stryver, slapping the desk with his contentious hand,\nopening his eyes wider, and taking a long breath, \"if I understand you,\nMr. Lorry, I'll be hanged!\"\n\nMr. Lorry adjusted his little wig at both ears as a means towards that\nend, and bit the feather of a pen.\n\n\"D--n it all, sir!\" said Stryver, staring at him, \"am I not eligible?\"\n\n\"Oh dear yes! Yes. Oh yes, you're eligible!\" said Mr. Lorry. \"If you say\neligible, you are eligible.\"\n\n\"Am I not prosperous?\" asked Stryver.\n\n\"Oh! if you come to prosperous, you are prosperous,\" said Mr. Lorry.\n\n\"And advancing?\"\n\n\"If you come to advancing you know,\" said Mr. Lorry, delighted to be\nable to make another admission, \"nobody can doubt that.\"\n\n\"Then what on earth is your meaning, Mr. Lorry?\" demanded Stryver,\nperceptibly crestfallen.\n\n\"Well! I--Were you going there now?\" asked Mr. Lorry.\n\n\"Straight!\" said Stryver, with a plump of his fist on the desk.\n\n\"Then I think I wouldn't, if I was you.\"\n\n\"Why?\" said Stryver. \"Now, I'll put you in a corner,\" forensically\nshaking a forefinger at him. \"You are a man of business and bound to\nhave a reason. State your reason. Why wouldn't you go?\"\n\n\"Because,\" said Mr. Lorry, \"I wouldn't go on such an object without\nhaving some cause to believe that I should succeed.\"\n\n\"D--n _me_!\" cried Stryver, \"but this beats everything.\"\n\nMr. Lorry glanced at the distant House, and glanced at the angry\nStryver.\n\n\"Here's a man of business--a man of years--a man of experience--_in_\na Bank,\" said Stryver; \"and having summed up three leading reasons for\ncomplete success, he says there's no reason at all! Says it with his\nhead on!\" Mr. Stryver remarked upon the peculiarity as if it would have\nbeen infinitely less remarkable if he had said it with his head off.\n\n\"When I speak of success, I speak of success with the young lady; and\nwhen I speak of causes and reasons to make success probable, I speak of\ncauses and reasons that will tell as such with the young lady. The young\nlady, my good sir,\" said Mr. Lorry, mildly tapping the Stryver arm, \"the\nyoung lady. The young lady goes before all.\"\n\n\"Then you mean to tell me, Mr. Lorry,\" said Stryver, squaring his\nelbows, \"that it is your deliberate opinion that the young lady at\npresent in question is a mincing Fool?\"\n\n\"Not exactly so. I mean to tell you, Mr. Stryver,\" said Mr. Lorry,\nreddening, \"that I will hear no disrespectful word of that young lady\nfrom any lips; and that if I knew any man--which I hope I do not--whose\ntaste was so coarse, and whose temper was so overbearing, that he could\nnot restrain himself from speaking disrespectfully of that young lady at\nthis desk, not even Tellson's should prevent my giving him a piece of my\nmind.\"\n\nThe necessity of being angry in a suppressed tone had put Mr. Stryver's\nblood-vessels into a dangerous state when it was his turn to be angry;\nMr. Lorry's veins, methodical as their courses could usually be, were in\nno better state now it was his turn.\n\n\"That is what I mean to tell you, sir,\" said Mr. Lorry. \"Pray let there\nbe no mistake about it.\"\n\nMr. Stryver sucked the end of a ruler for a little while, and then stood\nhitting a tune out of his teeth with it, which probably gave him the\ntoothache. He broke the awkward silence by saying:\n\n\"This is something new to me, Mr. Lorry. You deliberately advise me not\nto go up to Soho and offer myself--_my_self, Stryver of the King's Bench\nbar?\"\n\n\"Do you ask me for my advice, Mr. Stryver?\"\n\n\"Yes, I do.\"\n\n\"Very good. Then I give it, and you have repeated it correctly.\"\n\n\"And all I can say of it is,\" laughed Stryver with a vexed laugh, \"that\nthis--ha, ha!--beats everything past, present, and to come.\"\n\n\"Now understand me,\" pursued Mr. Lorry. \"As a man of business, I am\nnot justified in saying anything about this matter, for, as a man of\nbusiness, I know nothing of it. But, as an old fellow, who has carried\nMiss Manette in his arms, who is the trusted friend of Miss Manette and\nof her father too, and who has a great affection for them both, I have\nspoken. The confidence is not of my seeking, recollect. Now, you think I\nmay not be right?\"\n\n\"Not I!\" said Stryver, whistling. \"I can't undertake to find third\nparties in common sense; I can only find it for myself. I suppose sense\nin certain quarters; you suppose mincing bread-and-butter nonsense. It's\nnew to me, but you are right, I dare say.\"\n\n\"What I suppose, Mr. Stryver, I claim to characterise for myself--And\nunderstand me, sir,\" said Mr. Lorry, quickly flushing again, \"I\nwill not--not even at Tellson's--have it characterised for me by any\ngentleman breathing.\"\n\n\"There! I beg your pardon!\" said Stryver.\n\n\"Granted. Thank you. Well, Mr. Stryver, I was about to say:--it might be\npainful to you to find yourself mistaken, it might be painful to Doctor\nManette to have the task of being explicit with you, it might be very\npainful to Miss Manette to have the task of being explicit with you. You\nknow the terms upon which I have the honour and happiness to stand with\nthe family. If you please, committing you in no way, representing you\nin no way, I will undertake to correct my advice by the exercise of a\nlittle new observation and judgment expressly brought to bear upon\nit. If you should then be dissatisfied with it, you can but test its\nsoundness for yourself; if, on the other hand, you should be satisfied\nwith it, and it should be what it now is, it may spare all sides what is\nbest spared. What do you say?\"\n\n\"How long would you keep me in town?\"\n\n\"Oh! It is only a question of a few hours. I could go to Soho in the\nevening, and come to your chambers afterwards.\"\n\n\"Then I say yes,\" said Stryver: \"I won't go up there now, I am not so\nhot upon it as that comes to; I say yes, and I shall expect you to look\nin to-night. Good morning.\"\n\nThen Mr. Stryver turned and burst out of the Bank, causing such a\nconcussion of air on his passage through, that to stand up against it\nbowing behind the two counters, required the utmost remaining strength\nof the two ancient clerks. Those venerable and feeble persons were\nalways seen by the public in the act of bowing, and were popularly\nbelieved, when they had bowed a customer out, still to keep on bowing in\nthe empty office until they bowed another customer in.\n\nThe barrister was keen enough to divine that the banker would not have\ngone so far in his expression of opinion on any less solid ground than\nmoral certainty. Unprepared as he was for the large pill he had to\nswallow, he got it down. \"And now,\" said Mr. Stryver, shaking his\nforensic forefinger at the Temple in general, when it was down, \"my way\nout of this, is, to put you all in the wrong.\"\n\nIt was a bit of the art of an Old Bailey tactician, in which he found\ngreat relief. \"You shall not put me in the wrong, young lady,\" said Mr.\nStryver; \"I'll do that for you.\"\n\nAccordingly, when Mr. Lorry called that night as late as ten o'clock,\nMr. Stryver, among a quantity of books and papers littered out for the\npurpose, seemed to have nothing less on his mind than the subject of\nthe morning. He even showed surprise when he saw Mr. Lorry, and was\naltogether in an absent and preoccupied state.\n\n\"Well!\" said that good-natured emissary, after a full half-hour of\nbootless attempts to bring him round to the question. \"I have been to\nSoho.\"\n\n\"To Soho?\" repeated Mr. Stryver, coldly. \"Oh, to be sure! What am I\nthinking of!\"\n\n\"And I have no doubt,\" said Mr. Lorry, \"that I was right in the\nconversation we had. My opinion is confirmed, and I reiterate my\nadvice.\"\n\n\"I assure you,\" returned Mr. Stryver, in the friendliest way, \"that I\nam sorry for it on your account, and sorry for it on the poor father's\naccount. I know this must always be a sore subject with the family; let\nus say no more about it.\"\n\n\"I don't understand you,\" said Mr. Lorry.\n\n\"I dare say not,\" rejoined Stryver, nodding his head in a smoothing and\nfinal way; \"no matter, no matter.\"\n\n\"But it does matter,\" Mr. Lorry urged.\n\n\"No it doesn't; I assure you it doesn't.

Unaccountably, she refuses. Not to worry, though. Stryver's sure that he's going to win her over. He's on his way to Soho to visit Dr. Manette when he happens to walk by Tellson's. Since he knows that Mr. Lorry is a good friend of the Manettes, he drops by to share the good news. Mr. Lorry thinks that Mr. Stryver is too loud and too brazen to fit in well at Tellson's. In fact, the guy sort of sticks out like a sore thumb. Mr. Lorry tries to get Stryver to tone it down a bit, but Stryver doesn't seem to get the message. Glibly unaware of how arrogant he sounds, Stryver tells Mr. Lorry that he plans to marry Lucie. Mr. Lorry's upset. He knows exactly what the Manettes think of Stryver. Unsurprisingly, they don't think too much of him. He gently tries to break this to Stryver. Stryver's not the brightest kid in class. He keeps telling Mr. Lorry how perfect a suitor he is. After all, he's a prosperous lawyer. He's respectable and even well-off. Who wouldn't love him? In fact, after telling Mr. Lorry all about himself, Stryver's pretty sure that he should march right over to the Manettes' house and propose. Mr. Lorry disagrees. He's fairly certain that the whole thing will turn out...well, it won't be pretty. Stryver can't understand why this would be the case. After a bit of heated conversation, Mr. Lorry manages to get Stryver to agree to postpone proposing to Lucie right away. He tries to warn Stryver that Lucie might not think that Stryver is the amazing man that Stryver thinks he is. Instead, Mr. Lorry offers to head over to the Manette house to test the waters for Stryver. He's pretty sure that he knows what the answer will be, but he wants to save Stryver from the embarrassment of a proposal. Stryver agrees to wait for a day until Mr. Lorry returns. After all, he follows Carton's lead on everything else. Why wouldn't he follow Mr. Lorry's lead on this? That's what Mr. Lorry's banking on. He heads over to the Manette house immediately. Mr. Stryver stretches out on the couch in Mr. Lorry's office and waits for him to return with an answer."}

Having supposed that there was\nsense where there is no sense, and a laudable ambition where there is\nnot a laudable ambition, I am well out of my mistake, and no harm is\ndone. Young women have committed similar follies often before, and have\nrepented them in poverty and obscurity often before.

Rather than risk making Doctor Alexandre Manette or Lucie uncomfortable by receiving a proposal directly from Stryver, Mr. Lorry suggests that Stryver let him visit the Manettes and find out if Lucie would accept Stryver's suit. Stryver agrees, and when Mr. Lorry returns from Soho, he tells Stryver that he should drop his suit.

The Fellow of Delicacy\n\n\nMr. Stryver having made up his mind to that magnanimous bestowal of good\nfortune on the Doctor's daughter, resolved to make her happiness known\nto her before he left town for the Long Vacation. After some mental\ndebating of the point, he came to the conclusion that it would be as\nwell to get all the preliminaries done with, and they could then arrange\nat their leisure whether he should give her his hand a week or two\nbefore Michaelmas Term, or in the little Christmas vacation between it\nand Hilary.\n\nAs to the strength of his case, he had not a doubt about it, but clearly\nsaw his way to the verdict. Argued with the jury on substantial worldly\ngrounds--the only grounds ever worth taking into account--it was a\nplain case, and had not a weak spot in it. He called himself for the\nplaintiff, there was no getting over his evidence, the counsel for\nthe defendant threw up his brief, and the jury did not even turn to\nconsider. After trying it, Stryver, C. J., was satisfied that no plainer\ncase could be.\n\nAccordingly, Mr. Stryver inaugurated the Long Vacation with a formal\nproposal to take Miss Manette to Vauxhall Gardens; that failing, to\nRanelagh; that unaccountably failing too, it behoved him to present\nhimself in Soho, and there declare his noble mind.\n\nTowards Soho, therefore, Mr. Stryver shouldered his way from the Temple,\nwhile the bloom of the Long Vacation's infancy was still upon it.\nAnybody who had seen him projecting himself into Soho while he was yet\non Saint Dunstan's side of Temple Bar, bursting in his full-blown way\nalong the pavement, to the jostlement of all weaker people, might have\nseen how safe and strong he was.\n\nHis way taking him past Tellson's, and he both banking at Tellson's and\nknowing Mr. Lorry as the intimate friend of the Manettes, it entered Mr.\nStryver's mind to enter the bank, and reveal to Mr. Lorry the brightness\nof the Soho horizon. So, he pushed open the door with the weak rattle\nin its throat, stumbled down the two steps, got past the two ancient\ncashiers, and shouldered himself into the musty back closet where Mr.\nLorry sat at great books ruled for figures, with perpendicular iron\nbars to his window as if that were ruled for figures too, and everything\nunder the clouds were a sum.\n\n\"Halloa!\" said Mr. Stryver. \"How do you do? I hope you are well!\"\n\nIt was Stryver's grand peculiarity that he always seemed too big for any\nplace, or space. He was so much too big for Tellson's, that old clerks\nin distant corners looked up with looks of remonstrance, as though he\nsqueezed them against the wall. The House itself, magnificently reading\nthe paper quite in the far-off perspective, lowered displeased, as if\nthe Stryver head had been butted into its responsible waistcoat.\n\nThe discreet Mr. Lorry said, in a sample tone of the voice he would\nrecommend under the circumstances, \"How do you do, Mr. Stryver? How do\nyou do, sir?\" and shook hands. There was a peculiarity in his manner\nof shaking hands, always to be seen in any clerk at Tellson's who shook\nhands with a customer when the House pervaded the air. He shook in a\nself-abnegating way, as one who shook for Tellson and Co.\n\n\"Can I do anything for you, Mr. Stryver?\" asked Mr. Lorry, in his\nbusiness character.\n\n\"Why, no, thank you; this is a private visit to yourself, Mr. Lorry; I\nhave come for a private word.\"\n\n\"Oh indeed!\" said Mr. Lorry, bending down his ear, while his eye strayed\nto the House afar off.\n\n\"I am going,\" said Mr. Stryver, leaning his arms confidentially on the\ndesk: whereupon, although it was a large double one, there appeared to\nbe not half desk enough for him: \"I am going to make an offer of myself\nin marriage to your agreeable little friend, Miss Manette, Mr. Lorry.\"\n\n\"Oh dear me!\" cried Mr. Lorry, rubbing his chin, and looking at his\nvisitor dubiously.\n\n\"Oh dear me, sir?\" repeated Stryver, drawing back. \"Oh dear you, sir?\nWhat may your meaning be, Mr. Lorry?\"\n\n\"My meaning,\" answered the man of business, \"is, of course, friendly and\nappreciative, and that it does you the greatest credit, and--in short,\nmy meaning is everything you could desire.

I mean to tell you, Mr. Stryver,\" said Mr. Lorry,\nreddening, \"that I will hear no disrespectful word of that young lady\nfrom any lips; and that if I knew any man--which I hope I do not--whose\ntaste was so coarse, and whose temper was so overbearing, that he could\nnot restrain himself from speaking disrespectfully of that young lady at\nthis desk, not even Tellson's should prevent my giving him a piece of my\nmind.\"\n\nThe necessity of being angry in a suppressed tone had put Mr. Stryver's\nblood-vessels into a dangerous state when it was his turn to be angry;\nMr. Lorry's veins, methodical as their courses could usually be, were in\nno better state now it was his turn.\n\n\"That is what I mean to tell you, sir,\" said Mr. Lorry. \"Pray let there\nbe no mistake about it.\"\n\nMr. Stryver sucked the end of a ruler for a little while, and then stood\nhitting a tune out of his teeth with it, which probably gave him the\ntoothache. He broke the awkward silence by saying:\n\n\"This is something new to me, Mr. Lorry. You deliberately advise me not\nto go up to Soho and offer myself--_my_self, Stryver of the King's Bench\nbar?\"\n\n\"Do you ask me for my advice, Mr. Stryver?\"\n\n\"Yes, I do.\"\n\n\"Very good.

I mean to tell you, Mr. Stryver,\" said Mr. Lorry,\nreddening, \"that I will hear no disrespectful word of that young lady\nfrom any lips; and that if I knew any man--which I hope I do not--whose\ntaste was so coarse, and whose temper was so overbearing, that he could\nnot restrain himself from speaking disrespectfully of that young lady at\nthis desk, not even Tellson's should prevent my giving him a piece of my\nmind.\"\n\nThe necessity of being angry in a suppressed tone had put Mr. Stryver's\nblood-vessels into a dangerous state when it was his turn to be angry;\nMr. Lorry's veins, methodical as their courses could usually be, were in\nno better state now it was his turn.\n\n\"That is what I mean to tell you, sir,\" said Mr. Lorry. \"Pray let there\nbe no mistake about it.\"\n\nMr. Stryver sucked the end of a ruler for a little while, and then stood\nhitting a tune out of his teeth with it, which probably gave him the\ntoothache. He broke the awkward silence by saying:\n\n\"This is something new to me, Mr. Lorry. You deliberately advise me not\nto go up to Soho and offer myself--_my_self, Stryver of the King's Bench\nbar?\"\n\n\"Do you ask me for my advice, Mr. Stryver?\"\n\n\"Yes, I do.\"\n\n\"Very good. Then I give it, and you have repeated it correctly.\"\n\n\"And all I can say of it is,\" laughed Stryver with a vexed laugh, \"that\nthis--ha, ha!--beats everything past, present, and to come.\"\n\n\"Now understand me,\" pursued Mr. Lorry. \"As a man of business, I am\nnot justified in saying anything about this matter, for, as a man of\nbusiness, I know nothing of it. But, as an old fellow, who has carried\nMiss Manette in his arms, who is the trusted friend of Miss Manette and\nof her father too, and who has a great affection for them both, I have\nspoken. The confidence is not of my seeking, recollect. Now, you think I\nmay not be right?\"\n\n\"Not I!\" said Stryver, whistling. \"I can't undertake to find third\nparties in common sense; I can only find it for myself. I suppose sense\nin certain quarters; you suppose mincing bread-and-butter nonsense. It's\nnew to me, but you are right, I dare say.\"\n\n\"What I suppose, Mr. Stryver, I claim to characterise for myself--And\nunderstand me, sir,\" said Mr. Lorry, quickly flushing again, \"I\nwill not--not even at Tellson's--have it characterised for me by any\ngentleman breathing.\"\n\n\"There! I beg your pardon!\" said Stryver.\n\n\"Granted. Thank you. Well, Mr. Stryver, I was about to say:--it might be\npainful to you to find yourself mistaken, it might be painful to Doctor\nManette to have the task of being explicit with you, it might be very\npainful to Miss Manette to have the task of being explicit with you. You\nknow the terms upon which I have the honour and happiness to stand with\nthe family. If you please, committing you in no way, representing you\nin no way, I will undertake to correct my advice by the exercise of a\nlittle new observation and judgment expressly brought to bear upon\nit. If you should then be dissatisfied with it, you can but test its\nsoundness for yourself; if, on the other hand, you should be satisfied\nwith it, and it should be what it now is, it may spare all sides what is\nbest spared. What do you say?\"\n\n\"How long would you keep me in town?\"\n\n\"Oh! It is only a question of a few hours. I could go to Soho in the\nevening, and come to your chambers afterwards.\"\n\n\"Then I say yes,\" said Stryver: \"I won't go up there now, I am not so\nhot upon it as that comes to; I say yes, and I shall expect you to look\nin to-night. Good morning.\"\n\nThen Mr. Stryver turned and burst out of the Bank, causing such a\nconcussion of air on his passage through, that to stand up against it\nbowing behind the two counters, required the utmost remaining strength\nof the two ancient clerks. Those venerable and feeble persons were\nalways seen by the public in the act of bowing, and were popularly\nbelieved, when they had bowed a customer out, still to keep on bowing in\nthe empty office until they bowed another customer in.\n\nThe barrister was keen enough to divine that the banker would not have\ngone so far in his expression of opinion on any less solid ground than\nmoral certainty. Unprepared as he was for the large pill he had to\nswallow, he got it down. \"And now,\" said Mr. Stryver, shaking his\nforensic forefinger at the Temple in general, when it was down, \"my way\nout of this, is, to put you all in the wrong.\"\n\nIt was a bit of the art of an Old Bailey tactician, in which he found\ngreat relief. \"You shall not put me in the wrong, young lady,\" said Mr.\nStryver; \"I'll do that for you.\"\n\nAccordingly, when Mr. Lorry called that night as late as ten o'clock,\nMr. Stryver, among a quantity of books and papers littered out for the\npurpose, seemed to have nothing less on his mind than the subject of\nthe morning. He even showed surprise when he saw Mr. Lorry, and was\naltogether in an absent and preoccupied state.\n\n\"Well!\" said that good-natured emissary, after a full half-hour of\nbootless attempts to bring him round to the question. \"I have been to\nSoho.\"\n\n\"To Soho?\" repeated Mr. Stryver, coldly. \"Oh, to be sure! What am I\nthinking of!\"\n\n\"And I have no doubt,\" said Mr. Lorry, \"that I was right in the\nconversation we had. My opinion is confirmed, and I reiterate my\nadvice.\"\n\n\"I assure you,\" returned Mr. Stryver, in the friendliest way, \"that I\nam sorry for it on your account, and sorry for it on the poor father's\naccount. I know this must always be a sore subject with the family; let\nus say no more about it.\"\n\n\"I don't understand you,\" said Mr. Lorry.\n\n\"I dare say not,\" rejoined Stryver, nodding his head in a smoothing and\nfinal way; \"no matter, no matter.\"\n\n\"But it does matter,\" Mr. Lorry urged.\n\n\"No it doesn't; I assure you it doesn't. Having supposed that there was\nsense where there is no sense, and a laudable ambition where there is\nnot a laudable ambition, I am well out of my mistake, and no harm is\ndone. Young women have committed similar follies often before, and have\nrepented them in poverty and obscurity often before. In an unselfish\naspect, I am sorry that the thing is dropped, because it would have been\na bad thing for me in a worldly point of view; in a selfish aspect, I am\nglad that the thing has dropped, because it would have been a bad thing\nfor me in a worldly point of view--it is hardly necessary to say I could\nhave gained nothing by it. There is no harm at all done. I have not\nproposed to the young lady, and, between ourselves, I am by no means\ncertain, on reflection, that I ever should have committed myself to\nthat extent. Mr. Lorry, you cannot control the mincing vanities and\ngiddinesses of empty-headed girls; you must not expect to do it, or you\nwill always be disappointed. Now, pray say no more about it. I tell you,\nI regret it on account of others, but I am satisfied on my own account.\nAnd I am really very much obliged to you for allowing me to sound you,\nand for giving me your advice; you know the young lady better than I do;\nyou were right, it never would have done.\"\n\nMr. Lorry was so taken aback, that he looked quite stupidly at Mr.\nStryver shouldering him towards the door, with an appearance of\nshowering generosity, forbearance, and goodwill, on his erring head.\n\"Make the best of it, my dear sir,\" said Stryver; \"say no more about it;\nthank you again for allowing me to sound you; good night!\"\n\nMr. Lorry was out in the night, before he knew where he was. Mr. Stry\n\n### Summary:\n\n", "answer": "Before Stryver's vacation begins, he decides to propose to Lucie. He heads towards her house in Soho. On his way, he stops at Tellson's Bank to inform Mr. Lorry of his plans to marry Lucie. Mr. Lorry, on hearing the news, hints that Stryver will not be successful. Stryver is shocked at the suggestion and demands to know what prevents him from being a suitable, prospective husband. Mr. Lorry intimates that Lucie may not find him agreeable. This upsets Stryver even more, and he calls Lucie silly and giddy-headed. Such criticisms of Lucie annoy Mr. Lorry, for he is excessively fond of and protective towards her. Lorry agrees to go to the Manette residence to get a feel for Lucies estimation of Stryver. He returns with the news that Stryver has been rejected by Lucie, as expected. Stryver pretends to be unbothered by the news and judges his proposal to be an act of charity that has somehow misfired."}

Colbert's Carriage.\n\n\nAs Gourville had seen, the king's musketeers were mounting and following\ntheir captain. The latter, who did not like to be confined in his\nproceedings, left his brigade under the orders of a lieutenant, and set\noff on post horses, recommending his men to use all diligence. However\nrapidly they might travel, they could not arrive before him. He had\ntime, in passing along the Rue des Petits-Champs, to see something\nwhich afforded him plenty of food for thought and conjecture. He saw M.\nColbert coming out from his house to get into his carriage, which was\nstationed before the door. In this carriage D'Artagnan perceived the\nhoods of two women, and being rather curious, he wished to know the\nnames of the ladies hid beneath these hoods. To get a glimpse at them,\nfor they kept themselves closely covered up, he urged his horse so near\nthe carriage, that he drove him against the step with such force as to\nshake everything containing and contained. The terrified women uttered,\nthe one a faint cry, by which D'Artagnan recognized a young woman, the\nother an imprecation, in which he recognized the vigor and _aplomb_ that\nhalf a century bestows. The hoods were thrown back: one of the women\nwas Madame Vanel, the other the Duchesse de Chevreuse. D'Artagnan's\neyes were quicker than those of the ladies; he had seen and known them,\nwhilst they did not recognize him; and as they laughed at their fright,\npressing each other's hands,--\n\n\"Humph!\" said D'Artagnan, \"the old duchesse is no more inaccessible to\nfriendship than formerly. _She_ paying her court to the mistress of M.\nColbert! Poor M. Fouquet! that presages you nothing good!\"\n\nHe rode on. M. Colbert got into his carriage and the distinguished trio\ncommenced a sufficiently slow pilgrimage toward the wood of Vincennes.\nMadame de Chevreuse set down Madame Vanel at her husband's house, and,\nleft alone with M. Colbert, chatted upon affairs whilst continuing her\nride. She had an inexhaustible fund of conversation, that dear duchesse,\nand as she always talked for the ill of others, though ever with a view\nto her own good, her conversation amused her interlocutor, and did not\nfail to leave a favorable impression.\n\nShe taught Colbert, who, poor man! was ignorant of the fact, how great\na minister he was, and how Fouquet would soon become a cipher. She\npromised to rally around him, when he should become surintendant,\nall the old nobility of the kingdom, and questioned him as to the\npreponderance it would be proper to allow La Valliere. She praised him,\nshe blamed him, she bewildered him. She showed him the secret of so many\nsecrets that, for a moment, Colbert thought he was doing business with\nthe devil. She proved to him that she held in her hand the Colbert of\nto-day, as she had held the Fouquet of yesterday; and as he asked her\nvery simply the reason of her hatred for the surintendant: \"Why do you\nyourself hate him?\" said she.\n\n\"Madame, in politics,\" replied he, \"the differences of system oft bring\nabout dissentions between men. M. Fouquet always appeared to me to\npractice a system opposed to the true interests of the king.\"\n\nShe interrupted him.--\"I will say no more to you about M. Fouquet. The\njourney the king is about to take to Nantes will give a good account of\nhim. M. Fouquet, for me, is a man gone by--and for you also.\"\n\nColbert made no reply. \"On his return from Nantes,\" continued the\nduchesse, \"the king, who is only anxious for a pretext, will find\nthat the States have not behaved well--that they have made too few\nsacrifices. The States will say that the imposts are too heavy, and that\nthe surintendant has ruined them. The king will lay all the blame on M.\nFouquet, and then--\"\n\n\"And then?\" said Colbert.\n\n\"Oh! he will be disgraced. Is not that your opinion?\"\n\nColbert darted a glance at the duchesse, which plainly said: \"If M.\nFouquet be only disgraced, you will not be the cause of it.\"\n\n\"Your place, M. Colbert,\" the duchesse hastened to say, \"must be a high\nplace. Do you perceive any one between the king and yourself, after the\nfall of M. Fouquet?\"\n\n\"I do not understand,\" said he.\n\n\"You _will_ understand. To what does your ambition aspire?\"\n\n\"I have none.\"\n\n\"It was useless, then, to overthrow the superintendent, Monsieur\nColbert. It was idle.\"\n\n\"I had the honor to tell you, madame--\"\n\n\"Oh! yes, I know, all about the interest of the king--but, if you\nplease, we will speak of your own.\"\n\n\"Mine! that is to say, the affairs of his majesty.\"\n\n\"In short, are you, or are you not endeavoring to ruin M. Fouquet?\nAnswer without evasion.\"\n\n\"Madame, I ruin nobody.\"\n\n\"I am endeavoring to comprehend, then, why you purchased from me the\nletters of M. Mazarin concerning M. Fouquet. Neither can I conceive why\nyou have laid those letters before the king.\"\n\nColbert, half stupefied, looked at the duchesse with an air of\nconstraint.\n\n\"Madame,\" said he, \"I can less easily conceive how you, who received the\nmoney, can reproach me on that head--\"\n\n\"That is,\" said the old duchesse, \"because we must will that which we\nwish for, unless we are not able to obtain what we wish.\"\n\n\"_Will!_\" said Colbert, quite confounded by such coarse logic.\n\n\"You are not able, _hein!_ Speak.\"\n\n\"I am not able, I allow, to destroy certain influences near the king.\"\n\n\"That fight in favor of M. Fouquet? What are they? Stop, let me help\nyou.\"\n\n\"Do, madame.\"\n\n\"La Valliere?\"\n\n\"Oh! very little influence; no knowledge of business, and small means.\nM. Fouquet has paid his court to her.\"\n\n\"To defend him would be to accuse herself, would it not?\"\n\n\"I think it would.\"\n\n\"There is still another influence, what do you say to that?\"\n\n\"Is it considerable?\"\n\n\"The queen-mother, perhaps?\"\n\n\"Her majesty, the queen-mother, has a weakness for M. Fouquet very\nprejudicial to her son.\"\n\n\"Never believe that,\" said the old duchesse, smiling.\n\n\"Oh!\" said Colbert, with incredulity, \"I have often experienced it.\"\n\n\"Formerly?\"\n\n\"Very recently, madame, at Vaux. It was she who prevented the king from\nhaving M. Fouquet arrested.\"\n\n\"People do not forever entertain the same opinions, my dear monsieur.\nThat which the queen may have wished recently, she would not wish,\nperhaps, to-day.\"\n\n\"And why not?\" said Colbert, astonished.\n\n\"Oh! the reason is of very little consequence.\"\n\n\"On the contrary, I think it is of great consequence; for, if I were\ncertain of not displeasing her majesty, the queen-mother, my scruples\nwould be all removed.\"\n\n\"Well! have you never heard talk of a certain secret?\"\n\n\"A secret?\"\n\n\"Call it what you like. In short, the queen-mother has conceived a\nbitter hatred for all those who have participated, in one fashion or\nanother, in the discovery of this secret, and M. Fouquet I believe is\none of these.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said Colbert, \"we may be sure of the assent of the\nqueen-mother?\"\n\n\"I have just left her majesty, and she assures me so.\"\n\n\"So be it, then, madame.\"\n\n\"But there is something further; do you happen to know a man who was the\nintimate friend of M. Fouquet, M. d'Herblay, a bishop, I believe?\"\n\n\"Bishop of Vannes.\"\n\n\"Well! this M. d'Herblay, who also knew the secret, the queen-mother is\npursuing with the utmost rancor.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\"\n\n\"So hotly pursued, that if he were dead, she would not be satisfied with\nanything less than his head, to satisfy her he would never speak again.\"\n\n\"And is that the desire of the queen-mother?\"\n\n\"An order is given for it.\"\n\n\"This Monsieur d'Herblay shall be sought for, madame.\"\n\n\"Oh! it is well known where he is.\"\n\nColbert looked at the duchesse.\n\n\"Say where, madame.\"\n\n\"He is at Belle-Ile-en-Mer.\"\n\n\"At the residence of M. Fouquet?\"\n\n\"At the residence of M. Fouquet.\"\n\n\"He shall be taken.\"\n\nIt was now the duchesse's turn to smile. \"Do not fancy the capture so\neasy,\" said she; \"do not promise it so lightly.\"\n\n\"Why not, madame?\"\n\n\"Because M. d'Herblay is not one of those people who can be taken when\nand where you please.\"\n\n\"He is a rebel, then?\"\n\n\"Oh! Monsieur Colbert, we have passed all our lives in making rebels,\nand yet you see plainly, that so far from being taken, we take others.\"\n\nColbert fixed upon the old duchesse one of those fierce looks of which\nno words can convey the expression, accompanied by a firmness not\naltogether wanting in grandeur. \"The times are gone,\" said he, \"in which\nsubjects gained duchies by making war against the king of France. If M.\nd'Herblay conspires, he will perish on the scaffold. That will give, or\nwill not give, pleasure to his enemies,--a matter, by the way, of little\nimportance to _us_.\"\n\nAnd this _us_, a strange word in the mouth of Colbert, made the duchesse\nthoughtful for a moment. She caught herself reckoning inwardly with this\nman--Colbert had regained his superiority in the conversation, and he\nmeant to keep it.\n\n\"You ask me, madame,\" he said, \"to have this M. d'Herblay arrested?\"\n\n\"I?--I ask you nothing of the kind!\"\n\n\"I thought you did, madame. But as I have been mistaken, we will leave\nhim alone; the king has said nothing about him.\"\n\nThe duchesse bit her nails.\n\n\"Besides,\" continued Colbert, \"what a poor capture would this bishop be!\nA bishop game for a king! Oh! no, no; I will not even take the slightest\nnotice of him.\"\n\nThe hatred of the duchesse now discovered itself.\n\n\"Game for a woman!\" said she. \"Is not the queen a woman? If she wishes\nM. d'Herblay arrested, she has her reasons. Besides, is not M. d'Herblay\nthe friend of him who is doomed to fall?\"\n\n\"Oh! never mind that,\" said Colbert. \"This man shall be spared, if he is\nnot the enemy of the king. Is that displeasing to you?\"\n\n\"I say nothing.\"\n\n\"Yes--you wish to see him in prison, in the Bastile, for instance.\"\n\n\"I believe a secret better concealed behind the walls of the Bastile\nthan behind those of Belle-Isle.\"\n\n\"I will speak to the king about it; he will clear up the point.\"\n\n\"And whilst waiting for that enlightenment, Monsieur l'Eveque de Vannes\nwill have escaped. I would do so.\"\n\n\"Escaped! he! and whither should he escape? Europe is ours, in will, if\nnot in fact.\"\n\n\"He will always find an asylum, monsieur. It is evident you know nothing\nof the man you have to do with. You do not know D'Herblay; you do not\nknow Aramis. He was one of those four musketeers who, under the late\nking, made Cardinal de Richelieu tremble, and who, during the regency,\ngave so much trouble to Monseigneur Mazarin.\"\n\n\"But, madame, what can he do, unless he has a kingdom to back him?\"\n\n\"He has one, monsieur.\"\n\n\"A kingdom, he! what, Monsieur d'Herblay?\"\n\n\"I repeat to you, monsieur, that if he wants a kingdom, he either has it\nor will have it.\"\n\n\"Well, as you are so earnest that this rebel should not escape, madame,\nI promise you he shall not escape.\"\n\n\"Belle-Isle is fortified, M. Colbert, and fortified by him.\"\n\n\"If Belle-Isle were also defended by him, Belle-Isle is not impregnable;\nand if Monsieur l'Eveque de Vannes is shut up in Belle-Isle, well,\nmadame, the place shall be besieged, and he will be taken.\"\n\n\"You may be very certain, monsieur, that the zeal you display in the\ninterest of the queen-mother will please her majesty mightily, and\nyou will be magnificently rewarded; but what shall I tell her of your\nprojects respecting this man?\"\n\n\"That when once taken, he shall be shut up in a fortress from which her\nsecret shall never escape.\"\n\n\"Very well, Monsieur Colbert, and we may say, that, dating from this\ninstant, we have formed a solid alliance, that is, you and I, and that I\nam absolutely at your service.\"\n\n\"It is I, madame, who place myself at yours. This Chevalier d'Herblay is\na kind of Spanish spy, is he not?\"\n\n\"Much more.\"\n\n\"A secret ambassador?\"\n\n\"Higher still.\"\n\n\"Stop--King Phillip III. of Spain is a bigot. He is, perhaps, the\nconfessor of Phillip III.\"\n\n\"You must go higher even than that.\"\n\n\"_Mordieu!_\" cried Colbert, who forgot himself so far as to swear in the\npresence of this great lady, of this old friend of the queen-mother. \"He\nmust then be the general of the Jesuits.\"\n\n\"I believe you have guessed it at last,\" replied the duchesse.\n\n\"Ah! then, madame, this man will ruin us all if we do not ruin him; and\nwe must make haste, too.\"\n\n\"Such was my opinion, monsieur, but I did not dare to give it you.\"\n\n\"And it was lucky for us he has attacked the throne, and not us.\"\n\n\"But, mark this well, M. Colbert. M. d'Herblay is never discouraged; if\nhe has missed one blow, he will be sure to make another; he will begin\nagain. If he has allowed an opportunity to escape of making a king for\nhimself, sooner or later, he will make another, of whom, to a certainty,\nyou will not be prime minister.\"\n\nColbert knitted his brow with a menacing expression. \"I feel assured\nthat a prison will settle this affair for us, madame, in a manner\nsatisfactory for both.\"\n\nThe duchesse smiled again.\n\n\"Oh! if you knew,\" said she, \"how many times Aramis has got out of\nprison!\"\n\n\"Oh!\" replied Colbert, \"we will take care that he shall not get out\n_this_ time.\"\n\n\"But you were not attending to what I said to you just now. Do you\nremember that Aramis was one of the four invincibles whom Richelieu so\ndreaded? And at that period the four musketeers were not in possession\nof that which they have now--money and experience.\"\n\nColbert bit his lips.\n\n\"We will renounce the idea of the prison,\" said he, in a lower tone:\n\"we will find a little retreat from which the invincible cannot possibly\nescape.\"\n\n\"That was well spoken, our ally!\" replied the duchesse. \"But it is\ngetting late; had we not better return?\"\n\n\"The more willingly, madame, from my having my preparations to make for\nsetting out with the king.\"\n\n\"To Paris!\" cried the duchesse to the coachman.\n\nAnd the carriage returned towards the Faubourg Saint Antoine, after the\nconclusion of the treaty that gave to death the last friend of Fouquet,\nthe last defender of Belle\n\n### Summary:\n\n", "answer": "D'Artagnan is riding at the head of all the assembled Musketeers when he spies Colbert getting into a carriage occupied by two women. D'Artagnan is curious as to the women's identity and so runs his horse right next to the carriage to frighten them. They are revealed as Madame Vanel and Madame de Chevreuse. We learn that Madame Vanel is Colbert's mistress. Clearly Madame de Chevreuse is now on Colbert's side in the game of political alliances. Madame Vanel is dropped off at her husband's house, and Madame de Chevreuse then has time to chat with Colbert. She begins by flattering him and assuring him of her support. We learn that the papers incriminating Fouquet come from Madame de Chevreuse. She asks Colbert what his ambitions are. We next learn that the Queen mother will no longer come to Fouquet's defense if he is in danger, because he learned of her terrible secret. The Queen mother is also out for blood with regard to Aramis. Colbert can make no promises on that front. Madame de Chevreuse is angry that Colbert seems to underestimate Aramis's capabilities. She reveals that he the General of the Jesuits. The two allies decide it is time to return to Paris. The narrator reminds us that Madame de Chevreuse was once a devoted ally of the Musketeers'."}

By some of these\n     The Queene is put in anger; y'are excus'd:\n     But will you be more iustifi'de?

Thus it came; giue heede too't:\n    My Conscience first receiu'd a tendernes,\n    Scruple, and pricke, on certaine Speeches vtter'd\n    By th' Bishop of Bayon, then French Embassador,\n    Who had beene hither sent on the debating\n    And Marriage 'twixt the Duke of Orleance, and\n    Our Daughter Mary: I'th' Progresse of this busines,\n    Ere a determinate resolution, hee\n    (I meane the Bishop) did require a respite,\n    Wherein he might the King his Lord aduertise,\n    Whether our Daughter were legitimate,\n    Respecting this our Marriage with the Dowager,\n    Sometimes our Brothers Wife. This respite shooke\n    The bosome of my Conscience, enter'd me;\n    Yea, with a spitting power, and made to tremble\n    The region of my Breast, which forc'd such way,\n    That many maz'd considerings, did throng\n    And prest in with this Caution. First, me thought\n    I stood not in the smile of Heauen, who had\n    Commanded Nature, that my Ladies wombe\n    If it conceiu'd a male-child by me, should\n    Doe no more Offices of life too't; then\n    The Graue does to th' dead: For her Male Issue,\n    Or di'de where they were made, or shortly after\n    This world had ayr'd them. Hence I tooke a thought,\n    This was a Iudgement on me, that my Kingdome\n    (Well worthy the best Heyre o'th' World) should not\n    Be gladded in't by me. Then followes, that\n    I weigh'd the danger which my Realmes stood in\n    By this my Issues faile, and that gaue to me\n    Many a groaning throw: thus hulling in\n    The wild Sea of my Conscience, I did steere\n    Toward this remedy, whereupon we are\n    Now present heere together: that's to say,\n    I meant to rectifie my Conscience, which\n    I then did feele full sicke, and yet not well,\n    By all the Reuerend Fathers of the Land,\n    And Doctors learn'd. First I began in priuate,\n    With you my Lord of Lincolne; you remember\n    How vnder my oppression I did reeke\n    When I first mou'd you\n\n    B.Lin. Very well my Liedge\n\n    Kin. I haue spoke long, be pleas'd your selfe to say\n    How farre you satisfide me\n\n    Lin. So please your Highnes,\n    The question did at first so stagger me,\n    Bearing a State of mighty moment in't,\n    And consequence of dread, that I committed\n    The daringst Counsaile which I had to doubt,\n    And did entreate your Highnes to this course,\n    Which you are running heere\n\n    Kin. I then mou'd you,\n    My Lord of Canterbury, and got your leaue\n    To make this present Summons vnsolicited.\n    I left no Reuerend Person in this Court;\n    But by particular consent proceeded\n    Vnder your hands and Seales; therefore goe on,\n    For no dislike i'th' world against the person\n    Of the good Queene; but the sharpe thorny points\n    Of my alleadged reasons, driues this forward:\n    Proue but our Marriage lawfull, by my Life\n\n    And Kingly Dignity, we are contented\n    To weare our mortall State to come, with her,\n    (Katherine our Queene) before the primest Creature\n    That's Parragon'd o'th' World\n\n    Camp. So please your Highnes,\n    The Queene being absent, 'tis a needfull fitnesse,\n    That we adiourne this Court till further day;\nMeane while, must be an earnest motion\nMade to the Queene to call backe her Appeale\nShe intends vnto his Holinesse\n\nKin.

Everyone's gathered to hear the report from the Pope's rep read. Wolsey shuts everyone up so they can hear it. Henry doesn't think that's necessary, since the report has already been read, but Wolsey wants to carry on anyway. Katherine comes into the court and kneels at Henry's feet. Then she delivers a long speech about her position. Here are the highlights: 1) She's a foreigner in England, so she should be treated kindly; 2) She's been faithfully married to Henry for twenty years and has always tried to be a good wife; 3) Her dad and Henry's dad were buddies and decided their marriage was a great idea, so it must not be illegal. Wolsey won't have any of it: there are bunch of brainiacs here who have already tried to convince Henry to change his mind, so why should she try? That's just a waste of everyone's time. Unsurprisingly, Campeius agrees. So Katherine talks to Wolsey directly. She claims he's the real reason for Henry's beef with her, and she doesn't think it's fair that he's the one controlling her trial. He shouldn't have a say. \"You got a problem with me?\" asks Wolsey. He plays innocent and tells everyone he's never said anything bad about Katherine and doesn't know what her problem is. This isn't like her--is she sure she's okay? Katherine can see right through Wolsey's antics, but she's also worried about her own skill. She says she can't properly defend herself against him because he's very clever and twists things around. When Katherine tries to leave, Campeius and Henry call her back in. Katherine doesn't budge: she's not going to take this, so she won't come to any more of this sham. She leaves. Henry doesn't bother chasing after her. Instead, he compliments her, telling everyone that she is a great wife who is noble and obedient. Um, isn't the purpose of this whole thing to break up the marriage? Always thinking of himself, Wolsey asks Henry to clear his name. The queen just said that Wolsey was behind this whole thing; that's not true, and it gives Wolsey a bad rap. Henry agrees. Now it's time for a long speech from Henry. He tells everyone about his marriage and why he thinks it might be illegal. The short version: Katherine first married his bro and then got hitched to Henry after his bro died. Plus, Katherine only gave birth to girls or had miscarriages, and that's a bad sign. Once Henry thought about it, he figured it must be Heaven punishing him for getting into an illegal marriage. Yeah, that makes sense. Henry got some confirmation from his nobles, too. It's not that Henry doesn't like Katherine; it's that he worries he's not doing the right thing by being with her. Campeius declares that they have to wait until Katherine is present to make the divorce final, so they plan to get back together when she's ready. Everyone agrees, but Henry secretly tells the audience that he doesn't really trust the Roman cardinals--they play around with him, and he's not sure why. He just hopes that Cranmer, his trusty right-hand man, gets back soon so he doesn't have to deal with these clowns anymore."}

Wolsey calls for silence while the report from Rome is read, but Henry says it has already been read; there is no need to read it again. Queen Katharine kneels at Henry's feet and speaks: She asks him to have pity on her, now that she is a stranger in a foreign kingdom. She asks how she has offended Henry, what she has done to make him want to cast her off. She says she has been a true and loyal wife, always obeying him in every matter for 20 years, and had many children with him. She says she is willing to have God punish her if she has ever done anything against Henry, but she has not. She reminds him that Henry's father and her father, the king of Spain, were wise men, who conferred and agreed that their marriage was lawful. She begs the king to allow her time to receive counsel from Spain before submitting to a trial. Wolsey declares that many learned men are on hand, yet they cannot sway the king from his course, so there is no point in delaying proceedings. Campeius agrees that they should proceed. The queen then addresses Wolsey and says she believes he is her enemy, but she will not allow him to be her judge. She believes that he has caused this divorce, and she repeats that she will not let him judge her. Wolsey says that she sounds unlike herself, and she does him wrong. He claims to have nothing against her and that the case against her has been discussed by many others besides himself. He denies having stirred up trouble in the marriage, and he notes that he is speaking before the king, who he hopes will defend him against Katharine's assault. Katharine says that she is unable to defend herself against Wolsey's cunning. She accuses him of being arrogant and proud and of having gone above the power of his office to influence the king. She repeats that she will not be judged by him, and she tries to depart. Campeius and the king call her back, but she insists that she will not make an appearance during the rest of the proceeding and leaves. Henry lets her go, saying that no man has had a better wife than her. He speaks further of her noble and obedient nature. Wolsey asks the king to declare whether he has influenced him unduly with regards to Katharine, and the king consents to clear Wolsey's name, excusing him from Katharine's accusations. The king then relates how he came to doubt his marriage to Katharine. He tells how an ambassador from France came to negotiate for the hand of the king's daughter and asked if she were legitimate, which set the king thinking. He thought he must not be doing right in the eyes of heaven, since every child born to Katharine was either born dead or died soon thereafter or was a girl. Believing this was a sign that Katharine was unfit to be queen, he started the divorce process, despite his feelings for her. The king says he first spoke to some of his nobles about his plans, later asking the opinion of all his men. Therefore, it was not out of dislike for the queen that he chose to divorce her but out of a universal belief that the marriage had been unlawful. Campeius says they must adjourn until another day when the queen is present to complete the divorce. Henry notes to himself that he does not like the tricks of these cardinals, and he has no respect for Rome. He looks forward to the return of Cranmer, his trustworthy religious advisor."}

Before the proceedings begin, Katherine interrupts, appealing directly to the King for justice. She has been an impeccable wife and asks the King to explain his desire for divorce. She ends by requesting a postponement of the proceeding till she has consulted with her friends in Spain. Wolsey points out that she is well represented in England. She accuses him of being responsible for the rift that has developed her and the King. She refuses to have Wolsey as the judge of the proceedings and walk out saying that she wants the Pope to preside over the matter. The King summons her back but she refuses to return, further adding that she will never again make her appearance in the court regarding this matter. The King absolves Wolsey of the change the Queen placed on him. Cardinal Campeius says that since the Queen is not present the court should be adjourned. This is done but the King suspects that the Cardinals are not Wholly on his side. He eagerly awaits the return of Cranmer on whose unstinting help and support he can count on."}

I do professe\n   You speake not like your selfe: who euer yet\n   Haue stood to Charity, and displayd th' effects\n   Of disposition gentle, and of wisedome,\n   Ore-topping womans powre.

If he know\n   That I am free of your Report, he knowes\n   I am not of your wrong. Therefore in him\n   It lies to cure me, and the Cure is to\n   Remoue these Thoughts from you. The which before\n   His Highnesse shall speake in, I do beseech\n   You (gracious Madam) to vnthinke your speaking,\n   And to say so no more\n\n   Queen. My Lord, My Lord,\n   I am a simple woman, much too weake\n   T' oppose your cunning. Y'are meek, & humble-mouth'd\n   You signe your Place, and Calling, in full seeming,\n   With Meekenesse and Humilitie: but your Heart\n   Is cramm'd with Arrogancie, Spleene, and Pride.\n   You haue by Fortune, and his Highnesse fauors,\n   Gone slightly o're lowe steppes, and now are mounted\n   Where Powres are your Retainers, and your words\n   (Domestickes to you) serue your will, as't please\n   Your selfe pronounce their Office.

By some of these\n     The Queene is put in anger; y'are excus'd:\n     But will you be more iustifi'de? You euer\n     Haue wish'd the sleeping of this busines, neuer desir'd\n     It to be stir'd; but oft haue hindred, oft\n     The passages made toward it; on my Honour,\n     I speake my good Lord Cardnall, to this point;\nAnd thus farre cleare him.\nNow, what mou'd me too't,\n    I will be bold with time and your attention:\n    Then marke th' inducement. Thus it came; giue heede too't:\n    My Conscience first receiu'd a tendernes,\n    Scruple, and pricke, on certaine Speeches vtter'd\n    By th' Bishop of Bayon, then French Embassador,\n    Who had beene hither sent on the debating\n    And Marriage 'twixt the Duke of Orleance, and\n    Our Daughter Mary: I'th' Progresse of this busines,\n    Ere a determinate resolution, hee\n    (I meane the Bishop) did require a respite,\n    Wherein he might the King his Lord aduertise,\n    Whether our Daughter were legitimate,\n    Respecting this our Marriage with the Dowager,\n    Sometimes our Brothers Wife. This respite shooke\n    The bosome of my Conscience, enter'd me;\n    Yea, with a spitting power, and made to tremble\n    The region of my Breast, which forc'd such way,\n    That many maz'd considerings, did throng\n    And prest in with this Caution. First, me thought\n    I stood not in the smile of Heauen, who had\n    Commanded Nature, that my Ladies wombe\n    If it conceiu'd a male-child by me, should\n    Doe no more Offices of life too't; then\n    The Graue does to th' dead: For her Male Issue,\n    Or di'de where they were made, or shortly after\n    This world had ayr'd them. Hence I tooke a thought,\n    This was a Iudgement on me, that my Kingdome\n    (Well worthy the best Heyre o'th' World) should not\n    Be gladded in't by me. Then followes, that\n    I weigh'd the danger which my Realmes stood in\n    By this my Issues faile, and that gaue to me\n    Many a groaning throw: thus hulling in\n    The wild Sea of my Conscience, I did steere\n    Toward this remedy, whereupon we are\n    Now present heere together: that's to say,\n    I meant to rectifie my Conscience, which\n    I then did feele full sicke, and yet not well,\n    By all the Reuerend Fathers of the Land,\n    And Doctors learn'd. First I began in priuate,\n    With you my Lord of Lincolne; you remember\n    How vnder my oppression I did reeke\n    When I first mou'd you\n\n    B.Lin. Very well my Liedge\n\n    Kin. I haue spoke long, be pleas'd your selfe to say\n    How farre you satisfide me\n\n    Lin. So please your Highnes,\n    The question did at first so stagger me,\n    Bearing a State of mighty moment in't,\n    And consequence of dread, that I committed\n    The daringst Counsaile which I had to doubt,\n    And did entreate your Highnes to this course,\n    Which you are running heere\n\n    Kin. I then mou'd you,\n    My Lord of Canterbury, and got your leaue\n    To make this present Summons vnsolicited.\n    I left no Reuerend Person in this Court;\n    But by particular consent proceeded\n    Vnder your hands and Seales; therefore goe on,\n    For no dislike i'th' world against the person\n    Of the good Queene; but the sharpe thorny points\n    Of my alleadged reasons, driues this forward:\n    Proue but our Marriage lawfull, by my Life\n\n    And Kingly Dignity, we are contented\n    To weare our mortall State to come, with her,\n    (Katherine our Queene) before the primest Creature\n    That's Parragon'd o'th' World\n\n    Camp. So please your Highnes,\n    The Queene being absent, 'tis a needfull fitnesse,\n    That we adiourne this Court till further day;\nMeane while, must be an earnest motion\nMade to the Queene to call backe her Appeale\nShe intends vnto his Holinesse\n\nKin. I may perceiue\nThese Cardinals trifle with me: I abhorre\nThis dilatory sloth, and trickes of Rome.\nMy learn'\n\n### Summary:\n\n", "answer": "At Blackfriars, various bishops and officials have convened to decide the question of the king's marriage to Katherine. Wolsey asks for the decision from Rome to be read out, but the king says there is no need as it has already been read, and there is no need to do it again. Katherine goes directly to the king and kneels at his feet. She asks for justice and pity, as she is a woman and a foreigner and therefore fears that there is no impartial judge in England. She asks the king how she has offended him, as she has been a true and obedient wife to him. She has been married to him for twenty years, and they have had many children together. If anyone can prove that she has been unfaithful or has failed in her love and duty to the king, then she accepts that she should be turned away. She adds that Henry's father and her father were wise men and judged their marriage to be lawful. She asks that any decision be delayed until she can seek advice from friends in Spain. The king does not answer her, but Wolsey tells her that many learned men have come to plead her cause and that delay would be pointless and unsettling to her and the king. Campeius agrees that the proceedings should go ahead immediately. Then Katherine addresses Wolsey, telling him that she believes him to be her enemy and so she does not want him to be her judge. She says that he is responsible for stirring up trouble between her and the king. Wolsey says that her comments are out of character for her, as she is known for her gentleness and charity. He denies that he is her enemy and claims that he only acted under the authority of Rome. He also denies that he is responsible for the king's doubts about his marriage, and he hopes that the king will back him up in this. Katherine says she is a simple woman and unfitted to oppose Wolsey's cunning. She says that though Wolsey pretends to be humble, he is full of pride and has risen so far above his office  that many who used to be powerful now act as his servants. She tells him that he cares more about his own status than his spiritual calling. She repeats that she refuses to let him judge her, curtsies to the king, and tries to leave. The king orders that she be brought back into court, but she insists that she will never again appear in court to discuss this matter, and leaves. The king allows her to go, and reflects that no man had a better wife. He praises her nobility and obedience. Wolsey asks the king whether he had, as Katherine alleged, induced the king to doubt his marriage. The king excuses Wolsey from Katherine's accusations and goes on to explain how he came to doubt the legality of his marriage. The French ambassador, the Bishop of Bayonne, had come to negotiate a marriage between Mary, the daughter of King Henry and Katherine, and the Duke of Orleans. The ambassador had asked whether Mary were legitimate, given that Katherine had previously been married to Henry's brother . The question had awakened doubts in the king. He had reflected that Katherine had given birth to sons, but they had been born dead or died shortly afterwards. He felt that this was a judgment on him for contracting a marriage that was unlawful in God's eyes. He then thought about the danger to his kingdom if it were left without an heir. After a great struggle, his conscience had driven him to the solution of divorcing Katherine. The king had then consulted with the Bishop of Lincoln, whom he now asks to speak. The Bishop of Lincoln confirms that he advised the king to divorce Katherine. The king says he had asked the Archbishop of Canterbury for permission to decide the case in court, which the Archbishop had granted. The king insists that it is not out of dislike for Katherine that he has come to this, but out of conscience. If his marriage were proven lawful, he would be happy to remain married to her. Campeius says that the court must adjourn until Katherine can be persuaded to return. He also says that Katherine must not appeal to the Pope. The king suspects that the cardinals are just using delaying tactics. He looks forward to the return of Bishop Cranmer, his trusted advisor. The court breaks up."}

This sessions, to our great grief we pronounce,\n    Even pushes 'gainst our heart- the party tried,\n    The daughter of a king, our wife, and one\n    Of us too much belov'd. Let us be clear'd\n    Of being tyrannous, since we so openly\n    Proceed in justice, which shall have due course,\n    Even to the guilt or the purgation.\n    Produce the prisoner.\n  OFFICER. It is his Highness' pleasure that the Queen\n    Appear in person here in court.\n\n         Enter HERMIONE, as to her trial, PAULINA, and LADIES\n\n    Silence!\n  LEONTES. Read the indictment.\n  OFFICER.  [Reads]  'Hermione, Queen to the worthy Leontes, King\nof\n    Sicilia, thou art here accused and arraigned of high treason,\nin\n    committing adultery with Polixenes, King of Bohemia; and\n    conspiring with Camillo to take away the life of our\nsovereign\n    lord the King, thy royal husband: the pretence whereof being\nby\n    circumstances partly laid open, thou, Hermione, contrary to\nthe\n    faith and allegiance of true subject, didst counsel and aid\nthem,\n    for their better safety, to fly away by night.'\n  HERMIONE. Since what I am to say must be but that\n    Which contradicts my accusation, and\n    The testimony on my part no other\n    But what comes from myself, it shall scarce boot me\n    To say 'Not guilty.' Mine integrity\n    Being counted falsehood shall, as I express it,\n    Be so receiv'd. But thus- if pow'rs divine\n    Behold our human actions, as they do,\n    I doubt not then but innocence shall make\n    False accusation blush, and tyranny\n    Tremble at patience. You, my lord, best know-\n    Who least will seem to do so- my past life\n    Hath been as continent, as chaste, as true,\n    As I am now unhappy; which is more\n    Than history can pattern, though devis'd\n    And play'd to take spectators; for behold me-\n    A fellow of the royal bed, which owe\n    A moiety of the throne, a great king's daughter,\n    The mother to a hopeful prince- here standing\n    To prate and talk for life and honour fore\n    Who please to come and hear. For life, I prize it\n    As I weigh grief, which I would spare; for honour,\n    'Tis a derivative from me to mine,\n    And only that I stand for. I appeal\n    To your own conscience, sir, before Polixenes\n    Came to your court, how I was in your grace,\n    How merited to be so; since he came,\n    With what encounter so uncurrent I\n    Have strain'd t' appear thus; if one jot beyond\n    The bound of honour, or in act or will\n    That way inclining, hard'ned be the hearts\n    Of all that hear me, and my near'st of kin\n    Cry fie upon my grave!\n  LEONTES. I ne'er heard yet\n    That any of these bolder vices wanted\n    Less impudence to gainsay what they did\n    Than to perform it first.\n  HERMIONE. That's true enough;\n    Though 'tis a saying, sir, not due to me.\n  LEONTES. You will not own it.\n  HERMIONE. More than mistress of\n    Which comes to me in name of fault, I must not\n    At all acknowledge. For Polixenes,\n    With whom I am accus'd, I do confess\n    I lov'd him as in honour he requir'd;\n    With such a kind of love as might become\n    A lady like me; with a love even such,\n    So and no other, as yourself commanded;\n    Which not to have done, I think had been in me\n    Both disobedience and ingratitude\n    To you and toward your friend; whose love had spoke,\n    Ever since it could speak, from an infant, freely,\n    That it was yours. Now for conspiracy:\n    I know not how it tastes, though it be dish'd\n    For me to try how; all I know of it\n    Is that Camillo was an honest man;\n    And why he left your court, the gods themselves,\n    Wotting no more than I, are ignorant.\n  LEONTES. You knew of his departure, as you know\n    What you have underta'en to do in's absence.\n  HERMIONE. Sir,\n    You speak a language that I understand not.\n    My life stands in the level of your dreams,\n    Which I'll lay down.\n  LEONTES. Your actions are my dreams.\n    You had a bastard by Polixenes,\n    And I but dream'd it. As you were past all shame-\n    Those of your fact are so- so past all truth;\n    Which to deny concerns more than avails; for as\n    Thy brat hath been cast out, like to itself,\n    No father owning it- which is indeed\n    More criminal in thee than it- so thou\n    Shalt feel our justice; in whose easiest passage\n    Look for no less than death.\n  HERMIONE. Sir, spare your threats.\n    The bug which you would fright me with I seek.\n    To me can life be no commodity.\n    The crown and comfort of my life, your favour,\n    I do give lost, for I do feel it gone,\n    But know not how it went; my second joy\n    And first fruits of my body, from his presence\n    I am barr'd, like one infectious; my third comfort,\n    Starr'd most unluckily, is from my breast-\n    The innocent milk in it most innocent mouth-\n    Hal'd out to murder; myself on every post\n    Proclaim'd a strumpet; with immodest hatred\n    The child-bed privilege denied, which 'longs\n    To women of all fashion; lastly, hurried\n    Here to this place, i' th' open air, before\n    I have got strength of limit. Now, my liege,\n    Tell me what blessings I have here alive\n    That I should fear to die. Therefore proceed.\n    But yet hear this- mistake me not: no life,\n    I prize it not a straw, but for mine honour\n    Which I would free- if I shall be condemn'd\n    Upon surmises, all proofs sleeping else\n    But what your jealousies awake, I tell you\n    'Tis rigour, and not law. Your honours all,\n    I do refer me to the oracle:\n    Apollo be my judge!\n  FIRST LORD. This your request\n    Is altogether just. Therefore, bring forth,\n    And in Apollo's name, his oracle.\n                                         Exeunt certain OFFICERS\n  HERMIONE.

All this we swear.\n  LEONTES. Break up the seals and read.\n  OFFICER.

Now blessed be the great Apollo!\n  HERMIONE. Praised!\n  LEONTES. Hast thou read truth?\n  OFFICER. Ay, my lord; even so\n    As it is here set down.\n  LEONTES. There is no truth at all i' th' oracle.\n    The sessions shall proceed. This is mere falsehood.\n\n                        Enter a SERVANT\n\n  SERVANT. My lord the King, the King!\n  LEONTES.

He, most humane\n    And fill'd with honour, to my kingly guest\n    Unclasp'd my practice, quit his fortunes here,\n    Which you knew great, and to the certain hazard\n    Of all incertainties himself commended,\n    No richer than his honour. How he glisters\n    Thorough my rust! And how his piety\n    Does my deeds make the blacker!\n\n                      Re-enter PAULINA\n\n  PAULINA. Woe the while!\n    O, cut my lace, lest my heart, cracking it,\n    Break too!\n  FIRST LORD. What fit is this, good lady?\n  PAULINA. What studied torments, tyrant, hast for me?\n    What wheels, racks, fires? what flaying, boiling\n    In leads or oils? What old or newer torture\n    Must I receive, whose every word deserves\n    To taste of thy most worst? Thy tyranny\n    Together working with thy jealousies,\n    Fancies too weak for boys, too green and idle\n    For girls of nine- O, think what they have done,\n    And then run mad indeed, stark mad; for all\n    Thy by-gone fooleries were but spices of it.\n    That thou betray'dst Polixenes, 'twas nothing;\n    That did but show thee, of a fool, inconstant,\n    And damnable ingrateful. Nor was't much\n    Thou wouldst have poison'd good Camillo's honour,\n    To have him kill a king- poor trespasses,\n    More monstrous standing by; whereof I reckon\n    The casting forth to crows thy baby daughter\n    To be or none or little, though a devil\n    Would have shed water out of fire ere done't;\n    Nor is't directly laid to thee, the death\n    Of the young Prince, whose honourable thoughts-\n    Thoughts high for one so tender- cleft the heart\n    That could conceive a gross and foolish sire\n    Blemish'd his gracious dam. This is not, no,\n    Laid to thy answer; but the last- O lords,\n    When I have said, cry 'Woe!'- the Queen, the Queen,\n    The sweet'st, dear'st creature's dead; and vengeance\n    For't not dropp'd down yet.\n  FIRST LORD. The higher pow'rs forbid!\n  PAULINA. I say she's dead; I'll swear't. If word nor oath\n    Prevail not, go and see. If you can bring\n    Tincture or lustre in her lip, her eye,\n    Heat outwardly or breath within, I'll serve you\n    As I would do the gods. But, O thou tyrant!\n    Do not repent these things, for they are heavier\n    Than all thy woes can stir; therefore betake thee\n    To nothing but despair.

Meanwhile, Leontes convenes a court, with himself as judge, in order to give his wife a fair trial. She is brought from the prison to appear before him, and the indictment, charging her with adultery and conspiracy in the escape of Polixenes and Camillo, is read to the entire court. Hermione defends herself eloquently, saying: that she loved the Bohemian king \"as in honor he required\", but no more, certainly not in a sexual fashion; that she is ignorant of any conspiracy; and that Camillo is an honest man. Leontes, paying little heed to her words, declares that she is guilty, and that her punishment must be death. Hermione laughs bitterly at this and says that given her sufferings so far, death would be a blessed release. At this juncture, the two lords arrive with the Oracle's message. It is unsealed and read aloud--\"Hermione is chaste,\" it reports, \"Polixenes blameless, Camillo a true subject, Leontes a jealous tyrant, his innocent babe truly begotten, and the king shall live without an heir if that which is lost be not found\". The courtiers rejoice, while Leontes refuses to believe it; at that moment, however, a servant rushes in with word that Mamillius has died, and the enormity of the king's mistake suddenly comes crashing down on him. Hermione faints, and she is quickly carried away by her ladies and Paulina, who are frantically attempting to revive her. Leontes, now grief-stricken, pours curses upon his own head, and Paulina re-enters and tells him that Hermione, too, has died, and that he has murdered her. One of the lords rebukes her, but Leontes accepts her accusation as no more than his due. Ordering a single grave for the body of his wife and son, he pledges to spend the rest of his life doing penance for his sin."}

AMY'S VALLEY OF HUMILIATION.\n\n\n                      \n\n\n                      [Illustration: The Cyclops]\n\n\"That boy is a perfect Cyclops, isn't he?\" said Amy, one day, as Laurie\nclattered by on horseback, with a flourish of his whip as he passed.\n\n\"How dare you say so, when he's got both his eyes? and very handsome\nones they are, too,\" cried Jo, who resented any slighting remarks about\nher friend.\n\n\"I didn't say anything about his eyes, and I don't see why you need fire\nup when I admire his riding.\"\n\n\"Oh, my goodness! that little goose means a centaur, and she called him\na Cyclops,\" exclaimed Jo, with a burst of laughter.\n\n\"You needn't be so rude; it's only a 'lapse of lingy,' as Mr. Davis\nsays,\" retorted Amy, finishing Jo with her Latin. \"I just wish I had a\nlittle of the money Laurie spends on that horse,\" she added, as if to\nherself, yet hoping her sisters would hear.\n\n\"Why?\" asked Meg kindly, for Jo had gone off in another laugh at Amy's\nsecond blunder.\n\n\"I need it so much; I'm dreadfully in debt, and it won't be my turn to\nhave the rag-money for a month.\"\n\n\"In debt, Amy? What do you mean?\" and Meg looked sober.\n\n\"Why, I owe at least a dozen pickled limes, and I can't pay them, you\nknow, till I have money, for Marmee forbade my having anything charged\nat the shop.\"\n\n\"Tell me all about it. Are limes the fashion now? It used to be pricking\nbits of rubber to make balls;\" and Meg tried to keep her countenance,\nAmy looked so grave and important.\n\n\"Why, you see, the girls are always buying them, and unless you want to\nbe thought mean, you must do it, too. It's nothing but limes now, for\nevery one is sucking them in their desks in school-time, and trading\nthem off for pencils, bead-rings, paper dolls, or something else, at\nrecess. If one girl likes another, she gives her a lime; if she's mad\nwith her, she eats one before her face, and don't offer even a suck.\nThey treat by turns; and I've had ever so many, but haven't returned\nthem; and I ought, for they are debts of honor, you know.\"\n\n\"How much will pay them off, and restore your credit?\" asked Meg, taking\nout her purse.\n\n\"A quarter would more than do it, and leave a few cents over for a treat\nfor you. Don't you like limes?\"\n\n\"Not much; you may have my share. Here's the money. Make it last as long\nas you can, for it isn't very plenty, you know.\"\n\n\"Oh, thank you! It must be so nice to have pocket-money! I'll have a\ngrand feast, for I haven't tasted a lime this week. I felt delicate\nabout taking any, as I couldn't return them, and I'm actually suffering\nfor one.\"\n\nNext day Amy was rather late at school; but could not resist the\ntemptation of displaying, with pardonable pride, a moist brown-paper\nparcel, before she consigned it to the inmost recesses of her desk.\nDuring the next few minutes the rumor that Amy March had got twenty-four\ndelicious limes (she ate one on the way), and was going to treat,\ncirculated through her \"set,\" and the attentions of her friends became\nquite overwhelming. Katy Brown invited her to her next party on the\nspot; Mary Kingsley insisted on lending her her watch till recess; and\nJenny Snow, a satirical young lady, who had basely twitted Amy upon her\nlimeless state, promptly buried the hatchet, and offered to furnish\nanswers to certain appalling sums. But Amy had not forgotten Miss Snow's\ncutting remarks about \"some persons whose noses were not too flat to\nsmell other people's limes, and stuck-up people, who were not too proud\nto ask for them;\" and she instantly crushed \"that Snow girl's\" hopes by\nthe withering telegram, \"You needn't be so polite all of a sudden, for\nyou won't get any.\"\n\nA distinguished personage happened to visit the school that morning, and\nAmy's beautifully drawn maps received praise, which honor to her foe\nrankled in the soul of Miss Snow, and caused Miss March to assume the\nairs of a studious young peacock. But, alas, alas! pride goes before a\nfall, and the revengeful Snow turned the tables with disastrous success.\nNo sooner had the guest paid the usual stale compliments, and bowed\nhimself out, than Jenny, under pretence of asking an important question,\ninformed Mr. Davis, the teacher, that Amy March had pickled limes in her\ndesk.\n\nNow Mr. Davis had declared limes a contraband article, and solemnly\nvowed to publicly ferrule the first person who was found breaking the\nlaw. This much-enduring man had succeeded in banishing chewing-gum after\na long and stormy war, had made a bonfire of the confiscated novels and\nnewspapers, had suppressed a private post-office, had forbidden\ndistortions of the face, nicknames, and caricatures, and done all that\none man could do to keep half a hundred rebellious girls in order. Boys\nare trying enough to human patience, goodness knows! but girls are\ninfinitely more so, especially to nervous gentlemen, with tyrannical\ntempers, and no more talent for teaching than Dr. Blimber. Mr. Davis\nknew any quantity of Greek, Latin, Algebra, and ologies of all sorts, so\nhe was called a fine teacher; and manners, morals, feelings, and\nexamples were not considered of any particular importance. It was a most\nunfortunate moment for denouncing Amy, and Jenny knew it. Mr. Davis had\nevidently taken his coffee too strong that morning; there was an east\nwind, which always affected his neuralgia; and his pupils had not done\nhim the credit which he felt he deserved: therefore, to use the\nexpressive, if not elegant, language of a school-girl, \"he was as\nnervous as a witch and as cross as a bear.\" The word \"limes\" was like\nfire to powder; his yellow face flushed, and he rapped on his desk with\nan energy which made Jenny skip to her seat with unusual rapidity.\n\n\"Young ladies, attention, if you please!\"\n\nAt the stern order the buzz ceased, and fifty pairs of blue, black,\ngray, and brown eyes were obediently fixed upon his awful countenance.\n\n\"Miss March, come to the desk.\"\n\nAmy rose to comply with outward composure, but a secret fear oppressed\nher, for the limes weighed upon her conscience.\n\n\"Bring with you the limes you have in your desk,\" was the unexpected\ncommand which arrested her before she got out of her seat.\n\n\"Don't take all,\" whispered her neighbor, a young lady of great presence\nof mind.\n\nAmy hastily shook out half a dozen, and laid the rest down before Mr.\nDavis, feeling that any man possessing a human heart would relent when\nthat delicious perfume met his nose. Unfortunately, Mr. Davis\nparticularly detested the odor of the fashionable pickle, and disgust\nadded to his wrath.\n\n\"Is that all?\"\n\n\"Not quite,\" stammered Amy.\n\n\"Bring the rest immediately.\"\n\nWith a despairing glance at her set, she obeyed.\n\n\"You are sure there are no more?\"\n\n\"I never lie, sir.\"\n\n\"So I see. Now take these disgusting things two by two, and throw them\nout of the window.\"\n\nThere was a simultaneous sigh, which created quite a little gust, as the\nlast hope fled, and the treat was ravished from their longing lips.\nScarlet with shame and anger, Amy went to and fro six dreadful times;\nand as each doomed couple--looking oh! so plump and juicy--fell from her\nreluctant hands, a shout from the street completed the anguish of the\ngirls, for it told them that their feast was being exulted over by the\nlittle Irish children, who were their sworn foes. This--this was too\nmuch; all flashed indignant or appealing glances at the inexorable\nDavis, and one passionate lime-lover burst into tears.\n\nAs Amy returned from her last trip, Mr. Davis gave a portentous \"Hem!\"\nand said, in his most impressive manner,--\n\n\"Young ladies, you remember what I said to you a week ago. I am sorry\nthis has happened, but I never allow my rules to be infringed, and I\n_never_ break my word. Miss March, hold out your hand.\"\n\nAmy started, and put both hands behind her, turning on him an imploring\nlook which pleaded for her better than the words she could not utter.\nShe was rather a favorite with \"old Davis,\" as, of course, he was\ncalled, and it's my private belief that he _would_ have broken his word\nif the indignation of one irrepressible young lady had not found vent in\na hiss. That hiss, faint as it was, irritated the irascible gentleman,\nand sealed the culprit's fate.\n\n\"Your hand, Miss March!\" was the only answer her mute appeal received;\nand, too proud to cry or beseech, Amy set her teeth, threw back her\nhead defiantly, and bore without flinching several tingling blows on her\nlittle palm. They were neither many nor heavy, but that made no\ndifference to her. For the first time in her life she had been struck;\nand the disgrace, in her eyes, was as deep as if he had knocked her\ndown.\n\n   [Illustration: Amy bore without flinching several tingling blows]\n\n\"You will now stand on the platform till recess,\" said Mr. Davis,\nresolved to do the thing thoroughly, since he had begun.\n\nThat was dreadful. It would have been bad enough to go to her seat, and\nsee the pitying faces of her friends, or the satisfied ones of her few\nenemies; but to face the whole school, with that shame fresh upon her,\nseemed impossible, and for a second she felt as if she could only drop\ndown where she stood, and break her heart with crying. A bitter sense of\nwrong, and the thought of Jenny Snow, helped her to bear it; and, taking\nthe ignominious place, she fixed her eyes on the stove-funnel above what\nnow seemed a sea of faces, and stood there, so motionless and white that\nthe girls found it very hard to study, with that pathetic figure before\nthem.\n\nDuring the fifteen minutes that followed, the proud and sensitive little\ngirl suffered a shame and pain which she never forgot. To others it\nmight seem a ludicrous or trivial affair, but to her it was a hard\nexperience; for during the twelve years of her life she had been\ngoverned by love alone, and a blow of that sort had never touched her\nbefore. The smart of her hand and the ache of her heart were forgotten\nin the sting of the thought,--\n\n\"I shall have to tell at home, and they will be so disappointed in me!\"\n\nThe fifteen minutes seemed an hour; but they came to an end at last, and\nthe word \"Recess!\" had never seemed so welcome to her before.\n\n\"You can go, Miss March,\" said Mr. Davis, looking, as he felt,\nuncomfortable.\n\nHe did not soon forget the reproachful glance Amy gave him, as she went,\nwithout a word to any one, straight into the ante-room, snatched her\nthings, and left the place \"forever,\" as she passionately declared to\nherself. She was in a sad state when she got home; and when the older\ngirls arrived, some time later, an indignation meeting was held at\nonce. Mrs. March did not say much, but looked disturbed, and comforted\nher afflicted little daughter in her tenderest manner. Meg bathed the\ninsulted hand with glycerine and tears; Beth felt that even her beloved\nkittens would fail as a balm for griefs like this; Jo wrathfully\nproposed that Mr. Davis be arrested without delay; and Hannah shook her\nfist at the \"villain,\" and pounded potatoes for dinner as if she had him\nunder her pestle.\n\nNo notice was taken of Amy's flight, except by her mates; but the\nsharp-eyed demoiselles discovered that Mr. Davis was quite benignant in\nthe afternoon, also unusually nervous. Just before school closed, Jo\nappeared, wearing a grim expression, as she stalked up to the desk, and\ndelivered a letter from her mother; then collected Amy's property, and\ndeparted, carefully scraping the mud from her boots on the door-mat, as\nif she shook the dust of the place off her feet.\n\n\"Yes, you can have a vacation from school, but I want you to study a\nlittle every day, with Beth,\" said Mrs. March, that evening. \"I don't\napprove of corporal punishment, especially for girls. I dislike Mr.\nDavis's manner of teaching, and don't think the girls you associate with\nare doing you any good, so I shall ask your father's advice before I\nsend you anywhere else.\"\n\n\"That's good! I wish all the girls would leave, and spoil his old\nschool. It's perfectly maddening to think of those lovely limes,\" sighed\nAmy, with the air of a martyr.\n\n\"I am not sorry you lost them, for you broke the rules, and deserved\nsome punishment for disobedience,\" was the severe reply, which rather\ndisappointed the young lady, who expected nothing but sympathy.\n\n\"Do you mean you are glad I was disgraced before the whole school?\"\ncried Amy.\n\n\"I should not have chosen that way of mending a fault,\" replied her\nmother; \"but I'm not sure that it won't do you more good than a milder\nmethod. You are getting to be rather conceited, my dear, and it is quite\ntime you set about correcting it. You have a good many little gifts and\nvirtues, but there is no need of parading them, for conceit spoils the\nfinest genius. There is not much danger that real talent or goodness\nwill be overlooked long; even if it is, the consciousness of possessing\nand using it well should satisfy one, and the great charm of all power\nis modesty.\"\n\n\"So it is!\" cried Laurie, who was playing chess in a corner with Jo. \"I\nknew a girl, once, who had a really remarkable talent for music, and she\ndidn't know it; never guessed what sweet little things she composed when\nshe was alone, and wouldn't have believed it if any one had told her.\"\n\n\"I wish I'd known that nice girl; maybe she would have helped me, I'm so\nstupid,\" said Beth, who stood beside him, listening eagerly.\n\n\"You do know her, and she helps you better than any one else could,\"\nanswered Laurie, looking at her with such mischievous meaning in his\nmerry black eyes, that Beth suddenly turned very red, and hid her face\nin the sofa-cushion, quite overcome by such an unexpected discovery.\n\n                    [Illustration: You do know her]\n\nJo let Laurie win the game, to pay for that praise of her Beth, who\ncould not be prevailed upon to play for them after her compliment. So\nLaurie did his best, and sung delightfully, being in a particularly\nlively humor, for to the Marches he seldom showed the moody side of his\ncharacter. When he was gone, Amy, who had been pensive all the evening,\nsaid suddenly, as if busy over some new idea,--\n\n\"Is Laurie an accomplished boy?\"\n\n\"Yes; he has had an excellent education, and has much talent; he will\nmake a fine man, if not spoilt by petting,\" replied her mother.\n\n\"And he isn't conceited, is he?\" asked Amy.\n\n\"Not in the least; that is why he is so charming, and we all like him so\nmuch.\"\n\n\"I see; it's nice to have accomplishments, and be elegant; but not to\nshow off, or get perked up\n\n### Summary:\n\n", "answer": "Amy's Valley of Humiliation Amy sighs for money, wishing she could buy pickled limes to treat her friends at school.

Meg bathed the\ninsulted hand with glycerine and tears; Beth felt that even her beloved\nkittens would fail as a balm for griefs like this; Jo wrathfully\nproposed that Mr. Davis be arrested without delay; and Hannah shook her\nfist at the \"villain,\" and pounded potatoes for dinner as if she had him\nunder her pestle.\n\nNo notice was taken of Amy's flight, except by her mates; but the\nsharp-eyed demoiselles discovered that Mr. Davis was quite benignant in\nthe afternoon, also unusually nervous. Just before school closed, Jo\nappeared, wearing a grim expression, as she stalked up to the desk, and\ndelivered a letter from her mother; then collected Amy's property, and\ndeparted, carefully scraping the mud from her boots on the door-mat, as\nif she shook the dust of the place off her feet.\n\n\"Yes, you can have a vacation from school, but I want you to study a\nlittle every day, with Beth,\" said Mrs. March, that evening. \"I don't\napprove of corporal punishment, especially for girls. I dislike Mr.\nDavis's manner of teaching, and don't think the girls you associate with\nare doing you any good, so I shall ask your father's advice before I\nsend you anywhere else.\"\n\n\"That's good! I wish all the girls would leave, and spoil his old\nschool. It's perfectly maddening to think of those lovely limes,\" sighed\nAmy, with the air of a martyr.\n\n\"I am not sorry you lost them, for you broke the rules, and deserved\nsome punishment for disobedience,\" was the severe reply, which rather\ndisappointed the young lady, who expected nothing but sympathy.\n\n\"Do you mean you are glad I was disgraced before the whole school?\"\ncried Amy.\n\n\"I should not have chosen that way of mending a fault,\" replied her\nmother; \"but I'm not sure that it won't do you more good than a milder\nmethod. You are getting to be rather conceited, my dear, and it is quite\ntime you set about correcting it. You have a good many little gifts and\nvirtues, but there is no need of parading them, for conceit spoils the\nfinest genius. There is not much danger that real talent or goodness\nwill be overlooked long; even if it is, the consciousness of possessing\nand using it well should satisfy one, and the great charm of all power\nis modesty.\"\n\n\"So it is!\" cried Laurie, who was playing chess in a corner with Jo. \"I\nknew a girl, once, who had a really remarkable talent for music, and she\ndidn't know it; never guessed what sweet little things she composed when\nshe was alone, and wouldn't have believed it if any one had told her.\"\n\n\"I wish I'd known that nice girl; maybe she would have helped me, I'm so\nstupid,\" said Beth, who stood beside him, listening eagerly.\n\n\"You do know her, and she helps you better than any one else could,\"\nanswered Laurie, looking at her with such mischievous meaning in his\nmerry black eyes, that Beth suddenly turned very red, and hid her face\nin the sofa-cushion, quite overcome by such an unexpected discovery.\n\n                    [Illustration: You do know her]\n\nJo let Laurie win the game, to pay for that praise of her Beth, who\ncould not be prevailed upon to play for them after her compliment. So\nLaurie did his best, and sung delightfully, being in a particularly\nlively humor, for to the Marches he seldom showed the moody side of his\ncharacter. When he was gone, Amy, who had been pensive all the evening,\nsaid suddenly, as if busy over some new idea,--\n\n\"Is Laurie an accomplished boy?\"\n\n\"Yes; he has had an excellent education, and has much talent; he will\nmake a fine man, if not spoilt by petting,\" replied her mother.\n\n\"And he isn't conceited, is he?\" asked Amy.\n\n\"Not in the least; that is why he is so charming, and we all like him so\nmuch.\"\n\n\"I see; it's nice to have accomplishments, and be elegant; but not to\nshow off, or get perked up\n\n### Summary:\n\n", "answer": "The March girls are sitting at home together when Laurie rides by on horseback. Amy admires his horsemanship, and also his wealth. She says that she desperately needs money. Meg and Jo laugh at Amy and ask why she needs money so badly. Amy explains that it is fashionable at school for girls to buy pickled limes and share them with each other. Amy has had a lot of pickled limes from other girls, but she can't return the favor, and the other girls have said that she can't have any more until she takes her turn providing them. Meg takes pity on Amy and gives her a quarter - the family's \"rag money\" for the month. The next day, Amy comes to school with a brown paper bag of 24 pickled limes. She shows them off before lessons start and all the girls want to be her friend. But one girl, Jenny Snow, was rude to Amy before, and Amy tells her she's not going to get one. The class begins. An important person visits the school and compliments Amy's hand-drawn maps. This sends Jenny Snow over the edge, and she tattles on Amy for having limes in her desk. Unfortunately, Amy's teacher, Mr. Davis, hates pickled limes and has banned them at school. He calls Amy up front, humiliates her, and makes her throw the limes out of the window. He strikes her across the hand several times with a yardstick and then makes her stand at the front of the room until recess. When recess finally comes, Amy takes her things and goes straight home. Her sisters, along with their servant Hannah, are outraged at the way she has been treated. Her mother is angry but doesn't say much. Just before the school day ends, Jo takes a note to Mr. Davis. In the note, Mrs. March informs Mr. Davis that Amy is being withdrawn from the school. Mrs. March tells Amy that she is going to be home-schooled from now on. Amy feels vindicated, but then her mother reminds her that it was still wrong for her to break the rules and take limes to school. Mrs. March tells Amy that she needs to be less selfish and conceited. Laurie, who is playing a board game with Jo in the background, uses this as an opportunity to pay a compliment to shy Beth. As a reward, Jo lets him win the game. When Laurie leaves, Amy asks her mother if he is accomplished. Her mother says that he is, and that he's liked because he has a lot of accomplishments, but he is polite and doesn't show off. Amy takes this lesson to heart."}

The Discovery of OZ, The Terrible.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe four travellers walked up to the great gate of the Emerald City\nand rang the bell. After ringing several times it was opened by the\nsame Guardian of the Gate they had met before.\n\n\"What! are you back again?\" he asked, in surprise.\n\n\"Do you not see us?\" answered the Scarecrow.\n\n\"But I thought you had gone to visit the Wicked Witch of the West.\"\n\n\"We did visit her,\" said the Scarecrow.\n\n\"And she let you go again?\" asked the man, in wonder.\n\n\"She could not help it, for she is melted,\" explained the Scarecrow.\n\n\"Melted! Well, that is good news, indeed,\" said the man. \"Who melted\nher?\"\n\n\"It was Dorothy,\" said the Lion, gravely.\n\n\"Good gracious!\" exclaimed the man, and he bowed very low indeed\nbefore her.\n\nThen he led them into his little room and locked the spectacles\nfrom the great box on all their eyes, just as he had done before.\nAfterward they passed on through the gate into the Emerald City, and\nwhen the people heard from the Guardian of the Gate that they had\nmelted the Wicked Witch of the West they all gathered around the\ntravellers and followed them in a great crowd to the Palace of Oz.\n\nThe soldier with the green whiskers was still on guard before the\ndoor, but he let them in at once and they were again met by the\nbeautiful green girl, who showed each of them to their old rooms at\nonce, so they might rest until the Great Oz was ready to receive them.\n\nThe soldier had the news carried straight to Oz that Dorothy and the\nother travellers had come back again, after destroying the Wicked\nWitch; but Oz made no reply. They thought the Great Wizard would send\nfor them at once, but he did not. They had no word from him the next\nday, nor the next, nor the next. The waiting was tiresome and wearing,\nand at last they grew vexed that Oz should treat them in so poor a\nfashion, after sending them to undergo hardships and slavery. So the\nScarecrow at last asked the green girl to take another message to Oz,\nsaying if he did not let them in to see him at once they would call the\nWinged Monkeys to help them, and find out whether he kept his promises\nor not. When the Wizard was given this message he was so frightened\nthat he sent word for them to come to the Throne Room at four minutes\nafter nine o'clock the next morning. He had once met the Winged Monkeys\nin the Land of the West, and he did not wish to meet them again.\n\nThe four travellers passed a sleepless night, each thinking of the\ngift Oz had promised to bestow upon him. Dorothy fell asleep only\nonce, and then she dreamed she was in Kansas, where Aunt Em was\ntelling her how glad she was to have her little girl at home again.\n\nPromptly at nine o'clock the next morning the green whiskered soldier\ncame to them, and four minutes later they all went into the Throne\nRoom of the Great Oz.\n\nOf course each one of them expected to see the Wizard in the shape\nhe had taken before, and all were greatly surprised when they looked\nabout and saw no one at all in the room. They kept close to the door\nand closer to one another, for the stillness of the empty room was\nmore dreadful than any of the forms they had seen Oz take.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nPresently they heard a Voice, seeming to come from somewhere near\nthe top of the great dome, and it said, solemnly.\n\n\"I am Oz, the Great and Terrible. Why do you seek me?\"\n\nThey looked again in every part of the room, and then, seeing no one,\nDorothy asked,\n\n\"Where are you?\"\n\n\"I am everywhere,\" answered the Voice, \"but to the eyes of common\nmortals I am invisible. I will now seat myself upon my throne, that\nyou may converse with me.\" Indeed, the Voice seemed just then to come\nstraight from the throne itself; so they walked toward it and stood\nin a row while Dorothy said:\n\n\"We have come to claim our promise, O Oz.\"\n\n\"What promise?\" asked Oz.\n\n\"You promised to send me back to Kansas when the Wicked Witch was\ndestroyed,\" said the girl.\n\n\"And you promised to give me brains,\" said the Scarecrow.\n\n\"And you promised to give me a heart,\" said the Tin Woodman.\n\n\"And you promised to give me courage,\" said the Cowardly Lion.\n\n\"Is the Wicked Witch really destroyed?\" asked the Voice, and Dorothy\nthought it trembled a little.\n\n\"Yes,\" she answered, \"I melted her with a bucket of water.\"\n\n\"Dear me,\" said the Voice; \"how sudden! Well, come to me to-morrow,\nfor I must have time to think it over.\"\n\n\"You've had plenty of time already,\" said the Tin Woodman, angrily.\n\n\"We shan't wait a day longer,\" said the Scarecrow.\n\n\"You must keep your promises to us!\" exclaimed Dorothy.\n\nThe Lion thought it might be as well to frighten the Wizard, so\nhe gave a large, loud roar, which was so fierce and dreadful that\nToto jumped away from him in alarm and tipped over the screen that\nstood in a corner. As it fell with a crash they looked that way,\nand the next moment all of them were filled with wonder. For they\nsaw, standing in just the spot the screen had hidden, a little, old\nman, with a bald head and a wrinkled face, who seemed to be as much\nsurprised as they were. The Tin Woodman, raising his axe, rushed\ntoward the little man and cried out,\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Who are you?\"\n\n\"I am Oz, the Great and Terrible,\" said the little man, in a\ntrembling voice, \"but don't strike me--please don't!--and I'll do\nanything you want me to.\"\n\nOur friends looked at him in surprise and dismay.\n\n\"I thought Oz was a great Head,\" said Dorothy.\n\n\"And I thought Oz was a lovely Lady,\" said the Scarecrow.\n\n\"And I thought Oz was a terrible Beast,\" said the Tin Woodman.\n\n\"And I thought Oz was a Ball of Fire,\" exclaimed the Lion.\n\n\"No; you are all wrong,\" said the little man, meekly. \"I have been\nmaking believe.\"\n\n\"Making believe!\" cried Dorothy. \"Are you not a great Wizard?\"\n\n\"Hush, my dear,\" he said; \"don't speak so loud, or you will be\noverheard--and I should be ruined. I'm supposed to be a Great Wizard.\"\n\n\"And aren't you?\" she asked.\n\n\"Not a bit of it, my dear; I'm just a common man.\"\n\n\"You're more than that,\" said the Scarecrow, in a grieved tone;\n\"you're a humbug.\"\n\n\"Exactly so!\" declared the little man, rubbing his hands together as\nif it pleased him; \"I am a humbug.\"\n\n\"But this is terrible,\" said the Tin Woodman; \"how shall I ever get\nmy heart?\"\n\n\"Or I my courage?\" asked the Lion.\n\n\"Or I my brains?\" wailed the Scarecrow, wiping the the tears from his\neyes with his coat-sleeve.\n\n[Illustration: \"_Exactly so! I am a humbug._\"]\n\n\"My dear friends,\" said Oz, \"I pray you not to speak of these\nlittle things. Think of me, and the terrible trouble I'm in at being\nfound out.\"\n\n\"Doesn't anyone else know you're a humbug?\" asked Dorothy.\n\n\"No one knows it but you four--and myself,\" replied Oz. \"I have\nfooled everyone so long that I thought I should never be found out.\nIt was a great mistake my ever letting you into the Throne Room.\nUsually I will not see even my subjects, and so they believe I am\nsomething terrible.\"\n\n\"But, I don't understand,\" said Dorothy, in bewilderment. \"How was it\nthat you appeared to me as a great Head?\"\n\n\"That was one of my tricks,\" answered Oz. \"Step this way, please, and\nI will tell you all about it.\"\n\nHe led the way to a small chamber in the rear of the Throne Room,\nand they all followed him. He pointed to one corner, in which lay\nthe Great Head, made out of many thicknesses of paper, and with a\ncarefully painted face.\n\n\"This I hung from the ceiling by a wire,\" said Oz; \"I stood behind the\nscreen and pulled a thread, to make the eyes move and the mouth open.\"\n\n\"But how about the voice?\" she enquired.\n\n\"Oh, I am a ventriloquist,\" said the little man, \"and I can throw\nthe sound of my voice wherever I wish; so that you thought it was\ncoming out of the Head. Here are the other things I used to deceive\nyou.\" He showed the Scarecrow the dress and the mask he had worn when\nhe seemed to be the lovely Lady; and the Tin Woodman saw that his\nTerrible Beast was nothing but a lot of skins, sewn together, with\nslats to keep their sides out. As for the Ball of Fire, the false\nWizard had hung that also from the ceiling. It was really a ball of\ncotton, but when oil was poured upon it the ball burned fiercely.\n\n\"Really,\" said the Scarecrow, \"you ought to be ashamed of yourself\nfor being such a humbug.\"\n\n\"I am--I certainly am,\" answered the little man, sorrowfully; \"but it\nwas the only thing I could do. Sit down, please, there are plenty of\nchairs; and I will tell you my story.\"\n\nSo they sat down and listened while he told the following tale:\n\n\"I was born in Omaha--\"\n\n\"Why, that isn't very far from Kansas!\" cried Dorothy.\n\n\"No; but it's farther from here,\" he said, shaking his head at her,\nsadly. \"When I grew up I became a ventriloquist, and at that I was\nvery well trained by a great master. I can imitate any kind of a\nbird or beast.\" Here he mewed so like a kitten that Toto pricked up\nhis ears and looked everywhere to see where she was. \"After a time,\"\ncontinued Oz, \"I tired of that, and became a balloonist.\"\n\n\"What is that?\" asked Dorothy.\n\n\"A man who goes up in a balloon on circus day, so as to draw a crowd\nof people together and get them to pay to see the circus,\" he explained.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Oh,\" she said; \"I know.\"\n\n\"Well, one day I went up in a balloon and the ropes got twisted, so\nthat I couldn't come down again. It went way up above the clouds, so\nfar that a current of air struck it and carried it many, many miles\naway. For a day and a night I travelled through the air, and on the\nmorning of the second day I awoke and found the balloon floating over\na strange and beautiful country.\n\n\"It came down gradually, and I was not hurt a bit. But I found myself\nin the midst of a strange people, who, seeing me come from the clouds,\nthought I was a great Wizard. Of course I let them think so, because\nthey were afraid of me, and promised to do anything I wished them to.\n\n\"Just to amuse myself, and keep the good people busy, I ordered them to\nbuild this City, and my palace; and they did it all willingly and well.\nThen I thought, as the country was so green and beautiful, I would\ncall it the Emerald City, and to make the name fit better I put green\nspectacles on all the people, so that everything they saw was green.\"\n\n\"But isn't everything here green?\" asked Dorothy.\n\n\"No more than in any other city,\" replied Oz; \"but when you wear\ngreen spectacles, why of course everything you see looks green to\nyou. The Emerald City was built a great many years ago, for I was a\nyoung man when the balloon brought me here, and I am a very old man\nnow. But my people have worn green glasses on their eyes so long that\nmost of them think it really is an Emerald City, and it certainly is\na beautiful place, abounding in jewels and precious metals, and every\ngood thing that is needed to make one happy. I have been good to the\npeople, and they like me; but ever since this Palace was built I have\nshut myself up and would not see any of them.\n\n\"One of my greatest fears was the Witches, for while I had no magical\npowers at all I soon found out that the Witches were really able to\ndo wonderful things. There were four of them in this country, and\nthey ruled the people who live in the North and South and East and\nWest. Fortunately, the Witches of the North and South were good, and\nI knew they would do me no harm; but the Witches of the East and West\nwere terribly wicked, and had they not thought I was more powerful\nthan they themselves, they would surely have destroyed me. As it was,\nI lived in deadly fear of them for many years; so you can imagine how\npleased I was when I heard your house had fallen on the Wicked Witch\nof the East. When you came to me I was willing to promise anything if\nyou would only do away with the other Witch; but, now that you have\nmelted her, I am ashamed to say that I cannot keep my promises.\"\n\n\"I think you are a very bad man,\" said Dorothy.\n\n\"Oh, no, my dear; I'm really a very good man; but I'm a very bad\nWizard, I must admit.\"\n\n\"Can't you give me brains?\" asked the Scarecrow.\n\n\"You don't need them. You are learning something every day. A baby\nhas brains, but it doesn't know much. Experience is the only thing\nthat brings knowledge, and the longer you are on earth the more\nexperience you are sure to get.\"\n\n\"That may all be true,\" said the Scarecrow, \"but I shall be very\nunhappy unless you give me brains.\"\n\nThe false wizard looked at him carefully.\n\n\"Well,\" he said, with a sigh, \"I'm not much of a magician, as I said;\nbut if you will come to me to-morrow morning, I will stuff your head\nwith brains. I cannot tell you how to use them, however; you must\nfind that out for yourself.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Oh, thank you--thank you!\" cried the Scarecrow. \"I'll find a way to\nuse them, never fear!\"\n\n\"But how about my courage?\" asked the Lion, anxiously.\n\n\"You have plenty of courage, I am sure,\" answered Oz. \"All you need\nis confidence in yourself. There is no living thing that is not\nafraid when it faces danger. True courage is in facing danger when\nyou are afraid, and that kind of courage you have in plenty.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I have, but I'm scared just the same,\" said the Lion. \"I\nshall really be very unhappy unless you give me the sort of courage\nthat makes one forget he is afraid.\"\n\n\"Very well; I will give you that sort of courage to-morrow,\" replied Oz.\n\n\"How about my heart?\" asked the Tin Woodman.\n\n\"Why, as for that,\" answered Oz, \"I think you are wrong to want a\nheart. It makes most people unhappy. If you only knew it, you are in\nluck not to have a heart.\"\n\n\"That must be a matter of opinion,\" said the Tin Woodman. \"For my\npart, I will bear all the unhappiness without a murmur, if you will\ngive me the heart.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Very well,\" answered Oz, meekly. \"Come to me to-morrow and you shall\nhave a heart. I have played Wizard for so many years that I may as\nwell continue the part a little longer.\"\n\n\"And now,\" said Dorothy, \"how am I to get back to Kansas?\"\n\n\"We shall have to think about that,\" replied the little man, \"Give\nme two or three days to consider the matter and I'll try to find a\nway to carry you over the desert. In the meantime you shall all be\ntreated as my guests, and while\n\n### Summary:\n\n", "answer": "It's back to the Guardian of the Gates. He seems surprised to see the travelers back so soon. The Scarecrow explains that the witch is dead. The Guardian is super impressed. Everyone puts on their special glasses and heads into the Emerald City. The travelers are escorted back to their old rooms. They expect that Oz will want to see them at once, but he doesn't. In fact, days pass without word from the great wizard. Everyone's getting impatient, so the Scarecrow sends Oz a message that they'll call the Winged Monkeys if he doesn't see them soon. With a quickness, Oz issues an invitation for them to meet him in the throne room the next day. Morning comes, and the gang is excited. When they get to the throne room, they're surprised to see that no one's there. This time Oz appears as a disembodied voice. Dorothy says they're ready to be rewarded for having completed their mission. Oz is all like, what mission? She explains that she killed the witch and now she wants to return to Kansas, as promised. Oz tell them he needs time to think everything over, but the gang feels like they've waited long enough. To scare Oz, the Lion roars loudly, frightening Toto. Toto runs away and knocks down a screen. Suddenly a little old man comes into view. Wait, who's this guy? The gang is confused. Gradually, it becomes clear that Oz is just this little man, who's been tricking them. Dorothy and the others are angry. Oz asks them to hush. He doesn't want anyone to hear that he's a fraud. The gang is really worried about what this means for their rewards. Oz is worried that the people of his kingdom will find out that he's a man, not a wizard. He's kicking himself for allowing the gang into his throne room. Oz proceeds to show the travelers his bag of tricks, which includes a paper-mache head, a mask, and other disguises. He also explains that he's a ventriloquist. He threw his voice and used the props to create illusions. He goes on to explain his backstory. Turns out Oz is from Omaha, Nebraska. He used to work as a ventriloquist and a hot-air balloonist at the circus. One day, he lost control of his balloon. The next thing he knew, he was in Oz. The people of Oz assumed that he was a wizard since he had come from the sky. He didn't correct them, and has been posing as a powerful wizard ever since. After that, he ordered everyone to build the Emerald City...which isn't really green, by the way. People just think it's green because of the special glasses they have to wear. Oz secluded himself and didn't receive many visitors after that. He was afraid of the witches because he knew they had real power. That's why he sent Dorothy & Co. to kill the Wicked Witch of the West. He was afraid of her. Oz explains that, since he's a regular man, he can't do much about the brain, the heart, the courage, or Kansas. The group finds this unacceptable. Finally, Oz agrees to give the Scarecrow, the Tin Woodman, and the Lion what they seek the following day. He might need a little extra time for Dorothy's wish, though. Meanwhile, the \"wizard\" begs the group to keep his secret. He's deathly afraid of being found out. The gang agrees. Dorothy will do about anything to get back to Kansas, even if it means forgiving such a deceitful man."}

An Opinion\n\nWorn out by anxious watching, Mr. Lorry fell asleep at his post. On the\ntenth morning of his suspense, he was startled by the shining of the sun\ninto the room where a heavy slumber had overtaken him when it was dark\nnight.\n\nHe rubbed his eyes and roused himself; but he doubted, when he had\ndone so, whether he was not still asleep. For, going to the door of the\nDoctor's room and looking in, he perceived that the shoemaker's bench\nand tools were put aside again, and that the Doctor himself sat reading\nat the window. He was in his usual morning dress, and his face (which\nMr. Lorry could distinctly see), though still very pale, was calmly\nstudious and attentive.\n\nEven when he had satisfied himself that he was awake, Mr. Lorry felt\ngiddily uncertain for some few moments whether the late shoemaking might\nnot be a disturbed dream of his own; for, did not his eyes show him his\nfriend before him in his accustomed clothing and aspect, and employed\nas usual; and was there any sign within their range, that the change of\nwhich he had so strong an impression had actually happened?\n\nIt was but the inquiry of his first confusion and astonishment, the\nanswer being obvious. If the impression were not produced by a real\ncorresponding and sufficient cause, how came he, Jarvis Lorry, there?\nHow came he to have fallen asleep, in his clothes, on the sofa in Doctor\nManette's consulting-room, and to be debating these points outside the\nDoctor's bedroom door in the early morning?\n\nWithin a few minutes, Miss Pross stood whispering at his side. If he\nhad had any particle of doubt left, her talk would of necessity have\nresolved it; but he was by that time clear-headed, and had none.\nHe advised that they should let the time go by until the regular\nbreakfast-hour, and should then meet the Doctor as if nothing unusual\nhad occurred. If he appeared to be in his customary state of mind, Mr.\nLorry would then cautiously proceed to seek direction and guidance from\nthe opinion he had been, in his anxiety, so anxious to obtain.\n\nMiss Pross, submitting herself to his judgment, the scheme was worked\nout with care. Having abundance of time for his usual methodical\ntoilette, Mr. Lorry presented himself at the breakfast-hour in his usual\nwhite linen, and with his usual neat leg. The Doctor was summoned in the\nusual way, and came to breakfast.\n\nSo far as it was possible to comprehend him without overstepping those\ndelicate and gradual approaches which Mr. Lorry felt to be the only safe\nadvance, he at first supposed that his daughter's marriage had taken\nplace yesterday. An incidental allusion, purposely thrown out, to\nthe day of the week, and the day of the month, set him thinking and\ncounting, and evidently made him uneasy. In all other respects, however,\nhe was so composedly himself, that Mr. Lorry determined to have the aid\nhe sought. And that aid was his own.\n\nTherefore, when the breakfast was done and cleared away, and he and the\nDoctor were left together, Mr. Lorry said, feelingly:\n\n\"My dear Manette, I am anxious to have your opinion, in confidence, on a\nvery curious case in which I am deeply interested; that is to say, it is\nvery curious to me; perhaps, to your better information it may be less\nso.\"\n\nGlancing at his hands, which were discoloured by his late work, the\nDoctor looked troubled, and listened attentively. He had already glanced\nat his hands more than once.\n\n\"Doctor Manette,\" said Mr. Lorry, touching him affectionately on the\narm, \"the case is the case of a particularly dear friend of mine. Pray\ngive your mind to it, and advise me well for his sake--and above all,\nfor his daughter's--his daughter's, my dear Manette.\"\n\n\"If I understand,\" said the Doctor, in a subdued tone, \"some mental\nshock--?\"\n\n\"Yes!\"\n\n\"Be explicit,\" said the Doctor. \"Spare no detail.\"\n\nMr. Lorry saw that they understood one another, and proceeded.\n\n\"My dear Manette, it is the case of an old and a prolonged shock,\nof great acuteness and severity to the affections, the feelings,\nthe--the--as you express it--the mind. The mind. It is the case of a\nshock under which the sufferer was borne down, one cannot say for how\nlong, because I believe he cannot calculate the time himself, and there\nare no other means of getting at it. It is the case of a shock from\nwhich the sufferer recovered, by a process that he cannot trace\nhimself--as I once heard him publicly relate in a striking manner. It is\nthe case of a shock from which he has recovered, so completely, as to\nbe a highly intelligent man, capable of close application of mind, and\ngreat exertion of body, and of constantly making fresh additions to his\nstock of knowledge, which was already very large.

An Opinion\n\nWorn out by anxious watching, Mr. Lorry fell asleep at his post. On the\ntenth morning of his suspense, he was startled by the shining of the sun\ninto the room where a heavy slumber had overtaken him when it was dark\nnight.\n\nHe rubbed his eyes and roused himself; but he doubted, when he had\ndone so, whether he was not still asleep. For, going to the door of the\nDoctor's room and looking in, he perceived that the shoemaker's bench\nand tools were put aside again, and that the Doctor himself sat reading\nat the window. He was in his usual morning dress, and his face (which\nMr. Lorry could distinctly see), though still very pale, was calmly\nstudious and attentive.\n\nEven when he had satisfied himself that he was awake, Mr. Lorry felt\ngiddily uncertain for some few moments whether the late shoemaking might\nnot be a disturbed dream of his own; for, did not his eyes show him his\nfriend before him in his accustomed clothing and aspect, and employed\nas usual; and was there any sign within their range, that the change of\nwhich he had so strong an impression had actually happened?\n\nIt was but the inquiry of his first confusion and astonishment, the\nanswer being obvious. If the impression were not produced by a real\ncorresponding and sufficient cause, how came he, Jarvis Lorry, there?\nHow came he to have fallen asleep, in his clothes, on the sofa in Doctor\nManette's consulting-room, and to be debating these points outside the\nDoctor's bedroom door in the early morning?\n\nWithin a few minutes, Miss Pross stood whispering at his side. If he\nhad had any particle of doubt left, her talk would of necessity have\nresolved it; but he was by that time clear-headed, and had none.\nHe advised that they should let the time go by until the regular\nbreakfast-hour, and should then meet the Doctor as if nothing unusual\nhad occurred. If he appeared to be in his customary state of mind, Mr.\nLorry would then cautiously proceed to seek direction and guidance from\nthe opinion he had been, in his anxiety, so anxious to obtain.\n\nMiss Pross, submitting herself to his judgment, the scheme was worked\nout with care. Having abundance of time for his usual methodical\ntoilette, Mr. Lorry presented himself at the breakfast-hour in his usual\nwhite linen, and with his usual neat leg. The Doctor was summoned in the\nusual way, and came to breakfast.\n\nSo far as it was possible to comprehend him without overstepping those\ndelicate and gradual approaches which Mr. Lorry felt to be the only safe\nadvance, he at first supposed that his daughter's marriage had taken\nplace yesterday. An incidental allusion, purposely thrown out, to\nthe day of the week, and the day of the month, set him thinking and\ncounting, and evidently made him uneasy. In all other respects, however,\nhe was so composedly himself, that Mr. Lorry determined to have the aid\nhe sought. And that aid was his own.\n\nTherefore, when the breakfast was done and cleared away, and he and the\nDoctor were left together, Mr. Lorry said, feelingly:\n\n\"My dear Manette, I am anxious to have your opinion, in confidence, on a\nvery curious case in which I am deeply interested; that is to say, it is\nvery curious to me; perhaps, to your better information it may be less\nso.\"\n\nGlancing at his hands, which were discoloured by his late work, the\nDoctor looked troubled, and listened attentively. He had already glanced\nat his hands more than once.\n\n\"Doctor Manette,\" said Mr. Lorry, touching him affectionately on the\narm, \"the case is the case of a particularly dear friend of mine. Pray\ngive your mind to it, and advise me well for his sake--and above all,\nfor his daughter's--his daughter's, my dear Manette.\"\n\n\"If I understand,\" said the Doctor, in a subdued tone, \"some mental\nshock--?\"\n\n\"Yes!\"\n\n\"Be explicit,\" said the Doctor. \"Spare no detail.\"\n\nMr. Lorry saw that they understood one another, and proceeded.\n\n\"My dear Manette, it is the case of an old and a prolonged shock,\nof great acuteness and severity to the affections, the feelings,\nthe--the--as you express it--the mind. The mind. It is the case of a\nshock under which the sufferer was borne down, one cannot say for how\nlong, because I believe he cannot calculate the time himself, and there\nare no other means of getting at it. It is the case of a shock from\nwhich the sufferer recovered, by a process that he cannot trace\nhimself--as I once heard him publicly relate in a striking manner. It is\nthe case of a shock from which he has recovered, so completely, as to\nbe a highly intelligent man, capable of close application of mind, and\ngreat exertion of body, and of constantly making fresh additions to his\nstock of knowledge, which was already very large. But, unfortunately,\nthere has been,\" he paused and took a deep breath--\"a slight relapse.\"\n\nThe Doctor, in a low voice, asked, \"Of how long duration?\"\n\n\"Nine days and nights.\"\n\n\"How did it show itself? I infer,\" glancing at his hands again, \"in the\nresumption of some old pursuit connected with the shock?\"\n\n\"That is the fact.\"\n\n\"Now, did you ever see him,\" asked the Doctor, distinctly and\ncollectedly, though in the same low voice, \"engaged in that pursuit\noriginally?\"\n\n\"Once.\"\n\n\"And when the relapse fell on him, was he in most respects--or in all\nrespects--as he was then?\"\n\n\"I think in all respects.\"\n\n\"You spoke of his daughter.

Mr. Lorry enters the doctor's bedroom and finds the doctor sitting by his window, reading. He's a bit pale, sure, but otherwise he seems to be completely back to normal. The change is so drastic, in fact, that Mr. Lorry begins to doubt his own eyes. When Miss Pross arrives, she's equally astonished. Dr. Manette seems to have healed himself completely overnight. Because the doctor doesn't make any reference to his scary relapse, Miss Pross and Mr. Lorry decide not to mention it immediately, either. They all head down to breakfast. While they're sitting down, Mr. Lorry tells Dr. Manette that he needs an expert's opinion for a hypothetical case. We all know how much Mr. Lorry loves \"hypothetical\" cases. Asking the doctor how good friends should deal with the case of a man who relapsed for nine days, Mr. Lorry tries to gauge how much the doctor actually remembers of his relapse. As it turns out, the doctor doesn't remember anything. He quickly catches on to Mr. Lorry's ruse; finally, he asks if the daughter of this hypothetical man has been told of his illness. When Mr. Lorry says that the daughter hasn't been told of her father's condition, Dr. Manette breathes a huge sigh of relief. Actually, he says, the man probably has been expecting a relapse of this sort for some time. Puzzled, Mr. Lorry asks why. Dr. Manette pauses for a bit before replying. He finally says that the man had probably been anticipating some information from someone he knew well. Actually, anticipating is too nice a word. He'd been dreading the information. When it finally came, his mind crumbled entirely. Surprised, Mr. Lorry asks what the information was. The doctor, of course, can't say. After all, it's a hypothetical case. He does reassure Mr. Lorry that another relapse seems highly unlikely. After all, there are no more big shocks in store. Thank goodness. Now comes the tricky part: Mr. Lorry and Miss Pross have come up with a plan. They're pretty sure that the doctor won't like it at all. Nevertheless, they decide to give it a go. Mr. Lorry gently tells the doctor that the case they'd been discussing also involved some tools: the man who relapsed began working again at shoemaking. The doctor seems more disturbed than before. Mr. Lorry asks if it wouldn't be best for the friends of the man to take the shoemaking bench away. After all, couldn't the very presence of the bench in the man's room help to incite another relapse? Pained by this thought, the doctor explains that the bench was once the only thing that kept him sane. He worked with his hands so that he wouldn't go crazy while he was in prison. In some ways, then, the bench symbolizes his strength, not his weakness. Mr. Lorry understands this, but he still presses the doctor to get rid of the bench. Finally, the doctor agrees that if the bench could be taken away while the man was out of the house, it might be okay. Accordingly, a few days later the doctor heads out to the country to meet up with Darnay and Lucie. As soon as he leaves, Miss Pross and Mr. Lorry dismantle his workbench and bury the tools in the yard."}

For, going to the door of the\nDoctor's room and looking in, he perceived that the shoemaker's bench\nand tools were put aside again, and that the Doctor himself sat reading\nat the window. He was in his usual morning dress, and his face (which\nMr. Lorry could distinctly see), though still very pale, was calmly\nstudious and attentive.\n\nEven when he had satisfied himself that he was awake, Mr. Lorry felt\ngiddily uncertain for some few moments whether the late shoemaking might\nnot be a disturbed dream of his own; for, did not his eyes show him his\nfriend before him in his accustomed clothing and aspect, and employed\nas usual; and was there any sign within their range, that the change of\nwhich he had so strong an impression had actually happened?\n\nIt was but the inquiry of his first confusion and astonishment, the\nanswer being obvious. If the impression were not produced by a real\ncorresponding and sufficient cause, how came he, Jarvis Lorry, there?\nHow came he to have fallen asleep, in his clothes, on the sofa in Doctor\nManette's consulting-room, and to be debating these points outside the\nDoctor's bedroom door in the early morning?\n\nWithin a few minutes, Miss Pross stood whispering at his side. If he\nhad had any particle of doubt left, her talk would of necessity have\nresolved it; but he was by that time clear-headed, and had none.\nHe advised that they should let the time go by until the regular\nbreakfast-hour, and should then meet the Doctor as if nothing unusual\nhad occurred. If he appeared to be in his customary state of mind, Mr.\nLorry would then cautiously proceed to seek direction and guidance from\nthe opinion he had been, in his anxiety, so anxious to obtain.\n\nMiss Pross, submitting herself to his judgment, the scheme was worked\nout with care. Having abundance of time for his usual methodical\ntoilette, Mr. Lorry presented himself at the breakfast-hour in his usual\nwhite linen, and with his usual neat leg. The Doctor was summoned in the\nusual way, and came to breakfast.\n\nSo far as it was possible to comprehend him without overstepping those\ndelicate and gradual approaches which Mr. Lorry felt to be the only safe\nadvance, he at first supposed that his daughter's marriage had taken\nplace yesterday. An incidental allusion, purposely thrown out, to\nthe day of the week, and the day of the month, set him thinking and\ncounting, and evidently made him uneasy. In all other respects, however,\nhe was so composedly himself, that Mr. Lorry determined to have the aid\nhe sought. And that aid was his own.\n\nTherefore, when the breakfast was done and cleared away, and he and the\nDoctor were left together, Mr. Lorry said, feelingly:\n\n\"My dear Manette, I am anxious to have your opinion, in confidence, on a\nvery curious case in which I am deeply interested; that is to say, it is\nvery curious to me; perhaps, to your better information it may be less\nso.\"\n\nGlancing at his hands, which were discoloured by his late work, the\nDoctor looked troubled, and listened attentively. He had already glanced\nat his hands more than once.\n\n\"Doctor Manette,\" said Mr. Lorry, touching him affectionately on the\narm, \"the case is the case of a particularly dear friend of mine. Pray\ngive your mind to it, and advise me well for his sake--and above all,\nfor his daughter's--his daughter's, my dear Manette.\"\n\n\"If I understand,\" said the Doctor, in a subdued tone, \"some mental\nshock--?\"\n\n\"Yes!\"\n\n\"Be explicit,\" said the Doctor. \"Spare no detail.\"\n\nMr. Lorry saw that they understood one another, and proceeded.\n\n\"My dear Manette, it is the case of an old and a prolonged shock,\nof great acuteness and severity to the affections, the feelings,\nthe--the--as you express it--the mind. The mind. It is the case of a\nshock under which the sufferer was borne down, one cannot say for how\nlong, because I believe he cannot calculate the time himself, and there\nare no other means of getting at it. It is the case of a shock from\nwhich the sufferer recovered, by a process that he cannot trace\nhimself--as I once heard him publicly relate in a striking manner. It is\nthe case of a shock from which he has recovered, so completely, as to\nbe a highly intelligent man, capable of close application of mind, and\ngreat exertion of body, and of constantly making fresh additions to his\nstock of knowledge, which was already very large. But, unfortunately,\nthere has been,\" he paused and took a deep breath--\"a slight relapse.\"\n\nThe Doctor, in a low voice, asked, \"Of how long duration?\"\n\n\"Nine days and nights.\"\n\n\"How did it show itself? I infer,\" glancing at his hands again, \"in the\nresumption of some old pursuit connected with the shock?\"\n\n\"That is the fact.\"\n\n\"Now, did you ever see him,\" asked the Doctor, distinctly and\ncollectedly, though in the same low voice, \"engaged in that pursuit\noriginally?\"\n\n\"Once.\"\n\n\"And when the relapse fell on him, was he in most respects--or in all\nrespects--as he was then?\"\n\n\"I think in all respects.\"\n\n\"You spoke of his daughter. Does his daughter know of the relapse?\"\n\n\"No. It has been kept from her, and I hope will always be kept from her.\nIt is known only to myself, and to one other who may be trusted.\"\n\nThe Doctor grasped his hand, and murmured, \"That was very kind. That was\nvery thoughtful!\" Mr. Lorry grasped his hand in return, and neither of\nthe two spoke for a little while.\n\n\"Now, my dear Manette,\" said Mr. Lorry, at length, in his most\nconsiderate and most affectionate way, \"I am a mere man of business,\nand unfit to cope with such intricate and difficult matters. I do not\npossess the kind of information necessary; I do not possess the kind of\nintelligence; I want guiding. There is no man in this world on whom\nI could so rely for right guidance, as on you. Tell me, how does this\nrelapse come about? Is there danger of another? Could a repetition of it\nbe prevented? How should a repetition of it be treated? How does it come\nabout at all? What can I do for my friend? No man ever can have been\nmore desirous in his heart to serve a friend, than I am to serve mine,\nif I knew how.\n\n\"But I don't know how to originate, in such a case. If your sagacity,\nknowledge, and experience, could put me on the right track, I might be\nable to do so much; unenlightened and undirected, I can do so little.\nPray discuss it with me; pray enable me to see it a little more clearly,\nand teach me how to be a little more useful.\"\n\nDoctor Manette sat meditating after these earnest words were spoken, and\nMr. Lorry did not press him.\n\n\"I think it probable,\" said the Doctor, breaking silence with an effort,\n\"that the relapse you have described, my dear friend, was not quite\nunforeseen by its subject.\"\n\n\"Was it dreaded by him?\" Mr. Lorry ventured to ask.\n\n\"Very much.\" He said it with an involuntary shudder.\n\n\"You have no idea how such an apprehension weighs on the sufferer's\nmind, and how difficult--how almost impossible--it is, for him to force\nhimself to utter a word upon the topic that oppresses him.\"\n\n\"Would he,\" asked Mr. Lorry, \"be sensibly relieved if he could prevail\nupon himself to impart that secret brooding to any one, when it is on\nhim?\"\n\n\"I think so. But it is, as I have told you, next to impossible. I even\nbelieve it--in some cases--to be quite impossible.\"\n\n\"Now,\" said Mr. Lorry, gently laying his hand on the Doctor's arm again,\nafter a short silence on both sides, \"to what would you refer this\nattack?\"\n\n\"I believe,\" returned Doctor Manette, \"that there had been a strong and\nextraordinary revival of the train of thought and remembrance that\nwas the first cause of the malady. Some intense associations of a most\ndistressing nature were vividly recalled, I think. It is probable that\nthere had long been a dread lurking in his mind, that those associations\nwould be recalled--say, under certain circumstances--say, on a\nparticular occasion. He tried to prepare himself in vain; perhaps the\neffort to prepare himself made him less able to bear it.\"\n\n\"Would he remember what took place in the relapse?\" asked Mr. Lorry,\nwith natural hesitation.\n\nThe Doctor looked desolately round the room, shook his head, and\nanswered, in a low voice, \"Not at all.\"\n\n\"Now, as to the future,\" hinted Mr. Lorry.\n\n\"As to the future,\" said the Doctor, recovering firmness, \"I should have\ngreat hope. As it pleased Heaven in its mercy to restore him so soon, I\nshould have great hope. He, yielding under the pressure of a complicated\nsomething, long dreaded and long vaguely foreseen and contended against,\nand recovering after the cloud had burst and passed, I should hope that\nthe worst was over.\"\n\n\"Well, well! That's good comfort. I am thankful!\" said Mr. Lorry.\n\n\"I am thankful!\" repeated the Doctor, bending his head with reverence.\n\n\"There are two other points,\" said Mr. Lorry, \"on which I am anxious to\nbe instructed. I may go on?\"\n\n\"You cannot do your friend a better service.\" The Doctor gave him his\nhand.\n\n\"To the first, then. He is of a studious habit, and unusually energetic;\nhe applies himself with great ardour to the acquisition of professional\nknowledge, to the conducting of experiments, to many things. Now, does\nhe do too much?\"\n\n\"I think not. It may be the character of his mind, to be always in\nsingular need of occupation. That may be, in part, natural to it; in\npart, the result of affliction. The less it was occupied with healthy\nthings, the more it would be in danger of turning in the unhealthy\ndirection. He may have observed himself, and made the discovery.\"\n\n\"You are sure that he is not under too great a strain?\"\n\n\"I think I am quite sure of it.\"\n\n\"My dear Manette, if he were overworked now--\"\n\n\"My dear Lorry, I doubt if that could easily be. There has been a\nviolent stress in one direction, and it needs a counterweight.\"\n\n\"Excuse me, as a persistent man of business. Assuming for a moment,\nthat he _was_ overworked; it would show itself in some renewal of this\ndisorder?\"\n\n\"I do not think so. I do not think,\" said Doctor Manette with the\nfirmness of self-conviction, \"that anything but the one train of\nassociation would renew it. I think that, henceforth, nothing but some\nextraordinary jarring of that chord could renew it. After what has\nhappened, and after his recovery, I find it difficult to imagine any\nsuch violent sounding of that string again. I trust, and I almost\nbelieve, that the circumstances likely to renew it are exhausted.\"\n\nHe spoke with the diffidence of a man who knew how slight a thing\nwould overset the delicate organisation of the mind, and yet with the\nconfidence of a man who had slowly won his assurance out of personal\nendurance and distress. It was not for his friend to abate that\nconfidence. He professed himself more relieved and encouraged than he\nreally was, and approached his second and last point. He felt it to\nbe the most difficult of all; but, remembering his old Sunday morning\nconversation with Miss Pross, and remembering what he had seen in the\nlast nine days, he knew that he must face it.\n\n\"The occupation resumed under the influence of this passing affliction\nso happily recovered from,\" said Mr. Lorry, clearing his throat, \"we\nwill call--Blacksmith's work, Blacksmith's work. We will say, to put a\ncase and for the sake of illustration, that he had been used, in his bad\ntime, to work at a little forge. We will say that he was unexpectedly\nfound at his forge again. Is it not a pity that he should keep it by\nhim?\"\n\nThe Doctor shaded his forehead with his hand, and beat his foot\nnervously on the ground.\n\n\"He has always kept it by him,\" said Mr. Lorry, with an anxious look at\nhis friend. \"Now, would it not be better that he should let it go?\"\n\nStill, the Doctor, with shaded forehead, beat his foot nervously on the\nground.\n\n\"You do not find it easy to advise me?\" said Mr. Lorry. \"I quite\nunderstand it to be a nice question. And yet I think--\" And there he\nshook his head, and stopped.\n\n\"You see,\" said Doctor Manette, turning to him after an uneasy pause,\n\"it is very hard to explain, consistently, the innermost workings\nof this poor man's mind. He once yearned so frightfully for that\noccupation, and it was so welcome when it came; no doubt it relieved\nhis pain so much, by substituting the perplexity of the fingers for\nthe perplexity of the brain, and by substituting, as he became more\npractised, the ingenuity of the hands, for the ingenuity of the mental\ntorture; that he has never been able to bear the thought of putting it\nquite out of his reach. Even now, when I believe he is more hopeful of\nhimself than he has ever been, and even speaks of himself with a kind\nof confidence, the idea that he might need that old employment, and not\nfind it, gives him a sudden sense of terror, like that which one may\nfancy strikes to the heart of a lost child.\"\n\nHe looked like his illustration, as he raised his eyes to Mr. Lorry's\nface.\n\n\"But may not--mind! I ask for information, as a plodding man of business\nwho only deals with such material objects as guineas, shillings, and\nbank-notes--may not the retention of the thing involve the retention of\nthe idea? If the thing were gone, my dear Manette, might not the fear go\nwith it? In short, is it not a concession to the misgiving, to keep the\nforge?\"\n\nThere was another silence.\n\n\"You see, too,\" said the Doctor, tremulously, \"it is such an old\ncompanion.\"\n\n\"I would not keep it,\" said Mr. Lorry, shaking his head; for he gained\nin firmness as he saw the Doctor disquieted. \"I would recommend him to\nsacrifice it. I only want your authority. I am sure it does no good.\nCome! Give me your authority, like a dear good man. For his daughter's\nsake, my dear Manette!\"\n\nVery strange to see what a struggle there was within him!\n\n\"In her name, then, let it be done; I sanction it. But, I would not take\nit away while he was present. Let it be removed when he is not there;\nlet him miss his old companion after an absence.\"\n\nMr. Lorry readily engaged for that, and the conference was ended. They\npassed the day in the country, and the Doctor was quite restored. On the\nthree following days he remained perfectly well, and on the fourteenth\nday he went away to join Lucie and her husband. The precaution that\nhad been taken to account for his silence, Mr. Lorry had previously\nexplained to him, and he had written to Lucie in accordance with it, and\nshe had no suspicions.\n\nOn the night of the day on which he left the house, Mr. Lorry went into\nhis room with a chopper, saw, chisel, and hammer, attended by Miss Pross\ncarrying a light. There, with closed doors, and in a mysterious and\nguilty manner, Mr. Lorry hacked the shoemaker\n\n### Summary:\n\n", "answer": "On the tenth morning, Doctor Alexandre Manette awakens fully recovered and unaware that anything unusual has transpired. Mr. Lorry tactfully conveys to the Doctor what has happened and asks what caused the relapse and how it can be prevented. The Doctor explains that he expected the relapse, which was caused by the revival of certain memories. He believes that the worst is over and doubts that another relapse could occur; if one did, it would most likely result from an intense experience that revived those same memories. Mr. Lorry also questions the wisdom of keeping the shoemaking bench and materials, pointing out that their presence reminds the Doctor of the past that has caused him so much pain. Uneasily agreeing, Doctor Manette requests that Mr. Lorry dispose of the bench and tools without him. Therefore, Mr. Lorry and Miss Pross bury the tools and burn the shoemaking bench after the Doctor leaves to join Lucie and Darnay on their trip."}

An Opinion\n\nWorn out by anxious watching, Mr. Lorry fell asleep at his post. On the\ntenth morning of his suspense, he was startled by the shining of the sun\ninto the room where a heavy slumber had overtaken him when it was dark\nnight.\n\nHe rubbed his eyes and roused himself; but he doubted, when he had\ndone so, whether he was not still asleep. For, going to the door of the\nDoctor's room and looking in, he perceived that the shoemaker's bench\nand tools were put aside again, and that the Doctor himself sat reading\nat the window. He was in his usual morning dress, and his face (which\nMr. Lorry could distinctly see), though still very pale, was calmly\nstudious and attentive.\n\nEven when he had satisfied himself that he was awake, Mr. Lorry felt\ngiddily uncertain for some few moments whether the late shoemaking might\nnot be a disturbed dream of his own; for, did not his eyes show him his\nfriend before him in his accustomed clothing and aspect, and employed\nas usual; and was there any sign within their range, that the change of\nwhich he had so strong an impression had actually happened?\n\nIt was but the inquiry of his first confusion and astonishment, the\nanswer being obvious. If the impression were not produced by a real\ncorresponding and sufficient cause, how came he, Jarvis Lorry, there?\nHow came he to have fallen asleep, in his clothes, on the sofa in Doctor\nManette's consulting-room, and to be debating these points outside the\nDoctor's bedroom door in the early morning?\n\nWithin a few minutes, Miss Pross stood whispering at his side. If he\nhad had any particle of doubt left, her talk would of necessity have\nresolved it; but he was by that time clear-headed, and had none.\nHe advised that they should let the time go by until the regular\nbreakfast-hour, and should then meet the Doctor as if nothing unusual\nhad occurred. If he appeared to be in his customary state of mind, Mr.\nLorry would then cautiously proceed to seek direction and guidance from\nthe opinion he had been, in his anxiety, so anxious to obtain.\n\nMiss Pross, submitting herself to his judgment, the scheme was worked\nout with care. Having abundance of time for his usual methodical\ntoilette, Mr. Lorry presented himself at the breakfast-hour in his usual\nwhite linen, and with his usual neat leg. The Doctor was summoned in the\nusual way, and came to breakfast.\n\nSo far as it was possible to comprehend him without overstepping those\ndelicate and gradual approaches which Mr. Lorry felt to be the only safe\nadvance, he at first supposed that his daughter's marriage had taken\nplace yesterday. An incidental allusion, purposely thrown out, to\nthe day of the week, and the day of the month, set him thinking and\ncounting, and evidently made him uneasy. In all other respects, however,\nhe was so composedly himself, that Mr. Lorry determined to have the aid\nhe sought. And that aid was his own.\n\nTherefore, when the breakfast was done and cleared away, and he and the\nDoctor were left together, Mr. Lorry said, feelingly:\n\n\"My dear Manette, I am anxious to have your opinion, in confidence, on a\nvery curious case in which I am deeply interested; that is to say, it is\nvery curious to me; perhaps, to your better information it may be less\nso.\"\n\nGlancing at his hands, which were discoloured by his late work, the\nDoctor looked troubled, and listened attentively. He had already glanced\nat his hands more than once.\n\n\"Doctor Manette,\" said Mr. Lorry, touching him affectionately on the\narm, \"the case is the case of a particularly dear friend of mine. Pray\ngive your mind to it, and advise me well for his sake--and above all,\nfor his daughter's--his daughter's, my dear Manette.\"\n\n\"If I understand,\" said the Doctor, in a subdued tone, \"some mental\nshock--?\"\n\n\"Yes!\"\n\n\"Be explicit,\" said the Doctor. \"Spare no detail.\"\n\nMr. Lorry saw that they understood one another, and proceeded.\n\n\"My dear Manette, it is the case of an old and a prolonged shock,\nof great acuteness and severity to the affections, the feelings,\nthe--the--as you express it--the mind. The mind. It is the case of a\nshock under which the sufferer was borne down, one cannot say for how\nlong, because I believe he cannot calculate the time himself, and there\nare no other means of getting at it. It is the case of a shock from\nwhich the sufferer recovered, by a process that he cannot trace\nhimself--as I once heard him publicly relate in a striking manner. It is\nthe case of a shock from which he has recovered, so completely, as to\nbe a highly intelligent man, capable of close application of mind, and\ngreat exertion of body, and of constantly making fresh additions to his\nstock of knowledge, which was already very large. But, unfortunately,\nthere has been,\" he paused and took a deep breath--\"a slight relapse.\"\n\nThe Doctor, in a low voice, asked, \"Of how long duration?\"\n\n\"Nine days and nights.\"\n\n\"How did it show itself? I infer,\" glancing at his hands again, \"in the\nresumption of some old pursuit connected with the shock?\"\n\n\"That is the fact.\"\n\n\"Now, did you ever see him,\" asked the Doctor, distinctly and\ncollectedly, though in the same low voice, \"engaged in that pursuit\noriginally?\"\n\n\"Once.\"\n\n\"And when the relapse fell on him, was he in most respects--or in all\nrespects--as he was then?\"\n\n\"I think in all respects.\"\n\n\"You spoke of his daughter. Does his daughter know of the relapse?\"\n\n\"No. It has been kept from her, and I hope will always be kept from her.\nIt is known only to myself, and to one other who may be trusted.\"\n\nThe Doctor grasped his hand, and murmured, \"That was very kind. That was\nvery thoughtful!\" Mr. Lorry grasped his hand in return, and neither of\nthe two spoke for a little while.\n\n\"Now, my dear Manette,\" said Mr. Lorry, at length, in his most\nconsiderate and most affectionate way, \"I am a mere man of business,\nand unfit to cope with such intricate and difficult matters. I do not\npossess the kind of information necessary; I do not possess the kind of\nintelligence; I want guiding. There is no man in this world on whom\nI could so rely for right guidance, as on you. Tell me, how does this\nrelapse come about? Is there danger of another? Could a repetition of it\nbe prevented? How should a repetition of it be treated? How does it come\nabout at all? What can I do for my friend? No man ever can have been\nmore desirous in his heart to serve a friend, than I am to serve mine,\nif I knew how.\n\n\"But I don't know how to originate, in such a case. If your sagacity,\nknowledge, and experience, could put me on the right track, I might be\nable to do so much; unenlightened and undirected, I can do so little.\nPray discuss it with me; pray enable me to see it a little more clearly,\nand teach me how to be a little more useful.\"\n\nDoctor Manette sat meditating after these earnest words were spoken, and\nMr. Lorry did not press him.\n\n\"I think it probable,\" said the Doctor, breaking silence with an effort,\n\"that the relapse you have described, my dear friend, was not quite\nunforeseen by its subject.\"\n\n\"Was it dreaded by him?\" Mr. Lorry ventured to ask.\n\n\"Very much.\" He said it with an involuntary shudder.\n\n\"You have no idea how such an apprehension weighs on the sufferer's\nmind, and how difficult--how almost impossible--it is, for him to force\nhimself to utter a word upon the topic that oppresses him.\"\n\n\"Would he,\" asked Mr. Lorry, \"be sensibly relieved if he could prevail\nupon himself to impart that secret brooding to any one, when it is on\nhim?\"\n\n\"I think so. But it is, as I have told you, next to impossible. I even\nbelieve it--in some cases--to be quite impossible.\"\n\n\"Now,\" said Mr. Lorry, gently laying his hand on the Doctor's arm again,\nafter a short silence on both sides, \"to what would you refer this\nattack?\"\n\n\"I believe,\" returned Doctor Manette, \"that there had been a strong and\nextraordinary revival of the train of thought and remembrance that\nwas the first cause of the malady. Some intense associations of a most\ndistressing nature were vividly recalled, I think. It is probable that\nthere had long been a dread lurking in his mind, that those associations\nwould be recalled--say, under certain circumstances--say, on a\nparticular occasion. He tried to prepare himself in vain; perhaps the\neffort to prepare himself made him less able to bear it.\"\n\n\"Would he remember what took place in the relapse?\" asked Mr. Lorry,\nwith natural hesitation.\n\nThe Doctor looked desolately round the room, shook his head, and\nanswered, in a low voice, \"Not at all.\"\n\n\"Now, as to the future,\" hinted Mr. Lorry.\n\n\"As to the future,\" said the Doctor, recovering firmness, \"I should have\ngreat hope. As it pleased Heaven in its mercy to restore him so soon, I\nshould have great hope. He, yielding under the pressure of a complicated\nsomething, long dreaded and long vaguely foreseen and contended against,\nand recovering after the cloud had burst and passed, I should hope that\nthe worst was over.\"\n\n\"Well, well! That's good comfort. I am thankful!\" said Mr. Lorry.\n\n\"I am thankful!\" repeated the Doctor, bending his head with reverence.\n\n\"There are two other points,\" said Mr. Lorry, \"on which I am anxious to\nbe instructed. I may go on?\"\n\n\"You cannot do your friend a better service.\" The Doctor gave him his\nhand.\n\n\"To the first, then. He is of a studious habit, and unusually energetic;\nhe applies himself with great ardour to the acquisition of professional\nknowledge, to the conducting of experiments, to many things. Now, does\nhe do too much?\"\n\n\"I think not. It may be the character of his mind, to be always in\nsingular need of occupation. That may be, in part, natural to it; in\npart, the result of affliction. The less it was occupied with healthy\nthings, the more it would be in danger of turning in the unhealthy\ndirection. He may have observed himself, and made the discovery.\"\n\n\"You are sure that he is not under too great a strain?\"\n\n\"I think I am quite sure of it.\"\n\n\"My dear Manette, if he were overworked now--\"\n\n\"My dear Lorry, I doubt if that could easily be. There has been a\nviolent stress in one direction, and it needs a counterweight.\"\n\n\"Excuse me, as a persistent man of business. Assuming for a moment,\nthat he _was_ overworked; it would show itself in some renewal of this\ndisorder?\"\n\n\"I do not think so. I do not think,\" said Doctor Manette with the\nfirmness of self-conviction, \"that anything but the one train of\nassociation would renew it. I think that, henceforth, nothing but some\nextraordinary jarring of that chord could renew it. After what has\nhappened, and after his recovery, I find it difficult to imagine any\nsuch violent sounding of that string again. I trust, and I almost\nbelieve, that the circumstances likely to renew it are exhausted.\"\n\nHe spoke with the diffidence of a man who knew how slight a thing\nwould overset the delicate organisation of the mind, and yet with the\nconfidence of a man who had slowly won his assurance out of personal\nendurance and distress. It was not for his friend to abate that\nconfidence. He professed himself more relieved and encouraged than he\nreally was, and approached his second and last point. He felt it to\nbe the most difficult of all; but, remembering his old Sunday morning\nconversation with Miss Pross, and remembering what he had seen in the\nlast nine days, he knew that he must face it.\n\n\"The occupation resumed under the influence of this passing affliction\nso happily recovered from,\" said Mr. Lorry, clearing his throat, \"we\nwill call--Blacksmith's work, Blacksmith's work. We will say, to put a\ncase and for the sake of illustration, that he had been used, in his bad\ntime, to work at a little forge. We will say that he was unexpectedly\nfound at his forge again. Is it not a pity that he should keep it by\nhim?\"\n\nThe Doctor shaded his forehead with his hand, and beat his foot\nnervously on the ground.\n\n\"He has always kept it by him,\" said Mr. Lorry, with an anxious look at\nhis friend. \"Now, would it not be better that he should let it go?\"\n\nStill, the Doctor, with shaded forehead, beat his foot nervously on the\nground.\n\n\"You do not find it easy to advise me?\" said Mr. Lorry. \"I quite\nunderstand it to be a nice question. And yet I think--\" And there he\nshook his head, and stopped.\n\n\"You see,\" said Doctor Manette, turning to him after an uneasy pause,\n\"it is very hard to explain, consistently, the innermost workings\nof this poor man's mind. He once yearned so frightfully for that\noccupation, and it was so welcome when it came; no doubt it relieved\nhis pain so much, by substituting the perplexity of the fingers for\nthe perplexity of the brain, and by substituting, as he became more\npractised, the ingenuity of the hands, for the ingenuity of the mental\ntorture; that he has never been able to bear the thought of putting it\nquite out of his reach. Even now, when I believe he is more hopeful of\nhimself than he has ever been, and even speaks of himself with a kind\nof confidence, the idea that he might need that old employment, and not\nfind it, gives him a sudden sense of terror, like that which one may\nfancy strikes to the heart of a lost child.\"\n\nHe looked like his illustration, as he raised his eyes to Mr. Lorry's\nface.\n\n\"But may not--mind! I ask for information, as a plodding man of business\nwho only deals with such material objects as guineas, shillings, and\nbank-notes--may not the retention of the thing involve the retention of\nthe idea? If the thing were gone, my dear Manette, might not the fear go\nwith it? In short, is it not a concession to the misgiving, to keep the\nforge?\"\n\nThere was another silence.\n\n\"You see, too,\" said the Doctor, tremulously, \"it is such an old\ncompanion.\"\n\n\"I would not keep it,\" said Mr. Lorry, shaking his head; for he gained\nin firmness as he saw the Doctor disquieted. \"I would recommend him to\nsacrifice it. I only want your authority. I am sure it does no good.\nCome! Give me your authority, like a dear good man.

But, I would not take\nit away while he was present.

He tells Mr. Lorry that the relapse occurs due to a painful recollection, which is alleviated by cobbling. In prison, the Doctor had taken up cobbling as a means of occupying himself and as a means of forgetting his mental anguish. The Doctor agrees to hand over his bench, cobbling tools, and material.
