Franco's death in 1975 sparked a sea change in Spanish domestic and foreign policy. Within three years, Spain moved from dictatorship to democracy. Economic reforms begun in the late Franco period were expanded and rapid economic growth ensued. Spain joined NATO in 1982 and the European Union in 1986. Spain has played an increasingly prominent role in the EU and other international bodies, with Spanish diplomats and politicians often assuming positions of leadership. The United States, looking for reliable allies in the Cold War, acquired naval and air bases in Spain in exchange for economic aid to the Franco regime. This support for Franco fed anti-American sentiment in Spain, particularly among the Spanish left. Nevertheless, it should be noted that the United States and Spain have generally maintained good relations in the post-Franco period, whether under Socialist or right-of-center governments. According to the terms of an Agreement on Defense Cooperation, the United States has retained access to several Spanish military bases, including a naval base at Rota and an airbase at Moron, which is a key transportation link between the United States and U.S. forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Socialist Party (PSOE), led by Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, has governed Spain since 2004. After unseating conservative Popular Party (PP) leader and staunch U.S. ally José María Aznar in March 2004, Zapatero and the PSOE won a second term in office in March 2008 parliamentary elections. The Socialists won 169 seats in the 350-seat Congress of Deputies, up from 164 in the previous parliament. While again falling behind the PSOE, the PP gained parliamentary seats in the 2008 election, winning 154 seats, up from148 seats. As in 2004, the Socialists are short of an absolute parliamentary majority and are again expected to form a government which will depend on the support of one or more small leftist and regional nationalist parties. Unprecedented circumstances surrounding Zapatero's 2004 election led some to challenge the legitimacy of his victory and contributed to a tense political climate during his first term. The 2004 elections came three says after Islamic terrorists bombed four commuter trains in Madrid on March 11, 2004, killing 191 persons and wounding over 1,800 others. Until the bombings, Zapatero trailed Aznar in opinion polls, and observers agree that Zapatero's victory may have been more a reflection of public disenchantment with Aznar's handling of the bombings than of public support for Zapatero. Analysts expect Zapatero to face less united conservative opposition and enjoy broader political and public support during his second term. During his first term, and despite his narrow victory, Zapatero forged ahead with actions that infuriated the PP, the Catholic Church, and conservative sectors of Spanish society. Under his leadership, Spain has legalized gay marriage and liberalized divorce. He has called for a law that would publicly assign sole blame for the bloody 1936-1939 Spanish Civil War to General Franco, and force the removal of his name from streets and towns throughout Spain. Public debate over the war, and the misdeeds of Franco's dictatorship, had been muted for more than three decades in order to permit Spain to consolidate its democracy. Zapatero has also taken controversial steps in other areas. He negotiated a wide-ranging autonomy statute with the Catalonia region, giving increased powers over tax collection, the judiciary, and other key issues to local authorities. Opponents charged that the move was unconstitutional and would lead to the breakup of the Spanish state. Zapatero has also tried to negotiate an agreement with the Basque terrorist group Basque Fatherland and Liberty (ETA) to permanently give up violence. This effort suffered a devastating blow in December 2006 when ETA exploded a bomb placed in a parking lot at the Madrid airport, killing two persons. Zapatero's political reputation took a further beating after the attack when he initially appeared reluctant to give up the negotiations. Zapatero has since acknowledged the attempt to negotiate with ETA had been a mistake, and has taken a harder line on the Basque issue, particularly after ETA officially ended a formal cease-fire in June 2007. The PP largely failed to capitalize politically on Zapatero's missteps on the ETA peace talks. Instead, the 2008 election campaign centered on a downturn in what had been a booming economy and on increasing public concern with Spain's growing immigrant population. Analysts expect Zapatero to devote most of his attention in the foreseeable future to addressing Spain's worsening economic climate. After a decade of impressive economic performance during which Gross Domestic Product exceeded 3% per year for every year except 2002, Spain is expected to experience a sharp decline in economic growth in the coming year. Spain's once booming housing sector and other areas of the economy have been hit by global financial crises and higher energy prices. As a result, analysts expect year-on-year GDP growth to drop from 3.8% in 2007 to 1.9% in 2008 and 2009. After falling to 2.7% in 2006, inflation reached 4.4% in February 2008. Unemployment is expected to rise from an estimated 8.3% in 2007 to 9.6% in 2008. Zapatero has said he will seek to boost productivity growth in part by offering tax cuts and increasing public investment. He has promised a tax rebate of 400 Euros (about $600) for all wage earners, and is expected to boost government investment in infrastructure, education, research, and development. Analysts agree that Zapatero should win broad political support for his economic policy initiatives, but many also forecast an extended economic lull. Spain has been a key base for Islamist extremists throughout Europe, including some of those who carried out the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States. In September 2005, Spain's High Court convicted a group of Islamist extremists accused of assisting in the September 11 attacks on the United States. The group's leader, Imad Eddin Barakat Yarkas, was sentenced to 27 years in prison for conspiring with the 9/11 plotters, but was cleared of charges of murder. Seventeen others were sentenced to lesser terms, mainly for membership in a terrorist group. Six defendants were acquitted. Spanish police have made progress in breaking up the terrorist cell responsible for the March 11 attack. Spanish officials determined that the Al Qaeda-linked Moroccan Islamic Combatant Group carried out the bombings. On April 3, 2004, seven men suspected of involvement in the Madrid attacks were killed when they blew themselves up after they were surrounded by police. Police found evidence that the group was ready to commit additional attacks. Twenty-nine other suspects in the 3/11 attacks—19 mostly Moroccan Arabs and nine Spaniards—went on trial in February 2007. 21 of the suspects were convicted and seven acquitted in October 2007. All had pleaded not guilty. Prime Minister Zapatero expressed his view that justice had been served during the trial. However, some analysts and victims' groups expressed frustration that the three alleged masterminds of the operation were either acquitted or handed relatively lenient sentences. Spanish police remain concerned about possible \"sleeper cells\" that may continue to operate in the country. They are particularly concerned about terrorists who leave Spain to fight against U.S. forces in Iraq and may then return to Spain or other countries to launch new attacks. In January 2006, Spanish police arrested a militant and 20 associates involved in recruiting Muslims from Spain to fight in Iraq. In January 2008, 6 suspects were arrested for allegedly plotting to attack Barcelona's public transport system. Spanish officials are worried about terrorist recruiting efforts in Ceuta and Melilla, two Spanish enclaves on Morocco's coast. More than 300 men have been imprisoned in Spain for offenses related to Islamist terrorism. France, Britain, Italy, and Spain have reportedly developed a list of about 200 suspected Islamist terrorists at liberty on European soil, 20 of whom are living in Spain. Observers believe Prime Minister Zapatero's philosophy on fighting terrorism may differ somewhat from that of the United States. Zapatero has said that he views military force as a \"last resort\" in the war on terrorism. He has stressed the need to address social and economic roots of terrorism both in Spain and in Islamic countries. He has called for an \"alliance of civilizations\" among Western countries and Islamic ones. Zapatero has underlined the need to integrate the Muslim population in Spain. Estimates of the Muslim population (mainly of Moroccan or Algerian ancestry) run from 600,000 to 1 million, out of a total Spanish population of 44 million. Most have been in Spain less than 20 years. Spain has boosted law enforcement resources devoted to fighting Islamist terrorism, a change from the period before March 11, when the main focus of Spanish efforts was on the Basque terrorist group ETA. (The 9/11 attacks had only a modest impact on Spain's counterterrorism priorities). Improvements include enhancing coordination between Spanish law enforcement and intelligence bodies, establishing an integrated database of suspects, and increasing the number of law enforcement officers and Arabic language translators. Spain has strongly backed anti-terrorist cooperation with its EU partners, although these efforts have reportedly been hampered by some countries' reluctance to share sensitive intelligence. Spain has also been eager to highlight its cooperation with the United States in fighting terrorism. In March 2005, the two countries set up a group of experts and prosecutors to improve legal and police cooperation on terrorism. Senior U.S. and Spanish officials have also met to try to improve the flow of anti-terrorism intelligence between the two countries. In November 2005, Spanish press sources claimed that CIA planes, perhaps carrying terror suspects, made at least 10 secret stopovers at Spanish airports in Majorca and the Canary Islands between January 2004 and 2005. Spanish officials replied that all flights concerned were legal under Spanish law, but pledged to be \"vigilant\" about such flights in the future. The issue is politically sensitive due to European investigations into alleged secret CIA detention facilities in Eastern Europe and abuse of detainees allegedly committed or facilitated by the United States in various parts of the world. On February 9, 2007, the Spanish government agreed to release to a Spanish High Court judge documents providing details on the secret flights. The judge is investigating whether terror suspects were held illegally or tortured in Spain. The government says that it has no evidence that such crimes took place on Spanish soil, but has conceded that the flights could have conveyed detainees to other countries where crimes were committed. U.S.-Spanish relations deteriorated after Prime Minister Zapatero took office in 2004. Zapatero has shifted Spain's foreign policy from the strongly pro-U.S. focus of the Aznar government to favoring ties with EU partners France and Germany. Zapatero has also placed more emphasis on strengthening the European Union's foreign policy role than his predecessor did. After his election victory, Zapatero strongly attacked U.S. policy on Iraq in highly undiplomatic terms, claiming that it was based on \"lies,\" and suggested that Americans vote President Bush out of office in November 2004. Since President Bush's reelection, Spain has tried to repair its relationship with the United States, including with the exchange of many high-level visits. Personal ties between President Bush and Zapatero reportedly remain cool, however. The two leaders have yet to hold a bilateral meeting. The United States and Spain enjoy important links in other areas, including increasing cultural ties between Spain and Americans of Hispanic descent, and a strong economic relationship. The United States is Spain's largest export market outside of the EU. Iraq has been a major point of tension between the United States and Spain. On April 18, 2004, the day after the new Spanish government took office, Zapatero announced the withdrawal of Spain's 1,300 troops from Iraq. In a five-minute phone call to Zapatero, President Bush expressed regret about the \"abrupt\" Spanish decision and warned against taking actions that would give \"false comfort to terrorists.\" Some U.S. officials sharply criticized the way the withdrawal was planned, saying it was done without proper coordination and in an \"unprofessional\" way that could unnecessarily jeopardize operations and lives. After the January 2005 Iraqi elections, Zapatero offered to train Iraqi soldiers in demining at a site near Madrid, as well as to contribute to a NATO trust fund to support Iraqi security forces. In October 2005, Spain's High Court issued warrants for the arrest of three U.S. soldiers for firing on a Baghdad hotel and killing a Spanish cameraman in April 2003. The men had been exonerated by a U.S. military investigation, which concluded that enemy troops had been firing from the hotel at U.S. forces. The Spanish government challenged the warrants on technical grounds, saying that the court must first rule that the case merited prosecution. The warrants were then withdrawn, but reissued in January 2007 after the High Court made such a ruling. Despite conflicts over Iraq, the United States and Spain have continued to cooperate in Afghanistan. Spain contributes about 740 troops to the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). Spain operates a Provincial Reconstruction Team in a remote region of western Afghanistan and leads a forward support base in Herat, in cooperation with Italy. The Spanish force has suffered losses. In August 2005, 17 Spanish soldiers died when their helicopter crashed during a training exercise. In 2003, Spain lost 62 peacekeepers when the plane transporting them home from Afghanistan crashed. Spain has rejected U.S. calls to send troops to southern Afghanistan, where the potential for conflict with Taliban insurgents is high. Instead, Spain has offered four unmanned aerial reconnaissance aircraft and training for the Afghan army. U.S.-Spain relations have been negatively affected by differences over Venezuela and Cuba. The Zapatero government has sought to improve ties with the leftist regimes in both countries. Spanish officials say that they are dedicated to the same human rights goals as the United States in the region, but believe that engagement, rather than isolation, is the best way to secure improvement. Spain has strong cultural ties to Latin America and Spanish firms are major investors there. Spain is a key player in EU policy toward the region, and is reported to advocate closer EU ties with Cuba. U.S. officials expressed particular concern about Spain's agreement to sell ten military transport planes and eight coast guard vessels to Venezuela. They claim it is part of an arms buildup by President Hugo Chavez that could destabilize the region. Spanish officials say that the equipment is earmarked for anti-drug trafficking operations. In January 2006, the United States blocked the sale of the planes, by refusing to permit the use of U.S. military technology in them. Spanish officials responded that the U.S. move was unjustified and that the sale would go forward after the U.S. parts were replaced by technology from other countries. However, Spain cancelled the aircraft deal in October 2006, after it failed to find the replacement parts it was seeking. In November 2006, Spain, France, and Italy proposed a peace plan for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The plan would involve a cease-fire, exchange of prisoners, and the formation of a national unity government by the Palestinians. International monitors would oversee the cease-fire, and an international conference would be held in Madrid to restart Middle East peace efforts. However, other EU countries, taken off guard by the Spanish initiative, were unenthusiastic about the plan, and it has not been adopted as EU policy. The United States did not publicly denounce the plan, but greeted it coolly. The EU, along with the United States, Russia, and the United Nations, form the \"Quartet,\" an informal group aimed at promoting an Israeli-Palestinian peace. In addition to its active role in Israeli-Palestinian peace efforts, Spain plays an important role in UNIFIL, the U.N. peacekeeping force in Lebanon.\n\n### Summary:\n\n", "answer": "In the more than three decades since the death of Spanish dictator General Francisco Franco, Spain has become a mature democracy and has experienced rapid economic growth. It has also become an increasingly important player internationally, including in NATO and the European Union. The United States and Spain have generally enjoyed good relations. However, problems have arisen in recent years over such issues as the war in Iraq, promoting democracy in Latin America, and the tactics to be used in fighting the war on terrorism.

Although these developments have led to improvements in speed and productivity, they also require the development of ways to manage information that is increasingly in electronic rather than paper form. For federal agencies, such information includes e-mail messages that may have the status of federal records. Under the Federal Records Act, each federal agency is required to make and preserve records that (1) document the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, and essential transactions of the agency and (2) provide the information necessary to protect the legal and financial rights of the government and of persons directly affected by the agency’s activities. These records, which include e-mail records, must be effectively managed. If they are not, individuals might lose access to benefits for which they are entitled, the government could be exposed to unwarranted legal liabilities, and historical records of vital interest could be lost forever. In addition, agencies with poorly managed records risk increased costs when attempting to search their records in response to Freedom of Information Act requests or litigation-related discovery actions. Accordingly, agencies are required to develop records management programs to ensure that they have appropriate recordkeeping systems with which to manage and preserve their records. Among the activities of a records management program are identifying records and sources of records and providing records management guidance, including agency-specific recordkeeping practices that establish what records need to be created in order to conduct agency business. Agencies are also required to schedule their records: that is, to identify and inventory records, appraise their value, determine whether they are temporary or permanent, and determine how long the temporary records should be kept. The act also gives the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) responsibilities for oversight and guidance of federal records management, which includes management of e-mail records. NARA works with agencies to schedule records, and it must approve all records schedules. Records schedules may be specific to an agency, or they may be general, covering records common to several or all agencies. According to NARA, records covered by general records schedules make up about a third of all federal records. For the other two thirds, NARA and the agencies must agree upon specific records schedules. No record may be destroyed unless it has been scheduled. For temporary records, the schedule is of critical importance, because it provides the authority to dispose of the record after a specified time period. (For example, General Records Schedule 1, Civilian Personnel Records, provides instructions on retaining case files for merit promotions; agencies may destroy these records 2 years after the personnel action is completed, or after an audit by the Office of Personnel Management, whichever is sooner.) Once a schedule has been approved, the agency must issue it as a management directive, train employees in its use, and apply its provisions to temporary and permanent records. NARA has issued regulations that specifically address the management of e-mail records. As with other records, agencies are required to establish policies and procedures that provide for appropriate retention and disposition of e-mail records. NARA further specified that for each e-mail record, agencies must preserve certain transmission data—names of sender and addressees and message date. Further, except for a limited category of “transitory” e-mail records, agencies are not permitted to store the recordkeeping copy of e-mail records in the e-mail system, unless that system has certain features, such as the ability to group records into classifications according to their business purposes and to permit easy and timely retrieval of both individual records and groupings of related records. These recordkeeping features are important to ensure that e-mail records remain both accessible and usable during their useful lives. For example, it is essential to be able to classify records according to their business purpose so that they can be retrieved in case of mission need. Further, if records cannot be retrieved easily and quickly, or they are not retained in a usable format, they do not serve the mission or historical purpose that led to their being preserved. If agencies do not keep their e-mail records in systems with the required capabilities, records may also be at increased risk of loss from inadvertent or automatic deletion. If agency e-mail systems do not have the required recordkeeping features, either agencies must copy e-mail records to a separate electronic recordkeeping system, or they must print e-mail messages (including associated transmission information that is needed for purposes of context) and file the copies in traditional paper recordkeeping files. NARA’s regulations allow agencies to use either paper or electronic recordkeeping systems for record copies of e- mail messages, depending on the agencies’ business needs. The advantages of using a paper-based system for record copies of e-mails are that it takes advantage of the recordkeeping system already in place for the agency’s paper files and requires little or no technological investment. The disadvantages are that a paper-based approach depends on manual processes and requires electronic material to be converted to paper, potentially losing some features of the electronic original; such manual processes may be especially burdensome if the volume of e-mail records is large. The advantage of using an electronic recordkeeping system, besides avoiding the need to manage paper, is that it can be designed to capture certain required data (such as transmission data) automatically. Electronic recordkeeping systems also make searches for records on particular topics much more efficient. In addition, electronic systems that are integrated with other applications may have features that make it easier for the user to identify records, and potentially could provide automatic or partially automatic classification functions. However, as with other information technology investments, acquiring an electronic recordkeeping system requires careful planning and analysis of agency requirements and business processes; in addition, electronic recordkeeping raises the issue of maintaining electronic information in an accessible form throughout its useful life. Because of its nature, e-mail can present particular challenges to records management. First, the information contained in e-mail records is not uniform: it may concern any subject or function and document various types of transactions. As a result, in many cases, decisions on which e-mail messages are records must be made individually. Second, the transmission data associated with an e- mail record—including information about the senders and receivers of messages, the date and time the message was sent, and any attachments to the messages—may be crucial to understanding the context of the record. Third, a given message may be part of an exchange of messages between two or more people within or outside an agency, or even of a string (sometimes branching) of many messages sent and received on a given topic. In such cases, agency staff need to decide which message or messages should be considered records and who is responsible for storing them in a recordkeeping system. Finally, the large number of federal e-mail users and high volume of e-mails increase the management challenge. According to NARA, the use of e-mail results in more records being created than in the past, as it often replaces phone conversations and face-to-face meetings that might not have been otherwise recorded. These challenges have been recognized by NARA and the records management community in numerous studies and articles. A 2001 survey of federal recordkeeping practices conducted by a contractor for NARA concluded, among other things, that managing e-mail was a major records management problem and that the quality of recordkeeping varied considerably across agencies. In addition, the study concluded that for many federal employees, the concept of a “record” and what should be scheduled and preserved was not clear. A 2005 NARA-sponsored survey of federal agencies’ policy and practices for electronic records management concluded that procedures for managing e-mail were underdeveloped. The study, performed by the University of Maryland Center for Information Policy, stated that most of the surveyed offices had not developed electronic recordkeeping systems, but were instead maintaining recordkeeping copies of e-mail and other electronic documents in paper format. However, all of the offices also maintained electronic records (frequently electronic duplicates of paper records). According to the study team, the agencies did not establish electronic recordkeeping systems due to financial constraints, and implementing such systems was a considerable challenge that increased with the size of the agency. As a result, organizations were maintaining unsynchronized parallel paper and electronic systems, resulting in extra work, confusion regarding which is the recordkeeping copy, and retention of many records beyond their disposition date. Most recently, a NARA study team examined in 2007 the experiences of five federal agencies (including itself) with electronic records management applications, with a particular emphasis on how these organizations used these applications to manage e-mail. The purpose of the study was to gather information on the strategies that organizations are using that may be useful to others. Among the major conclusions from the survey was that implementing an electronic records management application requires considerable effort in planning, testing, and implementation, and that although the functionality of the software product itself is important, other factors are also crucial, including agency culture, training provided, and management and information technology support. With regard to e-mail in particular, the survey concluded that e-mail messages can constitute the most voluminous type of record that is filed into records management applications. Our work on e-mail records management demonstrates that agencies continue to face challenges similar to those identified by the prior studies. While our results are preliminary and we are not able to project them beyond the agencies we reviewed, I believe they help illustrate the difficulties agencies can face when applying NARA’s requirements to today’s operating environment. Three of the four agencies we reviewed—FTC, DHS, and EPA—had policies in place that generally complied with NARA’s guidance on how to identify and preserve e-mail records, but each was missing one applicable requirement. Specifically, the policies at EPA and FTC did not instruct staff on the management and preservation of e- mail records sent or received from nongovernmental e-mail systems (such as commercial Web-based systems). Both EPA and FTC officials told us that these instructions were not provided because the staff were informed that use of outside e-mail systems for official business was prohibited. However, whenever access to such external systems is available at an agency, providing these instructions is still required. DHS’s policy did not specify that draft documents circulated via e-mail may be federal records. DHS officials recognized that their policies did not specifically address the need to assess the records status of draft documents, and said they planned to address the omission during an ongoing effort to revise the policies. The policy at one of the four agencies, HUD, was missing three of eight applicable requirements. One element of the policy was inconsistent with NARA’s regulation: it required only the sender of an e-mail message to review it for potential records status, but the regulation states that e-mail records could include both messages sent or received. HUD officials acknowledged that its policy omits the recipient’s responsibility for determining the record status of e- mail messages and stated that its e-mail policy fell short of fully implementing NARA regulations in this regard because the department’s practice is not to use e-mail for business matters in which official records would need to be created. However, this practice does not remove the requirement for agency employees to assess e-mail received for its record status, because the agency cannot know that employees will not receive e-mail with record status; the determination of record status depends on the content of the information, not its medium. In addition, two other requirements were missing from HUD’s policy: it did not state, as required, that recordkeeping copies of e- mail should not be stored in e-mail systems and that backup tapes should not be used for recordkeeping purposes. HUD officials stated that they considered that these requirements were met by a reference in their policy to the NARA regulations in which these requirements appear. However, this reference is not sufficient to make clear to staff that e-mail systems and backup tapes are not to be used for recordkeeping. While agency policies were generally compliant with recordkeeping regulations, these policies were not applied consistently. Specifically, for 8 of the 15 senior officials we reviewed, e-mail messages that qualified as records were not being appropriately identified and preserved. Instead, the officials generally kept every message within their e-mail systems. Each of the four agencies generally followed a print and file process to preserve e-mail records in paper-based recordkeeping systems because their e-mail systems did not have required record-keeping capabilities. Factors contributing to this lack of compliance with recordkeeping requirements were the lack of adequate staff support and the volume of e-mail received—several of these officials had thousands or even tens of thousands of messages in their e-mail system accounts. Another reason was that keeping every e-mail ensured that no information was lost, which was seen as safe from a legal standpoint. However, by keeping every message, they were potentially increasing the time and effort that would be needed to search through and review all the saved messages in response to an outside inquiry, such as a Freedom of Information Act request. In addition, by not keeping the e-mail in an appropriate recordkeeping system, these officials were making it more difficult for their agencies to find information by subject. Appropriately identifying and saving record material also allows agencies to avoid expending resources on unnecessarily preserving nonrecord material and on keeping record material beyond its usefulness (that is, beyond the date when it can be disposed of according to the records schedule). In contrast, many of the officials whose e-mail records were appropriately managed delegated responsibility for this task to one or more administrative staff members. These individuals were responsible for identifying which e-mail messages qualified as records and ensuring that the message and any attachments were preserved according to the agency’s records management policies. Generally, this required that they print the message, including any attachments and transmission information (who the message was to and from and when it was sent), and place the paper copy in a file. Printing and filing copies of e-mail records is acceptable under NARA’s regulations. However, printing copies of e-mails can lead to an agency maintaining multiple copies of the message in both paper and electronic formats, which can lead to agencies’ expending resources on duplicative storage, as well as confusion over which is the recordkeeping copy. Further, as with all electronic documents, conversion to paper entails the risk of losing some features of the electronic original. Awareness of federal records requirements is also an ongoing concern. At one department, training for senior officials on their records management responsibilities took place only at the beginning of the current administration. Officials who joined the department subsequently were not trained on records management. Similarly, several administrative staff responsible for managing the e-mail of senior officials told us that they had not been trained to recognize a record. A draft bill, the Electronic Communications Preservation Act, would mandate agencies to transition to electronic records management by requiring the Archivist of the United States to promulgate regulations governing agency preservation of electronic communications that are federal records. Among other things, the regulations would ● require the electronic capture, management, and preservation of ● require that such electronic records are readily accessible for retrieval through electronic searches; and ● require the Archivist to develop mandatory minimum functional requirements for electronic records management applications to meet the first two requirements. The legislation would also require agencies to comply with the new regulations within 4 years of enactment. Requiring a governmentwide transition to electronic recordkeeping systems could help federal agencies improve e-mail management. For example, storing e-mail records in an electronic repository could make them easier to search and potentially speed agency responses to Freedom of Information Act requests. As our review shows, agencies recognize that devoting significant resources to creating paper records from electronic sources is not a viable long- term strategy and have accordingly begun to plan or implement such a system. The 4-year deadline in the draft bill could help expedite this transition. In addition, the development of minimum functional requirements by NARA should reduce the development risk that could have resulted from multiple agencies concurrently developing similar systems. By providing time both for standards to be developed and implemented by agencies, these provisions recognize the need for a well-planned process. Like any investment in information technology, the development of electronic recordkeeping systems will have to be carefully managed to avoid unnecessary cost and performance risks. However, once implemented, such systems could potentially provide the efficiencies of automation and avoid the expenditure of resources on duplicative manual processes and storage. In summary, the increasing use of e-mail is resulting in records management challenges for federal agencies. For example, the large number of federal e-mail users and the high volume of e-mails present challenges, particularly in the current paper-based environment. While agency e-mail policies generally contained required elements, about half of the senior officials we reviewed were not following these policies and were instead maintaining their e-mail messages within their e-mail accounts, where records cannot be efficiently searched, are not accessible to others who might need the information in the records, and are at increased risk of loss. Several agencies are considering developing electronic recordkeeping systems, but until such systems are implemented, agencies may have reduced assurance that information that is essential to protecting the rights of individuals and the federal government is being adequately identified and preserved.

In doing so, they are potentially creating messages that have the status of federal records, which must be managed and preserved in accordance with the Federal Records Act. To carry out the records management responsibilities established in the act, agencies are to follow implementing regulations that include specific requirements for e-mail records. In view of the importance that e-mail plays in documenting government activities, GAO was asked to testify on issues relating to the preservation of electronic records, including e-mail. As agreed, GAO's statement discusses challenges facing agencies when managing their e-mail records, as well as current policies and practices for managing e-mail messages that qualify as federal records. This testimony is primarily based on preliminary results of ongoing work, in which GAO is examining, among other things, e-mail policies at four agencies of contrasting sizes and structures (the Department of Homeland Security, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Federal Trade Commission, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development), as well as the practices of selected senior officials. E-mail, because of its nature, presents challenges to records management. First, the information contained in e-mail records is not uniform: it may concern any subject or function and document various types of transactions. As a result, in many cases, decisions on which e-mail messages are records must be made individually. Second, the transmission data associated with an e-mail record--including information about the senders and receivers of messages, the date and time the message was sent, and any attachments to the messages--may be crucial to understanding the context of the record. Third, a given message may be part of an exchange of messages between two or more people within or outside an agency, or even of a string (sometimes branching) of many messages sent and received on a given topic. In such cases, agency staff need to decide which message or messages should be considered records and who is responsible for storing them in a recordkeeping system. Finally, the large number of federal e-mail users and high volume of e-mails increase the management challenge. Preliminary results of GAO's ongoing review of e-mail records management at four agencies show that not all are meeting the challenges posed by e-mail records. Although the four agencies' e-mail records management policies addressed, with a few exceptions, the regulatory requirements, these requirements were not always met for the senior officials whose e-mail practices were reviewed. Each of the four agencies generally followed a print and file process to preserve e-mail records in paper-based recordkeeping systems, but for about half of the senior officials, e-mail records were not being appropriately identified and preserved in such systems. Instead, e-mail messages were being retained in e-mail systems that lacked recordkeeping capabilities. (Among other things, a recordkeeping system allows related records to be grouped into classifications according to their business purposes.) Unless they have recordkeeping capabilities, e-mail systems may not permit easy and timely retrieval of groupings of related records or individual records. Further, keeping large numbers of record and nonrecord messages in e-mail systems potentially increases the time and effort needed to search for information in response to a business need or an outside inquiry, such as a Freedom of Information Act request. Factors contributing to this practice were the lack of adequate staff support and the volume of e-mail received. In addition, agencies had not ensured that officials and their responsible staff received training in recordkeeping requirements for e-mail. If recordkeeping requirements are not followed, agencies cannot be assured that records, including information essential to protecting the rights of individuals and the federal government, is being adequately identified and preserved."}

Currently, most biofuels are derived from corn and soybeans. Ethanol is the most commonly produced biofuel in the United States, and about 98 percent of it is made from corn that is grown primarily in the Midwest. Corn is converted to ethanol at biorefineries through a fermentation process and requires water inputs and outputs at various stages of the production process—from growth of the feedstock to conversion into ethanol. While ethanol is primarily produced from corn grains, next generation biofuels, such as cellulosic ethanol and algae-based fuels, are being promoted for various reasons including their potential to boost the nation’s energy independence and lessen environmental impacts, including on water. Cellulosic feedstocks include annual or perennial energy crops such as switchgrass, forage sorghum, and miscanthus; agricultural residues such as corn stover (the cobs, stalks, leaves, and husks of corn plants); and forest residues such as forest thinnings or chips from lumber mills. Some small biorefineries have begun to process cellulosic feedstocks on a pilot-scale basis; however, no commercial-scale facilities are currently operating in the United States. In light of the federal renewable fuel standard’s requirements for cellulosic ethanol starting in 2010, DOE is providing $272 million to support the cost of constructing four small biorefineries that will process cellulosic feedstocks. In addition, in recent years, researchers have begun to explore the use of algae as a biofuel feedstock. Algae produce oil that can be extracted and refined into biodiesel and has a potential yield per acre that is estimated to be 10 to 20 times higher than the next closest quality feedstock. Algae can be cultivated in open ponds or in closed systems using large raceways of plastic bags containing water and algae. Thermoelectric power plants use a fuel source—for example, coal, natural gas, nuclear material such as uranium, or the sun— to boil water to produce steam. The steam turns a turbine connected to a generator that produces electricity. Traditionally, water has been withdrawn from a river or other water source to cool the steam back into liquid so it may be reused to produce additional electricity. Most of the water used by a traditional thermoelectric power plant is for this cooling process, but water may also be needed for other purposes in the plant such as for pollution control equipment. In 2000, thermoelectric power plants accounted for 39 percent of total U.S. freshwater withdrawals. EIA annually reports data on the water withdrawals, consumption and discharges of power plants of a certain size, as well as some information on water source and cooling technology type. These data are used by federal agencies and other researchers in estimating the overall power plant water use and determining how this use has and will continue to change. Our work to date indicates that while the water supply and water quality effects of producing corn-based ethanol are fairly well understood, less is known about the effects of the next generation of feedstocks and fuels. The cultivation of corn for ethanol production can require substantial quantities of water—from 7 to 321 gallons per gallon of ethanol produced—depending on where it is grown and how much irrigation water is used. Furthermore, corn is a relatively resource-intensive crop, requiring higher rates of fertilizer and pesticide applications than many other crops; some experts believe that additional corn production for biofuels conversion will lead to an increase in fertilizer and sediment runoff and in the number of impaired streams and other water bodies. Some researchers and conservation officials have told us that the impact of corn-based ethanol on water supply and water quality could be mitigated through research into developing additional drought-tolerant and more nutrient-efficient crop varieties thereby decreasing the amount of water needed for irrigation and the amount of fertilizer that needs to be applied. Furthermore, experts also mentioned the need for additional data on current aquifer water supplies and research on the potential of biofuel cultivation to strain these water sources. In contrast to corn-based ethanol, our work to date indicates that much less is known about the effects that large-scale cultivation of cellulosic feedstocks will have on water supplies and water quality. Since potential cellulosic feedstocks have not been grown commercially to date, there is little information on the cumulative water, nutrient, and pesticide needs of these crops, and it is not yet known what agricultural practices will actually be used to cultivate these feedstocks on a commercial scale. For example, while some experts assume that perennial feedstocks will be rainfed, other experts have pointed out that to achieve maximum yields for cellulosic crops, farmers may need to irrigate these crops. Furthermore, because water supplies vary regionally, additional research is needed to better understand geographical influences on feedstock production. For example, the additional withdrawals in states relying heavily on irrigation for agriculture, such as Nebraska, may place new demands on the Ogallala Aquifer, an already strained resource from which eight states draw water. In addition, if agricultural residues—such as corn stover—are to be used, this could negatively affect soil quality, increase the need for fertilizer, and lead to increased sediment runoff to waterways. Considerable uncertainty exists regarding the maximum amount of residue that can be removed for biofuels production while maintaining soil and water quality. USDA, DOE, and some academic researchers are attempting to develop new projections on how much residue can be removed without compromising soil quality, but sufficient data are not yet available to inform their efforts, and it may take several years to accumulate such data and disseminate it to farmers for implementation. Experts we spoke with generally agree that more research on how to produce cellulosic feedstocks in a sustainable way is needed. Our work also indicates that even less is known about newer biofuels feedstocks such as algae. Algae have the added advantage of being able to use lower-quality water for cultivation, according to experts. However, the impact on water supply and water quality will ultimately depend on which cultivation methods are determined to be the most viable. Therefore, research is needed on how best to cultivate this feedstock in order to maximize its potential as a biofuel feedstock and limit its potential impacts on water resources. Other areas we have identified that relate to water and algae cultivation in need of additional research include: Oil extraction. Additional research is needed on how to extract the oil from the algal cell in such a way as to preserve the water contained in the cell along with the oil, thereby allowing some of that water to be recycled back into the cultivation process. Contaminants. Information is needed on how to manage the contaminants that are found in the algal cultivation water and how any resulting wastewater should be handled. Uncertainty also exists regarding the water supply impacts of converting feedstocks into biofuels. Biorefineries require water for processing the fuel and need to draw from existing water resources. Water consumed in the corn-ethanol conversion process has declined over time with improved equipment and energy efficient design, according to a 2009 Argonne National Laboratory study, and is currently estimated at 3 gallons of water required for each gallon of ethanol produced. However, the primary source of freshwater for most existing corn ethanol plants is from local groundwater aquifers and some of these aquifers are not readily replenished. For the conversion of cellulosic feedstocks, the amount of water consumed is less defined and will depend on the process and on technological advancements that improve the efficiency with which water is used. Current estimates range from 1.9 to 5.9 gallons of water, depending on the technology used. Some experts we spoke with said that greater research is needed on how to manage the full water needs of biorefineries and reduce these needs further. Similar to current and next generation feedstock cultivation, additional research is also needed to better understand the impact of biorefinery withdrawals on aquifers and to consider potential resource strains when siting these facilities. Our work to date also indicates that additional research is needed on the storage and distribution of biofuels. Ethanol is highly corrosive and poses a risk of damage to pipelines, and underground and above-ground storage tanks, which could in turn lead to releases to the environment that may contaminate groundwater, among other issues. These leaks can be the result of biofuel blends being stored in incompatible tank systems—those that have not been certified to handle fuel blends containing more than 10 percent ethanol. While EPA currently has some research under way, additional study is needed into the compatibility of higher fuel blends, such as those containing 15 percent ethanol, with the existing fueling infrastructure. To overcome potential compatibility issues, future research is needed on other conversion technologies that can be used to produce renewable and advanced fuels that are capable of being used in the existing infrastructure. In our work to date, we have found (1) the use of advanced cooling technologies can reduce freshwater use at thermoelectric power plants, but federal data may not fully capture this industry change; (2) the use of alternative water sources can also reduce freshwater use, but federal data may not systematically capture this change; and (3) federal research under way is focused on examining efforts to reduce the use of freshwater in thermoelectric power plants. Advanced cooling technologies offer the promise to reduce freshwater use by thermoelectric power plants. Unlike traditional cooling technologies that use water to cool the steam in power plants, advanced cooling technologies carry out all or part of the cooling process using air. According to power plant developers, they consider using these water- conserving technologies in new plants, particularly in areas with limited available water supplies. While these technologies can significantly reduce the amount of water used in a plant—and in some cases eliminate the use of water for cooling—their use entails a number of challenges. For example, plants using advanced cooling technologies may cost more to build and operate; require more land; and, because these technologies can consume a significant amount of energy themselves, witness lower net electricity output—especially in hot, dry conditions. However, eliminating or minimizing freshwater use by incorporating an advanced cooling technology provides a number of potential benefits to plant developers, including minimizing the costs associated with acquiring, transporting, and treating water, as well as eliminating impacts on the environment associated with water withdrawals, consumption, and discharge. In addition, the use of these advanced cooling technologies may provide the flexibility to build power plants in locations not near a source of water. For these reasons, a number of power plant developers in the United States and across the world have adopted advanced cooling technologies, but according to EIA officials, the agency’s forms have not been designed to collect information on the use of advanced cooling technologies. Moreover, the instruments the agency uses to collect these data were developed many years ago and have not been recently updated. EIA officials have told us that while some plants may choose to report this information, they may not do so consistently or in such a way that allows comprehensive identification of the universe of plants using advanced cooling technologies. Water experts and federal agencies we spoke to during the course of our work identified value in the annual EIA data on cooling technologies, but some explained that not having data on advanced cooling technologies limits public understanding of their prevalence and analysis of the extent to which their adoption results in a significant reduction in freshwater use. According to EIA officials, the agency is currently redesigning the instrument it uses to collect these data and expects to begin using the revised instrument in 2011. In addition, during the course of our work we noted that in 2002, EIA discontinued reporting water-related data for nuclear power plants, including water use and cooling technology. As we develop our final report, we will be looking at various suggestions that we can make to DOE to improve its data collection efforts. Our work to date also indicates that the use of alternative water sources can substantially reduce or eliminate the need to use freshwater for power plant cooling at an individual plant. Alternative water sources that may be usable for power plant cooling include treated effluent from sewage treatment plants; groundwater that is unsuitable for drinking or irrigation because it is high in salts or other impurities; industrial water, such as water generated when extracting minerals like oil, gas, and coal; and others. Use of these alternative water sources can ease the development process where freshwater sources are in short supply and lower the costs associated with obtaining and using freshwater when freshwater is expensive. Because of these advantages, alternative water sources play an increasingly important role in reducing power plant reliance on freshwater, but can pose challenges, including requiring special treatment to avoid adverse effects on cooling equipment, requiring additional efforts to comply with relevant regulations, and limiting the potential locations of power plants to those nearby an alternative water source. These challenges are similar to those faced by power plants that use freshwater, but they may be exacerbated by the lower quality of alternative water sources. Power plant developers we spoke with told us they routinely consider use of alternative water sources when developing their power plant proposals. Moreover, a 2007 report by Argonne National Laboratory indicates that the use of treated municipal wastewater at power plants has become more common, with 38 percent of power plants after 2000 using reclaimed water. EIA collects annual data from power plants on their water use and water source. However, according to EIA officials, while some plants report using an alternative water source, many may not be reporting such information since EIA’s data collection form was not designed to collect data on these freshwater alternatives. One expert we spoke with told us that not having data on the use of alternative water sources at power plants limits public understanding of these trends and the extent to which these approaches are effective in reducing freshwater use. As we develop our final report, we plan to also develop suggestions for DOE that can improve this data gathering process. Power plant developers may choose to reduce their use of freshwater for a number of reasons, such as when freshwater is unavailable or costly to obtain, to comply with regulatory requirements, or to address public concern. However, a developer’s decision to deploy an advanced cooling technology or an alternative water source depends on an evaluation of the tradeoffs between the water savings and other benefits these alternatives offer and the cost involved. For example, where water is unavailable or prohibitively expensive, power plant developers may determine that despite the challenges, advanced cooling technologies or alternative water sources offer the best option for getting a potentially profitable plant built in a specific area. While private developers make key decisions on what types of power plants to build and where to build them, and how to cool them based on their views of the costs and benefits of various alternatives, government research and development can be a tool to further the use of alternative cooling technologies and alternative water supplies. In this regard, the Department of Energy’s National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) plays a central role in DOE’s research and development effort. In recent years, NETL has funded research and development projects through its Innovations for Existing Plants program aimed at minimizing the challenges of deploying advanced cooling technologies and using alternative water sources at existing plants, among other things. In 2008, DOE awarded about $9 million to support research and development of projects that, among other things, could improve the performance of advanced cooling technologies, recover water used to reduce emissions of air pollutants at coal plants for reuse, and facilitate the use of alternative water sources such as polluted water for cooling. Such research endeavors, if successful, could alter the trade-off analysis power plant developers conduct in favor of nontraditional alternatives to cooling. Ensuring sufficient supplies of energy and water will be essential to meeting the demands of the 21st century. This task will be particularly difficult, given the interdependency between energy production and water supply and water quality and the strains that both these resources currently face. DOE, together with other federal agencies, has a key role to play in providing key information, helping to identify ways to improve the productivity of both energy and water, partnering with industry to develop technologies that can lower costs, and analyzing what progress has been made along the way. While we recognize that DOE currently has a number of ongoing research efforts to develop information and technologies that will address various aspects of the energy-water nexus, our work indicates that there are a number of areas to focus future research and development efforts. Investments in these areas will provide information to help ensure that we are balancing energy independence and security with effective management of our freshwater resources.

However, both water and energy may face serious constraints as demand for these vital resources continues to rise. Two examples that demonstrate the link between water and energy are the cultivation and conversion of feedstocks, such as corn, switchgrass, and algae, into biofuels; and the production of electricity by thermoelectric power plants, which rely on large quantities of water for cooling during electricity generation. At the request of this committee, GAO has undertaken three ongoing studies focusing on the water-energy nexus related to (1) biofuels and water, (2) thermoelectric power plants and water, and (3) oil shale and water. For this testimony, GAO is providing key themes that have emerged from its work to date on the research and development and data needs with regard to the production of biofuels and electricity and their linkage with water. GAO's work on oil shale is in its preliminary stages and further information will be available on this aspect of the energy-water nexus later this year. While the effects of producing corn-based ethanol on water supply and water quality are fairly well understood, less is known about the effects of the next generation of biofuel feedstocks. Corn cultivation for ethanol production can require from 7 to 321 gallons of water per gallon of ethanol produced, depending on where it is grown and how much irrigation is needed. Corn is also a relatively resource-intensive crop, requiring higher rates of fertilizer and pesticides than many other crops. In contrast, little is known about the effects of large-scale cultivation of next generation feedstocks, such as cellulosic crops. Since these feedstocks have not been grown commercially to date, there are little data on the cumulative water, nutrient, and pesticide needs of these crops and on the amount of these crops that could be harvested as a biofuel feedstock without compromising soil and water quality. Uncertainty also exists regarding the water supply impacts of converting cellulosic feedstocks into biofuels. While water usage in the corn-based ethanol conversion process has been declining and is currently estimated at 3 gallons of water per gallon of ethanol, the amount of water consumed in the conversion of cellulosic feedstocks is less defined and will depend on the process and on technological advancements that improve the efficiency with which water is used. Finally, additional research is needed on the storage and distribution of biofuels. For example, to overcome incompatibility issues between the ethanol and the current fueling and distribution infrastructure, research is needed on conversion technologies that can be used to produce renewable fuels capable of being used in the existing infrastructure. With regard to power plants, GAO has found that key efforts to reduce use of freshwater at power plants are under way but may not be fully captured in existing federal data. In particular, advanced cooling technologies that use air, not water, for cooling the plant, can sharply reduce or even eliminate the use of freshwater, thereby reducing the costs associated with procuring water. However, plants using these technologies may cost more to build and witness lower net electricity output--especially in hot, dry conditions. Nevertheless, a number of power plant developers in the United States have adopted advanced cooling technologies, but current federal data collection efforts may not fully document this emerging trend. Similarly, plants can use alternative water supplies such as treated waste water from municipal sewage plants to sharply reduce their use of freshwater. Use of these alternative water sources can also lower the costs associated with obtaining and using freshwater when freshwater is expensive, but pose other challenges, including requiring special treatment to avoid adverse effects on cooling equipment. Alternative water sources play an increasingly important role in reducing power plant reliance on freshwater, but federal data collection efforts do not systematically collect data on the use of these water sources by power plants. To help improve the use of alternatives to freshwater, in 2008, the Department of Energy awarded about $9 million to examine among other things, improving the performance of advanced cooling technologies. Such research is needed to help identify cost effective alternatives to traditional cooling technologies."}

We will discuss experiences of other postal administrations that are particularly relevant to any future decisions by Congress affecting (1) public service obligations, such as universal service and uniform rates; (2) the postal monopoly; and (3) regulation of postal prices. My testimony is based primarily on our past and ongoing work relating to the responsibility of the U.S. Postal Service to provide uniform service to all communities in an increasingly competitive postal environment, as well as on issues involving the postal monopoly and postal rate setting in this country. We have also done limited work on other countries’ postal administrations. To date, we have focused most of our attention on Canada Post. Canada’s experience is especially relevant because of its proximity to the United States and its similarities in geographic size, business environment, and market-oriented economic systems. I will also refer to postal administrations in seven other countries on which we obtained data: Australia, France, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. These countries, along with Canada, have been described by Price Waterhouse in a recent study as among the most “progressive postal administrations,” and most of them have undergone reforms that changed their structure and operations in the past decade. Our testimony relating to other countries’ experiences is based primarily on that study as well as data readily available from the other countries’ postal administrations. While we believe that the overall experiences of other countries’ postal administrations are relevant to the current discussions of postal reform in the United States, meaningful comparisons of the specific operational practices followed and performance results can be difficult. Compared to each of the eight other postal administrations, the U.S. Postal Service has at least seven times the mail volume, and at least twice the number of employees. All eight postal services combined have only one-half of the U.S. Postal Service mail volume, and just slightly more than the total number of its employees. The U.S. Postal Service handled about 180 billion pieces of mail in fiscal year 1995 and had over 850,000 employees in December 1995. By comparison, Canada Post has about 6 percent of the U.S. Postal Service’s mail volume and about 6 percent of its number of employees. I have appended to my statement two graphics that illustrate the differences in mail volume and employment between the U.S. Postal Service and the other eight postal administrations. Notwithstanding the differences in workforce size and mail volume, other countries’ experiences with granting their postal administrations greater commercial freedom are relevant to current consideration for granting such freedom in the United States. For example, in 1992, we issued a report describing how the competition from both private firms and electronic communication, particularly in the expedited-service mail and package-delivery markets, may create the need for statutory changes. Similarly, according to Price Waterhouse’s February 1995 report, while many factors are driving postal reform in other countries, the increase in competition in the delivery and communications markets has, above all else, driven the changes. Various parties, including some Members of Congress and the Postmaster General, have called for fundamental changes in the laws and regulations governing the U.S. Postal Service. The Postmaster General has said that the Postal Service needs greater freedom to set postage rates, manage the postal workforce, and introduce new products and services. Private delivery firms and U.S. mailers say they want more freedom to deliver letters now protected by the statutory monopoly. In recent hearings, Congress has been presented with many ideas and some specific proposals for reforming and privatizing the Postal Service. The 1970 Postal Reorganization Act, which created the U.S. Postal Service, was the most recent major change to the laws governing the structure and operation of the postal administration in the United States. Major change has occurred more recently for some foreign postal administrations. In the past decade, a number of other countries have restructured postal administrations from entities subject to close governmental control to entities that are still owned by the government, but with less governmental control over day-to-day practices. For example, in 1981 Canada established the Canada Post Corporation, an entity owned by the Canadian government but freed from many government regulations. Reform of postal administrations also took place in New Zealand in 1987, in Australia and the Netherlands in 1989, in France in 1991, in Sweden in 1994, and in Germany in 1995. Following these reforms, postal administrations in many of these countries reported significant improvements in financial performance and service delivery. We will not discuss their performance or the effects of postal reform. However, I will highlight a key common feature—universal service—of the U.S. and other postal administrations after reform. I will also highlight variances in the characteristics of their monopolies and their ability to set postal prices. We believe that these three areas—universal service, the mail monopoly, and ratemaking—will be among the most challenging for Congress to address in any future reform of the U.S. Postal Service. The primary mission of the U.S. Postal Service, as it now exists in law, is to provide mail delivery service to persons in all communities and access to the mail system through post offices and other means. The rate for First Class mail, i.e. letters “sealed against inspection,” must be uniform for delivery anywhere in the United States. The U.S. Postal Service generally offers delivery to both urban and rural addresses six days a week. Any consideration of reforming the U.S. Postal Service will require a careful review of, and no doubt much debate on, how the current universal service mandate will be affected. In all of the other eight countries, the postal administrations provided certain services widely to their citizens and at uniform rates before reform and continued to provide them following reform. However, the definition of universal mail service varies somewhat from country to country. Some of the countries provided the same level of service for urban and rural customers, while some others had different service standards for urban and rural areas. For example, although Canada Post is required by law to maintain service that meets the needs of Canadian citizens, the service only needs to be similar for communities of the same size. Canadian citizens in very remote areas in the far north may receive mail delivery less frequently each week than those in some other areas of Canada. In some countries, changes in universal service practices, involving such areas as the frequency of delivery and access to post office services, have been controversial. For example, in New Zealand, citizens in rural communities were upset when they learned New Zealand Post wanted to discontinue delivery services to rural addresses. The Post then increased a long-standing rural delivery fee for service, paid by the addressee; this decision proved unpopular, and the fee was eliminated in 1995. There continues to be no rural delivery fee in New Zealand. Accessibility to postal services, which includes maintenance of local post offices in the United States, is also part of the public service obligation of postal administrations in some other countries. The U.S. Postal Service must follow strict legal criteria in determining whether to close post offices. In New Zealand, the postal administration has negotiated a written agreement with the government that specifies the minimum number of postal retail outlets. In the Netherlands, Dutch law specifies minimum requirements regarding the density of post offices in urban and rural areas. Five of the eight countries’ postal administrations differ from the U.S. Postal Service in that a majority of their postal retail outlets are privately owned and operated, according to the February 1995 Price Waterhouse report. This group includes Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. Except for the French postal administration, all of the eight foreign postal administrations have some form of franchising policy for postal retail services. Like the U.S. Postal Service, other postal administrations have also continued to provide certain subsidized services. For example, in Canada, the government compensates Canada Post for providing subsidized rates for publications, parliamentary mail, and literature for the blind. In Sweden, the government subsidizes certain services, such as free delivery of literature to the blind, while the postal service subsidizes the distribution of certain newspapers and provides discounts on association letters. We plan to issue a report shortly on the U.S. Postal Service’s role in the international mail market, including issues that have been raised by both the U.S. Postal Service and its major competitors, such as Federal Express and DHL Airways. The Postal Service participates in the Universal Postal Union, a specialized agency of the United Nations that governs international postal services. Its basic purpose is to help postal administrations fulfill statutory universal service obligations on an international level. A total of 189 Universal Postal Union member countries have agreed to accept mail from each other and to deliver the international mail to its final destination. The Postal Service has said that current universal service obligations and related public service mandates can only be met if its markets continue to be statutorily protected by the Private Express Statutes that provide the Service with a monopoly over letter mail. We plan to issue a report in the coming months that discusses the Postal Service’s monopoly in detail, including the growth since 1970 of private delivery firms that are competing and will likely compete more strongly in the future for some of the Service’s First-Class, Priority, and Third-Class mail. The postal monopoly is defined differently and varies widely in scope among the eight foreign postal administrations. In this country, the letter mail monopoly helps ensure that the Postal Service has sufficient revenues to carry out public service mandates, including universal service. The U.S. postal monopoly covers all letter mail, with some key regulatory exceptions being “extremely urgent” letters (generally next-day delivery) and outbound international letters. Postal Service data indicates that, in fiscal year 1995, at least 80 percent of the Postal Service’s total mail volume was covered by the postal monopoly. All but one (Sweden) of the eight countries’ postal administrations have monopolies over some aspects of the letter mail. Generally, the letter monopolies in other countries are defined according to price, weight, urgency of delivery, or a combination of these factors. For example, in Canada, the postal monopoly covers letters, with a statutory exclusion for “urgent” letters transmitted by a messenger for a fee that is at least three times Canada’s regular rate of postage. In Germany, the monopoly covers letters priced up to 10 times Germany’s standard letter rate. The postal monopoly in France covers letters and those parcels weighing less than 1 kilogram (2.2 pounds). In the United Kingdom, the monopoly is defined by price, covering those letters and parcels with postage up to one British pound. Australia and New Zealand narrowed the scope of their postal monopolies after reform. For example, in Australia, the monopoly price threshold was reduced in 1994 from 10 times the basic stamp price to 4 times the price. Other changes were also made, such as reducing the weight threshold from 500 grams to 250 grams and the excluding of outbound international mail. Australia Post reported in its 1994 annual report that these changes “will reduce the proportion of total business revenue from reserved services from around 60 percent to about 50 percent.” It now receives a majority of its revenues from services open to competition. Australia plans a review of the remaining postal monopoly during 1996-1997. In New Zealand, the monopoly price threshold was reduced in phases over 3 years, and the government announced in November 1994 that it would introduce legislation to completely deregulate the postal market. While no final decision has been made, New Zealand Post officials said last year that they had shaped their business plans to expect an open, competitive environment. Sweden has eliminated its postal monopoly. Full competition for all postal and courier services, including the delivery of letters and parcels, has been allowed in Sweden since January 1, 1994. Sweden Post officials told us that its monopoly offered little protection of postal revenue and enforcement was not cost-effective. The Swedish government, not the postal administration, has the obligation to provide universal mail service. The U.S. Postal Service and some other postal administrations have made efforts to enforce their postal monopoly. The U.S. postal monopoly has proved difficult to enforce for a number of reasons, including objections by both mailers and competitors to the Postal Service’s audits and other enforcement actions. We were informed by Canada Post officials that Canada Post also finds its monopoly difficult to enforce. They said that, while Canada Post has taken legal action against major violators of its postal monopoly, it prefers to use other means of persuasion to get violators to comply with the law. Enforcement problems can also be related to the way the postal monopoly is defined. For example, in France, an exclusion limits the letter mail postal monopoly to private correspondences. Since letters are sealed against inspection, thus making it impossible to determine whether they are private correspondences, enforcement is difficult. Finally, a monopoly on mail box access in the United States is related to the Postal Service monopoly on delivery of letter mail. By law, mail box access is restricted to the Postal Service. In contrast, none of the eight countries we reviewed have laws that give their postal administrations exclusive access to the mail box. We issued a report late last year on postal ratemaking that updated our 1992 report, saying that, if the Postal Service is to be more competitive, it will need more flexibility in setting postal rates. In our opinion, legislative changes to the 1970 Act’s ratemaking provisions may be necessary in order to give the Postal Service greater flexibility in setting rates. In our 1992 report, we said that Congress should reexamine the 1970 Act to (1) determine whether volume discounting by the Postal Service would be considered a discriminatory pricing policy and (2) clarify the extent to which demand pricing should be considered in postal ratemaking. In our latest report, we reiterated these points and also discussed alternatives which Congress could consider for improving the ratemaking process. Postal administrations in the other eight countries appear to have greater freedom to establish and change postal rates than does the U.S. Postal Service. In Canada, only certain rates, mainly those for full-price letter mail and the mailing of publications at government-subsidized rates, must be approved by the Canadian government. In addition, rate proposals are not subject to an independent regulatory body as they are in the United States. In Canada, interested parties have an opportunity to provide information, but the rate-setting process is not public, and parties do not have access to costing data or other information underlying postal rates. In Sweden, the postal administration is free to set all prices except for the standard domestic letter; the government and the postal administration have agreed to a price cap on the domestic letter rate equal to the standard consumer rate of inflation. Similarly, in New Zealand, the postal administration is free to set prices except for standard letters, which are subject to a price cap of the country’s Consumer Price Index minus 1 percent. The Australian postal administration sets its own prices. The government can “disapprove” of the basic postage rate proposed by Australia Post. In addition, Australia Post must notify an independent authority of proposed increases in the prices of monopoly services. The authority has only an advisory role and in the past has instituted inquiries into proposed increases lasting up to 3 months. Finally, while we have focused on the three complex and interrelated issues of universal mail service, the postal monopoly, and postal rate setting, there are other issues that will also require reexamination in any future reform initiative. These include, but are not limited to, the quality of the Postal Service’s labor relations. We previously reported that Congress may need to reconsider the collective bargaining provisions of the 1970 Act if the Postal Service and its major employee organizations are unable to resolve some long-standing problems. As the Congress continues its deliberations on postal reform, we believe that it is important to examine the interrelationships of these issues and how changes addressing them may affect postal operations and related services to the American public and business.

For example, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides contribute to the formation of fine particles, and nitrogen oxides contribute to the formation of ozone. Both fine particles and ozone have been linked to respiratory illnesses. For example, fine particles have been linked to premature death, aggravated asthma, and chronic bronchitis, while ozone can inflame lung tissue and increase susceptibility to bronchitis and pneumonia. In addition to affecting health, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides reduce visibility and contribute to acid rain, which harms aquatic life and degrades forests. Carbon dioxide has been linked to increases in air and ocean temperatures. Such climate changes, by the end of the century, could cause rising sea levels, droughts, and wind and flood damage, according to the National Academy of Sciences. Electricity generating units that burn fossil fuels, along with other stationary sources (such as chemical manufacturers and petroleum refineries), and transportation sources (such as cars) emit one or all of these substances. Figure 1 compares emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and carbon dioxide from fossil-fuel units to those from other sources in 1999, the most recent year for which data for all three substances were available. While the overall proportion of each substance emitted by fossil-fuel units varied—from 67 percent of all sulfur dioxide to 23 percent of all nitrogen oxides—these units emitted more of each substance than any other industrial source in 1999. Under the Clean Air Act, EPA establishes air quality standards and regulates emissions from a number of sources, including electricity generating units that burn fossil fuels. The act required EPA to issue regulations establishing federal performance standards for new sources of air pollution within certain categories of stationary sources. Accordingly, EPA issued new source standards for certain generating units with a capacity greater than 73 megawatts that were built or modified after August 17, 1971. Over time, EPA has made the standards more stringent, subjecting other types of units and those with a lower generating capacity to the standards. The standards do not apply to older units built before that date that have not been modified, although some older units do meet the standards. In addition, under a program called New Source Review, older units must install modern pollution controls when they make “major modifications” that significantly increase their emissions. The level of control required depends on the air quality in the area where the unit is located—a unit in an area that does not meet federal air quality standards must install more stringent controls. Although older units are generally excluded from the new source standards, they are subject to the acid rain provisions of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. The 1990 amendments directed EPA to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide from electricity generating units by setting a limit, known as a “cap,” on emissions from all units and establishing an emissions trading program. Under the trading program, each unit received emissions “allowances” that represent the right to emit one ton of sulfur dioxide. The allowances may be bought, sold, or banked for use in later years, but generating unit owners or operators must own enough allowances at the end of each year to cover their annual emissions. Although the program did not start until 1995, some units affected by the program complied earlier, according to EPA, thereby reducing sulfur dioxide emissions by about 2.2 million tons between 1990 and the end of 1994. Between 1995 and the end of 2000, the affected units reduced their sulfur dioxide emissions by 2.5 million tons (from 13.7 million tons in 1994 to 11.2 million tons in 2000)—a decline of about 18 percent. EPA expects the program to result in further reductions in sulfur dioxide emissions between 2000 and 2010. To reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides, the acid rain provisions of the 1990 amendments limited the annual rate of emissions for individual units, rather than imposing an annual aggregate tonnage of emissions. To achieve emissions reductions while minimizing the burden on generators, the legislation allowed companies with multiple units to comply with the prescribed rate by averaging their emissions rates across two or more units and ensuring that the average did not exceed the prescribed rate. Thus, individual older units may continue to emit at levels above the prescribed annual emissions rate. Although the program started in 1996, some of the affected units complied earlier, according to EPA, thereby reducing emissions of nitrogen oxides by 700,000 tons between 1990 and the end of 1995. Between 1996 and the end of 2000, the affected units reduced their emissions of nitrogen oxides by 900,000 tons (from 6.0 million tons in 1995 to 5.1 million tons in 2000)—a decline of 15 percent. In 2000, older units emitted more sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides—and about the same amount of carbon dioxide—per unit of electricity produced than newer units. For each megawatt-hour of electricity generated, older units, in the aggregate, emitted about twice as much sulfur dioxide as newer units—12.7 pounds at older units, compared with 6.4 pounds at newer units. Older units also emitted about 25 percent more nitrogen oxides than newer units—4.7 pounds versus 3.8 pounds—for every megawatt-hour of electricity generated. Older and newer units both emitted about 1 ton of carbon dioxide for each megawatt-hour of electricity generated. (See fig. 2.) Overall, while generating 42 percent of the electricity, older units emitted 59 percent of the sulfur dioxide, 47 percent of the nitrogen oxides, and 42 percent of the carbon dioxide from fossil-fuel units. Units that began operating in 1972 or after were responsible for the remainder of the emissions and electricity production. Of the older units, those in the Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, and Southeast released most of the emissions, and in disproportionate quantities for the amount of electricity they produced. Specifically, older units in these regions accounted for 87 percent of the sulfur dioxide, 75 percent of the nitrogen oxides, and 70 percent of the carbon dioxide emitted from older units nationwide in 2000, while generating 67 percent of the electricity from all older units. (App. I presents, by state, data on older units’ electricity generation, emissions per megawatt-hour of electricity generated, and aggregate emissions.) Figures 3, 4, and 5 show the location of older units and the amount of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and carbon dioxide they emitted in 2000. Older units that burned coal released a disproportionate share of emissions for the electricity they produced, compared with units burning natural gas and oil. Coal-burning units emitted 99 percent of the sulfur dioxide, 88 percent of the nitrogen oxides, and 85 percent of the carbon dioxide from older units nationwide, while generating 79 percent of the total electricity from older units. Older units generally do not have to meet the standards applicable to newer units, and in 2000, many of the older units emitted sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides at levels higher than what is permitted under the standards applicable to newer units for one or both of the pollutants. In that year, 36 percent of older units emitted sulfur dioxide at levels above the new source standard for that pollutant, and 73 percent emitted nitrogen oxides at levels above the new source standard. Approximately 31 percent of all older units emitted both pollutants at levels above the new source standards. As shown in figure 6, in 2000, 34 percent of the total sulfur dioxide emissions (2.13 million of 6.34 million tons) and 60 percent of the total nitrogen oxide emissions (1.41 million of 2.35 million tons) from older units were “additional” emissions—that is, emissions at levels above the standards applicable to newer units. The additional sulfur dioxide emissions represented 20 percent of the sulfur dioxide emissions from fossil-fuel units (older and newer), and the additional emissions of nitrogen oxides represented 28 percent of the emissions of nitrogen oxides from fossil-fuel units. Most of the additional emissions—91 percent of the sulfur dioxide and 78 percent of the nitrogen oxides—came from units located in the Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, and Southeast. Figures 7 and 8 show the level of additional emissions at older units in 2000. The majority of these emissions—99 percent of the sulfur dioxide and 91 percent of the nitrogen oxides—were from coal units, while other fossil fuel-burning units accounted for the remainder. As noted, the additional emissions shown in figure 6 represent the emissions by older units above the limits applicable to new sources. If the same older units had generated the same quantity of electricity in 2000 but had met the new source standards, total emissions would have been lowered by an amount equal to the computed additional emissions. However, a requirement that older units meet the standards could have reduced the quantity of electricity generated, raised the price of electricity, and/or shifted generation among units. Among other things, owners might have chosen to retire some older units rather than incur the costs of meeting the standards. According to a December 2000 Energy Information Administration study, requiring older coal units to install pollution control equipment would, by 2010, result in retirements that would reduce the nation’s coal-based electricity generating capacity by 7 percent more than is otherwise projected (and the total U.S. capacity from all fuels by 3 percent), based on 1999 capacity levels. The study projected that such a requirement would cause operators of coal units to spend $73 billion dollars to install pollution control equipment by 2020. The study also concluded that electricity prices in 2010 would be 4 percent higher with a requirement to install control equipment than they would be without one. If older units had been required to meet new source standards in 2000, to the extent practicable, other units might have increased their operations— for example, by running more hours each day—to meet the demand for electricity that would have otherwise been produced by the units that retired. Because it is not possible to determine exactly which units would have been retired or run more to meet the demand, it is not possible to quantify precisely what the emissions in 2000 would have been if all units had been required to meet the new source standards. In addition, generating units that increased production to meet the demand created by retirements could have purchased sulfur dioxide emissions allowances from the retired units. Thus, the net decrease in sulfur dioxide emissions would not have been as great as the level of additional emissions reported above. Similarly, it is difficult to predict precisely how such requirements would affect future emissions levels. Any new coal, natural gas, or oil units built to replace retired units would, at a minimum, have to meet the new source standards, which would reduce the emissions for each quantity of electricity generated. To meet the new source standards, older units would need to switch fuels, or add or upgrade pollution control equipment. Some older units already use pollution control equipment or have taken other actions to reduce their emissions of sulfur dioxide or nitrogen oxides. For example, we found that 681 older units met the sulfur dioxide standard by burning coal with low sulfur content. We also found that the use of emissions controls did not necessarily indicate that the units met the new source standards. For example, 399 older units with equipment to control their nitrogen oxide emissions still exceeded the emissions standard applicable to newer units. We provided EPA with a draft of this report for review and comment. We subsequently received comments from the Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, and the Office of Atmospheric Programs. EPA generally agreed with the information presented. Both offices suggested technical changes to the report, which we have incorporated as appropriate. To respond to the first objective, we reviewed information from the Energy Information Administration and EPA on air emissions, electricity generation, and the age of electricity generating units. While both agencies maintain such information, the data we needed for this analysis were not readily available in a user-friendly format. For example, EPA has reliable and timely emissions data, but the 2000 data were not available with information on electricity generation and the age of each unit. Because of these limitations, we obtained alternative data from Platts/RDI, a private vendor that integrates EPA’s emissions data with the Energy Information Administration’s data on electricity generation and the age of generating units. Specifically, we obtained and analyzed air emissions and electricity generation data for each active fossil-fuel unit above 15 megawatts in generating capacity that started operating before 1972. For newer units, we obtained data on aggregate national emissions and electricity generation at units with a capacity above 15 megawatts. We chose 15 megawatts as the threshold capacity because units above that capacity accounted for almost all (about 99 percent) of the electricity generation from all fossil-fuel units in 2000. Because data on air emissions and the use of control equipment were available for only 1,157 of the 1,396 active units (83 percent), the data may not fully represent the total level of emissions and the number of units using control equipment. However, the units that did not report emissions data generated less than 1 percent of the electricity from older units and therefore are not likely to have produced large quantities of emissions. To respond to the second objective, we identified the applicable new source standard for each type of unit, as listed in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 40, part 60. We then determined the difference between the actual rate of emissions at each unit, in pounds of pollutant per unit of fuel consumed, and the rate allowed under the standard that applies to newer units with the same capacity that burn the same fuel. We then multiplied the difference by the amount of fuel burned in 2000 to determine the annual level of “additional” emissions. In cases where EPA has not issued a standard for a particular type of unit, we excluded such units from our analysis of additional emissions. Regulations for some types of generating units were promulgated after 1971, but for purposes of this report we have not distinguished these units and have classified them as newer or older units based on their age. For example, EPA promulgated a regulation in 1978 requiring certain electric utility steam-generating units to meet new source standards. However, if one of these units was constructed after August 17, 1971, but before September 18, 1978, we classified it as a newer unit even though it would not have to meet the new source standard. We did not attempt to estimate the costs or benefits of requiring older units to meet the new source standards. Therefore our analysis does not allow us to comment on the economic or energy security implications of requiring older units to meet the standards. We conducted our work between October 2001 and May 2002 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the report date. At that time, we will send copies to the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce and its Subcommittee on Energy and Air Quality; the House Committee on Government Reform and its Subcommittee on Energy Policy, Natural Resources, and Regulatory Affairs; the Ranking Minority Member of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, and its Subcommittee on Clean Air, Wetlands, and Climate Change; other interested members of Congress; the Administrator, EPA; the Secretary of Energy; the Director of the Office of Management and Budget; and other interested parties.

In addition to the individuals named above, Michael Hix, Chase Huntley, Vincent Price, and Laura Yannayon made key contributions to this report\n\n### Summary:\n\n", "answer": "Although fossil fuels--coal, natural gas, and oil--account for more than two thirds of the nation's electricity, generating units that burn these fuels are major sources of airborne emissions that pose health and environmental risks. To limit emissions and protect air quality, the Environmental Protection Agency regulates emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides from a variety of sources including electricity generating units that burn fossil fuels, other industrial sources, and automobiles. Older electricity generating units--those that began operating before 1972--emit 59 percent of the sulfur dioxide, 47 percent of the nitrogen oxides, and 42 percent of all electricity produced by fossil-fuel units. Units that began operating in or after 1972 are responsible for the remainder of the emissions and electricity production. For equal quantities of electricity generated, older units, in the aggregate, emitted twice as much sulfur dioxide and 25 percent more nitrogen oxides than newer units which must meet the new source standards for these substances. Older and newer units emitted about the same amount of carbon dioxide for equal quantities of electricity generated. Of the older units, those in the Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, and Southeast produced the majority of the emissions, and in disproportionate quantities for the amount of electricity they generated compared with units located in other parts of the country. Older units that burned coal released a disproportionate share of emissions for the electricity they produced compared with units burning natural gas and oil. Thirty-six percent of older units, in 2000, emitted sulfur dioxide at levels above the new source standards applicable to newer units, and 73 percent emitted nitrogen oxides at levels above the standards. These \"additional\" emissions--those above the standards for newer units--accounted for 34 percent of the sulfur dioxide and 60 percent of the nitrogen oxides produced by older units. Coal-burning units emitted 99 percent of the additional sulfur dioxide and 91 percent of the additional nitrogen oxides, while other fossil fuel-burning units accounted for the remainder."}
{"original_length": 4130, "trunc_length": 4096, "text": "\n\nSummarize the following text into a summary of less than 800 words.\n### Text:\n\nOur work on patent examination issues, which was performed at this Committee’s request, is discussed in detail in our July 15, 1996, report entitled Intellectual Property: Enhancements Needed in Computing and Reporting Patent Examination Statistics (GAO/RCED-96-190). This section of our statement discusses the following three areas: (1) patent pendency—the amount of time that PTO spends in examining an application to determine whether an invention should receive a patent; (2) PTO’s resources committed to the patent process, the trademark process, the dissemination of information, and executive direction and administration; and (3) PTO’s workload and examination process in comparison with those of other industrialized countries. The importance of the issues addressed in our report has increased over the past year because of new legislation affecting the term of most patents. Public Law 103-465, enacted December 8, 1994, changed the term for most patents granted by the United States from 17 years from the date of issuance to 20 years from the date of the earliest filing of an application. Accordingly, the time frame for issuance reduces the effective term of the patent left to the inventor under the new law. In analyzing patent pendency, we found that the overall pendency statistics being reported by PTO do not provide inventors and decisionmakers with enough information. This is particularly the case after Public Law 103-465 changed the patent term for most applications filed after June 7, 1995. We attributed this lack of information to four reasons. First, PTO’s pendency computation method considers both issued patents and abandoned applications but does not consider applications still in-process. PTO defines pendency as the period from the date when an application is filed until the date when a patent is issued or an application is abandoned. As used by PTO, an abandoned application is any application that does not result in an issued patent and is eventually taken out of the examination process by the applicant or PTO. While PTO and other decisionmakers may be interested in knowing that overall pendency in fiscal year 1994 was 20.2 months or that applications abandoned during the year were pending for an average of 18.3 months, inventors may be most interested in knowing that the average pendency for patents issued was 21.3 months. Second, pendency can vary widely for individual applications, depending on the type of invention and factors such as whether the application is subject to a secrecy order. For example, while overall pendency for fiscal year 1994 was 20.2 months, pendency in the Computer Systems area averaged 27.6 months, while pendency in the Solar, Heat, Power, and Fluid Engineering area averaged 16.9 months. Similarly, pendency for patents issued and applications abandoned that were subject to secrecy orders averaged 62.9 months, although they were so relatively few in number that they had no appreciable effect on overall pendency. As above, such variations are of importance to the inventor, who needs to know the potential examination time associated with different types of inventions and factors such as whether a secrecy order will be imposed. Third, pendency is higher when the filing date used is that of the original, rather than the most recent, application for the particular invention. Frequently, an application may spawn other applications during the examination process. PTO refers to the original application as the “parent” and any application emerging from the original as a “child.” Some cases can involve several generations of applications. PTO’s current method for computing pendency considers the filing date of the current, or child, application whereas, under the new law, the patent term will be calculated for most patents from the filing date of the parent. Thus, PTO’s method does not provide inventors and decisionmakers with an accurate appraisal of how long applications are under examination. We found that calculating pendency by using the parent filing date rather than the current filing date raises pendency significantly. For fiscal year 1994, overall pendency would have been 28 months rather than 20.2 months. Applications in process would have been under examination an average of 25 months rather than 16 months. If only those applications that had a parent were considered, the differences would have been even more dramatic—increasing from 17.9 months to 47.7 months for fiscal year 1994 and from 14.6 months to 45 months for those applications in-process as of October 1, 1994. Fourth, the applicants themselves are partly responsible for the time taken to examine applications. PTO’s current method of computing pendency includes all of the time between the filing of the application and the issuance of a patent or the abandonment of the application. It does not separate the pendency for which PTO is responsible from the pendency created by the applicant. We calculated the pendency attributable to the applicants in one area—the time taken to respond to questions raised or requests for additional information by PTO during examination. These responses accounted for an average of 3.6 months of the 20.2 months total pendency for fiscal year 1994. Subsequent to our analysis, PTO made its own analysis of other areas where the applicant caused delays and computed an additional 3.8 months for fiscal year 1994. While we did not verify PTO’s computations, adding the applicants’ delays that PTO identified to those we computed would result in about 7.4 months of the 20.2-month average pendency for fiscal year 1994 being attributable to the applicants themselves. As a result of our findings, we recommended in our report that PTO compute and report patent pendency statistics that will separately identify issued patents, abandoned applications, and applications under examination. In commenting on our recommendations, the Department of Commerce said that more was needed than just an expansion of the pendency statistics now in use. It said that by fiscal year 2003, PTO’s goal is to complete the examination of each new patent application within 12 months. The Department said that PTO would continue to report pendency as it had in the past until new procedures associated with this new 12-month goal are implemented. We agree that PTO needs to track and report pendency when its new examination policy is put into effect. However, because this new policy may not take effect for several years, we believe that PTO needs to begin reporting pendency statistics in the interim as we recommended. Furthermore, we believe this change is needed regardless of PTO’s organizational placement. In analyzing the commitment of PTO’s resources to various functions, we found that PTO has consistently committed most of its resources to the patent process. In fiscal year 1995, about three-fourths of PTO’s funding—all of which now is generated by fees—and staff were devoted to the patent process. Other major activities in PTO include the trademark process, the agency’s executive direction and administration, and the dissemination of information. PTO’s annual obligations have increased steadily in recent years. In the 10-year period from fiscal year 1986 to fiscal year 1995, PTO’s annual obligations increased from $212 million to $589 million, an average annual increase of nearly 20 percent. The increases in resources allocated to the patent process from fiscal year 1986 through fiscal 1995 do not appear to have come at the expense of PTO’s other activities. Funding and staffing for these activities also increased in most years over this period. Overall, the patent process accounted for 56.6 to 75.4 percent of the obligations in individual years, while the range was 5.4 to 8.5 percent for the trademark process, 6.4 to 20.2 percent for executive direction and administration, and 9.9 to 18.5 percent for the dissemination of information. The majority of PTO staff also was committed to the patent process during the 10-year period. In fiscal year 1986, PTO had a total of 3,180 full-time equivalent (FTE) staff; in fiscal year 1995, the total was 5,007. In individual years, the percentage of staff ranged from 58 to 75.1 percent for the patent process, 6.8 to 9.7 percent for the trademark process, 7.1 to 15.4 percent for executive direction and administration, and 8 to 22.4 percent for the dissemination of information. In comparing PTO’s patent examination process with those of other industrialized countries, we found that they differ markedly. As one example, PTO considers the examination process to have begun when the application is filed. In the Japanese Patent Office, however, an application is not considered a request for examination. Rather, the applicant must make a separate request for examination, which may come at any time up to 7 years after the application is filed. Similarly, in the European Patent Office, examination is a two-phase process. A filing is taken to imply a request for a search to determine whether the invention is new compared with the state of the art. If an applicant then desires a substantive examination for industrial applicability, the applicant must file a separate request not more than 6 months after the publication of the search. Methods for computing pendency also differ between the three patent offices. For example, Japan and Europe consider applications in process when computing pendency, while PTO considers only those applications that resulted in a patent or were abandoned. These different computation methods would yield fundamentally different results. Consequently, caution should be exercised in comparing workloads and pendency between these offices. Our work on Copyright Office issues was summarized in our May 7, 1996, testimony before the Joint Committee on the Library of Congress. In October 1995, Senators Connie Mack and Mark Hatfield asked that we conduct a broad assessment of the Library’s management by the spring of 1996. To help meet that time frame, given that our limited resources were already committed to other priority projects, we contracted with Booz-Allen & Hamilton Inc. to conduct a general management review of the Library. Among the issues that Booz-Allen addressed in its review that the Senate Committee on the Judiciary expressed interest in were: (1) the potential for the Copyright Office to be transferred from the Library of Congress to another organization; (2) the possible additional revenues that the Copyright Office could charge if it recovered all costs; and (3) the impact on the Library, including the Copyright Office, from revisions to its competitive selection process as a result of the settlement of a class-action discrimination suit. Given the era of deficit reduction in which the federal government has found itself and the need for each agency to become as efficient as possible, Booz-Allen structured its management review to include a consideration of opportunities that might exist for the Library to reduce costs and enhance revenues. Within this context, Booz-Allen looked at various aspects of the Library’s organizational components and the Library’s fee structure. One such aspect included the potential for transferring the Copyright Office from the Library to another organization. Booz-Allen considered four elements of copyright operations, including the long-standing relationship between the Library and the Copyright Office, copyright registration as a source of material for Library collections, linkages between cataloging for copyright purposes and for Library collections, and the revenue potential from copyright receipts. Booz-Allen pointed out that its scope did not include an assessment of the operations, efficiency, or effectiveness of organizations outside the Library that might be considered potential recipients of the copyright function or the benefits of transferring it elsewhere. Booz-Allen concluded that while the transfer of the Copyright Office to another organization might not have negative operational impacts, the benefits of such a move were unknown and might cause significant disruption. Booz-Allen concluded that while there was little operational reason for housing the copyright function at the Library of Congress, the physical relocation of the Copyright Office could result in the office incurring an annual cost of $800,000 for leasing facilities that are now provided by the Library or the Architect of the Capitol at no cost to the Copyright Office. Also, the Booz-Allen analysis showed that while the Library saved $13 million a year from not having to purchase material obtained through copyright deposits and that this source of materials could be legislatively protected if the copyright function were housed elsewhere, the transportation and coordination aspects of such a shift would have to be assessed and would likely impose additional costs. Booz-Allen found that although both the Library and the Copyright Office perform cataloging processes, their purposes and methods were substantially different. With regard to the fees collected by the Library for copyright registrations, which amounted to $12.6 million in fiscal year 1995, Booz-Allen noted that the Library’s fee does not recover its full cost. Booz-Allen estimated that by increasing the fee to recover full cost, the Library could generate revenue in the range of $24 million to $29 million (or an additional $11 million to $17 million over current fees charged). In developing this estimate, Booz-Allen cautioned that it was predicated on the comparison of fees received in fiscal year 1995 with its estimate of the full cost of the copyright registration process and did not take into account possible changes stemming from a fee increase, such as a potential drop in the number of registrations received. Booz-Allen also said that the effect of increasing fees could adversely affect that part of the Library’s mission that deals with building its collection. As Booz-Allen also reported, the Copyright Law provides the Library with the authority to adjust fees at 5-year intervals to reflect changes in the Consumer Price Index, but the Copyright Office has elected not to do so. In its commentary concerning the recovery of all copyright fees, Booz-Allen also pointed out that the Library would first have to (1) refine its cost data and cost assumptions for the Copyright Office to obtain better cost information and (2) establish the capability and mechanisms to handle fee changes and possible multiple fee schedules. As part of its management review, Booz-Allen studied how well the Library of Congress managed its human resources. Since this part of the study was Library-wide in nature, the findings do not relate specifically to the Copyright Office or any other components of the Library but would apply generally to the Copyright Office. Booz-Allen found that the Library’s hiring process had been adversely affected by its settlement of a class action suit, commonly referred to as the Cook Case, which asserted the Library practiced discriminatory employment practices that denied African-American employees opportunities for promotion and advancement. The settlement required the Library to revise its competitive selection process, make a specified number of promotions and reassignments, pay monetary relief to the class, provide Library supervisors with specified training, and eliminate any discriminatory criteria for noncompetitive personnel actions. As part of the Cook Case settlement, which was approved by the court in September 1995, the court reserved jurisdiction for 4 years to ensure compliance with the settlement. The settlement agreement is currently under appeal which would delay the start of the 4-year period. Booz-Allen found that while efforts to revise the competitive selection process had resulted in significant improvements in the Library’s racial/ethnic profile, the revised process was viewed by many Library managers and human resources staff as lengthy and cumbersome. Booz-Allen found that the median number of calendar days to fill vacancies during fiscal years 1993 through 1995 was 177 days at the Library. In comparison, three other agencies took from 30 to 120 days to hire employees. As a result of inefficiently hiring qualified employees, Booz-Allen found that the Library potentially loses highly qualified candidates to other jobs, employees lack trust in the system, the Library pays the additional costs of contractors and internal staff time, and the Library is not able to handle changes to recruitment and selection requirements.

Property damage from flooding now totals over $1 billion each year in the United States and floods occur within all 50 states. Nearly 9 of every 10 presidential disaster declarations result from natural phenomena in which flooding was a major component. Most communities in the United States can experience some kind of flooding after spring rains, heavy thunderstorms, or winter snow thaws. Not only do floods cause damage and loss, they can be deadly—flooding caused the deaths of about 900 people from fiscal year 1992 through fiscal year 2001. Tropical Storm Allison, which struck the Gulf Coast in June 2001, demonstrated the economic and social impact flooding can have, causing billions of dollars in damages and 41 deaths. As a result of the storm, FEMA paid out over $1 billion in insurance claims, the largest amount paid for a single event since 1978 when FEMA began to collect summary statistics on flood claims. More recently, Hurricane Isabel ravaged the Mid-Atlantic states in September 2003. Through November 30, 2003, FEMA had paid over $160 million in flood insurance claims and estimates that ultimately, flood insurance claim payments resulting from Isabel will be about $450 million. At least 40 deaths have been attributed to the storm. Floods can be slow or fast rising but generally develop over a period of days. Flash flood waters move at very fast speeds and can roll boulders, tear out trees, destroy buildings, and obliterate bridges. Walls of water can reach heights of 10 to 20 feet and generally are accompanied by a deadly cargo of debris. Flood damage causes both direct and indirect costs. Direct costs reflect immediate losses and repair costs as well as short-term costs such as flood fighting, temporary housing, and administrative assistance. By contrast, indirect costs are incurred in an extended time period following a flood and include loss of business and personal income (including permanent loss of employment), reduction in property values, increased insurance costs, loss of tax revenue, psychological trauma, and disturbance to ecosystems. In 1968, in recognition of the increasing amount of flood damage, the lack of readily available insurance for property owners, and the cost to the taxpayer for flood-related disaster relief, the Congress passed the National Flood Insurance Act (Pub. L. No. 90-448) that created the National Flood Insurance Program. Through the National Flood Insurance Program, FEMA has sought to minimize flood-related property losses by making flood insurance available on reasonable terms and encouraging its purchase by people who need flood insurance protection—particularly those living in flood prone areas. The program identifies flood prone areas in the country, makes flood insurance available to property owners in communities that participate in the program, and requires floodplain building standards to mitigate flood hazards. FEMA also seeks to mitigate flood hazards through a variety of mitigation grant programs. Under the flood insurance program, FEMA prepares flood insurance rate maps to delineate flood prone areas including special flood hazard areas— also known as 100-year floodplains—where enhanced building standards and insurance requirements apply. Currently, FEMA is in the initial stages of a billion dollar effort to update the nation’s flood maps. The Map Modernization program is intended to improve the accuracy of flood maps, put the maps in digital format to improve their accessibility, and provide the basis for assessing the impact of other hazards in support of DHS’s efforts to protect the nation from both man-made and natural disasters. For example, the maps could be used to assess the impact of toxic chemical spills on local waterways. At the request of the Chairman of the House Financial Services Subcommittee on Housing and Community Opportunity, we have been reviewing the Map Modernization program and plan to report on FEMA’s program strategy and the status of the program later this spring. Flood maps provide the basis for establishing floodplain building standards that participating communities must adopt and enforce as part of the program. For a community to participate in the program, any structures built within a special flood hazard area after the flood map was completed must be built according to the program’s building standards that are aimed at minimizing flood losses. A key component of the program’s building standards that must be followed by participating communities is a requirement that the lowest floor of the structure be elevated to or above the base flood level—the highest elevation at which there is a 1-percent chance of flooding in a given year. The administration has estimated that the program’s standards for new construction save about $1 billion annually in flood damage avoided. According to FEMA, buildings constructed in compliance with these standards suffer approximately 80 percent less damage annually than those not built according to these standards. Flood maps also provide the basis for setting insurance rates and identifying properties whose owners are required to purchase flood insurance. When the program was created, the purchase of flood insurance was voluntary. To increase the impact of the program, the Congress amended the original law in 1973 to require the purchase of flood insurance in certain circumstances. Flood insurance is required for structures in special flood hazard areas of communities participating in the program if (1) any federal loans or grants were used to acquire or build the structures or (2) the structures are secured by mortgage loans made by lending institutions that are regulated by the federal government. The National Flood Insurance Reform Act of 1994 that further amended the program also reinforced the objective of using insurance as the preferred mechanism for disaster assistance. The act expanded the role of federal agency lenders and regulators in enforcing the mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements. It also prohibited further flood disaster assistance for any property where flood insurance was not maintained even though it was mandated as a condition for receiving prior disaster assistance. Currently, the program provides insurance for approximately 4.4 million policyholders in the nearly 20,000 communities that participate in the program. The program has paid about $12 billion in insurance claims, primarily from policyholder premiums that otherwise would have been paid through taxpayer-funded disaster relief or borne by home and business owners themselves. FEMA also has a variety of grant programs designed to mitigate the effects of natural hazards, including flooding, on people and property. From October 1989 through July 2003, FEMA funded approximately 3,900 flood mitigation projects worth about $2 billion through the flood insurance program and a variety of other grant programs. Through these projects, FEMA mitigated over 29,000 properties. FEMA’s Flood Mitigation Assistance Program is funded through the flood insurance program and is designed to reduce claims under the program. Grants provided to states and communities are to be used for flood related mitigation activities such as elevation, acquisition, and relocation of buildings insured by the flood insurance program. In implementing this program, FEMA has encouraged states to prioritize project grant applications that include repetitive loss properties. In addition, FEMA provides funding for mitigation planning activities and projects before and after floods occur, respectively through the Pre-Disaster Mitigation Program and the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program. In implementing the Pre-Disaster Mitigation Program for 2003, FEMA specifically targeted projects designed to mitigate repetitive loss properties. Through the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program, FEMA estimates that it has mitigated over 2,500 repetitive loss properties through acquisitions, elevations, and other flood protection measures. The flood insurance program has raised financial concerns because, over the years, it has lost money and at times has had to borrow funds from the U.S. Treasury. One of the primary reasons—payments for repetitive loss properties—has been consistently identified in our past work and by FEMA. About 49,000—approximately 1 percent of the 4.4 million buildings currently insured under the program—have been flooded on more than one occasion during a 10-year period and have received flood insurance payments of $1,000 or more for each claim. These repetitive loss properties are problematic not only because of their vulnerability to flooding but also because of the costs of repeatedly repairing flood damages. For example, a 1998 study by the National Wildlife Federation noted that nearly 1 out of every 10 repetitive loss homes has had cumulative flood loss claims that exceeded the value of the house. According to FEMA, repetitive loss properties have accounted for about 38 percent of all program claim costs historically and are projected by FEMA to cost about $200 million annually. Since 1978, the total cost of these repetitive loss properties to the program has been about $4.6 billion. Nearly half of all nationwide repetitive loss property insurance payments had been made in Louisiana, Florida and Texas. For example, in Texas, since 1978 there have been approximately 45,000 flood claims totaling over $1 billion for repetitive damage. These 3 states, plus 12 others, have accounted for nearly 90 percent of the total payments made for repetitive loss properties. FEMA has developed a strategy to reduce the number of properties repeatedly flooded that, like congressional proposals, seeks to target repetitive loss properties with the greatest losses. FEMA’s strategy identifies the highest priority properties, for example those with four or more losses, that would benefit from mitigation activities designed to remove them altogether from the floodplains, elevate them above the reach of floodwaters, or apply other measures that would significantly reduce their exposure to flood risk. According to FEMA, it has paid out close to $1 billion dollars in flood insurance claims over the last 21 years for these properties. As of November 30, 2003 FEMA had identified approximately 11,000 currently insured repetitive loss properties in this target group. FEMA has set up a special direct facility for servicing these properties and provides information about these property to state and local floodplain management officials. States or communities may sponsor projects to mitigate flood losses to these properties or may be able to provide property owners technical assistance on mitigation options. To facilitate grant-funded mitigation activities for this target group, FEMA also initiated a pilot program to allow states and communities (where these properties are located) to use simplified methodology and software to establish the cost-effectiveness of proposed projects when applying for grants to mitigate these repetitive loss properties. Members of Congress have also recognized the financial burden repetitive loss properties place on the program and have proposed changing premium rates for properties with the greatest losses. Two bills introduced in 2003—H.R. 253 and H.R. 670—proposed amending the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, to, among other things, change the premiums for repetitive loss properties. Under the proposed bills, premiums charged for such properties would reflect actuarially based rates if the property owner has refused a buyout, elevation, or other flood mitigation measure from the flood insurance program or FEMA. H.R. 253, as passed by the House, included a pilot program to allow FEMA to use flood insurance program funds to target “severe” repetitive loss properties for mitigation. Specifically, FEMA could use up to $40 million each year for the next 5 years for mitigation directed at these properties. For property owners who refuse FEMA’s mitigation offers, their premium rates would be increased by 50 percent if they subsequently made a claim to the program exceeding $1,500. In the past, we have noted that increasing policyholder premiums could cause some of the policyholders to cancel their flood insurance. H.R. 253 includes a provision that provides FEMA the flexibility of increasing the deductible, which would result in a lower premium rate, for policies where property owners refuse mitigation offers and make subsequent claims exceeding $1,500. This may provide property owners who refuse mitigation offers a means for maintaining their flood insurance without a significant increase in their premium rate. While we have not fully analyzed the potential results of FEMA’s repetitive loss strategy and mitigation actions proposed by H.R. 253, based on a preliminary assessment, they appear to have the potential to reduce the number and/or vulnerability of repetitive loss properties and, thereby, the potential to help improve the program’s financial condition. By making near term investments targeted to the most costly properties to insure, FEMA should be able to reduce annual expenditures for these properties in the long term by reducing the national inventory of repetitive loss properties. According to FEMA, there are a total of about 100,000 repetitive loss properties accounting for $4.6 billion in losses since 1978. Of these properties, FEMA reports that there are about 49,000 properties that are currently insured that have accounted for about $2.6 billion in losses since 1978. Of these currently insured properties, about 6,000 repetitive loss properties that have accounted for about $792 million in losses since 1978 could be considered for mitigation efforts funded through the pilot program proposed by H.R. 253. In accordance with the bill’s proposed criteria, each of these properties either had 4 or more separate claims each exceeding $5,000 with cumulative claims exceeding $20,000 or had at least 2 separate claims with cumulative losses exceeding the value of the property. The remaining 43,000 currently insured repetitive loss properties, accounting for $1.8 billion in losses since 1978, do not meet the criteria for the proposed pilot program. Of these properties that would not be eligible for the pilot program, about 26,000 properties, accounting for about $1.6 billion in losses since 1978, had cumulative losses greater than $20,000, but either (1) less than 4 claims had been filed or (2) each claim did not meet the $5,000 threshold. (For state by state details on the total number of repetitive loss properties, the number of currently insured repetitive loss properties, the number of currently insured repetitive loss properties that meet the criteria proposed in the H.R. 253 pilot program, and the number of currently insured repetitive loss properties that do not meet the criteria, see appendix 1, tables 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively.) As with all federal initiatives, the success of FEMA ‘s efforts in implementing a repetitive loss strategy and any future legislated program directives will be most effectively determined by using outcome-based, rather than output-based performance measures. Such outcome-based measures could allow FEMA to assess the impact of savings to the National Flood Insurance Program resulting from its mitigation of repetitive loss properties. Mr. Chairman, this concludes my statement. I would be pleased to answer any questions that you or other members of the Subcommittee may have. For further information on this testimony, please contact William O. Jenkins at (202) 512-8777. Individuals making key contributions to this testimony include Chris Keisling, Kirk Kiester, and Meg Ullengren. This appendix contains data we obtained from FEMA’s National Flood Insurance Program Bureau & Statistical Agent on repetitive loss properties and the flood insurance losses associated with those properties. To assess the reliability of this data, we interviewed agency officials knowledgeable about the data and the system development manager responsible for maintaining the data and the systems. We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for identifying repetitive loss properties and illustrating the potential impact of the pilot program proposed by H.R. 253 on these properties.

From fiscal year 1992 through fiscal year 2002, about 900 lives were lost due to flooding and flood damages totaled about $55 billion. Some properties have been repeatedly flooded and the subject of federal flood insurance claims. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) within the Department of Homeland Security is responsible for assisting state and local governments, private entities, and individuals to prepare for, mitigate, respond to, and recover from natural disasters, including floods. The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) is the primary vehicle for FEMA's efforts to mitigate the impact of floods. The Senate Subcommittee on Economic Policy, Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, asked GAO to discuss (1) FEMA's approach to flood mitigation, (2) the effect of repetitive loss properties on the NFIP, and (3) recent actions taken or proposed to address the impact of repetitive loss properties on the NFIP. FEMA has taken a multifaceted approach to mitigating, or minimizing the life and property losses and disaster assistance costs that result from flooding. Through the National Flood Insurance Program, FEMA develops and updates flood maps that identify flood prone areas and makes insurance available for communities that agree to adopt and enforce building standards based upon these maps. Since its inception in 1968, the National Flood Insurance Program has paid $12 billion in insurance claims to owners of flood-damage properties that have been funded primarily by policyholders' premiums that otherwise would have been paid through taxpayer-funded disaster relief or borne by home and business owners themselves. Through a variety of grant programs, FEMA also provides funding for mitigation planning activities and projects before and after floods occur. Repetitive loss properties represent a significant portion of annual flood insurance program claims. About 1 percent of the 4.4 million properties currently insured by the program are considered to be repetitive loss properties--properties for which policyholders have made two or more $1,000 flood claims. However, about 38 percent of all program claim costs have been the result of repetitive loss properties, at a cost of about $4.6 billion since 1978. Recent federal actions to reduce program losses related to repetitive loss properties include FEMA's strategy to target severe repetitive loss properties for mitigation and congressional proposals to phase out coverage or begin charging full and actuarially based rates for repetitive loss property owners who refuse to accept FEMA's offer to purchase or mitigate the effect of floods on these buildings. FEMA's strategy and the congressional proposals appear to have the potential to reduce the number and vulnerability of repetitive loss properties and, thereby, the potential to help reduce the number of flood insurance claims."}

During this period, millions of taxpayers who are trying to fulfill their tax obligations contact IRS over the phone, face-to-face, and via the Internet to obtain answers to tax law questions and information about their tax accounts. This period is also when IRS processes the bulk of the approximate 140 million returns it will receive, runs initial compliance screens, and issues over 100 million refunds. In recent years, IRS has improved its returns processing but has seen its taxpayer service performance deteriorate. For years we have reported that electronic filing (e-filing) has many benefits for taxpayers, such as higher accuracy rates and faster refunds compared to filing on paper. So far in 2012, the percentage of e-filed returns has increased by 1.9 percentage points to 88.8 percent since about the same time last year (a 2.2 percent increase), as table 1 shows. Since the same time in 2007, the percentage of e-filed returns has increased from 72.3 percent to 88.8 percent. This year, IRS may meet its long-held goal of having 80 percent of individual tax returns e-filed. However, the overall e-file percentage is likely to decline as the tax filing season ends since IRS typically receives more returns filed on paper later in the filing season. In addition, IRS is in the midst of a multi-phase modernization project, known to as the Customer Account Data Engine (CADE) 2, which will fundamentally change how it processes returns. With CADE 2, IRS also expects to be able to issue refunds in 4 business days for direct deposit and 6 business days for paper checks after IRS processes the return and posts the return data to the taxpayer’s account. Early in the 2012 filing season, IRS experienced two processing problems that delayed refunds to millions of taxpayers, and reported the problems had been resolved by mid-February. We summarized these problems in an interim report on the 2012 filing season. Providing good taxpayer service is important because, without it, taxpayers may not be able to obtain necessary and accurate information they need to comply with tax laws. In addition, more and more, taxpayers are relying on IRS’s website to obtain information and execute transactions, making it important that IRS have a modern website. However, as we have reported, IRS has experienced declines in performance in selected taxpayer service areas, most notably with respect to providing live telephone assistance and timely responses to taxpayers’ correspondence.from IRS to paper correspondence or have access to information online, they call IRS, correspond again, or seek face-to-face assistance—all of which are costly to IRS and burdensome to the taxpayer. Table 2 shows the declines in telephone service and paper correspondence and the goals for 2012 and 2013. Additional performance data is shown in appendix I. To improve the taxpayer experience and voluntary compliance, IRS has a range of options. Some of its options could provide taxpayers with better information to accurately fulfill their tax obligations. Other options would allow IRS to take enforcement actions sooner and with less burden on taxpayers. Simplifying the tax code could reduce unintentional errors and make intentional tax evasion harder. GAO-12-176. develop an online locator tool listing volunteer tax preparation sites— and IRS introduced an enhanced volunteer site locator tool in 2012;complete an Internet strategy that provides a justification for online self-service tools as IRS expands its capacity to introduce such tools. In addition to actions we recommended, IRS is also studying ways to better communicate with taxpayers and determine which self-service tools would be the most beneficial to taxpayers. According to IRS officials, the study should be completed later this year. Identifying more efficient ways to provide service also benefits IRS because it is able to make better use of scarce resources. GAO-12-176. most effective for improving the quality of tax returns prepared by different types of paid preparers. Likewise, IRS has discussed how to measure the effect of the requirements such as requiring continuing education and testing on tax return accuracy. It will take years to implement the approach as it will likely evolve over time and become more detailed. Tax preparation software is another critical part of tax administration. Almost 30 percent of taxpayers use such software to prepare their returns and, in the process, understand their tax obligations, learn about tax law changes, and get questions answered. Many also electronically file through their software provider. Consequently, tax software companies are another important intermediary between taxpayers and IRS. We have reported that IRS has made considerable progress in working with tax software companies to provide, for example, clearer information about why an e-filed return was not accepted, require additional information on returns to allow for IRS to better identify the software used, and enhance security requirements for e-filing. To illustrate the potential for leveraging tax software companies to improve taxpayer compliance, 4 years ago we recommended and IRS agreed to expand outreach efforts to external stakeholders and include software companies as part of an effort to reduce common types of misreporting related to rental real estate. In another report, we discussed the value of research to better understand how tax software influences compliance. IRS has volunteer partners, often nonprofit organizations or universities, that staff over 12,000 volunteer sites. Volunteers at these sites prepare several million tax returns for traditionally underserved taxpayers, including the elderly, low-income, disabled, and those with limited English proficiency. In recent reports we have made recommendations about estimating of the effectiveness of targeting underserved populations at such sites and making it easier for taxpayers to find the locations of nearby sites.to work with these volunteer partners to help improve assistance to taxpayers with the goal of improving compliance. Information reporting is a proven tool that reduces tax evasion, reduces taxpayer burden, and helps taxpayers voluntarily comply. This is, in part, because taxpayers have more accurate information to complete their returns and do not have to keep records themselves. In addition, IRS research shows that when taxpayers know that IRS is receiving data from third parties, they are more likely to correctly report the income or expenses to IRS. As part of its recent update of its tax gap estimates, IRS estimated that income subject to substantial information reporting, such as pension, dividend, interest, unemployment, and Social Security income, was misreported at an 8 percent rate compared to a 56 percent misreporting rate for income with little or no information reporting, such as sole proprietor, rent, and royalty income. GAO, Tax Administration: Costs and Uses of Third-Party Information Returns, GAO-08-266 (Washington, D.C.: Nov. 20, 2007). have not entered into an agreement with IRS to report details on U.S. account holders to IRS. As these three sets of information reporting requirements have only recently taken effect, it is too soon to tell the impact they are having on taxpayer compliance. We have made recommendations or suggested possible legislative changes in several other areas in which IRS could benefit from additional information reporting. They include the following: Service payments made by landlords. Taxpayers who rent out real estate are required to report to IRS expense payments for certain services, such as payments for property repairs, only if their rental activity is considered a trade or business. However, the law does not clearly spell out how to determine when rental real estate activity is considered a trade or business. Service payments to corporations. Currently, businesses must report to IRS payments for services they make to unincorporated persons or businesses, but payments to corporations generally do not have to be reported. Broader requirements for these two forms of information reporting, covering goods in addition to services, were enacted into law in 2010, but later repealed. We believe the more narrow extensions of information reporting to include services, but not goods, remain important options for improving compliance. Additionally, we have identified existing information reporting requirements that could be enhanced. Examples include the following: Mortgage interest and rental real estate. We recommended requiring information return providers to report the address of a property securing a mortgage, mortgage balances, and an indicator of whether the mortgage is for a current year refinancing when filing mortgage interest statements (Form 1098) could help taxpayers comply with and IRS enforce rules associated with the mortgage interest deduction. We have reported that collecting the address of the secured property on Form 1098 would help taxpayers better understand and IRS better enforce requirements for reporting income from rental real estate. Higher education expenses. Eligible educational institutions are currently required to report information on qualified tuition and related expenses for higher education so that taxpayers can determine the amount of educational tax benefits they can claim. However, the reporting does not always separate eligible from ineligible expenses. We recommended revising the information reporting form could improve the usefulness of reported information. Identifying additional third-party reporting opportunities is challenging. Considerations include whether third parties exist that have accurate information available in a timely manner, the burden of reporting, and whether IRS can enforce the reporting requirement. We have noted, for example, that the reason there is little third-party reporting on sole proprietor expenses is because of the difficulty of identifying third parties that could report on expense like the business use of cars. Modernized systems should better position IRS to conduct more accurate and faster compliance checks, which benefits taxpayers by detecting errors before interest and penalties accrue. In addition, modernized systems should result in more up-to-date account information, faster refunds, and other benefits, such as clearer notices so that taxpayers can better understand why a return was not accepted by IRS. Two new, modernized systems IRS is implementing include the following: Customer Account Data Engine (CADE) 2. For the 2012 filing season, IRS implemented the first of three phases to introduce modernized tax return processing systems. Specifically, IRS introduced a modernized taxpayer account database, called CADE 2, and moved the processing of individual taxpayer accounts from a weekly to a daily processing cycle. IRS expects that completing this first phase will provide taxpayers with benefits such as faster refunds and notices and updated account information. IRS initially expected to implement phase two of CADE 2 implementation by 2014. However, IRS reported that it did not receive funding in fiscal year 2011 that would have allowed it to meet the 2014 time frame. Modernized e-File (MeF). IRS is in the final stages of retiring its legacy e-file system, which preparers and others use to transmit e- filed returns to IRS, and replacing it with MeF. Early in the 2012 filing season, IRS experienced problems transferring data from MeF to other IRS systems. IRS officials said that they solved the problem in early February. IRS officials recently reiterated their intention to turn off the legacy e-file in October 2012 as planned. However, more recently, IRS processing officials told us they would reevaluate the situation after the 2012 filing season. MeF’s benefits include allowing taxpayers to provide additional documentation via portable document files (PDF), as opposed to filing on paper. In addition, MeF should generate clearer notices to taxpayers when a return is rejected by IRS compared to the legacy e-file system. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue has talked about a long-term vision to increase pre-refund compliance checks before refunds are sent to taxpayers. As previously noted, early error correction can benefit taxpayers by preventing interest and penalties from accumulating. In one example, IRS is exploring a process where third parties would send information returns to IRS earlier so they could be matched against taxpayers’ returns when the taxpayer files the return as opposed to the current requirement that some information returns go to taxpayers before being sent to IRS. The intent is to allow IRS to match those information returns to tax returns during the filing season rather than after refunds have been issued. Another option for expanding pre-refund compliance checks is additional math error authority (MEA) that Congress would need to grant IRS through statute. MEA allows IRS to correct calculation errors and check for obvious noncompliance, such as claims above income and credit limits. Despite its name, MEA encompasses much more than simple arithmetic errors. It also includes, for instance, identifying incorrect Social Security numbers or missing forms. The errors being corrected can either be in the taxpayers’ favor or result in additional tax being owed. MEA is less intrusive and burdensome to taxpayers than audits and reduces costs to IRS. It also generally allows taxpayers who make errors on their returns to receive refunds faster than if they are audited. This is due, in part, to the fact that IRS does not have to follow its standard deficiency procedures when using MEA—it must only notify the taxpayer that the assessment has been made and provide an explanation of the error. Taxpayers have 60 days after the notice is sent to request an abatement. Although IRS has MEA to correct certain errors on a case-by-case basis, it does not have broad authority to do so. In 2010, we suggested that Congress consider broadening IRS’s MEA with appropriate safeguards against the misuse of that authority. In the absence of broader MEA, we have identified specific cases where IRS could benefit from additional MEA that have yet to be enacted. These include authority to: use prior years’ tax return information to ensure that taxpayers do not improperly claim credits or deductions in excess of applicable lifetime limits, use prior years’ tax return information to automatically verify taxpayers’ compliance with the number of years the Hope credit can be claimed, and identify and correct returns with ineligible (1) individual retirement account (IRA) “catch-up” contributions and (2) contributions to traditional IRAs from taxpayers over age 70½. In 2009, Congress enacted our suggestion that IRS use MEA to ensure that taxpayers do not improperly claim the First-Time Homebuyer Credit in multiple years, which we estimate resulted in savings of about $95 million. Tax code complexity can make it difficult for taxpayers to voluntarily comply. Efforts to simplify or reform the tax code may help reduce burdensome record keeping requirements for taxpayers and make it easier for individuals and businesses to understand and voluntarily comply with their tax obligations. For example, eliminating or combining tax expenditures, such as exemptions, deductions, and credits, could help taxpayers reduce unintentional errors and limit opportunities for tax evasion. Frequent changes in the tax code also reduce its stability, making tax planning more difficult and increasing uncertainty about future tax liabilities. Limiting the frequency of changes to the tax code could also help reduce calls to IRS with questions about the changes. We have reported that IRS annually receives millions of calls about tax law changes. Reducing complexity in the tax code could take a variety of forms, ranging from comprehensive tax reform to a more incremental approach focusing on specific tax provisions. Policymakers may find it useful to compare any proposed changes to the tax code based on a set of widely accepted criteria for assessing alternative tax proposals. These criteria include the equity, or fairness, of the tax system; the economic efficiency, or neutrality, of the system; and the simplicity, transparency, and administrability of the system. These criteria can sometimes conflict, and the weight one places on each criterion will vary among individuals. Our publication Understanding the Tax Reform Debate: Background, Criteria, & Questions may be useful in guiding policymakers as they consider tax reform proposals. In closing, improving the taxpayer experience and increasing voluntary compliance will not be achieved through a single solution. Because voluntary compliance is influenced by so many factors, multiple approaches, such as those listed here, will be needed. Chairman Baucus, Ranking Member Hatch, and Members of the Committee, this completes my prepared statement. I would be happy to respond to any questions you and Members of the Committee may have at this time. For further information regarding this testimony, please contact James R. White, Director, Strategic Issues, at (202) 512-9110 or whitej@gao.gov. Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this statement. Individuals making key contributions to this statement include Joanna Stamatiades, Assistant Director; LaKeshia Allen; David Fox; Tom Gilbert; Kirsten Lauber; Sabrina Streagle, and Weifei Zheng. As shown in table 3, in recent years, the level of access to telephone assistors has declined and average wait time has increased. In addition, the volume of overage correspondence has steadily increased. On a positive note, tax law and account accuracy remains high. As shown in table 4, access to IRS assistors has declined over the last few years. IRS officials attribute the higher-than-planned level of service so far this year to a slight decline in the demand for live assistance. At the same time, the number of automated calls has\n\n### Summary:\n\n", "answer": "The U.S. tax system depends on taxpayers calculating their tax liability, filing their tax return, and paying what they owe on timewhat is often referred to as voluntary compliance. Voluntary compliance depends on a number of factors, including the quality of IRSs assistance to taxpayers, knowledge that its enforcement programs are effective, and a belief that the tax system is fair and other people are paying their share of taxes. Voluntary compliance is also influenced by other parties, including paid tax return preparers, tax software companies, and information return filers (employers, financial institutions, and others who report income or expense information about taxpayers to IRS). For this testimony, GAO was asked to (1) evaluate the current state of IRSs performance and its effect on the taxpayer experience, and (2) identify opportunities to improve the taxpayer experience and voluntary compliance. This testimony is based on prior GAO reports and recommendations. Additionally, GAO analyzed IRS data in delivering selected taxpayer services in recent years. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has made improvements in processing tax returns, and electronic filing (e-filing), which provides benefits to taxpayers including faster refunds, continues to increase. However, IRSs performance in providing service over the phone and responding to paper correspondence has declined in recent years. For 2012, as with previous years, IRS officials attribute the lower performance to other funding priorities. The following are among the opportunities to improve the taxpayer experience and increase voluntary compliance that GAO identifies in this testimony: IRS can provide more self-service tools to give taxpayers better access to information. IRS can create an automated telephone line for amended returns (a source of high call volume) and complete an online services strategy that provides justification for adding new self-service tools online. Better leveraging of third parties could provide taxpayers with other avenues to receive service. Paid preparers and tax software providers combine to prepare about 90 percent of tax returns. IRS is making progress implementing new regulation of paid preparers. As it develops better data, IRS should be able to test strategies for improving the quality of tax return preparation by paid preparers. Similarly, IRS may also be able to leverage tax software companies. Expanded information reporting could reduce taxpayer burden and improve accuracy. Expanded information reporting, such as the recent requirements for banks and others to report businesses credit card receipts to IRS, can reduce taxpayers record keeping and give IRS another tool. Implementing modernized systems should provide faster refunds and account updates. Modernized systems should allow IRS to conduct more accurate and faster compliance checks, which benefits taxpayers by detecting errors before interest and penalties accrue. Expanding pre-refund compliance checks could result in more efficient error correction. Expanding such checks could reduce the burden of audits on taxpayers and their costs to IRS. Reducing tax complexity could ease taxpayer burden and make it easier to comply. Simplifying the tax code could reduce unintentional errors and make intentional tax evasion easier to detect. GAO has made numerous prior recommendations that could help improve the taxpayer experience. Congress and IRS have acted on some recommendations, while others are reflected in the strategies presented in this testimony."}

Adequate and predictable funding is needed for airport development. The National Civil Aviation Review Commission—established by Congress to determine how to fund U.S. civil aviation—reported in December 1997 that more funding is needed to develop the national airport system’s capacity, preserve small airports’ infrastructure, and fund new safety and security initiatives. Funding is also needed to mitigate the noise and other negative environmental effects of airports on nearby communities. Airports provide important economic benefits to the nation and their communities. Air transportation accounted for $63.2 billion, or 0.8 percent, of U.S. Gross Domestic Product in 1996, according to the Department of Transportation’s statistics. 1.6 million people are employed at airports in 1998, according to the Airports Council International-North America. In our own study of airport privatization in 1996, we found that the 69 largest U.S. airports had 766,500 employees (686,000 private and 80,500 public employees). In 1996, tax-exempt bonds, the Airport Improvement Program (AIP), and passenger facility charges (PFC) together provided about $6.6 billion of the $7 billion in airport funding. State grants and airport revenue contributed the remaining funding for airports. Table 1 lists these sources of funding and their amounts in 1996. The amount and type of funding varies with airports’ size. The nation’s 71 largest airports (classified by FAA as large hubs and medium hubs), which accounted for almost 90 percent of all passenger traffic, received more than $5.5 billion in funding in 1996, while the 3,233 other national system airports received about $1.5 billion. As shown in figure 1, large and medium hub airports rely most heavily on private airport bonds, which account for roughly 62 percent of their total funding. By contrast, the 3,233 smaller national system airports obtained just 14 percent of their funding from bonds. For these smaller airports, AIP funding constitutes a much larger portion of their overall funding—about half. Airports’ planned capital development over the period 1997 through 2001 may cost as much as $10 billion per year, or $3 billion more per year than in 1996. Figure 2 compares airports’ total funding for capital development in 1996 with their annual planned spending for development. Funding for 1996, the bar on the left, is shown by source (AIP, PFCs, state grants, and operating revenues). Planned spending for future years, the bar on the right, is shown by the relative priority FAA has assigned to the projects, as follows: Reconstruction and mandated projects, FAA’s highest priorities, total $1.4 billion per year and are for projects to maintain existing infrastructure (reconstruction) or to meet federal mandates, including safety, security, and environmental requirements, including noise mitigation requirements. Other high-priority projects, primarily adding capacity, account for another $1.4 billion per year. Other AIP-eligible projects, a lower priority for FAA, such as bringing airports up to FAA’s design standards, add another $3.3 billion per year for a total of $6.1 billion per year. Finally, airports anticipate spending another $3.9 billion per year on projects that are not eligible for AIP funding, such as expanding commercial space in terminals and constructing parking garages. Other high-priority projects $1,360 Reconstruction & mandates $1,414 Planned development 1997 through 2001 (annualized) Within this overall picture of funding and planned spending for development, it is difficult to develop accurate estimates of the extent to which AIP-eligible projects are deferred or canceled because some form of funding cannot be found for them. FAA does not maintain information on whether eligible projects that do not receive AIP funding are funded from other sources, deferred, or canceled. We were not successful in developing an estimate from other information sources, mainly because comprehensive data are not kept on the uses to which airport and special facility bonds are put. But even if the entire bond financing available to smaller airports were spent on AIP-eligible projects, these airports would have, at a minimum, about $945 million a year in AIP-eligible projects that are not funded. Conversely, if none of the financing from bonds were applied to AIP-eligible projects, then the full $3 billion funding shortfall would apply to these projects. The difference between current and planned funding for development is bigger, in percentage terms, for smaller airports than for larger ones. Funding for the 3,233 smaller airports in 1996 was a little over half of the estimated cost of their planned development, producing a difference of about $1.4 billion (see fig. 3). This difference would be even greater if it were not for $250 million in special facility bonding for a single cargo/general aviation airport. For this group of airports, the $782 million in 1996 AIP funding exceeds the annual estimate of $750 million for FAA’s highest-priority projects—those involving reconstruction, noise mitigation, and compliance with federal mandates. However, there is no guarantee that the full amount of AIP funding will go only to the highest-priority projects, because one-third of AIP funds are awarded to airports on the basis of the number of passengers boarding commercial flights and not necessarily on the basis of projects’ priority. Planned development 1997 through 2001 (annualized) As a proportion of total funding, the potential funding difference between 1996 funding and planned development for the 71 large and medium hub airports is comparatively less than for their smaller counterparts (see fig. 3 and fig. 4). Larger airports potential shortfall of $1.5 billion represents 21 percent of their planned development costs, while smaller airports’ potential shortfall of $1.4 billion represents 48 percent of their development costs. Therefore, while larger and smaller airports’ respective shortfalls are similar in size, the greater scale of larger airports’ planned development causes them to differ considerably in proportion. Figure 4 also indicates that $590 million in AIP funding falls $74 million short of the estimated cost to meet FAA’s highest priorities for development—reconstruction, noise mitigation, and compliance with federal mandates. Planned development 1997 through 2001 (annualized) Proposals to increase airport funding or make better use of existing funding vary in the extent to which they would help different types of airports and close the gap between funding and the costs of planned development. For example, increasing AIP funding would help smaller airports more because current funding formulas would channel an increasing proportion of AIP to smaller airports. Conversely, any increase in PFC funding would help larger airports almost exclusively because they handle more passengers and are more likely to have a PFC in place. Changes to the current design of AIP or PFCs could, however, lessen the concentration of benefits to one group of airports. FAA has also used other mechanisms to better use and extend existing funding sources, such as letters of intent, state block grants, and pilot projects to test innovative financing. So far, these mechanisms have had mixed success. Under the existing distribution formula, increasing total AIP funding would proportionately help smaller airports more than large and medium hub airports. Appropriated AIP funding for fiscal year 1998 was $1.7 billion; large and medium hub airports received nearly 40 percent and all other airports about 60 percent of the total. We calculated how much funding each group would receive under the existing formula, at funding levels of $2 billion and $2.347 billion. We chose these funding levels because the National Civil Aviation Review Commission and the Air Transport Association (ATA), the commercial airline trade association, have recommended that future AIP funding levels be stabilized at a minimum of $2 billion annually, while two airport trade groups—the American Association of Airport Executives and the Airports Council International-North America—have recommended a higher funding level, such as AIP’s authorized funding level of $2.347 billion for fiscal year 1998. Table 2 shows the results. As indicated, smaller airports’ share of AIP would increase under higher funding levels if the current distribution formula were used to apportion the additional funds. Increasing PFC-based funding, as proposed by the Department of Transportation and backed by airport groups, would mainly help larger airports, for several reasons. First, large and medium hub airports, which accounted for nearly 90 percent of all passengers in 1996, have the greatest opportunity to levy PFCs. Second, such airports are more likely than smaller airports to have an approved PFC in place. Finally, large and medium hub airports would forego little AIP funding if the PFC ceiling were raised or eliminated. Most of these airports already return the maximum amount that must be turned back for redistribution to smaller airports in exchange for the opportunity to levy PFCs. If the airports currently charging PFCs were permitted to increase them beyond the current $3 ceiling, total collections would increase from the $1.35 billion that FAA estimates was collected during 1998. Most of the additional collections would go to larger airports. For every $1 increase in the PFC ceiling, we estimate that large and medium hub airports would collect an additional $432 million, while smaller airports would collect an additional $46 million (see fig. 5). In total, a $4 PFC ceiling would yield $1.9 billion, a $5 PFC would yield $2.4 billion, and a $6 PFC would yield $2.8 billion in total estimated collections. Increased PFC funding is likely to be applied to different types of projects than would increased AIP funding. Most AIP funding is applied to “airside” projects like runways and taxiways. “Landside” projects, such as terminals and access roads, are lower on the AIP priority list. However, for some airports, congestion may be more severe at terminals and on access roads than on airfields, according to airport groups. The majority of PFCs are currently dedicated to terminal and airport access projects and interest payments on debt, and any additional revenue from an increase in PFCs may follow suit. In recent years, the Congress has directed FAA to undertake other steps designed to allow airports to make better use of existing AIP funds. Thus far, some of these efforts, such as letters of intent and state block grants, have been successful. Others, such as pilot projects to test innovative financing and privatization, have received less interest from airports and are still being tested. Finally, one idea, using AIP grants to capitalize state revolving loan funds, has not been attempted but could help small airports. Implementing this idea would require legislative changes. Letters of intent are an important source of long-term funding for airport capacity projects, especially for larger airports. These letters represent a nonbinding commitment from FAA to provide multiyear funding to airports beyond the current AIP authorization period. Thus, the letters allow airports to proceed with projects without waiting for future AIP grants and provide assurance that allowable costs will be reimbursed. Airports may also be able to receive more favorable interest rates on bonds that are sold to finance a project if the federal government has indicated its support for the project in a letter of intent. For a period, FAA stopped issuing letters of intent, but since January 1997, it has issued 10 letters with a total funding commitment of $717.5 million. Currently, FAA has 28 open letters committing a total of $1.180 billion through 2010. Letters of intent for large and medium airports account for $1.057 billion, or 90 percent, of that total. Airports’ demand for the letters continues—FAA expects at least 10 airports to apply for new letters of intent in fiscal year 1999. In 1996, we testified before this Subcommittee that FAA’s state block grant pilot program was a success. The program allows FAA to award AIP funds in the form of block grants to designated states, that, in turn, select and fund AIP projects at small airports. States then decide how to distribute these funds to small airports. In 1996, the program was expanded from seven to nine states and made permanent. Both FAA and the participating states believe that they are benefiting from the program. In recent years, FAA, with congressional urging and direction, has sought to expand airports’ available capital funding through more innovative methods, including the more flexible application of AIP funding and efforts to attract more private capital. The 1996 Federal Aviation Reauthorization Act gave FAA the authority to test three new uses for AIP funding—(1) projects with greater percentages of local matching funds, (2) interest costs on debt, and (3) bond insurance. In all, these three innovative uses could be tested on up to 10 projects. Another innovative financing mechanism that we’ve recommended—using AIP funding to help capitalize state airport revolving funds—while not currently permitted, may hold some promise. FAA is testing 10 innovative uses of AIP funding totaling $24.16 million, all at smaller airports. Five projects tested the benefits of the first innovative use of AIP funding—allowing local contributions in excess of standard matching amount, which for most airports and projects is otherwise fixed at 10 percent of the AIP grant. FAA and state aviation representatives generally support the concept of flexible matching because it allows projects to begin that otherwise might be postponed for lack of sufficient FAA funding; in addition, flexible funding may ultimately increase funding to airports. The latter five projects test the other two mechanisms for innovative financing. Applicants have generally shown less interest in the latter two options, which, according to FAA officials, warrant further study. Some federal transportation, state aviation, and airport bond rating and underwriting officials believe using AIP funding to capitalize state revolving loan funds would help smaller airports obtain additional financing. Currently, FAA cannot use AIP funds for this purpose because AIP construction grants can go only to designated airports and projects. However, state revolving loan funds have been successfully employed to finance other types of infrastructure projects, such as wastewater projects and, more recently, drinking water and surface transportation projects. While loan funds can be structured in various ways, they use federal and state moneys to capitalize the funds from which loans are then made. Interest and principal payments are recycled to provide additional loans. Once established, a loan fund can be expanded through the issuance of bonds that use the fund’s capital and loan portfolio as collateral. These revolving funds would not create any contingent liability for the U.S. government because they would be under state control. Declining airport grants and broader government privatization efforts spurred interest in airport privatization as another innovative means of bringing more capital to airport development, but thus far efforts have shown only limited results. As we previously reported, the sale or lease of airports in the United States faces many hurdles, including legal and economic constraints. As a way to test privatization’s potential, the Congress directed FAA to establish a limited pilot program under which some of these constraints would be eased. Starting December 1, 1997, FAA began accepting applications from airports to participate in the pilot program on a first-come, first-served basis for up to five airports. Thus far, two airports have applied to be part of the program. Mr. Chairman, this concludes our prepared statement.

GAO noted that: (1) 3,304 airports that make up the federally supported national airport system obtained about $7 billion from federal and private sources for capital development; (2) more than 90 percent of this funding came from three sources: tax-exempt bonds issued by states and local airport authorities, federal grants from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Airport Improvement Program (AIP), and passenger facility charges paid on airline tickets; (3) the magnitude and type of funding varies with airports' size; (4) the nation's 71 largest airports accounted for nearly 80 percent of the total funding; (5) airports planned to spend as much as $10 billion per year for capital development for the years 1997 through 2001, or $3 billion per year more than they were able to fund in 1996; (6) the difference between funding and the costs of planned development is greater for smaller commercial and general aviation airports than for their larger counterparts; (7) smaller airports' funding would cover only about half the costs of their planned development, while larger airports' funding would cover about 4/5 of their planned development; (8) airports' planned development can be divided into four main categories based on the funding priorities of AIP; (9) about $1.4 billion per year was planned for safety, security, environmental, and reconstruction projects, FAA's highest priorities for AIP funding; (10) another $1.4 billion per year was planned for projects FAA regards as the next highest priority, primarily adding airport capacity; (11) other projects FAA considers to be lower in priority, such as bringing airports up to FAA's design standards, add another $3.3 billion per year; (12) airports anticipated spending another $3.9 billion per year on projects that are not eligible for AIP funding, such as expanding commercial space in terminals and constructing parking garages; (13) several proposals to increase or make better use of existing funding have emerged in recent years, including the amount of AIP funding and raising the maximum amount airports can levy in passenger facility charges; (14) under current formulas, increasing the amount of AIP funding would help small airports more than larger airports, while raising passenger facility charges would help larger airports more; and (15) other initiatives, such as AIP block grants to states, have had varied success, but none appears to offer a major breakthrough in reducing the shortfall between funding and airports' plans for development."}
{"original_length": 4135, "trunc_length": 4096, "text": "\n\nSummarize the following text into a summary of less than 800 words.\n### Text:\n\nAdvances in the use of IT and the Internet are continuing to change the way that federal agencies communicate, use, and disseminate information; deliver services; and conduct business. For example, electronic government (e-government) has the potential to help build better relationships between government and the public by facilitating timely and efficient interaction with citizens. To help agencies more effectively manage IT, the Congress has established a statutory framework of requirements and roles and responsibilities relating to information and technology management. In particular, the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 and the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 require agency heads, acting through agency CIOs to, among other things, better link their IT planning and investment decisions to program missions develop and maintain a strategic information resources management (IRM) plan that describes how IRM activities help to accomplish agency missions; develop and maintain an ongoing process to establish goals for improving IRM’s contribution to program productivity, efficiency, and effectiveness; methods for measuring progress toward these goals; and clear roles and responsibilities for achieving these goals; develop and implement a sound IT architecture; implement and enforce IT management policies, procedures, standards, and guidelines; establish policies and procedures for ensuring that IT systems provide reliable, consistent, and timely financial or program performance data; and implement and enforce applicable policies, procedures, standards, and guidelines on privacy, security, disclosure, and information sharing. Nevertheless, the agencies face significant challenges in effectively planning for and managing their IT. Such challenges can be overcome through the use of a systematic and robust management approach that addresses critical elements such as IT strategic planning and investment management. Federal agencies did not always have in place important practices associated with IT laws, policies, and guidance related to strategic planning/performance measurement and investment management (see fig. 1). A well-defined strategic planning process helps to ensure that an agency’s IT goals are aligned with its strategic goals. Moreover, establishing performance measures and monitoring actual-versus- expected performance using those measures can help to determine whether IT is making a difference in improving performance. Finally, an IT investment management process is an integrated approach to managing investments that provides for the continuous identification, selection, control, life-cycle management, and evaluation of IT investments. Agency IT officials could not always identify why practices were not in place, but in those instances in which reasons were identified, a variety of explanations were provided; for example, that the CIO position had been vacant, that not including a requirement in the agency’s guidance was an oversight, or that the process was being revised. Nevertheless, these practices are based on law, executive orders, Office of Management and Budget (OMB) policies, and our guidance, and are also important ingredients in ensuring effective strategic planning, performance measurement, and investment management that, in turn, make it more likely that the billions of dollars in government IT investments will be wisely spent. Critical aspects of the strategic planning/performance measurement area include documenting the agency’s IT strategic planning processes, developing IRM plans, establishing goals, and measuring performance to evaluate whether goals are being met. Although the agencies often had these practices, or elements of these practices, in place, additional work remains, as demonstrated by the following examples: Strategic planning process. Strategic planning defines what an organization seeks to accomplish and identifies the strategies it will use to achieve desired results. A defined strategic planning process allows an agency to clearly articulate its strategic direction and to establish linkages among planning elements such as goals, objectives, and strategies. About half of the agencies had fully documented their strategic planning processes. Such processes are an essential foundation for ensuring that IT resources are effectively managed. Strategic IRM plans. The Paperwork Reduction Act requires that agencies indicate in strategic IRM plans how they are applying information resources to improve the productivity, efficiency, and effectiveness of government programs. An important element of a strategic plan is that it presents an integrated system of high-level decisions that are reached through a formal, visible process. The Paperwork Reduction Act also requires agencies to develop IRM plans in accordance with OMB’s guidance. However, OMB does not provide cohesive guidance on the specific contents of IRM plans. Accordingly, although agencies generally provided OMB with a variety of planning documents to meet its requirement that they submit an IRM plan, these plans were generally limited to IT strategic or e-government issues and did not address other elements of IRM, as defined by the Paperwork Reduction Act. In particular, these plans generally include individual IT projects and initiatives, security, and enterprise architecture elements but do not often address other information functions—such as information collection, records management, and privacy—or the coordinated management of all information functions. OMB IT staff agreed that the agency has not set forth guidance on the contents of agency IRM plans in a single place, stating that its focus has been on looking at agencies’ cumulative results and not on planning documents. These staff also noted that agencies account for their IRM activities through multiple documents (e.g., Information Collection Budgets and Government Paperwork Elimination Act plans). Nevertheless, half the agencies indicated a need for OMB to provide additional guidance on the development and content of IRM plans. Accordingly, we recommended that OMB develop and disseminate to agencies guidance on developing IRM plans. IT goals. The Paperwork Reduction Act and the Clinger-Cohen Act require agencies to establish goals that address how IT contributes to program productivity, efficiency, effectiveness, and service delivery to the public. We have previously reported that leading organizations define specific goals, objectives, and measures, use a diversity of measure types, and describe how IT outputs and outcomes impact operational customer and agency program delivery requirements. The agencies generally had the types of goals outlined in the Paperwork Reduction Act and the Clinger- Cohen Act. However, five agencies did not have one or more of the goals required by the Paperwork Reduction Act and the Clinger-Cohen Act. It is important that agencies specify clear goals and objectives to set the focus and direction for IT performance. IT performance measures. The Paperwork Reduction Act, the Clinger- Cohen Act, and an executive order require agencies to establish a variety of IT performance measures—such as those related to how IT contributes to program productivity, efficiency, and effectiveness—and to monitor the actual-versus-expected performance using those measures. Although the agencies largely had one or more of the required performance measures in place, these measures were not always linked to the agencies’ enterprisewide IT goals. Moreover, few agencies monitored actual-versus- expected performance for all of their enterprisewide IT goals. Specifically, although some agencies tracked actual-versus-expected outcomes for the IT performance measures in their performance plans or accountability reports and/or for specific IT projects, they generally did not track the performance measures that were specified in their IRM plans. As we have previously reported, an effective IT performance management system offers a variety of benefits, including serving as an early warning indicator of problems and the effectiveness of corrective actions; providing input to resource allocation and planning; and providing periodic feedback to employees, customers, stakeholders, and the general public about the quality, quantity, cost, and timeliness of products and services. Moreover, without enterprisewide performance measures that are tracked against actual results, agencies lack critical information about whether their overall IT activities are achieving expected goals. Benchmarking. The Clinger-Cohen Act requires agencies to quantitatively benchmark agency process performance against public- and private-sector organizations, where comparable processes and organizations exist. Benchmarking is used because there may be external organizations that have more innovative or more efficient processes than their own processes. Seven agencies in our review had mechanisms in place—such as policies and strategies—related to benchmarking their IT processes. In general, however, agencies’ benchmarking decisions were ad hoc. Few agencies had developed a mechanism to identify comparable external private- or public-sector organizations and processes and/or had policies related to benchmarking, although all but 10 of the agencies provided examples of benchmarking that they had performed. Our previous study of IT performance measurement at leading organizations found that they had spent considerable time and effort comparing their performance information with that of other organizations. Agency IT officials could not identify why strategic planning/performance measurement practices were not in place in all cases, but in those instances in which reasons were identified, a variety of explanations were provided. For example, reasons cited by agency IT officials included that they lacked the support from agency leadership, that the agency had not been developing IRM plans until recently and recognized that the plan needed further refinement, that the process was being revised, and that requirements were evolving. Without strong strategic management practices, it is less likely that IT is being used to maximize improvement in mission performance. Moreover, without enterprisewide performance measures that are being tracked against actual results, agencies lack critical information about whether their overall IT activities, at a governmentwide cost of billions of dollars annually, are achieving expected goals. Critical aspects of IT investment management include developing well- supported proposals, establishing investment management boards, and selecting and controlling IT investments. The agencies’ use of practices associated with these aspects of investment management was wide- ranging, as follows: IT investment proposals. Various legislative requirements, an executive order, and OMB policies provide minimum standards that govern agencies’ consideration of IT investments. In addition, we have issued guidance to agencies for selecting, controlling, and evaluating IT investments. Such processes help ensure, for example, that investments are cost-beneficial and meet mission needs and that the most appropriate development or acquisition approach is chosen. The agencies in our review had mixed results when evaluated against these various criteria. For example, the agencies almost always required that proposed investments demonstrate that they support the agency’s business needs, are cost-beneficial, address security issues, and consider alternatives. However, they were not as likely to have fully in place the Clinger-Cohen Act requirement that agencies follow, to the maximum extent practicable, a modular, or incremental, approach when investing in IT projects. Incremental investment helps to mitigate the risks inherent in large IT acquisitions/developments by breaking apart a single large project into smaller, independently useful components with known and defined relationships and dependencies. Investment management boards. Our investment management guide states that establishing one or more IT investment board(s) is a key component of the investment management process. Such executive-level boards, made up of business-unit executives, concentrate management’s attention on assessing and managing risks and regulating the trade-offs between continuing to fund existing operations and developing new performance capabilities. Almost all of the agencies in our review had one or more enterprise-level investment management board. However, the investment management boards for six agencies were not involved, or the agency did not document the boards’ involvement, in the control phase. Maintaining responsibility for oversight with the same body that selected the investment is crucial to fostering a culture of accountability by holding the investment board that initially selected an investment responsible for its ongoing success. Selection of IT investments. During the selection phase of an IT investment management process, the organization (1) selects projects that will best support its mission needs and (2) identifies and analyzes each project’s risks and returns before committing significant funds. To achieve desired results, it is important that agencies have a selection process that, for example, uses selection criteria to choose the IT investments that best support the organization’s mission and that prioritizes proposals. Twenty- two agencies used selection criteria in choosing their IT investments. In addition, about half the agencies used scoring models to help choose their investments. Control over IT investments. During the control phase of the IT investment management process, the organization ensures that, as projects develop and as funds are spent, the project is continuing to meet mission needs at the expected levels of cost and risk. If the project is not meeting expectations or if problems have arisen, steps are quickly taken to address the deficiencies. In general, the agencies were weaker in the practices pertaining to the control phase of the investment management process than to the selection phase and no agency had the practices associated with the control phase fully in place. In particular, the agencies did not always have important mechanisms in place for agencywide investment management boards to effectively control investments, including decision-making rules for project oversight, early warning mechanisms, and/or requirements that corrective actions for under- performing projects be agreed upon and tracked. Executive level oversight of project-level management activities provides an organization with increased assurance that each investment will achieve the desired cost, benefit, and schedule results. Among the variety of reasons that agencies cited for not having IT investment management practices fully in place were that the CIO position had been vacant, that not including a requirement in the IT investment management guide was an oversight, and that the process was being revised. However, in some cases agencies could not identify why certain practices were not in place. It is important that agencies address their shortcomings, because only by effectively and efficiently managing their IT resources through a robust investment management process can they gain opportunities to make better allocation decisions among many investment alternatives and to further leverage their IT investments. To help agencies improve their IT strategic planning/performance measurement and investment management, we have made numerous recommendations to agencies and issued guidance. Specifically, in our January 2004 report we made recommendations to the 26 agencies in our review regarding practices that were not fully in place. These recommendations addressed issues such as IT strategic planning; establishing and linking enterprisewide goals and performance measures and tracking progress against these measures; and selecting, controlling, and evaluating investments. By implementing these recommendations, agencies can better ensure that they are using strategic planning, performance measurement, and investment management practices that are consistent with IT legislation, executive orders, OMB policies, and our guidance. Another mechanism that agencies can use to improve their IT management is to apply the management frameworks and guides that we have issued, which are based on our research into IT management best practices and our evaluations of agency IT management performance. In this vein, today we are releasing the latest version of our ITIM framework. This framework identifies and organizes critical processes for selecting, controlling, and evaluating IT investments into a framework of increasingly mature stages (see fig. 2). First issued as an exposure draft in May 2000, this new version of the ITIM includes lessons learned from our use of the framework in our agency reviews and from lessons conveyed to us by users of the framework. In addition, in order to validate the appropriateness of our changes and to gain the advantage of their experience, we had the new version reviewed by several outside experts who are familiar with the ITIM exposure draft and with investment management in a broad array of public and private organizations. ITIM can be used to analyze an organization’s investment management processes and to determine its level of maturity. The framework is useful to many federal agencies because it provides: (1) a rigorous, standardized tool for internal and external evaluations of an agency’s IT investment management process; (2) a consistent and understandable mechanism for reporting the results of these assessments to agency executives, Congress, and other interested parties; and (3) a road map that agencies can use for improving their investment management processes. Regarding the first two points, we and selected agency Inspectors General have used the ITIM to evaluate and report on the investment management processes of several agencies. Concerning the third point, a number of agencies have recognized the usefulness of the ITIM framework and have used it to develop and enhance their investment management strategies. For example, one agency uses the framework to periodically review its IT investment management capabilities and has developed an action plan to move through the stages of maturity. In summary, our January 2004 report indicates that the federal government can significantly improve its IT strategic planning, performance measurement, and investment management. Such improvement would better ensure that agencies are being responsible stewards of the billions of dollars for IT with which they have been entrusted, by helping them to invest these monies wisely. This can be accomplished, in part, through the expeditious implementation of our recommendations and the adoption of best practices, which we have incorporated into our IT management frameworks and guides such as the ITIM. Mr. Chairman, this completes my prepared statement. I would be happy to respond to any questions that you or other Members of the Subcommittee may have at this time. If you have any questions regarding this statement, please contact me at (202) 512-9286 or by e-mail at pownerd@gao.gov. Specific questions related to our January 2004 report may also be directed to Linda Lambert at (202) 512-9556 or via e-mail at lambertl@gao.gov or Mark Shaw at (202) 512-6251 or via e-mail at shawm@gao.gov.

Table 1 describes the 12 IT strategic planning/performance measurement and the 18 IT investment management practices that we used in our January 2004 report on the government’s performance in these areas. We identified these 30 practices after reviewing major legislative requirements (e.g., the Paperwork Reduction\n\n### Summary:\n\n", "answer": "The federal government spends billions of dollars annually on information technology (IT) investments that are critical to the effective implementation of major government programs. To help agencies effectively manage their substantial IT investments, the Congress has established a statutory framework of requirements and roles and responsibilities relating to information and technology management, that addresses, for example, (1) IT strategic planning/performance measurement (which defines what an organization seeks to accomplish, identifies the strategies it will use to achieve desired results, and then determines how well it is succeeding in reaching resultsoriented goals and achieving objectives) and (2) IT investment management (which involves selecting, controlling, and evaluating investments). GAO was asked to summarize its January 2004 report on IT strategic planning/performance measurement and investment management (Information Technology Management: Governmentwide Strategic Planning, Performance Measurement, and Investment Management Can Be Further Improved, GAO-04-49 , January 12, 2004) and to discuss how agencies can improve their performance in these areas. GAO recently reported that the use of important IT strategic planning/performance measurement and investment management practices by 26 major federal agencies was mixed. For example, agencies generally had IT strategic plans and goals, but these goals were not always linked to specific performance measures that were tracked. Agencies also largely had IT investment management boards, but no agency had the practices associated with the oversight of IT investments fully in place. Although they could not always provide an explanation, agencies cited a variety of reasons for not having practices fully in place, including that the chief information officer position had been vacant and that the process was being revised. By improving their IT strategic planning, performance measurement, and investment management, agencies can better ensure that they are being responsible stewards of the billions of dollars for IT that they have been entrusted with through the wise investment of these monies. To help agencies improve in these areas, GAO has made numerous recommendations to agencies and issued guidance. For example, in the January 2004 report, GAO made recommendations to the 26 agencies regarding practices that were not fully in place. In addition, today GAO is releasing the latest version of its Information Technology Investment Management (ITIM) framework, which identifies critical processes for selecting, controlling, and evaluating IT investments and organizes them into a framework of increasingly mature stages; thereby providing agencies a road map for improving IT investment management processes in a systematic and organized manner."}
{"original_length": 4136, "trunc_length": 4096, "text": "\n\nSummarize the following text into a summary of less than 800 words.\n### Text:\n\nDuring this Committee’s hearings on S. 981, one of the witnesses indicated that Congress should determine the effectiveness of previously enacted regulatory reforms before enacting additional reforms. Perhaps the most directly relevant of those reforms to S. 746 is title II of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA), which requires that agencies take a number of analytical and procedural steps during the rulemaking process. We examined the implementation of UMRA during its first 2 years of operation and, for several reasons, concluded that it had little effect on agencies’ rulemaking actions. First, the act’s cost-benefit requirement did not apply to many of the rulemaking actions that were considered “economically significant”actions under Executive Order 12866 (78 out of 110 issued in the 2-year period). Second, UMRA gave agencies discretion not to take certain actions if they determined that those actions were duplicative or unfeasible. For example, subsection 202(a)(3) of the act requires agencies to estimate future compliance costs and any disproportionate budgetary effects of the actions “if and to the extent that the agency determines that accurate estimates are reasonably feasible.” Third, UMRA requires agencies to take actions that they were already required to take. For example, the act required agencies to conduct cost- benefit analyses for all covered rules, but Executive Order 12866 required such analyses for more than a year before UMRA was enacted and for a broader set of rules than UMRA covered. Like UMRA, S. 746 contains some of the same requirements contained in Executive Order 12866 and in previous legislation. However, the requirements in the bill are also different from existing requirements in many respects. For example, S. 746 would address a number of topics that are not addressed by either UMRA or the executive order, including risk assessments and peer review. These requirements could have the effect of improving the quality of the cost-benefit analyses that agencies are currently required to perform. Also, S. 746 applies to rules issued by independent regulatory agencies that are not covered by Executive Order 12866. “an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities.” “(A) the agency proposing the rule or the Director (of the Office of Management and Budget) reasonably determines is likely to have an annual effect on the economy of $100,000,000 or more in reasonably quantifiable costs; or (B) is otherwise designated a major rule by the Director on the ground that the rule is likely to adversely affect, in a material way, the economy, a sector of the economy, including small business, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local or tribal governments, or communities.” Therefore, a rule that is economically significant under Executive Order 12866 because it is likely to have more than $100 million in benefits (but perhaps only $90 million in costs) would not be covered by the analytical requirements in S. 746 (unless designated by the Director). Also, the bill does not cover a rule if the agency determines that it imposes $90 million in costs plus other costs that are not “reasonably quantifiable.” If the intent of the bill is not to exclude these kinds of rules covered by the executive order, the definition of a major rule in subsection 621(7)(A) could be amended to eliminate the words “in reasonably quantifiable costs.” The centerpiece of S. 746 is its emphasis on cost-benefit analysis for major rules. The bill establishes detailed procedures for preparing those analyses and using them in the rulemaking process. Therefore, it is important to understand how agencies are currently preparing cost-benefit analyses. Mr. Chairman, in a 1998 report prepared at your and Senator Glenn’s request, we examined 20 cost-benefit analyses at 5 agencies to determine the extent to which those analyses contain the “best practices” elements recommended in the Office of Management and Budget’s (OMB) January 1996 guidance for conducting cost-benefit analyses. We concluded that some of these 20 analyses did not incorporate OMB’s best practices. For example, the guidance states that the cost-benefit analysis should show that the agency has considered the most important alternative approaches to the problem addressed by the proposed regulatory action. However, 5 of the 20 analyses that we examined did not discuss any alternatives to the proposed action, and some of the studies that discussed alternatives did so in a limited fashion. For example, the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) regulation on adolescents’ use of tobacco examined six regulatory alternatives but contained only a few paragraphs on the five that were ultimately rejected. A more thorough discussion of the alternatives that FDA considered would have better enabled the public to understand why the agency chose the proposed action. Six of the cost-benefit studies did not assign dollar values to benefits, and only six analyses specifically identified net benefits (benefits remaining after costs have been accounted for)—a key element in OMB’s guidance. Executive Order 12866, on which OMB’s guidance is based, emphasizes that agencies should select approaches that maximize net benefits unless a statute requires another regulatory approach. assumptions were not identified or were not explained in 8 of the analyses. For example, one analysis assumed a value of life that ranged from $1.6 million to $8.5 million while another analysis that was prepared in the same year assumed a value of life that ranged from $3 million to $12 million. In neither case did the analysis clearly explain why the values were chosen. Eight of the 20 cost-benefit analyses that we examined in our 1998 report did not include an executive summary that could help Congress, decisionmakers, the public, and other users quickly identify key information addressed in the analyses. In our 1997 report, 10 of the 23 analyses supporting air quality regulations did not have executive summaries. We have previously recommended that agencies’ cost-benefit analyses contain such summaries whenever possible, identifying (1) all benefits and costs, (2) the range of uncertainties associated with the benefits and costs, and (3) a comparison of all feasible alternatives. S. 746 addresses many of these areas of concern. For example, when an agency publishes a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for a major rule, section 623 of the bill would require agencies to prepare and place in the rulemaking file an initial regulatory analysis containing an analysis of the benefits and costs of the proposed rule and an evaluation of the benefits and costs of a reasonable number of alternatives. Section 623 also requires an evaluation of the relationship of the benefits of the proposed rule to its costs, including whether the rule is likely to substantially achieve the rulemaking objective in a more cost-effective manner or with greater net benefits than other reasonable alternatives. Finally, it requires agencies to include an executive summary in the regulatory analysis that describes, among other things, the key assumptions and scientific or economic information upon which the agency relied. vary from one analysis to another, the agencies should explain those variations. If enacted, Congress may want to review the implementation of this part of S. 746 to ensure that the initial regulatory analysis requirements apply to all of the rules that it anticipated. As I previously noted, the bill’s analytical requirements apply to all major rules at the time they are published as an NPRM. The Administrative Procedure Act of 1946 (APA) permits agencies to issue final rules without NPRMs when they find, for “good cause,” that the procedures are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest. When agencies use this exception, the APA requires the agencies to explicitly say so and provide an explanation for the exception’s use when the rule is published in the Federal Register. In a report we issued last April, we pointed out that 23 of the 122 final rules that were considered “major” under the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act and published between March 29, 1996, and March 29, 1998, were issued without a previous NPRM. If the same proportion holds true for the major rules covered by S. 746, the initial analytical requirements in the bill would not apply to nearly one-fifth of all final major rules. We also examined the issuance of final rules without NPRMs in another report that we issued last year. In some of the actions that we reviewed, agencies’ stated rationales for using the good cause exception were not clear or understandable. For example, in one such action, the agencies said in the preamble to the final rule that a 1993 executive order that imposed a 1994 deadline for implementation and incorporation of its policies into regulations prevented the agencies from obtaining public comments before issuing a final rule in 1995. In other actions, the agencies made only broad assertions in the preambles to the rules that an NPRM would delay the issuance of rules that were, in some general sense, in the public interest. appropriate situations. Similarly, we believe that using the issuance of NPRMs as the trigger for analytical requirements may be entirely appropriate. However, as a result, some major rules will probably not be subject to these requirements. S. 746 also requires agencies to provide for an independent peer review of any required risk assessments and cost-benefit analyses of major rules that the agencies or the OMB Director reasonably anticipate are likely to have a $500 million effect on the economy. Peer review is the critical evaluation of scientific and technical work products by independent experts. The bill states that the peer reviews should be conducted through panels that are “broadly representative” and involve participants with relevant expertise who are “independent of the agency.” We believe that important economic analyses should be peer reviewed. Given the uncertainties associated with predicting the future economic impacts of various regulatory alternatives, the rigorous, independent review of economic analyses should help enhance the quality, credibility, and acceptability of agencies’ decisionmaking. In our 1998 study of agencies’ cost-benefit analysis methods that I mentioned previously, only 1 of the 20 analyses that we examined received an independent peer review. Of the five agencies whose analyses we examined, only EPA had a formal peer review policy in place. Although OMB does not require peer reviews, the Administrator of OMB’s Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) testified in September 1997 that the administration supports peer review. However, she also said that the administration realizes that peer review is not cost-free in terms of agencies’ resources or time. The peer review requirements in S. 746 provide agencies with substantial flexibility. If an agency head certifies that adequate peer review has already been conducted, and the OMB Director concurs, the bill requires no further peer review. However, agencies will need to carefully plan for such reviews given the bill’s requirement that they be done for all risk assessments and each cost-benefit analysis for which the associated rule is expected to have a $500 million effect on the economy. Agencies will also need to ensure that a broad range of affected parties are represented on the panels and (as S. 746 requires) that panel reports reflect the diversity of opinions that exist. Mr. Chairman, last year we issued a report which you and Senator Glenn requested, assessing the implementation of the regulatory review transparency requirements in Executive Order 12866. Those requirements are similar to the public disclosure requirements in S. 746 in that they require agencies to identify for the public the substantive changes made during the period that the rules are being reviewed by OIRA, as well as changes made at the suggestion or recommendation of OIRA. We reviewed four major rulemaking agencies’ public dockets and concluded that it was usually very difficult to locate the documentation that the executive order required. In many cases, the dockets contained some evidence of changes made during or because of OIRA’s review, but we could not be sure that all such changes had been documented. In other cases, the files contained no evidence of OIRA changes, and we could not tell if that meant that there had been no such changes to the rules or whether the changes were just not documented. Also, the information in the dockets for some of the rules was quite voluminous, and many did not have indexes to help the public find the required documents. Therefore, we recommended that the OIRA Administrator issue guidance on how to implement the executive order’s transparency requirements. The OIRA Administrator’s comments in reaction to our recommendation appeared at odds with the requirements and intent of the executive order. Her comments may also signal a need for ongoing congressional oversight and, in some cases, greater specificity as Congress codifies agencies’ public disclosure responsibilities and OIRA’s role in the regulatory review process. For example, in response to our recommendation that OIRA issue guidance to agencies on how to improve the accessibility of rulemaking dockets, the Administrator said “it is not the role of OMB to advise other agencies on general matters of administrative practice.” The OIRA Administrator also indicated that she believed the executive order did not require agencies to document changes made at OIRA’s suggestion before a rule is formally submitted to OIRA for formal review. However, the Administrator also said that OIRA can become deeply involved in important agency rules well before they are submitted to OIRA. Therefore, adherence to her interpretation of the order would result in agencies’ failing to document OIRA’s early role in the rulemaking process. Those transparency requirements were put in place because of earlier congressional concerns regarding how rules were changed during the regulatory review process. Finally, the OIRA Administrator said that an “interested individual” could identify changes made to a draft rule by comparing drafts of the rule. This position seems to change the focus of responsibility in Executive Order 12866. The order requires agencies to identify for the public changes made to draft rules. It does not place the responsibility on the public to identify changes made to agency rules. Also, comparison of a draft rule submitted for review with the draft on which OIRA concluded review would not indicate which of the changes were made at OIRA’s suggestion—a specific requirement of the order. We believe that enactment of the public disclosure requirements in S. 746 would provide a statutory foundation to help ensure the public’s access to regulatory review information. In particular, the bill’s requirement that these rule changes be described in a single document would make it easier for the public to understand how rules change during the review process. We are also pleased to see that S. 746 requires agencies to document when no changes were made to the rules. Additional refinements to the bill may help clarify agencies’ responsibilities in light of the OIRA Administrator’s comments responding to our report. For example, S. 746 could state more specifically that agencies must document the changes made to rules at the suggestion or recommendation of OIRA whenever they occur, not just the changes made during the period of OIRA’s formal review. Similarly, if Congress wants OIRA to issue guidance on how agencies can structure rulemaking dockets to facilitate public access, S. 746 may need to specifically instruct the agencies to do so. S. 746 contains a number of provisions designed to improve regulatory management. These provisions strive to make the regulatory process more intelligible and accessible to the public, more effective, and better managed. Passage of S. 746 would provide a statutory foundation for such principles as openness, accountability, and sound science in rulemaking. This Committee has been diligent in its oversight of the federal regulatory process. However, our reviews of current regulatory requirements suggest that, even if S. 746 is enacted into law, congressional oversight will continue to be important to ensure that the principles embodied in the bill are faithfully implemented.

{"original_length": 4136, "trunc_length": 4096, "text": "\n\nSummarize the following text into a summary of less than 800 words.\n### Text:\n\nTribal officials we interviewed for our January 2016 report said they place a high priority on institutional and personal Internet access because of the numerous benefits, including the following: Economic Development: Officials from most tribes said high-speed Internet is essential for economic development such as finding employment or establishing online businesses. FCC also found that community access to Internet services is critical in facilitating job placement, career advancement, and other uses that help to stimulate economic activity. Education: Officials from many tribes stated that high-speed Internet access at schools supports educational success. For example, access can allow students to conduct online testing or to watch online lectures. Health: About half of the tribes said that high-speed Internet access to support telemedicine was important to the tribe, particularly in rural or remote areas. Officials from all 21 tribes we interviewed said that Internet service existed on at least some of their lands at varying connection speeds, ranging from less than 1 Mbps to over 25 Mbps. Some of the tribes we interviewed had at least some fiber optic high-speed Internet connections while others had slower copper lines, only mobile service, or only satellite service. Many of the tribal lands where we held interviews had some level of mobile Internet service but only a few had 4G mobile high-speed Internet services. Others had no mobile service. Further, officials from about half of the tribes we interviewed described important limitations to their Internet services, including higher than usual costs, small data allocations, slow download speeds, and unreliable connections. In January 2016, we found that the barriers to improvements in high- speed Internet service on tribal lands are interrelated. The rugged terrain and rural location as well as tribal members’ limited ability to pay for high- speed Internet service were tribes’ and private providers’ most commonly cited impediments. Many tribal officials and all six providers we interviewed said these barriers can deter private investment in infrastructure needed to connect remote towns and villages to a service provider’s core network—known as the middle-mile. Middle-mile infrastructure may include burying fiber optic or copper cables, stringing cable on existing poles, or erecting towers for wireless microwave links, which relay wireless Internet connections from tower to tower through radio spectrum. Tribal lands, located far from urban areas, may not have the middle-mile infrastructure necessary for providers to deploy high- speed Internet. Tribal officials and providers we interviewed also cited limited financial resources as a barrier to high-speed Internet access. Of the 21 tribes we interviewed, many reported poverty and affordability as drivers of low subscribership to existing Internet services or as a barrier to broadening the availability of services. Poverty rates among the tribes we interviewed varied, but many were well above the 2014 national average of 15.5 percent. Two of the providers we interviewed discussed non-payment among tribal households as a disincentive to Internet service provision. One provider said that the customers it serves on tribal lands had non- payment rates double that of other customer groups, and that these rates often follow seasonal employment patterns. About half of the tribes we interviewed told us that a lack of tribal members with sufficient bureaucratic and technical expertise was a common barrier to increasing high-speed Internet access on tribal lands. Tribal officials said that tribal members do not always have the bureaucratic expertise required to apply for federal funds, which can lead to mistakes or the need to hire consultants. A lack of technical expertise also affects tribes’ ability to interact with private-sector Internet providers. For the seven tribes we interviewed that either had a tribally-owned provider or were in the process of establishing one, three of them said that the lack of expertise in the tribe was a challenge to establishing a tribally-owned telecommunications provider for high-speed Internet deployment. To address this, in the early 2000s, FCC held a number of Indian telecommunications initiatives, regional workshops, and roundtables. In fiscal year 2012, the FCC’s Office of Native Affairs and Policy consulted with about 200 tribal nations, many during six separate one- to three-day telecommunications training and consultation sessions on tribal lands. These included the Native Learning Labs, where attendees could, for example, learn about data the FCC has available on spectrum licensing and USF programs, among other things. The Office held seven training workshops in fiscal years 2014 and 2015, and plans to offer more in fiscal year 2016. The goal of this new series of sessions is to provide tribal officials with information about funding opportunities and policy changes with respect to high-speed Internet, USF programs, and spectrum issues. In January 2016, we found that FCC and USDA implement mutually supportive, interrelated high-speed Internet access programs that offer funding to either tribal entities or service providers to achieve the goal of increased access. Tribal officials we interviewed said that both FCC’s and USDA’s programs were important for the expansion of high-speed Internet service on their lands. Tribes sometimes qualify for benefits from more than one of these programs, either directly or through private-sector Internet providers. Eligibility requirements are based on the need of an area as well as deployment requirements. Table 1 identifies three universal service programs that subsidize telecommunications carriers and services to areas that include tribal lands and two RUS grant programs. While FCC and USDA programs that promote high-speed Internet access on tribal lands are interrelated, we found that they are not always well coordinated. Our body of work has shown that interagency coordination can help agencies with interrelated programs ensure efficient use of resources and effective programs. Agencies can enhance and sustain their coordinated efforts by engaging in key practices, such as establishing compatible policies and procedures through official agreements. Agencies can also develop means to operate across agency boundaries, including leveraging resources across agencies for joint activities such as training and outreach. One area lacking coordination between FCC and USDA is their outreach and technical assistance efforts. FCC and USDA independently conduct outreach and training efforts for related programs promoting Internet access. For example, while FCC officials said they invite USDA officials to FCC training workshops and are sometimes invited to USDA training workshops, they said that they do not coordinate to develop joint outreach or training events. Synchronizing these activities could be a resource- saving mechanism, which could result in a more efficient use of limited federal resources, an opportunity for resource leveraging between the two agencies and a cost-savings to the tribes attending training events. For example, USDA held a training event in Washington State in fiscal year 2015 and FCC hosted a training event in Oregon the same year. The two agencies could have planned a joint training event in the Pacific Northwest Region—each contributing to the cost of the event—that would have reduced the cost burdens for tribes. Tribal members with limited budgets would not have had to travel twice or choose between the two training events. Better coordination on conferences, as feasible, could help FCC and USDA reach a broader audience and increase the value of their outreach to tribes. To this end, we recommended in January 2016 that FCC develop joint outreach and training efforts with USDA whenever feasible to help improve Internet availability and adoption on tribal lands. FCC concurred with our recommendation and summarized the areas in which it coordinates with USDA and said that it will continue to work with USDA to ensure more strategic and routine coordination. For example, FCC invited USDA officials to participate in all tribal consultation and training events planned for 2016. FCC defines Internet availability as the presence of Internet service in an area, and Internet adoption as the number of people in the area subscribing to Internet service. In 2006, we found that data on the rate of availability and adoption of Internet on tribal lands was unknown because no federal survey had been designed to capture this information. We recommended that additional data be identified to help assess progress towards providing access to telecommunications, including high-speed Internet, for Native Americans living on tribal lands. Since then, as discussed in our January 2016 report, the federal government has started collecting data on Internet availability and adoption. However, as of December 2015, FCC has not identified the performance goals and measures it intends to achieve for broadband availability or adoption on tribal lands. In 2011, The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), in cooperation with FCC and the states, began publishing the National Broadband Map, an interactive website that allows users to view information on high-speed Internet availability across the United States, including on tribal lands. The data to support the National Broadband Map is collected from service providers, including those offering service to federally recognized Indian tribes, including Alaska Native villages. The National Broadband Map website provides data on Internet availability on approximately 318 federal Indian reservations and associated trust lands, including upload and download speeds for both wireline and wireless service, technology for Internet delivery, and the number of Internet service providers. While the National Broadband Map provides information about high- speed Internet availability, according to NTIA officials, the map is based on Census blocks. If a service provider reported any availability of high- speed Internet in a Census block, the entire block was counted as served. This could create misrepresentations of service in rural areas, which generally constitute large Census blocks. Because much of tribal land is rural, the reported broadband service is shown to be greater than the actual service available on tribal lands, according to NTIA officials. Some tribal officials agreed that certain areas on the Broadband Map were inaccurate. For example, the map showed the Lac du Flambeau reservation in Wisconsin as covered because two providers reported that they provide Internet service on the reservation. However, according to tribal officials, the National Broadband Map exaggerated the level of service on their reservation making them unable to compete for some USF and RUS programs despite their efforts to document coverage problems to correct the map. One provider indicated that in rural areas, it is more difficult to get accurate data because in some cases addresses are not used, making it difficult to link service to a census block. However, in the future, this provider indicated that it planned to utilize GPS information to provide more accurate data. Five of the six providers we interviewed said that the reliability of the National Broadband Map has improved over time. In 2008, Congress passed the Broadband Data Improvement Act, which required the Bureau of the Census to collect information from residential households, including those on tribal lands. Census captured three aspects of Internet adoption: 1) whether a computer is owned or used at the residence, 2) if the household subscribes to Internet service, and if so, 3) whether that service is dial-up or a high-speed connection. Census began collecting the required data on Internet adoption beginning with the 2013 American Community Survey (ACS). According to Census officials, five years of ACS data must be collected to provide data for areas with smaller populations. Census officials said that this data will be available in late 2018 and will provide an estimate for Internet adoption nationwide, including the first estimates for hard to reach populations such as Native Americans. Agency performance measurement is the ongoing monitoring and reporting of program accomplishments, particularly towards pre- established goals. Performance measurement allows organizations to track progress in achieving their goals and provides information to identify gaps in program performance and plan any needed improvements. The GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 requires annual performance plans to include performance measures to show the progress the agency is making in achieving its goals. Further, we have identified best practices in articulating goals that include: showing baseline and trend data for past performance, and identifying projected target levels for performance for multi-year goals. Making high-speed Internet, including broadband Internet, available to all Americans is FCC’s stated long-term objective, but we found in January 2016 that FCC has not set goals to demonstrate or measure progress toward achieving it. The National Broadband Map is currently the best tool for setting goals and measuring progress toward increasing the availability of high-speed Internet on tribal lands. Map data are widely used by FCC to describe the availability of broadband nationwide. For example, FCC uses data gathered for the National Broadband Map in its annual Broadband Progress report provided to Congress as required by the Telecommunications Act of 1996. To improve performance management, we recommended in our January 2016 report that FCC develop performance goals and measures using, for example, data from the National Broadband Map, to track progress on achieving its strategic goal of making broadband internet available to households on tribal lands, and FCC agreed with our recommendation. Although Census is gathering baseline information on household Internet adoption, and the National Broadband Map provides data on high-speed Internet availability across the country, we found that FCC lacks the specific information it needs to measure the outcomes of its E-rate program at tribal schools and libraries. The E-rate program provides assistance to schools, school districts, and libraries to obtain telecommunications technology, including high-speed Internet. E-rate does not specifically target tribal schools and libraries, although some are eligible and receive benefits. Since 2010, E-rate has committed more than $13 billion in service provider customer fees to schools and libraries, and according to data provided by FCC, at least $1 billion of that amount supports tribal institutions. FCC’s E-rate program has a stated goal of ensuring that all schools and libraries have affordable access to modern broadband technologies. Communicating what an agency intends to achieve and its programs for doing so are fundamental aims of performance management and required under the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010. Specifically the act requires an agency to have measurable, quantifiable, outcome-oriented goals for major functions and operations, an annual performance plan consistent with FCC’s strategic plan and a means to communicate the outcomes of its efforts. However, FCC has not set any quantifiable goals and performance measures for its E-rate efforts to extend high-speed Internet in schools and libraries nationwide or on tribal lands. According to federal internal control standards, government managers should ensure there are adequate means of obtaining information from external stakeholders that may have a significant impact on the agency meeting its goals. To that end, FCC collects information on E-rate recipients nationwide through questions on its application for E-rate assistance. Several different types of institutions on tribal lands can qualify for E-rate funding, including schools operated by the tribe or Bureau of Indian Education, private schools operating on a reservation, and public school districts that serve the reservation. On FCC’s E-rate application, applicants receiving service may self-identify as tribal, but in this instance, the application provides no definition of “tribal.” We found that not all schools and libraries on tribal lands identify themselves as such during the application process. FCC provided us with information on E-rate recipients between 2010 and 2014 that self-identified as tribal, and the amounts committed to those recipients. These data may understate the amount of funds supporting schools on tribal lands. Specifically, we identified more than 60 additional school districts, private schools, and public libraries on the lands of the 21 tribes we studied that received E- rate assistance but were not included in FCC’s information on tribal recipients. Consequently, FCC does not have accurate information on the number of federally recognized tribes, including Alaska Native villages, receiving E-rate support, or the amount being provided to them. Without more precise information and direction from FCC, the extent to which E- rate assistance is provided to tribal institutions cannot be reliably determined, nor can FCC rely on the information to develop quantifiable goals and performance measures for improving high-speed Internet access in tribal schools or libraries. It is important to understand how these programs affect tribal institutions because FCC has made improving high-speed Internet access in tribal institutions a priority following the National Broadband Plan, with the establishment of the Office of Native Affairs and Policy in 2010, and its current Strategic Plan. To address these concerns, in January 2016, we recommended that FCC: improve the reliability of data related to institutions receiving E-rate funding by defining “tribal” on the program application. FCC agreed with our recommendation and intends to provide guidance to applicants in fiscal year 2017. develop performance goals and measures to track progress on achieving its strategic objective of ensuring that all tribal schools and libraries have affordable access to modern broadband technologies. FCC also agreed with this recommendation, indicating that goals and performance measures, among other things, will substantially improve the accessibility of modern broadband technologies for tribal schools and libraries.

This testimony examines: (1) perspectives of tribes and providers on high-speed Internet access and barriers to increasing this access; (2) the level of interrelation and coordination between federal programs that promote high-speed Internet access on tribal lands; and (3) existing data and performance measures related to high-speed Internet on tribal lands. This statement is based on GAO's January 2016 report (GAO-16-222). For this report, GAO visited or interviewed officials from a non-generalizable sample of 21 tribal entities and 6 service providers. GAO also reviewed FCC and USDA fiscal year 2010 through 2014 program data, funding, and materials and interviewed federal officials. In January 2016, GAO found that, although all 21 tribes GAO interviewed have some access to high-speed Internet, barriers to increasing access remain. Tribal officials and Internet providers said that high poverty rates among tribes and the high costs of connecting remote tribal villages to core Internet networks limit high-speed Internet availability and access. About half of the tribes GAO interviewed also said that the lack of sufficient administrative and technical expertise among tribal members limits their efforts to increase high-speed Internet access. The Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) Universal Service Fund subsidy programs and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Rural Utilities Service grant programs are interrelated. The programs seek to increase high-speed Internet access in underserved areas, including tribal lands. GAO's previous work on overlap, duplication, and fragmentation has shown that interagency coordination on interrelated programs can help ensure efficient use of resources and effective programs. However, FCC and USDA do not coordinate to develop joint outreach and training, which could result in inefficient use of federal resources and missed opportunities for resource leveraging. For example, USDA and FCC held separate training events in the Pacific Northwest Region in 2015 when a joint event could have saved limited training funds and reduced costs. FCC has placed special emphasis on improving Internet access on tribal lands following the issuance of the National Broadband Plan in 2010, which called for greater efforts to make broadband available on tribal lands. However, FCC has not developed performance goals and measures for improving high-speed Internet availability to households on tribal lands. FCC could establish baseline measures to track its progress by using, for example, the National Broadband Map which includes data on Internet availability on tribal lands. FCC also lacks both reliable data on high-speed Internet access and performance goals and measures for high-speed Internet access by tribal institutions—such as schools and libraries. Specifically, FCC's E-rate program provides funds to ensure that schools and libraries have affordable access to modern broadband technologies, but FCC has neither defined “tribal” on its E-rate application nor set any performance goals for the program's impact on tribal institutions. Without these goals and measures FCC cannot assess the impact of its efforts. In January 2016, GAO recommended that FCC take the following actions in tribal areas: (1) develop joint training and outreach with USDA; (2) develop performance goals and measures for improving broadband availability to households; (3) develop performance goals and measures for improving broadband availability to schools and libraries; and (4) improve the reliability of FCC data related to institutions that receive E-rate funding by defining “tribal” on the program application. FCC agreed with the recommendations."}

Within EM, innovative technology projects have been funded by OST, the Office of Waste Management, the Office of Environmental Restoration, and the Office of Nuclear Material and Facility Stabilization. In August 1994, we reported that insufficient coordination and integration of technology development activities across EM’s program offices, and between headquarters and the field, had limited the use of innovative cleanup technologies. In response to our concerns and the concerns of others, in January 1994, EM restructured its technology development program around five high-priority problems, or “focus areas”: radioactive tank waste remediation (Tanks); characterization, treatment, and disposal of mixed waste (Mixed Waste); containment and remediation of contaminant plumes (Plumes); stabilization of landfills (Landfill Stabilization); and decontamination and decommissioning (D&D). Within each focus area, the restructuring created teams of technology developers, users, and other stakeholders, including members from both headquarters and the field, to increase the likelihood that new technologies would be used to clean up the contamination at DOE’s sites. In addition, EM made OST responsible for centrally managing technology development to ensure the coordination of activities and the elimination of unnecessary duplication across all of EM’s program offices. Within the research and development community, experts agree that some duplication in projects is useful to provide the competition that results in the best science. However, EM officials and peer review experts we spoke with generally agreed that several projects competing in a specific area of technology would be sufficient. Our August 1994 report said that although OST’s mission was to manage EM’s nationwide technology development program, other program offices within EM conducted their own projects, which often overlapped and conflicted with OST’s activities. We also found that DOE did not have a comprehensive needs assessment for ranking and funding technology development projects as effectively as possible. Although EM originally established the focus area approach to coordinate technology development activities across its program offices, we found that only OST was evaluating the projects that it funded to identify areas of possible overlap and excessive duplication. EM directed its other program offices to support the focus area approach by appointing “user” representatives to serve on focus area management teams, but some of these offices did not inventory their projects, and their projects did not receive the same level of scrutiny as OST’s. As a result, no comprehensive list of EM’s technology development projects had been compiled. We were able to determine that, apart from OST, only the Office of Waste Management funded technology development at field sites during fiscal years 1995 and 1996. We were unable to verify the extent of the possible overlap and duplication between the two offices, since no comprehensive list of the Office of Waste Management’s projects was available. Partial lists had, however, been prepared for the Mixed Waste and Tanks focus areas. The Office of Waste Management did not formerly require its sites to describe their technology development projects because it viewed technology development as an integral part of the sites’ waste management activities. However, the office plans to begin collecting this information in support of its fiscal year 1998 work plan. In a preliminary review of projects funded by OST and the Office of Waste Management, we found that these offices had funded a large number of melter projects and that several projects had received funds from other DOE program offices as well. At our request, OST compiled a comprehensive list of all DOE-funded melter projects. This list revealed that DOE had contributed funds for 60 different melters at various sites across the country and fully funded 52 of them. According to a DOE official, a melter costs between $15 million and $30 million to develop fully. OST’s list indicated that most of the funding for these melters came from Energy Research and certain EM program offices but some also came from Defense Programs. OST has no summary information on the total amount of funding dedicated to melter projects; however, in 1996, EM funded melter projects totaling more than $40 million. In November 1995, concerned about possible overlap and duplication, the managers from the Mixed Waste and Landfill Stabilization focus areas convened a group of experts in melter technology from outside the agency to determine whether the number of melter projects should be reduced. The experts concluded that although some duplication is useful, DOE was sponsoring far more melter projects than were needed. The experts characterized DOE’s technology development effort as “a proliferation of melter systems” and recommended that the Department reduce the number of melter projects significantly because many of the technologies, such as joule-heated melters, are already available in the commercial sector. The experts noted that when enough vendors are available to bid competitively on cleaning up a site using a particular type of technology, DOE should say “enough is enough” and cease to support the research and development of that technology. When EM first conceived the focus area approach, OST was responsible for managing the technology development program centrally at headquarters. However, as this approach evolved, EM shifted the program’s leadership to the field as part of a Department-wide effort to decentralize. Between July 1994 and February 1995, EM delegated the leadership for the five focus areas to the following locations: Tanks: Richland, Washington; Mixed Waste: Idaho Falls, Idaho; Plumes: Savannah River, South Carolina; Landfill Stabilization: Savannah River, South Carolina; D&D: Morgantown, West Virginia OST chose three of the lead sites through a competitive process, considering each site’s experience in an area and the strength of the management team described in the site’s proposal. Thus, OST chose Richland for Tanks, Idaho Falls for Mixed Waste, and Savannah River for Plumes. Subsequently, OST selected Savannah River, without competition, to lead the Landfill Stabilization focus area. Because the Landfill Stabilization and Plumes focus areas are interrelated, OST did not consider competition necessary. Finally, OST chose Morgantown to lead the D&D focus area because its staff had expertise in contracting—an important consideration, since many D&D technologies are available in the private sector. OST gave the lead sites the responsibility for managing the nationwide program for their respective focus areas. Their responsibilities included (1) making nationwide funding decisions among potential technology development projects and (2) ensuring that the needs of customers across all DOE sites and EM offices, as well as various stakeholder groups nationwide, were met. However, OST provided the lead sites with no specific guidelines for selecting projects. We found that by delegating the lead responsibility for the focus areas to field locations and by not providing any guidelines for selecting projects, EM created an organizational structure that allows certain lead sites to favor their own projects. Within each focus area, the funding for projects has begun to be concentrated at the lead sites. For fiscal year 1996, each lead site received more dollars for projects in its focus area than it had received for fiscal year 1995, before the restructuring (see table 1). The concentration of funding at certain lead sites may, in part, reflect an extended history of work in a particular area, yet in some instances it also represents a dramatic shift in funding away from the nonlead sites. At Idaho Falls, for example, the increase in funding for Mixed Waste projects evolved from this lead site’s long-term work on buried waste. At Savannah River, however, the increase in funding for Landfill Stabilization projects—from 8 percent in 1995 to 27 percent in 1996—may have occurred, to some extent, because management wanted to secure support for researchers at the lead site. According to researchers and field representatives at Savannah River, one reason for the increase in funding at Savannah River was to provide support for researchers on-site whose work had previously been funded through DOE’s Defense Programs office. Meanwhile, the percentage of funding for Landfill Stabilization projects at Idaho Falls, for example, dropped from 46 percent in 1995 to 20 percent in 1996. Such shifts in workload have led to expressions of concern by nonlead sites that their proposals are not being treated fairly because their focus area’s management has a vested interest in selecting proposals submitted from the lead site. To ensure that proposals are selected fairly on the basis of their scientific merits, the National Academy of Sciences’ National Research Council recommends that agencies use some form of peer review to judge the quality of proposals. The Council defines “peer reviewers” as established working scientists or engineers from diverse institutions who are deeply knowledgeable about a field of study and who provide disinterested technical judgments as to the scientific significance of a proposed work, the competence of the researchers, the soundness of the research plan, and the likelihood of success. We found, however, that although the lead sites used significantly different systems to select projects, none of them used disinterested reviewers to determine the technical merit of the proposed work. For example, in the Plumes focus area, the members of Savannah River’s lead team decided which projects should receive funding; no peer reviewers evaluated the proposals’ technical merit. Although the Landfill Stabilization and Mixed Waste focus areas did use peer reviewers, most were associated with the local leadership team and, therefore, were not independent. The Tanks focus area used an elaborate system of technical review, but many of the reviewers were not independent. Finally, the D&D focus area did not use peer reviewers for fiscal year 1996 because the large demonstration projects upon which the fiscal year 1996 D&D program is based were competitively selected. During a 1995 review of EM’s technology development program, the National Research Council noted that EM’s process for selecting projects should incorporate a review of proposals by a knowledgeable independent review group comprising individuals from outside the agency with no vested interests in the outcome. According to the Council, this independent peer review system should (1) exclude those reviewers who might be considered to have a conflict of interest and (2) be carefully implemented to ensure equity. Starting in December 1995, OST began taking actions independently to improve the technology development program’s management within its own office and within EM as a whole. To eliminate duplication and overlap and to promote coordination across EM’s programs, OST developed a strategy in February 1996 that will coordinate and rank technology development projects funded by EM’s various program offices. To eliminate overlap among focus areas within its own office, OST scheduled a comprehensive review of all ongoing work in each focus area to clarify which projects each focus area should be funding. OST’s review is scheduled to be completed by the end of June 1996. In addition, in February 1996, OST combined the Plumes and Landfill Stabilization focus areas into the Subsurface Contamination focus area. Responding to the recommendations of the OST-sponsored melter review panel, the focus areas began to close out melter projects in December 1995, and in April 1996, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of OST told us that OST had decided to stop funding melter projects because most melter technologies are now available commercially. To help ensure that the funding for projects is not being concentrated at the focus areas’ lead sites unless warranted by the projects’ technical merits, senior OST officials told us that they plan to direct the focus areas’ managers to use independent peer reviewers in selecting projects. OST indicated that this system will be in place for the fiscal year 1997 selection process. Reviewers are to be “external, independent, and technically qualified” to determine the technical and scientific merits of specific projects and to ensure that projects are selected on the basis of their merits without regard to the location of the work. We provided a copy of our report to DOE for its review and comment. The offices of Science and Technology, Environmental Restoration, and Nuclear Material and Facility Stabilization did not provide comments. A senior technical adviser in the office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Waste Management commented on our statement that, despite the promising steps taken to improve the management of technology development, it is not clear that OST can effectively coordinate technology development across EM’s program offices without EM’s leadership and support. According to the Office of Waste Management, EM has given OST leadership and support to coordinate technology development. Specifically, the Office of Waste Management cited the former Assistant Secretary for Environmental Management’s strategic goals, and the newly confirmed Assistant Secretary for Environmental Management’s guiding principles, for focusing EM’s technology development efforts. While we agree that such goals and principles are important as guides to DOE’s technology development efforts, we note that they do not provide specific direction for eliminating duplication and promoting coordination across EM’s programs. Accordingly, we have not changed this portion of our report. We conducted our review from May 1995 through June 1996 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Appendix I provides a detailed discussion of our scope and methodology. As arranged with your office, unless you publicly announce its contents earlier, we plan no further distribution of this report until 7 days from the date of this letter. At that time, we will send copies to the appropriate congressional committees; the Secretary of Energy; and the Director, Office of Management and Budget. We will also make copies available to others upon request. Please call me at (202) 512-3841 if you or your staff have any questions about the information provided in this report. Major contributors to this report are listed in appendix II. At the request of the Ranking Minority Member, Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, we examined the Office of Environmental Management’s (EM) current management practices in selecting innovative projects for funding. Specifically, we determined whether EM is managing its program to prevent (1) excessive duplication and unnecessary overlap and (2) an unwarranted concentration of projects at certain field offices. To determine whether excessive duplication and unnecessary overlap existed within EM’s program, we obtained the opinions of experts on duplication in research projects. Specifically, we attended the 3-day melter review panel, which was sponsored by EM’s Mixed Waste and Landfill Stabilization focus areas in November 1995, and we spoke with other researchers who have served as peer reviewers for the National Academy of Sciences. We requested descriptions of all technology development projects from each EM program office for fiscal years 1995 and 1996. After determining that the Office of Environmental Restoration and the Office of Nuclear Material and Facility Stabilization were not currently developing technology, we limited our review to information received on projects funded by the Office of Science and Technology’s (OST) focus areas and the Office of Waste Management. To determine whether there was an unwarranted concentration of projects at certain field sites, we compared the distribution of projects among sites for fiscal years 1995 and 1996. We also reviewed the process each focus area used to select projects for funding, after the focus areas’ leadership was moved to the field. In the course of our work, we interviewed the Deputy Assistant Secretaries of Environmental Restoration, Waste Management, Nuclear Material and Facility Stabilization, and Science and Technology, representing each of the EM program offices that have historically funded technology development activities. We also interviewed the leaders of each of the five focus areas. In addition, we attended several of the Technology Development Council’s meetings, as well as the February 1996 meeting of the Focus Area Board of Directors, which OST convened to address the concerns we noted during our review. We obtained and reviewed pertinent documents, including copies of the proposals received by each of the focus areas for fiscal year 1996, as well as descriptions of the projects funded in fiscal 1996. We performed our review from May 1995 through June 1996 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

{"original_length": 4175, "trunc_length": 4096, "text": "\n\nSummarize the following text into a summary of less than 800 words.\n### Text:\n\nScience and technology is traditionally divided into three broad categories: basic research, applied research, and advanced technology development. Basic research attempts to produce new knowledge in a scientific or technological area. This research is not associated with a specific weapon system. Applied research supports the development and maturation of new technologies for a defined military application. Advanced development entails large-scale hardware development and technology integration in more operationally realistic settings. Research and development beyond these categories is done in support of a specific weapon system. In the Air Force, the focal point for science and technology investments is the Air Force Research Laboratory. It was created in 1997 to centrally manage all Air Force science and technology efforts. Previously, the Air Force operated 13 different laboratories across the country. The present Air Force Research Laboratory, headquartered at Wright Patterson Air Force Base, comprises 10 technology directorates. Nine directorates handle applied and advanced development projects. The 10th directorate, the Office of Scientific Research, manages the Air Force’s basic research projects. The Air Force Research Laboratory biennially generates a comprehensive strategic plan that supports the national military strategy and the Air Force Strategic Plan. In the past, the Air Force was a leader in high-technology exploration. According to a January 2000 Air Force Association study, the Air Force was the unquestioned leader in science and technology investments at the end of the Cold War. In the 1990s, however, it dropped to third place, behind the Army and Navy. The Congress has been concerned about the Air Force’s level of investment in science and technology. For fiscal year 2000, the House and Senate Armed Services Committees noted that the Air Force in particular, had failed to comply with the science and technology funding objective specified in the prior year’s authorization act, thus jeopardizing the stability of the technology base and increasing the risk of failure to maintain technological superiority in future weapons systems. In 2001, the Scientific Advisory Board found that the Air Force’s science and technology program needed to improve its planning process and generate stronger user support and sponsorship. It also found weaknesses in the connection between operational requirements and science and technology programs, which inhibited the prioritization of investments. The Air Force complied with the overall requirements of the National Defense Authorization Act regarding long-term challenges. (See table 1 for the checklist of provisions.) The act defined a long-term challenge as a high-risk, high-payoff effort that will provide a focus for research in the next 20 to 50 years. To identify potential long-term challenges, an Air Force review team obtained over 140 ideas from a variety of sources in the scientific community. Ideas ranged from cloaking technologies (the deceptive masking of assets) and holodeck command capabilities (virtual reality battlespace control) to micro weapons like ubiquitous “battle bees” (miniaturized unmanned air vehicles) and cyber warfare technologies. The team evaluated these ideas to ensure that they complied with the three primary criteria specified in the act. The potential long-term challenges had to involve (1) compelling Air Force requirements; (2) high-risk, high- payoff areas of exploration; and (3) very difficult but achievable results. Yet another provision in the act required that the team should avoid selecting projects that are linear extensions of ongoing science and technology projects. This provision was more difficult to assess, but after additional deliberations, the team determined that the following six challenges satisfied the criteria in the act: Finding and Tracking. To provide the decision maker with target quality information from anywhere in near real-time. Command and Control. To assess, plan, and direct aerospace operations from anywhere or from multiple locations in near real-time. Controlled Effects. To create precise effects rapidly, with the ability to retarget quickly against complex target sets anywhere, anytime, for as long as required. Sanctuary. To protect our total force from natural and man-made hazards or threats, allowing us to operate anywhere with the lowest risk possible. Rapid Aerospace Response. To respond as quickly as necessary to support peacetime operations or crises and move this response to another location very rapidly if needed. Effective Aerospace Persistence. To sustain the flow of equipment and supplies as well as the application of force for as long as required. Once the long-term challenges were identified, the Air Force followed the planning process specified in the act. For example, it established six work groups tasked with identifying possible approaches to address these challenges. The groups had about 9 weeks to complete their work. As required, a technical coordinator, assisted by a management coordinator, headed each group. Each group also complied with the requirement to hold a workshop within the science and technology community to obtain suggestions on possible approaches and promising areas of research. The workshop participants satisfied the requirement to identify current work that addresses the challenge, deficiencies in current work, and promising areas of research. Finally, the groups were also expected to select projects that were not linear extensions of current science and technology work. This particular provision was not easy for some groups to define. Some pondered the relative nature of the term. For example, a user would perceive “nonlinearity” differently than a scientist. Another group characterized it as a quantum leap in capability. Another definition associated nonlinear projects with multiple-capability dimensions. For example, if doubling the payload capacity of a weapon is a linear extension, then doubling the payload, speed, and range of the weapon would also be a nonlinear extension. Regardless of the definition selected, each group addressed the issue in its planning process. Each group summarized the results of its workshop in a briefing that contained enabling capabilities, research areas, technology roadmaps, and associated funding requirements. In many cases, the level of funding projections was double or triple the level of the planned budget. For example, the level of funding projections for basic research in physics, materials, mathematics, and computer science was more than triple the planned investment levels. The Air Force complied with the overall provisions of the National Defense Authorization Act regarding short-term objectives. (See table 2 for the checklist of provisions.) As required, the Air Force established a task force consisting of representatives from the Air Force Chief of Staff and combatant commands to identify short-term objectives. The task force obtained about 58 ideas from the requirements, user, and acquisition communities as specified in the act. Because of the mandated short-term focus, most of the input involved enhancing or accelerating ongoing research efforts—not initiating entirely new areas of research. These ideas included maintaining aging aircraft, combat identification, and time-critical targeting. While these are not new concepts, they still present significant technological challenges. We have recently reported on weaknesses in each of these areas. The task force reviewed each idea to ensure that it complied with the criteria in the act: (1) to involve compelling Air Force requirements, (2) to have support within the user community, and (3) to likely attain the desired benefits within 5 years. To ensure that each idea represented a compelling Air Force requirement, the task force evaluated each idea against the Air Force’s core competencies and critical future capabilities. To meet the user support requirement, the task force linked each potential short-term objective to specific mission needs and requirements documents. The objectives were reviewed and approved by the Air Force’s corporate structure. To ensure that the projects selected would achieve results in 5 years, the task force decided to use the technology maturity levels highlighted in a recent GAO report. The following is a list of the eight short-term objectives. Target Location, Identification, and Track. To detect, locate, track, and identify air/ground targets anytime in countermeasure environments in near real time. Command, Control, Communication, Computers, and Intelligence. To dynamically assess, plan, and execute global missions. Precision Attack. To engage air and ground targets from manned and unmanned vehicles with the precision and speed necessary to bring about decisive results. Space Control. To increase the survivability of critical space assets. Access to Space. To improve access to space through responsive, cost- effective launch systems. Aircraft Survivability and Countermeasures. To improve the ability to survive and operate against airborne and ground threats in all environments. Sustaining Aging Systems. To extend the service life of aging aircraft and space launch systems with reduced manpower, reduced total ownership costs, and enhanced reliability. Air Expeditionary Forces Support. To provide air expeditionary forces with the ability to operate with highly responsive and agile combat support forces. After the objectives were identified, the Air Force complied with the planning process specified in the act. As required, it established an integrated product team to address each short-term objective. Each team was composed of a cross-cutting mix of officials from the requirements, user, and science and technology communities, as the act specified. According to many of the short-term objective team leaders, the cross- cutting nature of the teams was very productive. Not only did they believe that their planning was enhanced by the direct input from users and requirements officials, they also believed that the expertise and assistance from scientists in other laboratory directorates improved the process. Each team satisfied the requirement to identify, define, and prioritize the enabling capabilities necessary to meet the objectives. As required, each team identified the deficiencies in the enabling capabilities and projects necessary to eliminate the deficiencies. The teams summarized their work in briefings that contained prioritized lists of enabling capabilities, a definition of the objectives, technology roadmaps, and budget spreadsheets. The spreadsheets detailed the current and additional funding required to achieve the objectives. Obtaining the additional funding was a concern to many teams. Many teams identified funding requirements that greatly exceeded current funding levels; it was not uncommon for proposed annual funding levels to double or triple the level currently projected. For example, the Command, Control, Communication, Computer, and Intelligence team proposed programs that would require from 2.6 to over 4 times the planned annual investment. Another concern was the 15-year gap between the short-term objective and long-term challenge planning. According to the act’s provisions, the short- term teams were required to focus on technologies that would be mature in 5 years; the long-term teams focused on technologies needed 20 to 50 years in the future. According to laboratory officials, this mid-term gap constitutes much of the normal science and technology planning effort and represents a critical point in science and technology project development. This time frame is where science and technology can have a significant impact. The Air Force currently addresses this time frame in its normal planning process. In addition, this period is covered in the long-term challenge technology roadmaps, at least for the research efforts associated with those six challenges. The Air Force satisfied the top-level review requirements in the act. (See table 3 for the checklist of provisions.) The act required the secretary of the Air Force to conduct a timely review of the science and technology programs and to assess the budgetary resources needed to address the long- and short-term needs. The secretary delegated this responsibility to the deputy assistant secretary for Science, Technology and Engineering. The deputy complied with the requirement to conduct a review of the long- and short-term science and technology programs within the 1 year time limit specified in the act. On October 25, 2001, the deputy briefed the secretary on the final results and received his approval. The act also required the secretary to assess the fiscal year 2001 budget resources used and needed to adequately address science and technology needs. After consultation with representatives from the House and Senate Armed Services Committees, however, the deputy changed the budget baseline to fiscal year 2002. This was done to reflect the science and technology budget realignment occurring in fiscal year 2002. The deputy assessed the 2002 budget resources planned for science and technology programs and determined that they were adequately funded. The deputy noted, however, that the current level of funding would enable the programs to pursue the minimum level of scientific research. Additional funding would be required to pursue other projects. The deputy also complied with the provision to evaluate whether the ongoing and projected science and technology programs addressed the long- and short-term science and technology needs. He determined that the programs did address these needs, thus obviating the requirement to develop a course of action for science and technology programs that do not address the long- term challenges or short-term objectives. Finally, the act required the secretary to review the long-term challenges and short-term objectives and to identify additional work that should be undertaken to meet the challenges and objectives. The deputy complied with both provisions. Not only did he review the results of the long- and short-term planning efforts and identify additional work, but he also directed that the additional work be incorporated into the laboratory’s future planning, programming, and budget decisions. The deputy was in a unique position to address these requirements. He served not only as the overall review director for the science and technology planning process, but also as the chairman of the short-term objective task force. As a result, the deputy had many opportunities to review the work of both the long- term challenge and particularly the short-term objective planning teams. Because the Air Force complied with the provisions of the act, we are not making any recommendations in this report. The Department of Defense has reviewed this report and concurs with its contents. We conducted our work from May 2001 to January 2002 in compliance with generally accepted auditing standards. Additional information on our scope and methodology is located in appendix I. If you have any questions about the information contained in this letter, please call me at (202) 512-4530. Major contributors to this work included Robert Murphy, Rae Ann Sapp, and Kristin Pamperin. To document the extent to which the Air Force complied with the long- term planning process specified in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001, we obtained appointment letters, membership rosters, initial guidance and work plans, meeting schedules, biographies of each technical coordinator, and a comprehensive listing of the initial long-term challenge ideas. We also obtained minutes from team meetings, weekly activity reports, E-mail communications, interim and final briefing reports, associated studies, workshop agendas and results, current and projected budget spreadsheets, capability lists, and promising research areas. To discuss how each team addressed the act’s provisions, we met with each long-term challenge technical coordinator and management coordinator. We also met with officials from the Air Force Research Laboratory’s headquarters and the Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Science, Technology, and Engineering. Finally, we physically observed the proceedings of one long-term challenge workshop over the course of 2 days. To determine whether each provision was addressed, we prepared summary checklists for each long-term challenge and keyed the data back to a specific provision of the act.

In looking to the states it is necessary to disaggregate them into several categories. First, 8 states have biennial legislative cycles and hence necessarily have biennial budget cycles. Second, as the table below shows, the 42 states with annual legislative cycles present a mixed picture in terms of budget cycles: 27 describe their budget cycles as annual, 12 describe their budget cycles as biennial and 3 describe their budget cycles as mixed. The National Association of State Budget Officers (NASBO) reports that those states that describe their system as “mixed” have divided the budget into two categories: that for which budgeting is annual and that for which it is biennial. Connecticut has changed its budget cycle from biennial to annual and back to biennial. In the last 3 decades, 17 other states have changed their budget cycles: 11 from biennial to annual, 3 from annual to mixed, and 3 from annual to biennial. Translating state budget laws, practices, and experiences to the federal level is always difficult. As we noted in our review of state balanced budget practices, state budgets fill a different role, may be sensitive to different outside pressures, and are otherwise not directly comparable. In addition, governors often have more unilateral power over spending than the President does. However, even with those caveats, the state experience may offer some insights for your deliberations. Perhaps significant is the fact that most states that describe their budget cycles as biennial or mixed are small and medium sized. Of the 10 largest states in terms of general fund expenditures, Ohio is the only one with an annual legislative cycle and a biennial budget. According to a State of Ohio official, every biennium two annual budgets are enacted, and agencies are prohibited from moving funds across years. In addition, the Ohio legislature typically passes a “budget corrections bill.” A few preliminary observations can be made from looking at the explicit design of those states which describe their budget cycle as “mixed” and the practice of those which describe their budget cycle as “biennial.” Different items are treated differently. For example, in Missouri the operating budget is on an annual cycle while the capital budget is biennial. In Arizona “major budget units”—the agencies with the largest budgets—submit annual requests; these budgets are also the most volatile and the most dependent on federal funding. In Kansas the 20 agencies that are on a biennial cycle are typically small, single-program or regulatory-type agencies that are funded by fees rather than general fund revenues. In general, budgeting for those items which are predictable is different than for those items subject to great volatility whether due to the economy or changes in federal policy. S. 1434, like a number of previous bills, proposes that the entire budget cycle be shifted from annual to biennial. Under this system, the President would submit budgets every 2 years. Authorizations would be for 2 years or longer. Budget resolutions would be adopted, and appropriations enacted, every 2 years. We believe that this need not be seen as an all-or-nothing proposal. Budget agreements, authorizations, budget resolutions, and appropriations need not cover the same time period. Multiyear fiscal policy agreements and multiyear authorizations make a great deal of sense, but they do not require changing the appropriations decision cycle from annual to biennial. While biennial appropriations could save time for agencies, they would result in a shift in congressional control and oversight. Proposals to change the process should be viewed partly in the context of their effect on the relative balance of power in this debate. We have previously supported the use of multiyear authorizations for federal programs. There seems to be little reason to reexamine and reauthorize programs more often than they might actually be changed. Furthermore, multiyear authorizations help both the Congress and the executive branch by providing a longer term perspective within which a program may operate and appropriations can be determined. This is the normal practice for most of the nondefense portion of the budget. We also agree that a 2-year budget resolution is worth considering. Especially in an era of multiyear spending caps and multiyear reconciliation instructions, a 2-year budget resolution may not be a major change. However, a way would have to be found to update the Congressional Budget Office’s (CBO) forecast and baseline against which legislative action is “scored.” As you know, CBO scores legislation on the economic assumptions in effect at the time of the budget resolution. Even under the current system there are years when this practice presents problems: in 1990 the economic slowdown was evident during the year, but consistent practice meant that bills reported in compliance with reconciliation instructions were scored on the assumptions in the budget resolution. If budget resolutions were biennial, this problem of outdated assumptions would be greater—some sort of update in the “off year” would be necessary. We have also said that we believe that at a time when major efforts are under way to reduce the deficit, there should be some way to look back and track progress against any multiyear fiscal policy plan. Such a formal “lookback” would be even more critical under a biennial budget resolution. Traditionally, biennial budgeting has been advocated as a way to advance several objectives: (1) to shift the allocation of agency officials’ time from the preparation of budgets and justifications to improved financial management and analysis of program effectiveness, (2) to reduce the time Members of the Congress must spend on seemingly repetitive votes, and hence permit increased oversight, and (3) to reduce uncertainty about longer-term funding levels and allocations and hence improve program management and results. However, shifting the entire cycle—authorizations, budget resolutions, and appropriations—to a biennial one may not be necessary to achieve these objectives. As I noted earlier, biennial appropriations can be considered separate from biennial budget resolutions because the two raise quite different questions. Let me turn now specifically to that issue. In considering whether the federal government should shift to a biennial budget, it is important to recognize the critical distinction between how often budget decisions are made and how long the money provided for agency use is available. That is the difference between the periodicity of decisions and the periodicity of funds. Biennial budgeting proposals seek to change the frequency with which decisions are made—from annual to biennial budget decisions. Too often, however, the idea is discussed as though it were necessary to change the frequency of decisions in order to change the length of time funds are available. However, as you know, this is a misconception. The federal budget today is not composed entirely of annually enacted appropriations of 1-year moneys. Not all funds expire on September 30 of each year. First, because budget decisions about mandatory programs and entitlements—which constitute nearly two-thirds of federal spending—are not made annually, the debate about annual versus biennial appropriations deals with less than half of the budget. Annually enacted appropriations apply to that portion of the budget known as discretionary spending—about 36 percent of federal outlays in fiscal year 1995. Even within that 36 percent of the budget on an annual appropriation cycle, not all appropriations were for 1-year funds. The Congress has routinely provided multiple-year or no-year appropriations for accounts or for projects within accounts when it seemed to make sense to do so. Indeed, about two-thirds of the accounts on an annual appropriation cycle contained some multiple-year or no-year funds. For these accounts, some prior year and/or current year authority was available for obligation beyond September 30, 1995, without further congressional action. To the extent that biennial budgeting is proposed as a way to ease a budget execution problem, the Congress has shown itself willing and able to meet that need under the current annual cycle. The federal government has had some experience with biennial budgets. The 1986 Defense Authorization Act directed the Department of Defense (DOD) to submit a biennial budget for fiscal years 1988 and 1989 and every 2 years thereafter. DOD submitted 2-year budgets for a number of fiscal years. However, the authorization committees have not approved a full 2-year budget, and thus the appropriation committees have not provided appropriations for the second year. We have previously reported that if the Congress decides to implement a 2-year budget at the appropriation account level, it should proceed cautiously by testing it on a limited basis. Good candidates for a limited test would be organizations or programs which are relatively stable and for which there are no obvious impediments. Impediments would be activities that hamper the forecasting of budgetary needs for the 2-year period, such as a major reorganization, major changes in financial management or IRM systems, or major changes in mission. In its efforts to bring the budget into balance, the Congress is currently considering major changes in the scope and methods of delivering government services. The very magnitude of these changes raises questions about whether a shift to biennial appropriations could or should be made at the same time. For agency officials—both agency budget officers and program managers—the arguments for biennial budgeting may seem quite strong. Currently, agency budget officers spend several months every year preparing a “from-the-ground-up” budget with voluminous written justifications. Much of this work is repetitious. In contrast, requests for supplemental appropriations are handled on an exception basis. Only those agencies requesting supplemental appropriations prepare and present justifications, and those justifications are less complex than for the annual budget. If, under a biennial appropriations process, the “off-year” updates, amendments, or adjustments were treated like supplemental appropriations, the savings in agency time could be significant, even if the Congress required—as seems reasonable—that agencies submit audited financial and spending reports every year. Would agency time and energy be shifted to improved financial management or better program evaluation? I suspect that would depend on the President’s and the agency’s leadership and on what the Congress demanded of the agencies. For agency program managers, the interest in biennial budgets is slightly different. Although preparation and analysis for the annual budget preparation and submission process is time-consuming and burdensome for program managers, they are likely to have a greater interest in how long money is available for use. Especially in some programs, such as defense procurement and education programs, multiyear appropriations tend to smooth program functioning. However, as noted above, the Congress has already addressed this budget execution problem for many of these programs by giving them some multiyear funding. While a shift of the entire cycle would ease planning and increase predictability for all program managers, multiyear or advance funding can be provided for those programs for which 1-year money seriously impairs program effectiveness without that shift. Regardless of the potential benefits to agencies, the decision on biennial budgeting will depend on how the Congress chooses to exercise its constitutional authority over appropriations and its oversight functions. Annually enacted appropriations have long been a basic means of exerting and enforcing congressional policy. Oversight has often been conducted in the context of agency requests for funds. A 2-year appropriation cycle could lessen congressional influence or control over program and spending matters, largely because the process would afford fewer scheduled opportunities to affect agency programs and budgets. Although it could be argued that the existence of fixed-dollar caps on discretionary spending mean that multiyear decisions have already been made, that is so only at the aggregate level. The Congress has retained the right to rearrange priorities within those caps. A shift to a biennial appropriations cycle could lessen that flexibility. We have long advocated regular and rigorous congressional oversight of federal programs. Such oversight should examine both the design and effectiveness of federal programs and the efficiency and skill with which they are managed. Through the Chief Financial Officers Act and the Government Performance and Results Act, the Congress has put in place the building blocks to improved accountability—both for the taxpayer’s dollar and for results. Congressional involvement in reviewing agency strategic plans and in develop performance indicators will be critical to the success of these efforts. However, it is not necessary to change the budget and appropriations cycle to have effective congressional oversight. Indeed, as I mentioned before, the regular appearance before Appropriations committees historically has provided one vehicle for oversight. This brings me back to my main point: the decision on whether the budget and appropriations cycle should be annual or biennial is fundamentally a decision about the form and forum the Congress wishes to use to affect agency programs and operations. We believe that multiyear fiscal policy agreements and multiyear authorizations make a great deal of sense, but they do not require changing the appropriations decision cycle from annual to biennial. While biennial appropriations could save time for agencies, they would also result in a shift in congressional control and oversight. Proposals to change the process should be viewed partly in the context of their effect on the relative balance of power in this debate. While budgeting always involves forecasting, which itself is uncertain, the longer the period of the forecast, the greater the uncertainty. Increased difficulty in forecasting was one of the primary reasons states gave for shifting from biennial to annual cycles. Dramatic changes in program design or agency structure, such as those the Congress is considering in many areas, will make budget forecasting more difficult. Moving from an annual to a biennial appropriations cycle at the same time may not be wise, given that there may be program changes which could in turn create the need for major budgeting changes in the second year of a biennium. If this happens, biennial budgeting would exist only in theory. Biennial appropriations would be neither the end of congressional control nor the solution to many budget problems. The questions for the Congress are, how does it wish to exercise its constitutional authority over appropriations and in what forum will it conduct its oversight responsibilities? Mr. Chairman, this concludes my prepared statement. I would be happy to answer any questions you or Members of the Subcommittee may have.

{"original_length": 4204, "trunc_length": 4096, "text": "\n\nSummarize the following text into a summary of less than 800 words.\n### Text:\n\nAccording to State, the OAS is the primary inter-American political forum through which the United States engages with other countries in the Western Hemisphere to promote democracy, human rights, security, and development. While PAHO, IICA, and PAIGH are independent organizations, the Charter of the Organization of American States (OAS Charter) directs them to take into account the recommendations of the OAS General Assembly and Councils. PAHO, a specialized international health agency for the Americas, works with member countries throughout the region to improve and protect people’s health and serves as the Regional Office for the Americas of the World Health Organization, the United Nations agency on health. IICA, among other things, supports its member states’ efforts to achieve agricultural development and rural well- being through consultation and the administration of agricultural projects through agreements with the OAS and other entities. PAIGH specializes in regional cartography, geography, history, and geophysics and has facilitated the settlement of regional border disputes. Member states collectively finance these organizations by providing assessed contributions, in accordance with the organizations’ regulations. The member states’ assessed contributions are intended to finance the organizations’ regular budgets, which generally cover the organizations’ day-to-day operating expenses, such as facilities and salaries. Member states of each organization meet to review and approve the organizations’ budgets. The exact dollar amount each member state is responsible for providing corresponds to its assessed percentage of the total approved assessment for any given year. The budgets are based on total approved quota assessment and other projected income. The OAS’s system for determining member states’ quotas is used to calculate member states’ assessed contributions by the other three organizations. Thus, any change in the OAS’s assessed quota structure should be reflected at PAHO, IICA, and PAIGH, according to their respective processes regarding the determination of assessed contributions. Member states also finance certain OAS, PAHO, and IICA activities through voluntary contributions. Member states generally target these contributions toward specific programs or issue areas. According to U.S. officials, the United States provides voluntary contributions to the OAS, IICA, and PAHO primarily through grants for specific projects from State, the U.S. Agency for International Development, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the Department of Health and Human Services. For example, according to OAS documentation, in 2015, State contributed slightly more than $200,000 to the OAS to fund judicial training to combat money laundering. According to U.S. agency officials, the organizations’ regional knowledge and technical expertise make them effective implementing partners for projects serving U.S. national interests and priorities throughout the hemisphere. The Reform Act directs the Secretary of State to submit “a multiyear strategy that…identifies a path toward the adoption of necessary reforms that would lead to an assessed fee structure in which no member state would pay more than 50 percent of the OAS’s assessed yearly fees.” According to the Reform Act, it is the sense of Congress that it is in the interest of the United States, OAS member states, and a modernized OAS that the OAS move toward an assessed quota structure that (1) assures the financial sustainability of the organization and (2) establishes, by October 2018, that no member state pays more than 50 percent of the organization’s assessed contributions. The United States’ assessed contributions constituted over 57 percent of total assessed contributions by member states to the OAS, PAHO, IICA, and PAIGH from 2014 through 2016, as shown in table 1. During this time, the United States’ assessed quota for these organizations did not change, and the total assessed contributions for all member states of these organizations remained about the same; thus, the actual amounts assessed to the United States generally remained the same. All four organizations apply a similar assessed quota structure that uses the relative size of member states’ economies, among other things, to help determine each member state’s assessed contributions. The OAS determines the assessed quota for each member state based on the United Nations’ methodology, as adapted for the OAS, using criteria that include gross national income, debt burden, and per capita income. In addition, the OAS applies a minimum assessed quota of 0.022 percent and a maximum assessed quota of 59.470 percent. According to State officials, the OAS last made a major revision to its assessed quota structure in 1990 when Canada joined the organization, and the United States’ and other members’ assessed quotas were reduced as a result. OAS officials said that while member states seek, as far as possible, to adjust the assessed quota structure through consensus, the OAS General Assembly may force a vote and adopt changes with a two-thirds majority. The United States also provided voluntary contributions totaling about $105 million to the OAS, PAHO, and IICA from calendar years 2014 through 2016, as shown in table 2. In 2014, the United States contributed $37 million in voluntary contributions, or approximately 22 percent of the total of $168 million in such contributions from all member states. In 2015, the United States contributed $36 million, or approximately 29 percent of the total of $123 million from all member states. In 2016, the United States contributed $32 million, or approximately 22 percent of the total of $143 million from all member states. According to U.S. officials, levels of U.S. voluntary contributions vary year-to-year due to factors that include the schedule of multiyear grant disbursements, member states’ priorities, and sudden crises. For example, the U.S. Agency for International Development made a $200,000 contribution to PAHO in 2016 for post- earthquake reconstruction and resilience-building in Ecuador. State is working with other member states toward reforming the OAS’s quota structure for assessed contributions so that no member state provides more than 50 percent of the organization’s annual assessed contributions, but State officials told us that reaching consensus among OAS member states will be difficult. In response to the Reform Act, State developed a strategy that identified a path toward the adoption of necessary reforms that would lead to an assessed quota structure in which no member state would pay more than 50 percent of the OAS’s annual assessed contributions. State officials told us that they submitted the strategy to Congress in April 2014. The strategy included efforts to engage member state governments to explore options for reforming the quota structure and to examine the extent to which the OAS’s quota- setting methodology reflects member states’ capacity to finance the organization’s activities. According to the OAS and State’s 2015 report to Congress, achieving quota structure reform will require one or more of the other major contributors to accept an increase in their quotas—the percentages of total annual assessed contributions that they agree to provide. State officials told us that they have been working to implement this strategy. For example, State officials told us they engaged with other OAS member states, including Canada and Mexico, to explore options for quota structure reform. According to State officials, Canada led a modernization committee that produced a strategic plan that included quota structure reform. State officials added that they also reached out to member states from the Caribbean to discuss the importance of quota structure reform while highlighting OAS development programs that benefit Caribbean nations. In addition, officials at the U.S. Mission to the OAS worked with their counterparts from Mexico to review the OAS’s assessed quota structure and to consult on alternatives that would adjust all member states’ quotas so that no member pays more than 50 percent of the OAS’s assessed contributions. According to State officials, the four largest contributing member states, including the United States, have agreed on the importance of quota structure reform. State officials added that quota structure reform efforts were bolstered by the selection of a reform-minded OAS Secretary General in 2015. However, State officials told us that while it will be difficult, it is not impossible for OAS member states to reach consensus on reforming the organization’s assessed quota structure by October of 2018. Several issues among the member states have impeded the progress of State’s strategy, according to State and OAS officials. These issues include the following: State and OAS officials told us that regional political tensions have complicated OAS member states’ ability to reach consensus on quota structure reform. According to State officials, Venezuela’s contentious political relationship with the OAS has hindered progress on various efforts promoted by the United States, including quota structure reform. State officials added that Venezuela has actively worked against the OAS to undermine the normal procedures of the organization. State officials told us that some member states have at times supported Venezuela during committee votes. For example, according to State officials, some member states voted against bringing proceedings against Venezuela for violating the Inter- American Democratic Charter in 2016. In this context, State officials emphasized that it was important for member states other than the United States to officially propose resolutions on quota structure reform. State officials told us that certain member states’ nonpayment of their assessed contributions also has impeded the quota structure reform effort, as well as contributing to financial difficulties at the OAS. Venezuela has expressed publically its unwillingness to pay its assessed contributions, according to State officials. Additionally, as of November 2016, the OAS projected that five member states would be more than $17 million in arrears on their assessed contributions to the OAS by the end of 2016. Brazil—the OAS’s second largest contributor—and Venezuela had not fully paid their assessed contributions for 2015 and 2016, which accounted for approximately 99 percent of the more than $17 million in arrears that member states owed the OAS. State officials told us that the large amounts owed by a few member states had contributed to smaller OAS member states’ reluctance to increase their annual assessed quotas to ensure that no member state provides more than 50 percent by 2018. According to State officials, the United States repeatedly urged the Brazilian government to pay its arrears and 2016 contribution as soon as possible. Brazil recently paid its arrears in full for 2015 and 2016 and its assessed contribution for 2017. Thus, as of April 5, 2017, the remaining arrears for all member states at the OAS were lowered to just over $7 million. State officials told us that on April 28, 2017, Venezuela officially notified the OAS of its intent to withdraw from the organization. According to OAS officials, the OAS currently lacks a mechanism to penalize member states for not paying assessed contributions, unlike the other three organizations. OAS officials told us that OAS committees are discussing the potential for defining negative consequences for member states in arrears. According to State officials, the OAS’s next opportunity to discuss quota structure reform at the ministerial level will be at its General Assembly meeting in Mexico City in June 2017. The Mexican government announced that the main theme of the meeting will be strengthening dialogue and cooperation in the OAS. State officials said that high-level engagement between member states’ officials will be needed to promote quota structure reform. They informed us that efforts to reform the assessed quota structure continue at the working level and that they are seeing some progress toward reform. We provided a draft of this report for comment to State, the Departments of Agriculture and Health and Human Services, the U.S. Agency for International Development, the OAS, PAHO, IICA, and PAIGH. The Departments of Agriculture, Health and Human Services, and the U.S. Agency for International Development stated that they did not have any comments on our report. State provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate. As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce the contents of this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the report date. At that time, we will send copies to the appropriate congressional committees, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development, the Secretary General of the Organization of American States, the Secretary General of the Pan American Health Organization, the Director General of the Inter-American Institute for Cooperation on Agriculture, the Secretary General of the Pan-American Institute of History and Geography, and other interested parties. In addition, the report will be available at no charge on the GAO website at http://www.gao.gov. If you or your staff have questions about this report, please contact me at (202) 512-9601, or melitot@gao.gov. Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. GAO staff who made key contributions to this report are listed in appendix III. This report responds to a request for GAO to review several issues related to the Organization of American States (OAS), the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), the Inter-American Institute for Cooperation on Agriculture (IICA), and the Pan-American Institute of Geography and History (PAIGH). In this report, we (1) determine the amounts and percentages of U.S. contributions assessed by these organizations and voluntary contributions paid to them in calendar years 2014 to 2016, and (2) describe the Department of State’s (State) efforts to comply with requirements in the Organization of American States Revitalization and Reform Act of 2013 (Reform Act) regarding a strategy for reform of the assessed quota structure of the OAS. To determine the amounts and percentages of contributions assessed by the OAS, PAHO, IICA, and PAIGH to the United States and other member states, as well as the amounts and percentages of additional voluntary contributions paid to these organizations, we reviewed externally audited budget reports for calendar years 2014 and 2015. For calendar year 2016, we reviewed budget documents from the four organizations and corroborated the accuracy of the data with the organizations and the U.S. agencies that provide funds to these organizations. For assessed contributions, we reviewed the organizations’ assessed quota structures. We report the quota structure percentage assessed to the United States over these 3 years and the corresponding United States’ assessed contribution amounts for this same time period, based on our analysis of data provided by the organizations. We determined the 2014 and 2015 data to be sufficiently reliable for the purpose of reporting the United States’ assessed contributions and quota percentages because these data had been externally audited. To determine the reliability of the 2016 data, we reviewed budget documents that have not yet been audited, discussed these data with knowledgeable officials at the organizations and U.S. agencies, and corroborated them with these officials and U.S. agencies. We determined the data were sufficiently reliable for the purpose of reporting the United States’ assessed contributions and quota percentages in 2016. These data reflect the quotas assessed to the United States and do not reflect total payments made by the U.S. government to the organizations’ regular budget, which include other miscellaneous payments. For voluntary contributions, we reviewed the same externally audited reports and data from the organizations to obtain the amounts contributed by member states and calculated the proportion of the United States’ voluntary contributions compared with those of the other member states. The four organizations under review have different categories of voluntary funds, depending on their source and intended use. For consistency purposes, we worked with State and officials from the OAS, PAHO, and IICA to establish our definition of voluntary contributions as funds given from governments to the organizations for implementing specific projects outside their respective countries. In accordance with this definition, we considered the following categories of voluntary contributions: “specific funds” at the OAS, “government financing of voluntary contributions” at PAHO, and “external resources by financing source” for each member state at IICA. We determined the 2014 and 2015 data to be sufficiently reliable for the purpose of reporting the United States’ voluntary contributions as a percentage of all members’ voluntary contributions because they had been externally audited. To determine the reliability of the 2016 data, we reviewed budget documents that have not yet been audited, discussed these data with knowledgeable officials at the organizations and U.S. agencies, and corroborated them with these officials and U.S. agencies. We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purpose of reporting the United States’ voluntary contributions as a percentage of all members’ voluntary contributions in 2016. To describe State’s efforts to comply with the Reform Act, we analyzed documents from State regarding its strategy for reform of the assessed quota structure in response to the Reform Act. We also interviewed officials from the U.S. Mission to the Organization of American States, State’s Bureau of International Organization Affairs, and the OAS Secretariat for Administration and Finance. We conducted this performance audit from July 2016 to June 2017 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. Appendix II: Member States\n\n### Summary:\n\n", "answer": "The United States belongs to several inter-American organizations, including the OAS, PAHO, IICA, and PAIGH, which promote democracy, security, health care, agricultural development, and scientific exchange in the Western Hemisphere. The United States helps finance these organizations' operating expenses through assessed contributions (fees) that are based in part on the size of the U.S. economy relative to those of other members. The Reform Act required State to submit a strategy identifying, among other things, a path toward the adoption of reforms to the OAS's assessed quota structure to ensure that no member will pay more than 50 percent of OAS assessed contributions. In addition, the United States also provides the OAS, PAHO, and IICA with project-specific voluntary contributions. GAO was asked to review U.S. financial contributions to these four organizations. In this report, GAO (1) determines the amounts and percentages of U.S. contributions assessed by these organizations and voluntary contributions paid to them in calendar years 2014 to 2016, and (2) describes State's efforts to comply with the Reform Act's requirements regarding a strategy for reform of the assessed quota structure of the OAS. GAO analyzed documents and interviewed officials from State, the Department of Health and Human Services, the U.S. Agency for International Development, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the four organizations. GAO also analyzed the four organizations' annual audited financial reports. The United States' assessed contributions constituted over 57 percent of total assessed contributions by member states to four inter-American organizations from 2014 to 2016. These organizations are the Organization of American States (OAS), the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), the Inter-American Institute for Cooperation on Agriculture (IICA), and the Pan-American Institute of Geography and History (PAIGH). During this time, the annual U.S. percentages (or quotas) of these organizations' assessed contributions have remained about the same. The United States also provided voluntary contributions to three of these organizations, as shown in the table. In response to a requirement in the Organization of American States Revitalization and Reform Act of 2013 (Reform Act), the Department of State (State) submitted to Congress a strategy that included working with OAS member states toward ensuring that the OAS would not assess any single member state a quota of more than 50 percent of all OAS assessed contributions. State officials told GAO that reaching member state agreement on assessed quota reform by 2018 will be difficult, although not impossible. State officials informed GAO that State continues to implement a strategy that includes engaging with other OAS member states, such as Canada and Mexico, to explore assessed quota reform options. For example, State officials have consulted with their counterparts from Mexico to review the OAS's assessed quota structure and to consult on alternatives that would adjust all member states' quotas so that no member state's quota exceeds 50 percent of the OAS's assessed contributions. According to State and OAS officials, obstacles to assessed quota reform include tensions among member states. For example, State officials noted that Venezuela's contentious political relationship with the OAS has hindered progress on various reforms, including assessed quota reform. State officials explained that some member states' failure to fully pay assessed contributions from previous years and smaller member states' reluctance to increase their annual assessed contributions have also impeded assessed quota reform efforts."}
{"original_length": 4216, "trunc_length": 4096, "text": "\n\nSummarize the following text into a summary of less than 800 words.\n### Text:\n\nBecause the models that comprise the ALSP Confederation were built in the early 1980s to meet service-specific needs, they lack the ability to simulate many aspects of joint warfare, including operations other than war, strategic mobility, space, intelligence, and logistics capabilities. These models also lack the capability to represent many combat interactions, such as ground to ship. Because of the existing shortfalls of the services’ individual models, the ALSP Confederation can only fully support 2 of 25 identified CINC and service joint training requirements. This also may be the result of the fact that requirements for application of the ALSP technology were solicited from the CINCs and services only after development of the technology. The services have long recognized the technical and training shortfalls of their respective models for accurately portraying joint operations. The Army’s Corps Battle Simulation is a ground maneuver training simulation used in exercises for commanders and battle staffs. The Army model lacks the capability to simulate weather information, the terrain of the battlefield, and ground-to-ground combat interactions with the Marine Corps model. The Air Force’s Air Warfare Simulation used to support air operations has limited capability to simulate electronic warfare, reconnaissance and surveillance play, and space capabilities. The Navy’s sanctioned training model, the Enhanced Naval Wargaming System, operates on a hardware system that cannot interface with ALSP. The Navy has been modifying this model for acceptance into the confederation since 1993. Navy officials were unable to elaborate on the joint training benefits that would be achieved from these modifications. According to service modeling and simulation officials and after-action reports, the Research, Evaluation, and Systems Analysis Simulation—a naval analytical model—has been used successfully in the current ALSP Confederation. In 1994, the Marine Corps introduced a new amphibious operations simulation, the Marine Air Ground Task Force Tactical Warfare Simulation, into the ALSP Confederation. The Office of the Secretary of Defense created the Defense Modeling and Simulation Office to serve as the focal point for modeling and simulation under the Director, Defense Research and Engineering. The DOD Executive Council for Modeling and Simulation, chaired by the Director, Defense Research and Engineering, advises and assists the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology in modeling and acquisition decisions. The JSIMS program is a jointly managed DOD program with the Air Force providing acquisition oversight. The JSIMS Joint Program Office, under the Air Force Program Executive Officer for Combat Support Systems, has been designated as an acquisition activity for JSIMS. The Army’s Simulation, Training and Instrumentation Command is the executive agent for the day-to-day management of the ALSP Confederation. The development of JSIMS is already a year behind schedule and a clear, consistent definition of JSIMS is still evolving. According to the June 1994 joint memorandum of agreement, a clear definition was due of what constitutes JSIMS within 4 months of the signing of the memorandum. Also due was a detailed plan of action in the form of a JSIMS Joint Program Office charter and JSIMS master plan delineating duties, responsibilities, mission, scope, and strategies for implementing JSIMS. However, lack of agreement among the services as to what JSIMS entails has delayed approval of the charter and the plan. The services have different interpretations of the memorandum of agreement. The low end of expectations is a set of standards and protocols that would allow interoperability for the services’ next generation of simulations. The high end of expectations is a “super model” in which JSIMS would describe all of the objects, such as aircraft, for all of the services and determine all warfare functions. During July 1995, the Acting Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition approved milestone 0 for the JSIMS program, which authorizes proceeding into the concept exploration and definition phase of the acquisition cycle. At that time, the JSIMS Joint Program Office stated that JSIMS would comprise (1) a core element of common functions, such as terrain and weather effects and (2) warfare functions, such as air, ground, and naval combat, and logistics. Common core development would be the responsibility of the JSIMS Joint Program Office while warfare function development will be the responsibility of designated executive agents. The executive agents will develop a joint representation of their warfare area that would then be integrated with the JSIMS core. The Army is the executive agent for land warfare, the Air Force for air and space warfare, and the Navy for sea warfare. The Marine Corps’ missions will be included throughout these executive agents’ warfare representations. Further, the 1994 memorandum of agreement stated that JSIMS should also be adaptable to other modeling and simulation applications, such as analysis and testing. However, in February 1995, the Deputy Secretary of Defense directed the Director, Program Analysis and Evaluation, to initiate and lead development of a new joint analysis model called the Joint Warfare System (JWARS). Program Analysis and Evaluation officials informed us that they believed improvements to DOD’s analytical capability needed to be made now and they could not afford to wait for JSIMS to become a reality. The JSIMS’ focus is now solely on providing a simulation environment for joint task force training. Coordination between the JSIMS and JWARS programs is being worked out. Currently, the major stumbling block for JSIMS is how to fund the $416 million program since there is no central funding line for the program. Some military service officials have expressed concerns about the piecemeal approach of funding JSIMS. As of July 1995, the JSIMS’s core element was estimated to cost about $154 million. Under the provisions of the joint memorandum of agreement, the Army, the Air Force, and the Navy have each agreed to provide 30 percent of this cost. The Marine Corps will provide 10 percent of the cost. In addition to the $154 million, the executive agents will incur additional costs, currently estimated at a total of $262 million, to develop simulations for their specific warfare functions. The problem with this approach is that if a service believes that improving its own core competencies has a higher priority to fund than its responsibilities for JSIMS, that function for JSIMS may not be developed in concert with the other required components. The military services are proceeding to develop the next generation of simulations that will better address their specific mission or core requirements. The services are also responsible for ensuring that these simulations are able to function within the JSIMS’ domain. The Army’s program, Warfighters’ Simulation 2000, is estimated to cost about $200 million and be operational by 2000. The Air Force is developing the National Air and Space Warfare Model that is estimated to cost about $103 million and be fully operational by 2003. The Navy is developing an analytical simulation, the Naval Simulation System, at an initial estimated cost between $15 million and $25 million that could be enhanced at an additional cost of about $47 million to function in a training capacity. Unless decisive management is exercised, these service efforts may outpace JSIMS’ core development and require additional modifications to operate in the JSIMS’ domain. According to DOD officials, several recent events have occurred that demonstrate the JSIMS program is moving forward. First, on July 14, 1995, the Director, Defense Research and Engineering, chaired the first JSIMS Senior Review Board at which the members agreed to provide their share of the JSIMS Joint Program Office permanent staff. Second, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology signed a memorandum on August 8, 1995, calling on DOD components to formally adopt a proposed division of funding and personnel requirements. Third, the Deputy Secretary of Defense endorsed the establishment of a joint core funding line with the services providing both their share of core funding and personnel to staff the JSIMS Joint Program Office. In addition, the Director, Defense Research and Engineering, and the Joint Staff are to provide a share of funding for the JSIMS core program. However, we note that these actions have not been formalized. Concurrent with the development of JSIMS, DOD has decided to make improvements to the ALSP Confederation, the last of which is expected to be in place in 1999—at the same time that JSIMS should reach initial operational capability. According to the ALSP Master Plan, the improvements are intended to respond to the identified CINC and service training requirements and include additional capabilities such as strategic mobility and ground-to-ground combat interactions between models. Even though officials from the Office of the Secretary of Defense’s Director, Defense Research and Engineering, the Defense Modeling and Simulation Office, and the Army Simulation, Training, and Instrumentation Command told us that the total cost of these improvements will not be significantly high, none of these offices was able to provide comprehensive cost estimates. We identified about $40 million that DOD plans to spend for ALSP Confederation improvements through fiscal year 1999. However, because this money may be directed toward service-specific improvements rather than joint improvements, the cost could be higher. As is the case with JSIMS, there is no central funding line for the ALSP Confederation improvements. Consequently, DOD’s ability to achieve all of the improvements that it seeks is dependent on funding from the individual military services, agencies, or CINCs. However, to date the Office of the Under Secretary for Acquisition and Technology has not provided the management to ensure that all significant components of the ALSP improvements will be completed. Consequently, management of the improvements has been fragmented and it is questionable whether the improvement plan is cost-effective. For example, the Army has decided not to fund ALSP improvements to its ground warfare model, which is a primary component of the ALSP Confederation. The Army is proceeding to develop its new training model, Warfighters’ Simulation 2000. The Army has already awarded contracts for the new model’s development. The impact of the Army’s decision not to fund ground warfare improvements on other confederation model improvement efforts or future training requirements is unknown. In contrast, the Air Force is spending about $7 million to consolidate two versions of its air warfare model and plans to enter the combined model into the ALSP Confederation in 1997. The consolidation effort will result in combining the best features of the two versions, as well as preventing future duplicative efforts. The Navy has been spending nearly $2 million annually to replace its current confederation model by fiscal year 1997. Navy officials, however, could not specify how the replacement model would improve the confederation’s joint training capability. The U.S. Transportation Command and the U.S. Space Command are each modifying models for inclusion into future confederations that would expand the ALSP Confederation’s capability. To help ensure the total development of JSIMS, we recommend that the Secretary of Defense establish a joint funding line for the core development of JSIMS and direct the Secretaries of the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force to establish funding lines for their respective executive agent JSIMS responsibilities regarding warfare function development. Further, we recommend that the Secretary of Defense require the Under Secretary for Acquisition and Technology to assume a stronger management role to resolve simulation issues by defining JSIMS and developing a definitive plan of action and developing a transition strategy to phase out ALSP and phase in JSIMS. This strategy should be based upon cost estimates associated with modifying, expanding, and testing the ALSP Confederation to decide which improvements to the ALSP Confederation provide benefits that are cost-effective. In written comments on a draft of our report, DOD generally agreed with our findings and recommendations (see app. I). The Department said that it recognizes the shortcomings of today’s joint training simulations and is committed to developing more cost-effective capabilities. In response to our recommendations, DOD said that it has taken action to establish a joint funding line for the JSIMS core and to ensure service support for their respective combat representations. DOD stated that a plan to phase out ALSP and phase in JSIMS will be developed based on both technical considerations provided by the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology and operational considerations provided by the services and CINCs. However, DOD did not agree with our assessment of the status of the JSIMS program. The Department does not believe that the JSIMS program has been stalled. DOD said that (1) it deliberately established ambitious milestones in the JSIMS memorandum of agreement to serve as an action to move the project along; (2) the JSIMS project has moved from a general consensus agreement, through stand-up of a transitional JSIMS Joint Program Office, to the formation of a permanent Joint Program Office; (3) a systems definition for JSIMS was developed in an April 1995 meeting; (4) the JSIMS Operational Requirements Document is in final review; and (5) the program officially entered the Concept Exploration and Definition phase when it attained milestone 0 status during July 1995. Our assessment of the status of JSIMS is based upon documentation provided to us during our review. The various management groups responsible for development of JSIMS have conducted numerous meetings in an effort to bring about a consensus of what JSIMS constitutes. However, we believe that JSIMS has been stalled at a fundamental level as evidenced by the minimal progress since the signing of the June 1994 memorandum of agreement. At the conclusion of our review, there were indications that the program might be progressing. However, no actions had been finalized. A permanent charter for the Joint Program Office as called for by October 1994 is still not established. The JSIMS Operational Requirements Document is still not approved. According to documents presented at the July 1995 JSIMS Senior Review Board meeting, the estimated cost to develop JSIMS core and warfare functions is $416 million. The JSIMS core without the warfare functions will not achieve DOD’s joint training objectives. Therefore, we believe it is important to identify all development costs. DOD said that it could not substantiate the $40 million we identified that the services are planning to spend on ALSP improvements. DOD stated that $6.1 million is currently budgeted for ALSP core support through fiscal year 1999. DOD acknowledged that all other funding for modifications in the ALSP models is provided by the services or CINCs but could not substantiate this figure. The $40 million figure was derived from documents and discussions held with service budget officials and is subject to change depending upon the services’ priorities for spending. To determine whether DOD is progressing with its development of JSIMS, we interviewed knowledgeable officials from the Defense Modeling and Simulation Office, Washington, D.C.; the Joint Staff, Washington, D.C.; the Joint Warfighting Center, Fort Monroe, Virginia; the JSIMS Joint Program Office, Orlando, Florida; and the services’ modeling and simulation management offices in Washington, D.C. In addition, we interviewed the Director, Defense Research and Engineering, Office of the Secretary of Defense. We reviewed the draft DOD Modeling and Simulation Master Plan; the Executive Council for Modeling and Simulation meeting minutes; and DOD, Joint Staff, and service modeling and simulation policies. In addition, we reviewed related Defense Science Board and DOD Inspector General reports. To determine whether DOD’s decisions to improve the ALSP Confederation are cost-effective, we interviewed modeling and simulation officials at the Simulation, Training, and Instrumentation Command, Orlando, Florida; the Warrior Preparation Center, Einsiedlerhof Air Station, Germany; the Joint Training Analysis and Simulation Center, Suffolk, Virginia; and the National Simulation Center, Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. We reviewed numerous documents on the ALSP Confederation. We discussed the costs of simulation improvements with each of the service model’s proponents. We conducted our work between January 1995 and August 1995 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. We are sending copies of this report to the Chairmen, Senate and House Committees on Appropriations, Senate Committee on Armed Services, and House Committee on National Security; the Secretary of Defense; the Deputy Secretary of Defense; the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology; the Director, Defense Research and Engineering; and the Secretaries of the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force.

The bulk of executive powerrests with the prime minister and his or her cabinet (the Indian president is a ceremonial chief of statewith limited executive powers). Most of India's prime ministers have come from the country'sHindi-speaking northern regions and, until 2004, all but one had been upper-caste Hindus. (2) The 543-seat Lok Sabha(People's House) is the locus of national power, with directly-elected representatives from each ofthe country's 28 states and seven union territories. A smaller upper house, the Rajya Sabha (Councilof States), may review, but not veto, most legislation, and has no power over the prime minister orthe cabinet. National and state legislators are elected to five-year terms. The previous nationalelection was held in October 1999. Although India's political stage is crowded with numerousregional and caste-based parties, recent years have seen an increasingly dyadic battle between twomajor parties that vie for smaller allies in a system that now requires coalitional politics (no partyhas won a national election outright since 1984). Since 1998, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) hadled a ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) coalition of more than 20 parties working underthe leadership of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. The October 1999 Lok Sabha electionssolidified the BJP's standing. The key opposition party during this time was the CongressParty. (3) During April and May 2004, India held a four-phase national election to seat a new LokSabha. The NDA called elections six months early in an apparent effort to capitalize on perceivedmomentum from positive economic news and from three convincing state-level victories overCongress in December 2003. Some 380 million Indians cast ballots at nearly 700,000 pollingstations. When results were announced on May 13, nearly all observers and participants -- includingPrime Minister Atal Vajpayee -- were surprised by the upset defeat of the NDA, and by asimultaneous resurgence of the Congress Party led by Sonia Gandhi, the Italian-born widow offormer Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, which had forged strategic and unprecedented alliances withpowerful regional parties. On May 18, Gandhi stunned her supporters by declining the position ofprime minister in a new United Progressive Alliance (UPA) coalition government, insteadnominating her party lieutenant, Oxford-educated economist Manmohan Singh, for the job. AsFinance Minister from 1991-1996, Singh was the architect of major Indian economic reform andliberalization efforts. On May 22, the widely-esteemed Sikh became India's first-ever non-HinduPrime Minister. Poll results also were notable for the best-ever showing of a leftist alliance led by theCommunist Party of India (Marxist), which won a total of 62 seats, nearly all of them from WestBengal and Kerala. Although this Left Front is not part of the new UPA government, it is supportingthe UPA from outside. Investor fears that a new coalition government including communists mightcurtail or halt India's economic reform and liberalization process apparently led to huge losses in thecountry's stock markets: Bombay's benchmark Sensex index lost 11% of its value on May 17, thesecond-largest daily loss ever, and the value of India's largest companies reportedly declined by some$40 billion over seven days, with state-owned businesses slated for public sale taking the greatesthits. Market recovery began after Congress Party leaders offered assurances that the newgovernment would be \"pro-growth, pro-savings, and pro-investment.\" (4) Numerous analysts weighed in on the meaning of the complex electoral results. A longtradition of anti-incumbency was only partly apparent in 2004, as many states re-elected sittingparliamentarians. It also is notable that the BJP-led coalition received slightly more total votes thandid the Congress-led alliance. However, huge reversals for the incumbent NDA-allied TeluguDesam Party of the Andhra Pradesh state -- as well as for the BJP, which fell from 181 seats inparliament to only 138 -- were seen by many as evidence that India's rural poor were not persuadedby the NDA's \"India Shining\" campaign that sought to highlight the country's economic gains(Andhra Pradesh's capital, Hyderabad, has been touted as an information technologyboom-town (5) ). It may bethat voters found the NDA insufficiently attentive to the core issues of \" bijli, sadak, pani \" (power,roads, water) and voiced a rejection of neo-liberal economic reforms that were seen to benefit India'smiddle- and upper-classes only. (6) Other analysts saw in the results a rejection of the Hindu nationalism associated with the BJP(just days after a December 2002 state election victory in Gujarat, the BJP's president declared thathis party would \"duplicate the Gujarat experience everywhere\" as it represented a \"mandate for the[Hindutva] ideology\" (7) ). Sonia Gandhi's foreign origin had become a key point of criticism for these groups and it is likelythat her decision to pass on the prime ministership was in part a result of her not wanting to becomea subject of controversy, as Hindu nationalist groups had threatened to launch a nationwide protestcampaign if she took the prime ministership. It also is widely held that Gandhi's action was drivenby a perceived interest in establishing circumstances in which her son Rahul, who ran for and wona parliamentary seat for the first time this year, can assume the family \"dynasty\" mantle later in thedecade. (8) The dynastic Congress Party of Jawaharlal Nehru, his daughter, Indira Gandhi, and her son,Rajiv, had dominated India's political stage for 45 of its first 56 years of independence, but did nothold the prime ministership after May 1996. Never before had Congress been out of power in NewDelhi for such a long period (although it continued to hold power in 11 states). After 1998,Congress's national leader was Rajiv's widow, the Italian-born Catholic Sonia Gandhi, who took topolitics only with reluctance. Factors in the decline of support for Congress included neglect of itsgrassroots political organizations by the leadership, a perceived lack of responsiveness to such majorconstituent groups as Muslims and lower castes, the rise of regional and issue-based parties, andallegations of widespread corruption involving party leaders. Gandhi herself, while enjoying theloyalty of most party leaders, came under fire for allegedly poor campaign skills and for her foreignorigins. In the wake of three surprise state-level losses in December 2003, Gandhi called on India'ssecular forces to close ranks in resisting the BJP's \"development\" emphasis, insisting that it wasmerely a cover for the BJP's ongoing \"agenda of hatred and divisiveness.\" Motivated by a belief thatsecular forces would hang together or be hanged separately, Congress began actively seekingalliance partners. (9) Manyanalysts had argued that Gandhi represented a net liability for the party, (10) a long-running andcontentious debate that likely was settled by the outpouring of affection for her in May 2004. Still,some analysts are concerned that Gandhi's significant and \"extra-constitutional\" influence bodespoorly for the future stability both of the UPA and of the Congress Party, itself. (11) The new Prime Minister'stop four cabinet ministries (Home, External Affairs, Defense, and Finance) are being headed byCongress stalwarts. The BJP, associated with Hindu nationalist groups, had enjoyed rapid success in nationalpolitics. Riding a crest of rising Hindu nationalism, it increased its strength in Parliament from onlytwo seats in 1984 to 181 seats 1999. Some observers hold elements of the BJP, as the political armof the extremist Hindu nationalist organization Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS or NationalVolunteer Force), responsible for the outbreaks of serious communal violence in which a mosquewas destroyed at Ayodhya and some 3,000 people were killed in anti-Muslim rioting in Bombay andelsewhere. While in power, the BJP worked -- with limited success -- to change its image fromright-wing Hindu nationalist to conservative and moderate, although anti-Muslim riots in BJP-runGujarat in early 2002 again damaged the party's national and international credentials. In general terms, the BJP has comprised a moderate wing focused on governance anddevelopment, and a hardline wing more concerned with \"emotive\" issues related to Hindunationalism. Former PM Atal Vajpayee is viewed as the leading moderate, while former Deputy PMand current BJP parliamentary leader Lal Advani fronts the hardline faction. Advani, who steeredthe BJP's 2004 electoral strategy, has widely been viewed as heir-apparent to Vajpayee, but Advani'sclose ties to the RSS and Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP or World Hindu Council), and pastinvolvement in communal conflict (especially the 1992 destruction of the Babri Mosque and ensuingviolence), have denied him the widespread popularity enjoyed by Vajpayee. (12) Because the BJP did notplay the \"Hindutva card\" in recent state elections, its impressive December 2003 victories in threeof four contested states were viewed as a triumph of the politics of development associated withVajpayee. Still, national election results were widely viewed as a serious blow to the Hindunationalist project. (13) BJP leaders attributed their setback to complacency and overconfidence. Hindu nationalistsblamed the NDA's defeat on an alleged betrayal of the Hindutva cause by the BJP; one top leadercalled for the creation of a new party to \"look after the interest of Hindus\" (BJP leaders such asAdvani equate Hindutva with nationalism). (14) The long-standing rift between moderates and hardliners cameto the fore in a June debate over the possible removal from power of the controversial Chief Ministerof Gujarat, BJP notable Narendra Modi. Vajpayee himself suggested that Modi should go, but hewas swiftly rebuked by the RSS chief in a sign that the BJP is likely to maintain a more hardlineposition while in opposition. (15) Selected Election Results Source: Election Commission of India; \"The Big Picture,\" Hindu (Madras), May 20, 2004. Although the Communist Party of India (Marxist) seated the third largest number ofparliamentarians in 2004, its vote bank is almost wholly limited to West Bengal and Kerala (the LeftFront coalition holds about 11% of all Lok Sabha seats). Communist parties have in the past beenbitter rivals of the Congress in these states, but a mutual commitment to secularism appears to havemotivated their cooperation against the BJP in 2004. Early alarm was sounded that the influence ofcommunists in New Delhi might derail India's economic reform efforts, however, Indian industrialleaders have sought to assure foreign investors that Left Front members are not \"Cuba-stylecommunists,\" but can be expected to support the UPA reform agenda. The communist ChiefMinister of West Bengal has himself actively sought corporate investment in his state. (16) The power of regional and caste-based parties has become an increasingly important variablein Indian politics; the most recent poll saw such parties receiving nearly half of all votes cast. Neverbefore had the Congress Party entered into pre-poll alliances at the national level, and numerousanalysts attributed Congress's success to precisely this new tack, especially thorough arrangementswith the Bihar-based Rashtriya Janata Dal and Tamil Nadu's Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam. (17) The influence of large andsmaller regional parties, alike, is seen to be reflected in the UPA's ministerial appointments, and inits professed attention to rural issues and center-state relations. (18) Prime Minister Singh has insisted that development will be a central priority of the UPAgovernment, with reforms aimed at reducing poverty and increasing employment. He alsoemphasizes that privatization is not part of UPA ideology and that major public sector concerns willnot be sold off. The appointment of Harvard-educated lawyer and economic reformer PalaniappanChidambaram to head the Finance Ministry, and a UPA Common Minimum Program (CMP)emphasizing economic growth and increased investment, have been welcomed by most businessinterests, even if the pace of privatization and labor reform efforts may slower. The UPA's firstbudget, released on July 8, generally was lauded by Indian industrial groups as \"progressive andforward-looking.\" (19) The budget calls for a major increase in defense expenditures, up 27 percent over the previous year. Both Prime Minister Singh and his new External Affairs Minister, career diplomat NatwarSingh, have given indications that their initial foreign policy focus will be on India's immediateneighbors. This may mean a deeper diplomatic engagement in the Sri Lankan conflict, along withmore energetic efforts to assist the Nepali government in its struggle with communist rebels. Perhaps most significantly, the India-Pakistan peace initiative begun in April 2003 suffered noapparent damage from the change of government in New Delhi, with both sides insisting that theprocess will continue. The UPA has indicated that it will make the 1972 Simla Agreement betweenIndia and Pakistan the basis of its relationship with Islamabad, even as it will abide by all subsequentaccords. (20) Since thenew government was seated, India and Pakistan have agreed to increase bilateral counternarcoticscooperation; to establish a hotline to reduce the threat of accidental nuclear war; to continue mutualnotifications of missile launches; to return their respective embassies to full strength; and tore-establish consulates in Bombay and Karachi. New National Security Advisor J.N. Dixit has beenassigned to take the lead role in relations with China, replacing his predecessor, Brajesh Mishra, andthe world's two most populous countries have vowed to bolster defense and trade ties while movingforward on efforts to resolve outstanding territorial disputes. (21) India also agreed toincrease bilateral defense ties with Japan through periodic ministerial-level interaction. The new Prime Minister has vowed to repeal the controversial 2002 Prevention of TerrorismAct that some have called a tool for discrimination against religious minorities and oppositionpolitical figures. Statements about the necessity of preventing a repeat of the communal violenceseen in Gujarat in 2002 have encouraged those who hope that a secularist, left-leaning governmentwill do more to both oppose such divisiveness and bring to justice those who encourage it throughlawless means. (22) Itremains unclear how the UPA intends to address roiling separatist violence in several of India'snortheastern states. On military issues, the UPA states an intent to hasten India's modernizationefforts and to maintain a \"credible nuclear weapons program\" while pursuing confidence-buildingmeasures with its \"nuclear neighbors.\" (23) It is as yet unclear how, if at all, the Congress-led government might differ from itspredecessor in terms of relations with the United States. Many of Prime Minister Singh's toplieutenants were steeped in the non-alignment policies of the Congress Party during the Cold War. External Affairs Minister Natwar Singh and National Security Advisor J.N. Dixit have in the pastbeen highly critical of such issues as U.S. involvement in Iraq, U.S. nonproliferation policy, and U.S.designation of Pakistan as a \"major non-NATO ally.\" Their criticisms often went far beyond similarconcerns raised by the outgoing BJP-led alliance. (24) The Congress-led government continues to state that it has noplans to contribute Indian troops for service in Iraq, although U.S. officials are reportedly seekingto \"overcome\" Indian reservations. (25) The possible influences of communist parties have added toconcerns that New Delhi may become at least somewhat more critical of and less cooperative withthe United States on bilateral and global issues. However, early statements from the UPA\n\n### Summary:\n\n", "answer": "U.S. relations with India depend largely on India's political leadership.

{"original_length": 4229, "trunc_length": 4096, "text": "\n\nSummarize the following text into a summary of less than 800 words.\n### Text:\n\nHistorically, the Department has invested about 10 percent of its approximately $20 billion annual budget in information technology resources. The majority of all information technology resource expenditures—over 90 percent—are made by management and operating contractors, who identify and acquire resources needed to support the Department’s programs at the site (field) level. A past GAO review found that the Department’s contractors had wide latitude in controlling their information technology resources and spent substantial resources on developing and operating duplicate systems at the site level. Key to the Department’s success in eliminating its duplicate information systems is ensuring that information technology is acquired, used, and managed effectively. This includes knowing what information resources exist or are planned and how they improve performance of agency missions. The Congress and the Office of Management and Budget have supported the need for effective management of agencywide information resources through (1) the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, which requires agencies to follow a number of practices aimed at improving the productivity, efficiencies, and effectiveness of government operations, (2) the Information Technology Management Reform Act (ITMRA) of 1996, which supplements the Paperwork Reduction Act, and requires agencies to design and implement a strategic process for maximizing the value and managing the risks of their technology investments, and (3) the Office of Management and Budget’s (OMB) Evaluating Information Technology Investments: A Practical Guide, published in November 1995, which guides agencies in planning for, acquiring, and implementing information systems. Developing and maintaining a complete inventory of the Department’s information resources is a key requirement of the Paperwork Reduction Act and is essential to meeting the goals of ITMRA. Further, a critical element of OMB’s investment guide is the need for agencies to create a portfolio of their information technology investments. As part of its strategy for streamlining information systems, the Department plans to eliminate or consolidate systems which have the same or similar capabilities and analyze requirements for new systems to prevent additional purchases of duplicate systems. As a key step in this process, the Department’s Office of Information Management (OIM) developed a baseline inventory to identify the functions and capabilities of software systems that are being developed, proposed, and operated by the Department and its management and operating contractors. OIM intended to use this inventory to analyze the Department’s existing information systems environment and help identify systems that could be eliminated or consolidated. This intent was expressed in the Department’s strategic alignment initiative plan to integrate information management. To most effectively carry out this effort, therefore, OIM needs an inventory that contains complete and accurate data, fully describes system capabilities, and is based on consistent reporting by the Department’s management and operating contractors. Currently, however, the baseline inventory is substantially incomplete and lacks information describing systems’ functional capabilities. Specifically, in developing the baseline inventory, OIM relied primarily on data gathered from the Department and its management and operating contractors in early 1995 for inclusion in the System Review Inventory System (SRIS). SRIS is a headquarters database used by OIM to maintain information on the Department’s software systems, including the name, primary function, specific capabilities, data content, operating platforms, and cost of the systems. The Department requires that all systems being developed, proposed, and operated by the Department and its sites that have life-cycle costs exceeding $250,000 be reported to OIM for inclusion in the SRIS database. We believe that OIM’s baseline inventory of software systems will not be adequate to support the Department’s streamlining efforts because the SRIS data is incomplete and inconsistently reported. OIM’s analyses showed that only two-thirds of the Department’s management and operating contractors responded to its request for updated SRIS information in 1995. Moreover, according to this analysis, the information which contractors did submit was incomplete in that it did not identify the functional capabilities of about two-thirds of the 2,053 systems reported in the SRIS database. Without this type of information, the Department cannot accurately assess its existing information systems environment or make informed decisions regarding the most appropriate candidates for elimination or consolidation. The data deficiencies that we noted exist largely because the Department has allowed its contractors wide latitude in developing and implementing software inventory procedures and standards, and has not required them to follow the Department’s software management guidance. Although the Department’s existing software management order requires each site to establish and operate its own software management program, the order allows sites to determine how to accomplish this. In addition, although the Department’s “Software Management Guide” (which was put in place to assist the sites in developing software management programs) states that sites should maintain inventories of the software that they acquire, develop, or operate, the Department does not require contractors to follow it. As a result, contractors (1) have inconsistent practices in developing and maintaining information on their systems and (2) use inconsistent methods for classifying systems by function and capability. For example, although the official responsible for maintaining the software inventory at the Department’s largest (in terms of funding) EM site told us that the site recently reviewed in detail the systems reported in its software inventory in order to ensure that all the requested data were identified, some other sites reported having starkly different practices, including the following: Contractor officials at another major EM site stated that they had not verified any of the inventory data reported by their site and that hundreds of additional systems were probably unaccounted for in their inventory. A field office official responsible for reviewing software management at two national laboratories stated that these laboratories have not inventoried the vast majority of the systems acquired by the sites to support their program and project requirements. Our analyses of two major EM sites’ inventories, which together identified 1,348 systems, showed that these inventories lacked data on (1) the functions of 59 percent of the systems and (2) the development cost of 84 percent of the systems. Management and operating contractors also use a variety of methods for classifying site software systems by the specific capabilities they provide. Because of this lack of consistency in classifying systems, some sites do not report the requested data to the Department or they report incomplete data. For example, EM’s two largest sites use different classification methods, and neither of these methods is the same as that used for SRIS, which classifies the functional capabilities of systems according to 12 primary and 48 secondary categories. One of the sites does not classify any of its systems according to functional capabilities, with the exception of engineering systems. The other site classifies its systems according to 16 primary categories of functional capabilities, including the 12 primary categories identified for SRIS but does not classify systems according to the secondary categories identified for SRIS. An official at this site stated that because its classification method differs from that used for SRIS, the site did not provide OIM any information on the functional capabilities of its systems in 1995. Contractor officials at both sites stated that before they can provide the required updates to SRIS, they must perform time-consuming word searches and other research, and modify their systems classifications to agree with SRIS’s classifications. The Department currently is developing a consolidated order for information resources management that will replace the existing software management order (DOE 1330.1D). The new order, which is still in draft, establishes Department policies, responsibilities, and authorities for the planning, funding, development, acquisition, security, and integration of information technology resources. The draft order states that a local software inventory management system shall be developed to maintain an awareness of the software available at each site. However, as written, the order does not specify (1) standards for classifying systems according to their functional capabilities or (2) procedures for ensuring the integrity of software systems data included in the inventories. As a result, contractors will continue to have wide latitude in how they choose to develop and maintain software system inventories, and thus, the Department will not likely progress toward having an inventory that it can effectively use to identify duplicate systems. Streamlining information systems is essential to helping the Department realize savings. In addition, it is essential that the Department and its contractors be able to assess the capabilities of existing systems prior to acquiring new systems to avoid further duplication and waste. However, without mechanisms for ensuring more reliable reporting by the Department’s management and operating contractors, these efforts will not succeed. Because approximately 90 percent of all information technology resource expenditures are made by management and operating contractors at the site level, the success of the Department’s improvement efforts hinges on their effective participation. We recommend that you direct the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Information Management to develop, and include in the draft consolidated information resources management order, (1) specific standards for classifying software systems according to their functional capabilities and (2) procedures for ensuring that the data included in software system inventories are complete and reliable; and require all management and operating contractors to immediately evaluate their software system inventories for completeness and accuracy, address any weaknesses identified, and create and provide OIM a database which is consistent with the Department’s standards. Department of Energy officials, including the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Information Management, provided written comments on a draft of this report. We have incorporated their comments where appropriate and reprinted them in appendix I. These officials disagreed with our recommendations. Specifically, the officials said that they had not meant to imply that a complete inventory of departmental and contractor systems would be available or needed to support the Department’s streamlining effort. Moreover, they stated that they did not believe that it was appropriate for the Department to require its management and operating contractors to either maintain information system inventories or to adhere to specific systems classifications for identifying their information systems. They stated that such inventories are not required by either the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 or the Information Technology Management Reform Act of 1996. They further stated that “collective experience of the Information Management staff is that detailed inventories are too expensive and time-consuming to develop and maintain and that they do not yield the necessary insight in either consolidating applications or precluding duplications.” They stated that they will rely on performance-based contracts to consolidate and eliminate duplicate systems. We disagree with the Department’s position that such inventories lack value for consolidating and eliminating duplicate systems and that the cited legislation does not require systems inventories. Knowing what information resources an organization has is necessary to effectively manage them, and further, to make decisions regarding the investment in additional resources. As noted in our report, the Department has spent significant resources on developing and implementing duplicate information systems at its sites. In its Integrate Information Management Implementation Plan, the Department, itself, acknowledged the need for a baseline inventory of its information resources to facilitate its streamlining effort and help maximize its investment in information systems. For example, the plan called for developing a comprehensive corporate information management program to maximize the Department’s information system investments by avoiding unnecessary duplication of effort and reducing redundant systems. To help achieve this, the plan cited a critical need to obtain an accurate baseline inventory of current and planned system development/acquisition activities and costs, including baselining existing information management architectures, infrastructures, standards, information structures, and resources departmentwide. In addition, OIM officials involved in implementing the streamlining initiative told us during our review that a baseline inventory was being developed to help identify systems that could be consolidated or eliminated. Moreover, developing and maintaining a complete inventory of the Department’s information resources is essential to implementing a strategic information resources management process, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act and the recently enacted Information Technology Management Reform Act of 1996. These acts require agencies to design and implement a strategic process for maximizing the value and assessing and managing the risks of information technology acquisitions. This process is to be used by the agency head, Chief Information Officer, and program officials to select, control, and evaluate agencywide investments in information technology. To ensure that investments are effectively managed, the Paperwork Reduction Act requires agencies to develop and maintain a current and complete inventory of their information resources. Information resources include computers, software, and other automated data processing equipment owned and operated by the agency directly, owned by an agency and operated by a contractor, or owned and operated by a contractor under contract with the agency. The Act excludes “governtment-owned contractor-operated facilities” from the definition of the term “agency” (44 U.S.C. Sec. 3502(1)). Thus, the broad management responsibilities imposed by Section 3506 fall on the Department and not the contractor. However, we do not read the Act as excluding government-owned contractor-operated information resources from the requirements imposed on agencies by Section 3506. In addition, the Office of Management and Budget’s Evaluating Information Technology Investments: A Practical Guide provides a systematic approach to managing the risks and returns of information technology investments. According to this guide, one of the organizational attributes critical to the success of an agency’s information technology investments is defining a portfolio that includes information technology projects in every phase (initial concept, new, ongoing, or fully operational) and for every type (mission critical, cross-functional, infrastructure, administrative, and R&D) of information technology systems. Since approximately 90 percent of the Department’s information technology investments are made by its management and operating contractors, it is incumbent upon the Department to collect and maintain accurate information on these information resources. Without this information, the Department cannot expect to develop a full and accurate accounting of its information technology expenditures or to adequately assess the extent to which its information resources contribute to program productivity, efficiency, and effectiveness. In addition, even with performance-based contracts, information on what resources exist agencywide will be essential to contractors in identifying the appropriate systems to consolidate or eliminate, and to the Department in assessing how well contractors meet performance goals aimed at eliminating systems duplication to achieve savings. As you know, 31 U.S.C. 720 requires the head of a federal agency to submit a written statement of actions taken on our recommendations. You must send the statement to the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs and the House Committee on Governmental Reform and Oversight within 60 days after the date of this report. You must also submit a written statement to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations with the agency’s first request for appropriations made over 60 days after the date of this letter. We are sending copies of this report to the Chairmen and Ranking Minority Members of the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations, the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, the House Committee on Governmental Reform and Oversight, and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. We will also make copies available to others upon request. We performed our review from July 1995 through March 1996, in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Details on the scope and methodology of this work are in appendix II. If you have questions about this report, please contact me on (202) 512-6240 or Valerie C. Melvin, Assistant Director, on (202) 512-6304. Major contributors to this report are listed in appendix III. To assess software systems acquired to support the Department of Energy’s Environmental Management (EM) Program, we obtained and analyzed software systems inventory data describing the names, functional capabilities, costs, developmental stages, and operating platforms of software systems at 8 departmental offices and 19 sites supporting the EM program. We interviewed Department of Energy field office staff and management and operating contractor officials responsible for developing and maintaining site software system inventories. We also analyzed documentation provided by officials in the Department’s Office of Information Management regarding the collection, analysis, and use of departmental and site software systems inventory data, policies and procedures for developing and maintaining software system inventories, and strategies and plans for streamlining information systems. In addition, we analyzed legislative criteria on managing information technology investments contained in the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 and the Information Technology Management Reform Act of 1996. Finally, we analyzed applicable sections of the Department’s software management guidance, including DOE Order 1330.1D, Computer Software Management, and discussed with responsible information resources management officials, software management provisions contained in the Department’s draft consolidated information resources management order. We performed our work from July 1995 through March 1996, in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Our work was conducted primarily at the Department’s headquarters in Washington, D.C., and its field offices in Albuquerque, New Mexico; Richland, Washington; Golden, Colorado; and Aiken, South Carolina.

The Department of Transportation reported: (1) that in 2008, federal funds were nearly 40 percent of total transit agency capital expenditures; (2) that state funds provided approximately 12 percent; and (3) that local funds provided the remaining 48 percent of total transit agency capital expenditures. Our November 2012 report found similar funding trends. Specifically, local funding exceeded total federal funding for the 25 projects approved for federal New Starts grants—part of FTA’s Capital Investment Grant Program—from October 2004 through June 2012.important part of this picture, and according to FTA, MAP-21 authorized federal funding for public transit—$10.6 billion for fiscal year 2013 and $10.7 billion for fiscal year 2014. However, while state and localities face their own funding challenges, MAP-21 did not address long-term transportation federal funding challenges. Federal funds available for the FTA’s transit programs come from two sources: (1) the general fund of the U.S. treasury and (2) the Mass Transit Account of the Highway Trust Fund. Both of these sources of federal funding face difficulties. Currently, congressional budget discussions raise issues about general fund federal spending. This affects transit programs, such as the Capital Investment Grant Program, which are funded through annual appropriations from the general fund. In addition, the Highway Trust Fund authorizes funds for transit programs primarily through statutory formulas, and there are concerns over the fund’s decreasing revenue. The primary mechanism for funding federal highway and transit for more than 50 years is the Highway Trust Fund, which is funded through motor fuel and other highway use taxes. These taxes were established to make the federal-aid highway program self- financing—that is, paid for by the highway users who directly benefit from the program. For many years, user fees in the form of federal fuel taxes and taxes on commercial trucks provided sufficient revenues to the Highway Trust Fund; however, revenues into the fund have eroded over time, in part because federal fuel tax rates have not increased since 1993 and in part because of improvements in vehicle fuel efficiency. In May 2013, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that to maintain current spending levels plus inflation between 2015 and 2022, the Highway Trust Fund will require over $132 billion more than it is expected to take in over that period. About $35 billion of that deficit would be in the transit account. To maintain current spending levels and cover revenue shortfalls, Congress has transferred more than $50 billion in general revenues to the Highway Trust Fund since fiscal year 2008. This approach has effectively broken the link between taxes paid and benefits received by users and may not be sustainable given competing demands and the federal government’s growing fiscal challenge. As we have previously reported, this trend will continue in the years ahead as more fuel efficient and alternative fuel vehicles take to the roads. We have previously concluded that a sustainable solution to funding surface transportation is based on balancing revenues to and spending from the Highway Trust Fund. Ultimately, major changes in transportation revenues, spending, or both will be needed to bring the two into balance. For this and other reasons, and because MAP-21 did not address these issues, funding surface transportation remains on GAO’s High-Risk List. Our recent work describes how sound capital-investment decisions can help transit agencies use federal and other transit funds more efficiently, and MAP-21’s new requirements for transit agencies to use asset management are consistent with our recent findings. Improved transit asset management is important because of (1) the large backlog of transit assets—such as buses, rail cars, elevators, and escalators—that are already beyond their useful lives; (2) increasing demand for transit services; and (3) financial strains on transit providers due to rising fuel prices, decreased state and local funding, and likely limitations of federal funding going forward. According to FTA, roughly $78 billion (in 2009 dollars) would be necessary to cover the costs of rehabilitating or replacing the nation’s transit assets and bring them to a state of good repair. Sound asset-management practices can help agencies prioritize their capital investments to help optimize limited funding. We reviewed agencies by conducting site visits and interviews, examining documents, and consulting relevant literature. We selected agencies for review in two ways: 1) using a selection process for transit-agency site visits, and 2) reviewing transit agency case studies included in two key reports we identified through a comprehensive literature review. decisions. Transit agencies that measure and quantify the effects of their capital-investment decisions are likely to make a stronger case for additional funding from state and local decision-makers. However, of the nine transit agencies we visited, only two measured the effects of capital investments on the condition of certain transit assets and none of the agencies measured the effects on future ridership, in part because they lacked the tools to determine these effects. Figure 1 below shows the extent to which selected transit agencies measured the effect of capital investments. Accordingly, we recommended that the Administrator of FTA conduct additional research to help transit agencies measure the effects of capital investments, including future ridership effects. The FTA concurs with this recommendation, in part. FTA agrees that more research to identify the operational impacts of not addressing the state of good repair backlog will support better asset management by transit agencies. However, according to FTA officials, given the agency’s current budget situation, it is difficult for it to commit to conduct additional research in the near future. FTA has almost $10 million in research projects on transit asset management underway. MAP-21 directed FTA to provide transit agencies with tools and guidance they need to help them better prioritize capital investment decisions. MAP-21 also directed FTA to develop asset management requirements for all recipients of federal transit program funds, including a transit asset management plan, which must include at a minimum, capital asset inventories, condition assessments, and investment priorities. Since the enactment of MAP-21, FTA has been developing guidance to help transit agencies implement leading practices in transit asset management and a decision support tool to prioritize investments. FTA also issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) in October 2013 and requested that comments be submitted to them by January 2, 2014. The ANPRM states that FTA is seeking to ensure public transportation systems are in a state of good repair and transit agencies provide increased transparency into their budgetary decision-making process. FTA is seeking public comment on, among other things, (1) proposals it is considering and (2) questions regarding the following: the requirements of a National Transit Asset Management System, including four options for defining and measuring state of good repair, and the relationship between safety, transit asset management, and state of good repair. As FTA completes its analysis of these comments and further develops a National Transit Asset Management System, transit agencies may be better equipped to implement current leading practices in transit asset management and comply with future transit asset management requirements envisioned by MAP-21. In addition to maintaining transit agencies’ existing assets in a state of good repair, some transit agencies also face a need to build and expand their systems to meet demand. To meet these needs in a financially constrained environment, transit agencies can apply for capital funding available from the federal government through the Capital Investment Grant Program, which includes New and Small Starts grants. In many cases, transit agencies have taken advantage of this federal funding to develop bus rapid transit (BRT) projects, which often require less capital investment than other transit modes. For example, New York implemented a BRT project for the M15 line. This BRT line provides critical transportation service in Manhattan for over 55,000 riders a day, connecting many neighborhoods that are a long walk from the nearest subway station. Thus transit agencies are able to meet transit demand with BRT projects with a lower initial capital investment than other modes of transit, like heavy rail. Specifically, we found in our 2012 report that median costs for the 30 BRT and 25 rail transit projects we examined from fiscal year 2005 through February 2012 were about $36.1 million and $575.7 million, respectively. Pub. L. No. 109-59, 119 Stat. 1144 (Aug. 10, 2005). projects. According to all of the five BRT project sponsors we spoke with during our work, even at a lower capital cost, BRT could provide rail-like benefits. For example, Cleveland RTA officials told us the Healthline BRT project cost roughly one-third ($200 million) of what a comparable light- rail project would have cost. Similarly, Eugene, Oregon, Lane Transit District (LTD) officials told us that the agency pursued BRT when it became apparent that light rail was unaffordable and that an LTD light rail project would not be competitive in the New Starts federal grant process. In terms of benefits, these projects—and most other BRT project we examined—increased ridership and improved travel times over the previous bus service. As a result of the lower initial capital costs for BRT along with the benefits of improved service, transit agencies took advantage of federal New and Small Starts dollars to invest in a relatively large number of BRT projects, as compared to other modes of transit. (See fig. 2). In addition, we found that although many factors contribute to economic development, most local officials in the five case study locations we visited believed that BRT projects were contributing to localized economic development. For instance, officials in Cleveland told us that an estimated $4 to $5 billion had been invested near the Healthline BRT project— associated with major hospitals and universities in the corridor. While most local officials believed that rail transit had a greater economic development potential than BRT, they agreed that certain factors can enhance BRT’s ability to contribute to economic development, including physical BRT features that relay a sense of permanence to developers; key employment and activity centers located along the corridor; and local policies and incentives that encourage transit-oriented development. Our analysis of land value changes near BRT lines at our five case study locations lends support to these themes. MAP-21 included a few changes that affected BRT. For example, MAP-21 defined BRT more narrowly and specifically than SAFETEA-LU. Specifically, MAP-21 required that BRT projects include features that emulate the services provided by rail, including defined stations rather than bus stops. This is consistent with our work, as we found that including rail-like features appears to lead to increased economic development along BRT corridors. In addition, MAP-21 made a distinction between BRT projects that are eligible for New Starts versus Small Starts funding. Effective federal coordination can help maximize limited resources, while still providing essential services—especially to transportation- disadvantaged populations, including those who cannot provide their own transportation or may face challenges in accessing public transportation due to age, disability, or income constraints. We have previously reported that transportation-disadvantaged populations often benefit from greater and higher quality services when transportation providers coordinate their operations. Additionally, as we reported in our findings on duplicative efforts and programs, improved coordination of these programs and transportation services has the potential to improve the quality and cost- effectiveness of these services, while also reducing duplication, overlap, and fragmentation of services. However, effective coordination can be challenging, as federal programs provide funding under a variety of services, including education, employment, and medical and other human services. Our 2012 report on transportation-disadvantaged populations found that 80 federal programs in eight different agencies fund a variety of transportation services. While some federally funded programs are transportation focused, transportation was not the primary mission for the vast majority of the programs we identified. For example, the Department of Health and Human Services’ Medicaid program reimburses states that provide Medicaid beneficiaries with bus passes, among other transportation options, to access eligible medical services. Total federal spending on services for transportation-disadvantaged populations remains unknown because federal departments did not separately track spending for roughly two-thirds of the programs we identified. Our June 2012 report also concluded that insufficient federal leadership and lack of guidance for furthering collaborative efforts might hinder the coordination of transportation services among state and local providers. Officials in each of the five states we selected for interviews said that the federal government could provide state and local entities with improved guidance on transportation coordination—especially related to instructions on how to share costs across programs (i.e., determining what portion of a trip should be paid by whom). To promote and enhance federal, state, and local coordination efforts, we recommended in 2012 that the Secretary of Transportation, as the chair of the Interagency Coordinating Council on Access and Mobility (Coordinating Council), along with the Coordinating Council’s member agencies, should meet and complete and publish a strategic plan outlining agency roles and responsibilities and articulate a strategy to help strengthen interagency collaboration and communication. Also, the Coordinating Council should report on the progress of its prior recommendations and develop a plan to address any outstanding recommendations. DOT agreed to consider our recommendation and the Coordinating Council’s member agencies responded by issuing a strategic plan for 2011–2013, which established agency roles and responsibilities and identified a shared strategy to reinforce cooperation, and officials have indicated they will continue to take steps to implement our recommendations. FTA has made some progress in enhancing coordination for transportation-disadvantaged populations. According to FTA officials, as a result of MAP-21, the agency has been updating program guidance and has issued draft program circulars for its Urbanized Area Formula Program, Enhanced Mobility for Seniors and Individuals with Disabilities Program, and the Rural Areas Formula Program, all of which discuss coordinated transit programs, among other issues. In addition, FTA continues to support federal programs that play an important role in helping transportation-disadvantaged populations by providing funds to state and local grantees that, in turn, offer services either directly or through private or public transportation providers. Further, some FTA programs require or encourage their grantees to coordinate transportation services. For example, FTA’s Enhanced Mobility of Seniors and Individuals with Disabilities program—which provides formula funding to states to serve the special needs of transit-dependent populations beyond traditional public-transportation service—requires grantees to coordinate their transportation services and establish locally developed, coordinated public transit-human services transportation plans. We continue to examine these funding, service delivery, and coordination issues. Chairman Johnson, Ranking Member Crapo, and Members of the Committee, this completes my prepared statement.

To meet the needs of these passengers in a challenging economy, transit agencies must use federal and other resources wisely, while ensuring quality service. The July 2012 surface transportation reauthorization act--MAP-21--has addressed a number of transit issues by strengthening federal authority to oversee transit safety and emphasizing the restoration and replacement of aging infrastructure, among other things. While it is too early to assess all of the impacts of MAP-21, the work GAO has done can help inform the next surface transportation reauthorization act. This testimony covers GAO's recent work on: (1) funding transit; (2) improving capital decision making; and (3) coordinating services for transit-disadvantaged populations. To address these objectives, GAO drew from its recent reports issued from March 2011 through November 2013. GAO has also analyzed MAP-21, recent rulemaking, and other reports. The Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21) authorized $10.6 and $10.7 billion for fiscal years 2013 and 2014, respectively, for public transit, but did not address long-term funding. Federal funds available for FTA's transit programs come from the general fund of the U.S. Treasury and the Mass Transit Account of the Highway Trust Fund. The Highway Trust Fund supports surface transportation programs, including highways and transit, and is funded through motor fuel and other highway use taxes; however, revenues have eroded over time because federal fuel tax rate stagnation, fuel efficiency improvements, and the use of alternative fuel vehicles. In May 2013, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that to maintain current spending levels plus inflation between 2015 and 2022, the Fund will require over $132 billion more than it is expected to take in over that period. GAO reported that while Congress transferred over $50 billion in general revenues to the Fund since fiscal year 2008, this approach may not be sustainable given competing demands for funding. For these reasons funding surface transportation remains on GAO's High-Risk List. To address these funding challenges, sound capital-investment decisions can help transit agencies use their funds more efficiently. GAO's work on transit asset management and bus rapid transit has illustrated these benefits. Transit asset management : According to the Federal Transit Administration (FTA), it would cost roughly $78 billion (in 2009 dollars) to rehabilitate or replace the nation's aging transit assets--such as buses, rail cars, and escalators. GAO's 2013 report on asset management recognized that many of the nearly 700 public transit agencies struggle to maintain their bus and rail assets in a state of good repair. Sound management practices can help agencies prioritize investments to help optimize limited funding. However, of the nine transit agencies GAO visited, only two measured the effects of capital investments on asset condition and none measured the effects on future ridership. Thus, GAO recommended additional research to measure the effects of capital investments; FTA concurs in part with this recommendation. FTA agency officials recognize the importance of additional research; however, they are hesitant to commit additional resources given their current budget situation. Bus rapid transit (BRT) : In addition to maintaining assets, transit agencies often need to build or expand systems to meet demand. Transit agencies can apply for federal capital-investment funding for new projects through New and Small Starts and Core Capacity Improvement grants. GAO's 2012 report found that many agencies had taken advantage of New and Small Starts funding to develop BRT projects, which generally require less capital investment compared to rail. GAO's recent work also shows benefits from coordinating transit services for the transportation-disadvantaged--those who cannot provide their own transportation or face challenges accessing public transportation. GAO's 2012 report pointed out that coordination can be challenging, as federal programs provide funding for a variety of services. GAO also concluded that insufficient federal leadership and guidance on coordinating services for the disadvantaged may hinder coordination among state and local providers. The Coordinating Council--a group of federal agencies providing these services--has completed a strategic plan to strengthen interagency coordination, as GAO recommended. GAO made recommendations on these issues in previous reports. The Department of Transportation agreed to consider these recommendations and is in various stages of implementing them."}
