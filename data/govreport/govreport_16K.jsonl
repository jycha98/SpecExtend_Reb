Under such plans, participation is generally automatic for eligible workers, and retirement benefits are established by a formula, often based on a worker’s salary and years of service. Since the 1980s, defined contribution plans—most prominently the 401(k) plan—have supplanted defined benefit plans as the dominant type of private-sector retirement plan. Under defined contribution plans, workers typically must decide whether or not to participate, how much to contribute, and how to invest plan assets from a range of options provided under the plan. Under a 401(k) plan, if the employee does not participate, if contributions made to an employee’s account are insufficient, or if the investments that an employee chooses yield an inadequate return, the employee may have retirement income that is insufficient to maintain his or her desired standard of living. As defined contribution plans emerged as the dominant form of retirement plan, the percentage of the population covered by employer-sponsored plans changed very little—remaining at about half of the workforce. As figure 1 shows, Current Population Survey data reveal that about 48 percent of the total U.S. workforce was not covered by an employer- sponsored a plan in 2007. About 40 percent worked for an employer that did not sponsor a plan, and about 8 percent did not participate in the plan that their employer sponsored. According to the Current Population Survey, certain segments of the working population have consistently had much lower rates of employment with employers sponsoring a plan, and lower participation rates than the working population overall. As figure 2 illustrates, larger portions of certain worker groups, such as lower-income workers, younger workers, workers employed by smaller companies, and part-time workers lack coverage compared to all full-time workers. Workers may choose not to enroll, or delay enrolling, in a retirement plan for a number of reasons. For example, according to a recent Congressional Research Service presentation of data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation, most non-participating workers whose employer sponsored a plan said they thought—in some cases, incorrectly—they were ineligible. The report also found that substantial numbers of employees fail to participate because they believe they cannot afford to contribute to the plan. For example, 19 percent of nonparticipating respondents cited this reason, and 10 percent said they did not want to tie up their money. In recent years, exponents of “behavioral economics” have noted that many non-participants may not have made a specific decision, but rather fail to participate because of a tendency to procrastinate and follow the path that does not require an active decision. Further, some workers may not participate because of more immediate savings objectives—such as saving for education or a home—and, in the case of lower income workers, the prospect that Social Security benefits will replace a relatively high percentage of income in their retirement years. For example, a recent analysis by the Investment Company Institute concluded that lower income workers are less likely to save for retirement in part because Social Security benefits replace a higher proportion of their pre-retirement earnings. In recent years, automatic enrollment has been advocated as a way to encourage greater participation in 401(k) plans among the portion of the workforce who have access to such plans but opt not to participate. Typically, under 401(k)s and some other types of defined contribution plans, workers have been required to decide whether or not to join a plan, to specify their saving contribution rates, and to select investments from the range of investment options offered by the plan. Under automatic enrollment, in contrast, a worker would be enrolled in a plan unless she or he explicitly opted-out of the plan. Plan sponsors that adopt automatic enrollment must specify a default contribution rate—the portion of an employee’s salary that will be deposited in the plan—that applies to employees who do not choose a different contribution rate. Also, plan sponsors must select a default investment—the fund or other vehicle into which deferred savings will be invested—unless the employee specifies an investment or investments from those available under the plan. Employers may also adopt an automatic escalation policy, under which an employee’s contribution rates would be automatically increased at periodic intervals, such as annually. For example, if the default contribution rate is 3 percent of pay, a plan sponsor may choose to increase an employee’s rate of saving by 1 percent per year, up to some maximum, such as 6 percent. While a plan sponsor that adopts an automatic enrollment policy must specify a default contribution rate and a default investment, plan features such as these and automatic escalation may also be adopted in the absence of an automatic enrollment policy. Automatic enrollment has not been a traditional feature of 401(k) plans and, prior to 1998, plan sponsors feared that adopting automatic enrollment could lead to plan disqualification. However, in 1998, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) addressed this issue by stating that a plan sponsor could automatically enroll newly hired employees and, in 2000, clarified that automatic enrollment is permissible for current employees who have not enrolled. Nonetheless, a number of considerations inhibited widespread adoption of automatic enrollment, including remaining concerns such as liability in the event that the employee’s investments under the plan did not perform satisfactorily, and concerns about state laws that prohibit withholding employee pay without written employee consent. More recently, provisions of the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA) and subsequent regulations further facilitated the adoption of automatic enrollment by providing incentives for doing so and by protecting plans from fiduciary and legal liability if certain conditions are met. In September 2009, the Department of the Treasury announced IRS actions designed to further promote automatic enrollment and the use of automatic escalation policies. Anti-Discrimination Safe Harbor 401(k) (13) Plans that adopt automatic enrollment may be exempt from required annual testing to ensure that the plan does not discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees. To obtain safe harbor protection, plans must adopt automatic enrollment as well as other plan features and policies. For example, the plan must: Notify affected employees about automatic contributions Defer at least 3 percent of pay in the first year Automatically increase contribution by 1 percent each subsequent year, to a minimum of 6 percent and a maximum of 10 percent Invest savings in a type of investment vehicle identified in Department of Labor regulations as a Qualified Default Investment Alternative (QDIA) Match 100 percent of the first 1 percent of employee contributions, and 50 percent of contributions beyond 1 percent, up to 6 percent of wages Protection from Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) Fiduciary Liability In the absence of direction from an employee, plans that automatically invest contributions in a QDIA are treated as if the employee exercised control over management of their savings in the plan. As a result, plans that comply with Department of Labor regulations pertaining to QDIAs will not be liable for any loss that occurs as a result of such investments. An automatically enrolled worker has 90 days to opt out and withdraw any contributions (including the earnings on those contributions.) These amounts will not be subject to the extra tax that normally applies to distributions received before age 59½. 414(w)(2)(B). Protection from State Wage-Garnishment Laws PPA preempts any state law that would directly or indirectly prohibit or restrict the inclusion of an automatic enrollment arrangement in a plan. Final regulations issued by the U.S. Department of Labor specify four categories of QDIAs. They are (1) a product with a mix of investments that takes into account an individual’s age (such as a target- date fund), (2) an investment service that allocates assets according to an individual’s age (such as a managed account), or (3) a product with a mix of investments that takes into account the characteristics of the group of employees as a whole, rather than each individual (such as a balanced fund). A sponsor may also use a capital preservation fund as a QDIA for the first 120 days of an individual’s participation to simplify administration if the worker opts out of the plan. 29 C.F.R. §2550.404c-5(c)(4). Other proposals have been put forth with the intent of broadening the practice of saving for retirement among workers whose employers do not sponsor a retirement plan. One such proposal is the automatic IRA, which would require employers that do not sponsor a retirement plan to facilitate direct deposit or payroll-deduction savings for all employees. To maximize participation, employees would be automatically enrolled, but would be permitted to opt out. Legislative proposals to establish an automatic IRA requirement were introduced in Congress in 2006 and 2007, and the concept of an automatic IRA was also mentioned in the President’s 2010 Budget proposal. In addition, legislative proposals have been introduced in some states’ legislatures that would involve state governments in facilitating payroll-deduction retirement plans or IRAs for employers that do not already offer them. According to the architect of the state plan concept, a state could play an intermediary role to pool assets and share expenses among many plan sponsors, thus lowering costs. Existing studies show that automatic enrollment significantly increases participation rates in 401(k) plans, although beneficial effects of automatic enrollment may depend on accompanying policies designed to ensure adequate savings and appropriate investment. While defined contribution plan sponsors have increasingly adopted automatic enrollment in recent years, this approach may not be suitable for all plan sponsors, and available data show that some plan sponsors have not augmented automatic enrollment policies with other policies designed to ensure adequate savings. According to analyses we reviewed, automatic enrollment policies result in considerably increased 401(k) participation rates for plans adopting them, with some participation rates reaching as high as 95 percent. For example, one study followed comparison groups hired before and after a company adopted automatic enrollment for new employees only and compared the participation rates of the two groups. The participation rate for those hired before automatic enrollment was adopted was 37 percent at 3 to 15 months of tenure, compared with an 86 percent participation rate for the group hired after automatic enrollment with a similar amount of tenure. According to the studies we reviewed, automatic enrollment has this effect because many people find it easier to delay the decision to enroll in a plan out of inertia, procrastination, feelings of intimidation about making savings and investment decisions, or other factors. Workers may intellectually understand the importance of saving for retirement but have trouble overcoming their own inertia to start saving or to save effectively. A team of researchers found that under automatic enrollment, workers’ inertia works in favor of saving for retirement because workers need to do little or nothing to participate in their employers’ plan. Further, workers may also decline to participate, in p because they believe the decision to participate in a 401(k) plan r time-consuming and complex decisions, such as choosing how muc h to contribute and how to invest their contributions. Automatic enrollment, through its default contribution rates and default investment vehicles, equires offers an easier way to start saving. Table 1 shows overall participation rate increases reported in the various studies we reviewed. Three of the studies also found that automatic enrollment has a significant effect on subgroups of workers with relatively low participation rates, such as lower-income and younger workers. For example, the Fidelity Investments study found that 30 percent of workers aged 20 to 29 were participating in plans without automatic enrollment. In plans with automatic enrollment, the participation rate for workers in that age range was 77 percent, an increase of 47 percentage points. In addition, four of the studies found that automatic enrollment policies reduced the disparities in participation rates between certain groups of workers. For example, the Madrian and Shea study examined participation rates by race and ethnicity and found that, among workers hired under a voluntary enrollment only policy, Hispanic workers had the lowest participation rate at 19.0 percent, blacks had a slightly higher participation rate of 21.7 percent, and whites had the highest participation rate at 42.7 percent. Under automatic enrollment, however, the participation rates for Hispanic and black employees nearly quadrupled to 75.1 percent and 81.3 percent, respectively, narrowing the gap with white workers, whose participation rate more than doubled, increasing to 88.2 percent. The difference in participation rates between white and Hispanic employees fell from 23.7 to 13.1 percentage points. The high level of participation rates under automatic enrollment appears to persist after such policies are adopted, according to two of the studies in our review. Both studies observed participation rates at specific companies for about 3 years after an automatic enrollment policy was adopted. The studies found that for employees hired under automatic enrollment, participation jumped almost immediately and then increased slightly over the 3-year period, but remained relatively stable. The Vanguard study modeled the participation rate over time and found a decline in the participation rate over a 3-year period, with the participation rate falling by about 10 percentage points from its peak of 91 percent but remaining high relative to participation rates for plans without automatic enrollment. Consistent with these results, plan sponsors who had adopted automatic enrollment stated that their experience also indicated that higher participation rates were sustained. One plan sponsor, a large manufacturer, reported that after 2 years of automatic enrollment, 95 percent of employees who had been automatically enrolled had stayed in the plan. Although automatic enrollment can increase participation and saving rates for most workers, it may have an adverse effect on saving rates and investment choices for other workers, depending on the nature of default contribution rates and default investment funds used, according to some of the studies in our review. Four of the six studies we reviewed found that automatically enrolled participants are likely to accept the plan’s default contribution rate. Three of the studies found that some participants would have selected a contribution rate higher than the default rate had they not been subject to automatic enrollment and had they chosen to enroll in the plan voluntarily. Further, two of the three studies also found that some participants were likely to accept a default investment fund with relatively low future prospects for return on investment, such as money-market or stable-value funds, compared to the investment fund they would have selected if they had voluntary enrolled. Thus, these studies concluded that overall savings for these particular participants were lower under automatic enrollment. Further, the Beshears et al. study calculated participation rates for a company that doubled its default contribution rate from 3 percent to 6 percent and found that the participation rates were virtually identical before and after the policy change. In addition, Fidelity Investments reported that employees accept the default contribution rate the majority of the time, regardless of how high it is. Studies have found that default policies have these effects, in part, for the same reasons that automatic enrollment increases participation rates—accepting the defaults is the path of least resistance and requires no action on the part of the worker. In addition, some studies found that some employees see default policies as implicit advice from the plan sponsor and that they imply optimal saving rates and investment choices. Automatic enrollment policies have been increasingly adopted by defined contribution plan sponsors in recent years as a result of several factors. Nonetheless, a number of considerations may limit adoption of automatic enrollment over the long term. Low default contribution rates and an apparent lag in the adoption of automatic escalation policies raise questions about the adequacy of long-term saving rates under automatic enrollment. Further, the widespread adoption of target-date funds (TDF)—funds that allocate investments among various asset classes and automatically shift to lower-risk, income-producing investments as a “target” retirement date approaches—as default investments for plans with automatic enrollment has raised concerns about investment risk and transparency of investments of TDFs for participants nearing retirement. Data from two large plan administrators, as well as discussion with retirement plan experts, indicate that plan sponsors’ adoption of such policies has grown considerably in recent years. Data from Fidelity Investments show that the percentage of defined contribution plans adopting automatic enrollment grew from about 1 percent in December 2004 to about 16 percent in March of 2009. Comparable data from Vanguard show that about 19 percent of plans had adopted automatic enrollment as of December 2008, up from 8 percent in June 2006. Data from one plan administrator show that large plan sponsors— sponsors of plans with $500 million or more in assets—have adopted automatic enrollment policies more often than smaller plans. As figure 3 illustrates, Fidelity Investments data show that about 40 percent of large plans had adopted automatic enrollment by March 2009, while only about 14 percent of small plans had done so. According to Fidelity’s data, about 47 percent of all plan participants are included in plans that offer automatic enrollment. Plan sponsors can choose to apply automatic enrollment “broadly” to all employees, or more narrowly to include only newly hired employees. Data from Fidelity Investments indicate that automatic enrollment policies are typically applied only to new or recently hired employees, but a growing percentage of plan sponsors extended automatic enrollment to existing employees as well. Among plans with automatic enrollment polices, about 58 percent of plans apply such policies to new and recently hired employees only, while about 42 percent apply automatic enrollment to existing eligible employees as well. There is considerable variation in this pattern by plan size—as figure 3 illustrates, the majority of large plans had adopted automatic enrollment only for new or recently hired employees, while nearly half of small plans applied the policy to all eligible employees. According to plan sponsors, retirement plan experts, and others we contacted, several considerations have been driving the increase in automatic enrollment. These considerations include: (1) plan sponsors’ desire to increase participation rates, (2) plan administrators’ marketing of automatic enrollment, and (3) aspects of the Pension Protection Act that facilitate and encourage the adoption of automatic enrollment. Sponsor Desire to Increase Participation Rates: Officials of each of the six plan sponsors we contacted that had adopted automatic enrollment highlighted the desire to better ensure adequate retirement savings for employees. Some plan sponsors noted that automatic enrollment was considered necessary because other methods of increasing plan participation had not been effective. For example, one plan sponsor had sent e-mails and educational materials reminding employees of the plan’s availability and provided them with analyses of the matching funds they had lost by not contributing. While these methods raised contribution rates from the 50 percent range to the 65 percent range, the company could not further increase contribution rates. However, after instituting an automatic enrollment policy, the plan’s participation rates increased to 93 percent. An official of another plan sponsor noted that an automatic enrollment policy was necessary because the company had a very young workforce, and the company believed that retirement savings was a very low priority and a distant, “abstract” benefit for these workers. Some plan sponsors also noted that adoption of an automatic enrollment policy may be particularly urgent in the case of plans that discontinue other benefits. For example, representatives of two plan sponsors stated that automatic enrollment was adopted at about the time that an existing defined benefit plan was frozen—that is, closed to new entrants. A representative of a large plan consulting firm noted that sponsors may do this with the long term in view; they want their employees to be able to retire at retirement age, partly to ensure that as productivity drops off, these workers do not have a reason to stay on indefinitely. This plan consultant also said that some plans may adopt automatic enrollment to help ensure that the sponsor can pass nondiscrimination testing. Plan Administrator Marketing: 401(k) plan administrators—firms that provide and manage retirement plans for plan sponsors—have been actively marketing and promoting adoption of automatic enrollment, according to plan administrators and others. One large plan administrator stated that it encourages automatic enrollment by conducting analyses of the effects of automatic enrollment tailored to individual plan sponsor clients. The official stated that when plan sponsors see the potential benefits to employees of automatic enrollment compared to the status quo, about 25 percent of them have adopted automatic enrollment. The Pension Protection Act: Finally, various aspects of the PPA have facilitated the trend toward automatic enrollment. An official of one of the nation’s largest 401(k) plan administrators noted that the criteria and guidelines established in the PPA streamlined and simplified the decision- making process about automatic enrollment and the related plan design features. One consultant noted that the deliberations about the PPA involved considerable industry input and had an “announcement effect” that generated considerable publicity regarding automatic enrollment. Representatives of two plan sponsors said that the PPA safe harbor protection was a consideration in adopting automatic enrollment. One plan had not adopted all of the PPA safe harbor provisions. Instead, it used the safe harbor specifications as a guide in setting features such as a matching contributions and the 3 percent default contribution rate. The other plan sponsor adopted all of the PPA safe harbor provisions. Various factors, including higher costs, management views, concerns about legal and regulatory challenges, and lack of awareness may delay or prevent the adoption of automatic enrollment policies by some plan sponsors. Greater Costs: Automatic enrollment implies greater costs for plan sponsors, including higher matching costs and greater fees paid to plan administrators. One plan administrator stated that automatic enrollment could be particularly unattractive to cost-sensitive companies that have narrow profit margins. This concern was reflected by a plan sponsor who noted that the adoption of automatic enrollment would be difficult for one of the company’s subsidiaries, which operated in a very cost-competitive environment and would therefore have difficulty passing on costs to customers. The subsidiary would probably have to absorb the additional costs through reduced profit margins. Plan consultants and plan administrators noted that the costs of automatic enrollment may be a particular concern in the current economic environment. One large plan administrator noted that the current state of the economy will slow down adoption of automatic enrollment, as many companies try to minimize additional costs. While some noted that this should be a transient consideration, one expert we contacted said that the recession would be a memorable event for some plan sponsors, which could have longer-term implications. Certain types of plan sponsors may be especially concerned about the cost impact of automatic enrollment. For example, plan sponsors that employ a low-wage and high-turnover workforce—such as retail establishments and restaurant chains—may be especially reluctant to adopt automatic enrollment because of the additional cost, administrative burden, and prospect of limited benefits for employees. One such plan sponsor we contacted explained that adopting automatic enrollment would result in a five-fold increase in the number of plan participants and associated administrative costs and that the company might lower the employer match to mitigate the associated cost increases. In addition, the plan would have greater administrative burdens related to the need for employee communication and to handle inquiries from the much larger pool of participants. A representative of this plan sponsor also explained that, even with contribution rates of 6 percent, low-wage and short-tenure staff would accumulate very small balances and likely abandon them or take a lump-sum distribution upon separation. Management Views: Apart from costs, experts noted that some plan sponsors may be reluctant to adopt automatic enrollment due to certain management views or out of concern about employee reaction or welfare. Some experts told us that some managers view automatic enrollment as overly paternalistic or do not wish to reward passivity in employees who do not voluntarily join a plan. For example, a representative of one plan sponsor told us that the company wanted all employees to participate in the plan but wanted active participation and conscientious saving. A representative of a small manufacturing company stated that management believes that the workforce would be highly distressed if the company began summarily taking 401(k) contributions from their pay, even with a well-communicated opt-out feature. The representative further noted that the sponsor believes the recent declines in the equity markets also weigh against adoption of automatic enrollment, in light of the firm’s fiduciary responsibility for the plan. Legal and Regulatory Challenges: Some experts noted that some plan sponsors may be reluctant to adopt automatic enrollment due to legal and regulatory concerns. One expert noted that small plans see the legal and regulatory environment surrounding 401(k)s as complex and may see a switch to automatic enrollment as overly risky. Another expert noted that, unlike larger plan sponsors, small plans without well-staffed legal and compliance departments may be risk-averse and slow to adopt new policies. Lack of Employer Awareness: Some smaller employers may not be aware that automatic enrollment is a plan feature available to them. Representatives of two small plan sponsors said that they were generally unaware of automatic enrollment as a plan option. For example, one small plan sponsor stated that neither she nor the organization’s 401(k) employee advisory committee was familiar with the concept of automatic enrollment. Further, the local service provider that provides the organization with plan guidance and management assistance had not suggested such a policy. Relatedly, representatives of one large plan administrator told us that small plan sponsors generally lag behind large plan sponsors in adopting innovative services, tools, and plan design features, including automatic enrollment. Available data show that many plans with automatic enrollment have not adopted default automatic escalation policies, which, in combination with low default contribution rates, could result in low saving rates for participants who do not increase contribution rates over time. Also, experts noted that a trend toward TDFs as default investments, while potentially beneficial in important respects, also raises questions about the investment risks and transparency for those close to retirement. As figure 4 illustrates, data from two large plan sponsors indicate that the majority of plans with automatic enrollment have adopted initial default contribution rates of 3 percent. Between 15 to 17 percent of plans have a default contribution rate of less than 3 percent, and between 22 and 25 percent of plans have a default contribution rate of more than 3 percent. Data from Fidelity showed that the average default contribution rate grew modestly, from about 3.0 percent in March 2005 to about 3.2 percent in March 2009. According to a Vanguard official, the average default contribution rate was 3.3 percent at the end of 2008. Available data is mixed with regard to the extent to which plan sponsors with automatic enrollment have also adopted automatic escalation policies. According to one plan administrator’s data, about 45 percent of plans with automatic enrollment had adopted a default automatic escalation feature as of March 2009, up from zero in 2005. Further, this administrator’s data shows that adoption of default automatic escalation policies are much less prevalent among large plans than small plans— about 24 percent of large plans with automatic enrollment policies have adopted such a policy, while about 51 percent of small plans have done so. Data from another plan administrator show a much greater rate of adoption of default automatic escalation policies—77 percent of all plans with automatic enrollment had adopted default automatic escalation policies in 2008, up from 31 percent in 2005. Available data indicate that plans with automatic enrollment policies overwhelmingly adopted TDFs as a default investment. TDFs allocate their investments among various asset classes and shift that allocation from equity investments to fixed income and money market investments as a “target” retirement date approaches. Eighty-seven percent of Vanguard Group plans with automatic enrollment had adopted TDFs as a default investment at the end of 2008, compared to 42 percent in 2005. Conversely, the use of balanced funds, money market funds, and stable value funds as default investments have declined significantly. This trend toward TDFs as a default investment vehicle is corroborated by data from Fidelity Investments, which shows that 96 percent of plans with an automatic enrollment policy used TDFs as of March 2009, up from 57 percent at the end of 2005. Target-date funds (TDF) offer investors certain advantages generally not offered by other types of investment vehicles. TDFs allocate their investments among various asset classes and shift that allocation to more conservative investments as a “target” date approaches. For example, a TDF could be designed for workers expecting to retire many years in the future and would typically have a much greater allocation to equities and a lesser allocation to fixed-income investments. Conversely, a fund designed for workers nearing retirement age would tend to have a greater allocation to fixed-income investments. TDFs thus offer participants a potentially beneficial long- term asset allocation strategy while lowering risks as the participant approaches retirement age. This trend is important in part because recent evidence suggests that participants who are automatically enrolled in plans with target-date fund defaults tend to have a high concentration of their savings in these funds. A recent analysis by the Employee Benefit Research Institute found that workers who were considered to be automatically enrolled in a 401(k) plan were more likely than those who voluntarily joined to invest all their assets in a TDF. The study found that, except for participants in plans with more than 10,000 participants, more than 90 percent of those automatically enrolled in TDFs had all of their allocation in such funds. While TDFs may help ensure that workers have a more age-appropriate mix of investments, some experts have stated that TDFs may pose certain challenges, as recent events in the financial markets have illustrated. As a result of the 2008 stock market decline, some TDFs designed for those expecting to retire in or around 2010 lost 25 percent or more in value. In light of concerns about a number of issues, including how plan sponsors evaluate, monitor, and use TDFs, in 2008 the Advisory Council on Employee Welfare and Pension Benefit Plans recommended that the U.S. Department of Labor provide more specific guidance regarding the complex nature of TDFs, and outline the methodology that plan fiduciaries should follow in selecting and monitoring them. The Advisory Council also stated that additional education materials would help plan participants become aware of the value and risks of TDFs. In order to promote retirement savings among the 40 percent of the workforce whose employer does not sponsor a plan, members of Congress, in recent years, have introduced bills for federally required “automatic IRAs” that would be implemented nationwide. Automatic IRAs offer the potential benefit of expanding retirement coverage but some have expressed concerns that automatic IRAs may not result in significant retirement savings, and raised questions about the costs of such a program for employers and the federal government. There have also been proposals for state-supported retirement savings programs over the past several years. These state proposals also have the potential to expand retirement coverage, but on a state-by-state basis. Concerns have been expressed regarding the cost of these state proposals, as well as employer and employee interest in such plans, and potential legal barriers. A number of existing proposals have described in general terms the concept of an automatic IRA, and they contain common elements. Under the 2006 and 2007 congressional bills for automatic IRAs, employers that do not sponsor a retirement plan would be required to defer a percentage of an employee’s pay to an IRA through payroll deduction, unless the employee opts out. The requirement would apply to all employers with more than 10 employees and who had been in business for at least 2 years, or employers with 100 or more employees regardless of the length of time the employer has been in business. Eligible workers would be those who had worked for an employer for a specified period, were at least 18 years old, and were not eligible to participate in any other qualified retirement plan the employer sponsors. Affected employers could either (1) automatically enroll eligible workers, although employees would be offered the option to affirmatively opt out or (2) require that employees make an explicit yes or no decision on whether to participate; workers not making such a decision would be automatically enrolled (see fig. 6). Employers would then transfer a portion of employees’ pay to either a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA through payroll deduction. Employers could elect to send contributions to IRAs of an employer-designated issuer, unless the employee selects his own IRA provider. If neither the employer nor the employee designates a specific IRA provider, the contributions would be deposited into federally designated default fault accounts. accounts. The automatic IRA is intended to help address the retirement security needs of those not already covered by an employer-sponsored retirement plan. Further, the automatic IRA is designed to extend the benefits of payroll-deduction savings and automatic features of 401(k)s. According to some experts, requiring employers to offer automatic IRAs is necessary for a number of reasons. First, employers have had the option to establish payroll-deduction IRAs for over 10 years, and for a number of reasons, very few employers have done so. As we previously reported, IRA providers have told us some employers may be reluctant to adopt a payroll-deduction IRA because they believe that their publicizing the payroll-deduction IRAs may be construed as an endorsement of the policy, which could potentially violate ERISA. Further, employers may not be aware of how payroll-deduction IRAs work and some small employers may not be aware that this option exists. The automatic enrollment component is necessary, according to designers of the automatic IRA, because various impediments would prevent many eligible employees from taking advantage of an available payroll-deduction IRA. For example, employees would have to decide whether to participate, select an IRA provider, select investment vehicles, and determine how much to contribute. These officials note that many workers may have difficulty overcoming inertia, and automatic enrollment would help them overcome this difficulty. Advocates for automatic IRAs and some pension industry experts reported that the automatic IRA could have a positive effect on retirement savings. According to the architects of the approach, automatic IRAs offer a powerful mechanism for accumulating retirement savings through regular payroll deposits that continue automatically. In light of the impact of automatic enrollment polices on participation in 401(k)s, an automatic IRA program that features default automatic enrollment could have a positive impact on participation rates. One study estimated that likely automatic IRA participants include younger, part-time, and lower- or moderate-income workers, as well as workers subject to higher than average job turnover. Advocates stated that automatic IRAs could help these employees overcome inertia since they would no longer need to take the initiative in order to save. Further, two pension industry experts told us that the payroll-deduction nature of automatic IRAs would ensure that employees of affected companies are saving on a regular basis. However, some experts agree that the automatic enrollment component of automatic IRAs has the potential to significantly increase the number of workers saving for retirement by including workers that currently do not have access to an employer-sponsored plan. Some caution, however, that the benefits resulting from the automatic IRA could be relatively small. A 2009 preliminary analysis funded by the Department of Labor illustrates potential outcomes of two automatic IRA scenarios using specific behavioral assumptions about participation and contribution rates, among other things. The analysis found that the resulting increase in average retirement benefits at age 70 is small (even when ignoring account fees and offsetting reductions in other savings) and is weighted toward the third of the population with the highest lifetime earnings. If actual participation rates in the automatic IRA are higher than the analysis assumes—and the experience of automatic enrollment in 401(k)s indicates this is a possibility—the resulting increase in average retirement benefits could be higher. The Department of Labor is undertaking additional analysis to illustrate the effects of participation rates similar to those achieved in 401(k) plans with automatic enrollment. Participants may also not fully benefit from the tax incentives provided by automatic IRAs. According to analysis sponsored by AARP, 50 percent of automatic IRA participants would be lower-income. Therefore, with the exception of Social Security and Medicare taxes, they would pay little, if any, income tax and may not benefit from the tax incentives traditional IRAs offer. Further, while some participants would be eligible for the Saver’s Credit, one analysis estimated that the benefit of the credit could be limited. Because the credit is nonrefundable, it can only be used to offset income tax liability. If the participant does not have income tax liability up to the full amount of the credit, the full value of the credit can not be used. For example, the study concluded that if participants made the maximum permitted contributions to an automatic IRA, then nearly 90 percent would not receive the full credit. In part to improve the tax incentive of automatic IRAs, the Department of Treasury, in August of 2009, proposed making the Saver’s Credit fully refundable and depositing it automatically into IRAs. Finally, proper administration of accounts, including record keeping, will be important for managing and maintaining the retirement savings accumulated through the IRAs, according to some analyses and experts. For example, workers would be responsible for ensuring that they do not exceed applicable limits on annual contributions to an automatic IRA. An analysis sponsored by AARP and pension industry officials noted that it might be difficult for some workers to keep track of their accounts when they move from job to job or if their employer goes out of business. A 2007 study noted that automatic IRA proposals do not impose record- keeping responsibilities on employers, beyond withholding and transmitting IRA contributions. Because of this, the report noted that other entities must assume these responsibilities, and a companion report recommended a centralized administrator be responsible for record keeping. For example, the first report found that a central administrator could help prevent lost accounts by providing participants with annual reports including their contributions and investment earnings for the year, as well as the total account balance. In addition, the architects of the automatic IRA proposed that the federal government set up a standard default account and contract with private financial institutions for record- keeping services, among other things, to make managing the IRAs easier. A variety of views exist regarding the cost and administrative burden that an automatic IRA would place on affected small employers. As one analysis of the automatic IRA concept noted, an automatic IRA has the potential to result in some costs and administrative burdens on small employers. The analysis noted that employers would need to provide employees with election forms and process paperwork with respect to employee elections or non-elections, choose an IRA provider or opt for the federally designated default investment, and withhold contributions from employees’ pay. Pension industry officials also stated that some small employers do not have payroll deduction systems and send paper or spreadsheet files to their record keepers and brokers. They told us that these employers may choose to invest in new infrastructure in order to remit automatic IRA contributions through payroll deduction. Recent legislative proposals for an automatic IRA have recognized the potential challenges for small employers and contain provisions to mitigate their impacts. For example, the 2007 bills to authorize automatic IRAs would have exempted employers with fewer than 10 employees as well as those that had been in business for less than 2 years. According to some advocates, the proposals would have therefore avoided placing additional requirements on the smallest companies, which may not have electronic payroll-deduction systems. It would also relieve employers starting a new business from additional costs and administrative burdens. In addition, the proposals would establish a tax credit in the early years for participating employers with fewer than 100 employees to mitigate some administrative and startup costs. In light of these automatic IRA features, some experts and a recent analysis have found that additional costs may be small for most small employers. The architects of the automatic IRA concept have stated that because many employers already make deductions for federal income tax and payroll tax withholdings, making IRA payroll deductions would impose little, if any, new administrative costs. Further, they said these employers would not have to bear the costs involved in maintaining a retirement plan, such as matching employee contributions. These views were supported by a 2009 report sponsored by AARP, which found that most small employers would face low costs to implement the automatic IRA. This study noted, for example, that about 97 percent of employers with 10 or more employees had automated payroll systems, and such employers would face relatively few burdens implementing the automatic IRA. The report also found that payroll software companies and payroll service providers are likely to adopt automatic IRA requirements in their services to small employers. For the estimated 3 percent of affected employers that process payroll manually, the automatic IRA would also have to be implemented manually. Past proposals have described a federal role that could mitigate some of the difficulties and risks of implementing an automatic IRA. For example, the proposals would have created a new federal entity that would, among other things, establish low-cost default investments. According to experts we contacted and analyses we reviewed, establishing an automatic IRA policy would require tax incentives to make it more affordable to some employers and federal expenditures to establish and govern the program, among other things. However, analyses sponsored by AARP found that it is not possible to determine what the costs would be to the federal government without a more detailed proposal. Further, these studies reported that the establishment of an automatic IRA would reduce federal tax revenues as a result of the tax credit available to small employers, individual tax benefits from deferred employee income, and greater use of the Saver’s Credit. Two analyses estimated that the revenue losses could amount to somewhere between $2 billion and $19 billion over 10 years. Industry officials and some experts we contacted also noted that establishment of an automatic IRA could affect the market for 401(k) plans. For example, some pension industry experts and representatives of two national organizations representing large plan sponsors noted that if automatic IRAs are made too attractive, they might displace 401(k)s and Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees of Small Employers (SIMPLE) plans. These officials said that an employer might forego adopting a 401(k) plan if they have already been required to facilitate an automatic IRA, and that this would be unfortunate because an IRA is in many ways an inferior option for workers. The officials told us that a 401(k) plan can offer workers better benefits, such as an employer match and higher contribution rates. In addition, some of the officials reported that the existence of a 401(k) creates a workplace culture that encourages participation in retirement saving. Further, an AARP-sponsored analysis noted that small businesses will weigh the costs of establishing or maintaining a qualified retirement plan against the costs of complying with the automatic IRA requirements. To the extent that the automatic IRA approach offers significantly lower costs—including the relative costs of fiduciary liability—employers may decide against adopting a 401(k) plan or may eliminate an existing one. In light of concerns such as these, officials of one large financial services firm said that, if implemented, the automatic IRA program should be evaluated to determine if it led to a shift away from 401(k) plans. Others, however, have stated that the automatic IRA is not likely to erode the popularity of 401(k) plans, and may even promote greater adoption of such retirement vehicles. Some experts noted that the potential for automatic IRAs to supplant 401(k)s can be minimized by careful design of the program. Perhaps most importantly, they said that the maximum annual savings for an automatic IRA should be designed so that it is less attractive to a small business employer than a 401(k). Specifically, they noted that it is important that the automatic IRA not permit contributions above the current IRA dollar limits to avoid competing with qualified plans. These advocates reason that the potential tax advantage of a 401(k) enables a small business owner—who, along with his employees, may choose to participate in the 401(k) or IRA plan his business sponsors—to save a much higher percentage of his tax-deferred income than does an automatic IRA, making the 401(k) plan a more attractive option. Further, some industry experts told us that an automatic IRA would likely be a stepping stone toward adopting a 401(k) for some small employers. For example, according to an official of one large organization representing pension professionals stated that payroll deduction automatic IRA arrangements will ultimately encourage more employers to sponsor 401(k) plans, and contribute on their employees’ behalf. In recent years, 10 states have considered proposals that would involve state governments in facilitating retirement savings plans for workers whose employer does not sponsor a plan. One study on such state proposals reported that employers would like to provide a retirement savings vehicle for their employees, but are inhibited by the cost, complexity, and time that would be required to do so. Under the proposals, state governments could take a number of actions to help address some of these issues and facilitate the use of payroll- deduction or SIMPLE IRAs or the adoption of 401(k) plans. For example, a state would promote private pension coverage and facilitate retirement savings for small business, moderate-income, and lower-income workers—who are less likely to be covered by an employer-sponsored plan—by acting as an intermediary between employers and financial institutions. In addition, a state could help small employers pool their investments and administrative activities. The type of retirement plans that would be established by the programs varies. For example, California’s proposal would establish a payroll- deduction, traditional, or SIMPLE IRA, or a combination of these options; Connecticut’s proposal would establish a 401(k) or other type of defined contribution plan; and proposals in Maryland and Washington would establish a defined contribution plan and IRA options. Regardless, the state would initiate and oversee the programs, while private-sector companies under contract to the state would manage the investment vehicles and day-to-day administration. For example, a Washington study outlined an option under which the state would design the basic features of a 401(k) plan and market the plan to private-sector employers who do not currently offer a plan. The state would then contract with a private- sector plan administrator to provide access to investment funds, direct customer service, Web-based account access, and to distribute account statements and other communications. Table 2 shows examples of state roles and the intended impact of automatic IRAs under existing proposals. Program Participation: Little is known about the extent to which employers and employees would participate in a state-assisted retirement savings program. According to representatives of two organizations in favor of state-assisted retirement savings plans, employer and employee interest in such a program could be considerable. Moreover, one of the representatives noted that proposals in Washington and other states have been specifically designed to address small companies’ concerns that the cost of setting up payroll deduction prevents them from adopting a 401(k) plan or a payroll-deduction IRA. However, no known rigorous assessment exists of the extent to which small employers or employees would opt to participate in such a program. We obtained state-sponsored studies from three of the four states we examined, and while none of the studies included an analysis measuring the magnitude of the market demand for such a program, two noted concerns regarding the potential demand for a state program. For example, a study prepared for the Maryland legislature compared a Maryland proposal to a number of other state financial programs, such as a state-sponsored college savings program. In comparing the two, the report noted that the college savings program offers distinctive tax and pre-payment guarantee advantages that are not otherwise available in the private market. However, the study noted that this distinction, which helps ensure a market demand for the college savings plans, would not exist for the state-assisted retirement program. The report noted that there will be no additional employee tax benefit for participants in the proposed state-assisted retirement savings program and, for that reason, the program would have to compete on an equal footing with plans in the marketplace. The Maryland analysis concluded that the program might be difficult to establish or market in the absence of a federal requirement that all employers have a retirement savings plan. Representatives of the financial services industry also indicated that state- assisted programs to some extent could have a “zero-sum” effect. In commentary on the Connecticut proposal in March of 2008, the Small Business Council of America (SBCA) and American Society of Pension Professionals and Actuaries (ASPPA) stated that low-cost retirement options exist now, and the state-assisted program would result in little difference in cost. The SBCA and ASPPA added that state government should not compete with small private businesses unless there is a clear market failure or some inherent unfairness that disadvantages its citizens. Representatives of the Connecticut Bankers Association were concerned that rather than expand retirement savings vehicles to new employees, the state program would attract the “already served market” with initial low costs. Similarly, an SBCA representative stated that providing retirement services to small employers is not very profitable for financial services firms, and if such a proposal resulted in the state obtaining half of the small business market, for example, it is conceivable that large plan administrators would exit the business since they only profit in this sector though large volume. Further, a fiscal analysis of a Washington state proposal noted that the program would have no initial plan assets and uncertain levels of participation and, as a result, vendors may have difficulty estimating the total cost of record-keeping services. This, in turn, could affect vendor interest in providing services for the program. Program Design and Costs to State: Studies from California, Maryland, and Washington about the feasibility of state-assisted retirement savings programs identified important questions about program design and related costs. For example, state governments will need to determine the extent to which administrative and management responsibilities will be borne by the state, and how much will be contracted out to financial services providers. States would also need to determine what types of investment funds will be used, including any default funds. Further, analyses from the three states showed they would face initial and ongoing costs. In addition, a fiscal analysis of the Washington proposal identified three major costs categories—including program development and administration, communications and marketing, and record keeping. As table 3 illustrates, the Washington analysis estimated a total cost of about $4.4 million to implement and operate the program in the first 2 years. Lack of startup funding may be a significant barrier in some states. While the Maryland and Connecticut proposals allow for state budget appropriations (which may later be recovered through participant fees), the California proposal stated that initial funding could come from a state budget appropriation or a non-profit or private entity. However, state budget appropriations may be difficult to obtain given these states’ current budget shortfalls. The Washington proposal stated that its program could not be started until the state had obtained federal and/or philanthropic funds sufficient to support the first 3 years of the program. According to an advocate for the Washington proposal, his organization recognized that, due to the current economy, the states are not in a position to self-fund state-assisted retirement savings programs. He reported that his organization has been working on obtaining federal funds to cover the startup costs of such programs. Legal and Regulatory Challenges: State-assisted savings programs would also have to comply with both federal and state law that, according to the state analyses, could provide additional challenges. One analysis noted that states would need to obtain requisite federal approvals to ensure that the programs adhere to all federal requirements governing the operation of retirement plans. For example, if the program establishes 401(k) accounts, the state would need to submit plan documents to the IRS and Department of Labor for approval. Further, the Maryland and Washington analyses found that if a state sponsored the establishment of a 401(k) plan, such plans would be subject to ERISA’s fiduciary requirements and expose either the state or the employer to potential liability in the event that participants suffer financial losses. According to the Maryland analysis, participants may try to hold the state or the employer liable if they incur investment losses after being sold an investment unsuitable for their needs or if they received misleading communications about investments. However, both analyses noted that there are steps the states can take to minimize their liability. For example, according to the Maryland study, the state could limit investment options to reduce the possibility of unsuitable choices or miscommunication. The Washington and Maryland analyses discussed a number of other potential liabilities that states could face. For example, the Maryland analysis noted that a failure to file required forms and conduct transactions under applicable standards could subject the state or employers to significant penalties imposed by IRS or the Department of Labor. Officials from Washington noted that a 401(k) option could create a new and complex compliance and monitoring role for the state retirement agency and that it could be administratively difficult for the state to assume this role. They added that the state would face a steep learning curve in addressing ERISA and liability issues, and might have to contract with outside expertise to deal with compliance and oversight issues. The state role envisioned in the proposals may be precluded by some states’ constitutions. Analyses of proposals in California and Washington specifically cited aspects of the state constitutions that could affect the states’ ability to operate a plan. For example, California’s constitution prohibits the gift or loan of state credit to associations, companies or corporations, and prohibits the state from loaning its credit, subscribing to, or being interested in the stock of any company, association, or corporation. According to the California study, although California’s constitution specifically exempts the retirement board of a public retirement system from this prohibition, it is not clear whether the exemption would extend to a program for private-sector employees. The California study noted that if the program is structured in such a way that the state internally manages funds associated with the program, this could be seen as the state having a financial interest outside the limits of the public employees’ retirement fund. The California study also observed that a constitutional amendment may be needed to address this issue. Washington’s constitution has a similar prohibition. The Washington report noted that the proposed retirement savings program may be permissible because it serves a public purpose by helping individuals save for retirement and reducing the risk that individuals will rely on state assistance in the absence of adequate retirement savings. However, the report also noted that no Washington case has considered proposals similar to those discussed in the report. The report concluded that it was not possible to predict how a court would rule should the program be challenged. In addition, because no other states have enacted such programs, there is no guidance available from other courts. Automatic enrollment of workers in 401(k) plans has proven to be an effective means of increasing plan participation rates. Because such policies are being increasingly adopted by defined contribution plan sponsors in the wake of the Pension Protection Act of 2006, many additional workers will be brought into plans who might not otherwise have participated. Nonetheless, a number of considerations could potentially limit the extent or impact of such policies. First, the benefits of automatic enrollment are inherently limited to workers that have access to an employer-sponsored plan but do not participate. Second, some types of employers, such as employers with high-turnover workforces and small employers, may find automatic enrollment too costly or inappropriate for their workforce. Third, initially low default contribution rates and the absence of default automatic escalation policies at some plans may result in inadequate long-term savings for some workers. Automatic IRAs may hold promise for workers who do not have access to an employer-sponsored plan. The proposal has potential in that it could foster retirement savings among the roughly 40 percent of the workforce whose employers do not sponsor a plan. As such a policy is designed, however, a number of important issues remain to be considered. For example, it is not clear that an automatic IRA will offer low-income workers a significant benefit. Further, in order to ensure that the intended beneficiaries accumulate and retain savings, some central administration—possibly by the federal government—may be required to assume significant and long-term involvement for record keeping and administration. The nature and costs of such a role have not yet been publicly assessed or compared against the potential benefits and limitations of an automatic IRA. In addition, while state-assisted retirement savings plans may also hold some promise for expanding retirement coverage for workers, none of these proposals has been enacted and they could face significant legal barriers to implementation. Both the growth of automatic enrollment and the introduction of automatic IRA proposals have brought renewed attention to the question of how to extend retirement coverage to the half of the workforce not covered by an employer-sponsored plan. This is an important step forward, as past debate over retirement security has largely focused on increasing retirement savings for those already participating in retirement plans. As plan sponsors and participants gain more experience with automatic enrollment, it will be helpful to learn from these experiences, especially in light of the recent recession. The lessons learned may have important implications for related 401(k) plan features, such as automatic escalation, and for the potential feasibility and usefulness of automatic IRA and state-assisted retirement savings proposals. Further, it would also be helpful to carefully consider the various concerns raised in the automatic IRA debate to increase the likelihood that, if such a proposal becomes law, it is administered in an efficient and effective way. Finally, while state efforts could be helpful in increasing the number of workers saving for retirement, these efforts may not be necessary depending on the potential implementation of automatic IRAs. Further, fiscal difficulties in some states may make such proposals difficult to implement in the near future. We provided a draft of this report to the Department of Labor and the Department of the Treasury for review and comment. The Department of Labor generally agreed with our findings. With regard to the potential impacts of an automatic IRA on retirement benefits, Labor said that the Employee Benefits Security Administration is undertaking additional analysis to illustrate the effect of higher participation rates, similar to those achieved in 401(k) plans. The Department of Labor provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate. The Department of Labor’s formal comments are reproduced in appendix II. The Department of the Treasury also generally agreed with our findings, and provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate. The Department of the Treasury’s formal comments are reproduced in appendix III. As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce its contents earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days after the date of this letter. At that time, we will send copies of this report to the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of the Treasury, appropriate congressional committees, and other interested parties. In addition, the report will be available at no charge on GAO’s Web site at http://www.gao.gov. If you have any questions concerning this report, please contact Barbara Bovbjerg at (202) 512-7215. Contact points for our Office of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. GAO staff who made major contributions to this report are listed in appendix II. To determine what is known about the effect of automatic enrollment policies among the nation’s defined contribution plans, as well as the extent of and prospects for such policies, we first reviewed reports examining the impact of automatic enrollment, default contribution rates, and default investment funds on participation rates and saving patterns. Table 4 shows the six reports presenting original research that we reviewed. Officials at the Department of Labor, as well as other pension industry experts, verified our selections. The six reports include two conducted by large plan administrators that analyzed the records of their respective defined contribution plan sponsors and participants. The remaining four reports conducted case studies of companies that adopted automatic enrollment and analyzed participation rates, contribution rates, and investment fund allocations before and after the policy was implemented. For each study, we analyzed available evidence on: (1) the impact of automatic enrollment on participation rates and the durability of any increases in participation, (2) the characteristics of the workers whose participation rates are affected by automatic enrollment,(3) the impact of automatic enrollment on contribution rates, and (4) the impact of automatic enrollment on selection of investment funds. However, the findings of these case studies may not be generalizable for three reasons. First, each study examined the experience of only one to three companies. Second, many of the companies in the four case studies seem to have been facing difficulty meeting nondiscrimination testing requirements. Third, some offered matching contributions to their employees and it is unclear whether the presence of a match affects automatic enrollment participation rates. Therefore, the experiences of these companies may not be representative of all 401(k) sponsors. To determine the extent to which plans had adopted automatic enrollment policies, we obtained data from two large plan administrators—Fidelity Investment and Vanguard Investments. Data from Fidelity represents the 18,100 qualified defined contribution plans Fidelity administers, encompassing about 14 million plan participants and over $600 billion in assets. Data from Vanguard is drawn from Vanguard’s universe of defined contribution plans—more than 2,200 qualified plans that encompass more than 3 million participants and almost $200 billion in assets. We determined that these data accurately reflect the experience of Fidelity and Vanguard, but are not necessarily representative of the universe of defined contribution plans. We conducted in-depth interviews with 12 plan sponsors to obtain their perspectives on their experiences with automatic enrollment and related policies, as well as prospects for the policies. We used Form 5500 data from the Department of Labor to select a sample that included plan sponsors from a variety of industries including those that may be considered to have low wages and high turnover, and vice-versa, and small, medium, and large plans, as measured by number of participants. Six of the plan sponsors had adopted automatic enrollment, including one that had significantly narrowed the scope of its automatic enrollment policy, two that had adopted a 401(k) plan within the past 5 years, and 10 that have sponsored a 401(k) plan for more than 5 years. The remaining six plan sponsors have not adopted automatic enrollment. Table 5 shows the industries and plan sponsor sizes for the 12 sponsors that we contacted. In addition, we conducted interviews with officials at the Departments of the Treasury and Labor, as well as academic experts from the Employee Benefits Research Institute (EBRI), Brookings, The Heritage Foundation, Harvard University, and the New School of Social Research. We also interviewed 401(k) plan administrators, providers, and consultants including Deloitte, Fidelity Investments, Vanguard, Mercer, Watson Wyatt, T. Rowe Price, ADP, State Street Global Advisors, and Renaissance Institutional Management. Finally, we interviewed industry and research organizations such as the Investment Company Institute (ICI), the Pension Rights Center (PRC), AARP, the Profit Sharing/401(k) Council of America (PSCA), the American Benefits Council (ABC), American Society for Pension Professionals and Actuaries (ASPPA), the Center for American Progress (CAP), the AFL-CIO, the Small Business Council of America (SBCA), and the Committee on Investment of Employee Benefit Assets (CIEBA). To determine the potential benefits and limitations of automatic IRA proposals and state-assisted retirement savings plan proposals, we analyzed the Automatic IRA Acts of 2006 and 2007 as well as state-assisted retirement savings proposals from four states. The Economic Opportunity Institute identified nine states that have introduced state-assisted retirement savings proposals: California, Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, and Washington. In addition, the architect of the state-assisted retirement savings concept identified Vermont as having introduced a proposal. We selected four—California, Connecticut, Maryland, and Washington—for an in-depth review because these states covered a range of plan type offerings and we were able to obtain feasibility studies or testimony prepared for state congressional hearings on their proposals. We did not conduct an independent legal review of these proposals. We analyzed the work of two researchers from Brookings and The Heritage Foundation that have developed proposals for the automatic IRA and state-assisted retirement savings plans. We then reviewed four studies sponsored by AARP examining the feasibility of automatic IRAs; survey reports by AARP and Prudential on employee and employer attitudes toward automatic IRAs; a microsimulation analysis of the impact of automatic IRAs on workers’ savings accumulations and retirement security; and three feasibility studies on California, Maryland, and Washington states’ proposals.\n\n### Summary:", "answer": "Although employer-sponsored retirement plans can be an important component of income security after retirement, only about half of all workers participate in such plans. To foster greater participation among workers who have access to such plans, Congress included provisions that facilitate plan sponsors' adoption of automatic enrollment policies in the Pension Protection Act of 2006. To foster greater retirement savings among workers who do not have access to an employer-sponsored plan, proposals have been made at the federal level for an \"automatic IRA\" and at the state level for state-based programs. Because of questions about the extent of retirement savings and prospects for a sound retirement for all Americans, GAO was asked to determine (1) what is known about the effect of automatic enrollment policies among the nation's 401(k) plans, and the extent of and future prospect for such policies; and (2) the potential benefits and limitations of automatic IRA proposals and state-assisted retirement savings proposals. To answer these questions, GAO reviewed available reports and data, and interviewed plan sponsors, industry groups, investment professionals, and relevant federal agencies. Automatic enrollment appears to significantly increase participation in 401(k) plans according to existing studies, but may not be suitable for all plan sponsors. Some studies found that participation rates can reach as high as 95 percent under automatic enrollment. Available data indicate that the percentage of plans with automatic enrollment policies increased from about 1 percent in 2004 to more than 16 percent in 2009, with higher rates of adoption among larger plan sponsors. In most cases, these plans automatically enroll only new employees, rather than all employees. We also found that automatic enrollment may not be suitable for all plan sponsors, such as those with a high-turnover workforce. Further, some data show that while automatic escalation policies--which automatically increase saving rates over time--are increasingly common, they lag behind adoption of automatic enrollment. In combination with low initial contribution rates, this could depress savings for some workers. Also, the emergence of target-date funds--funds that allocate investments among various asset classes and shift to lower-risk investments as a \"target\" retirement date approaches--as the typical default investment raises questions in light of the substantial losses such funds experienced in the past year. Other proposals could expand the portion of the workforce saving for retirement, but these proposals could face challenges. Under a federally mandated automatic IRA, certain employers could be required to enroll eligible employees in payroll-deduction IRAs, unless the worker specifically opted out. Such a proposal could broaden the population that saves for retirement at minimal cost to employers. However, this proposal faces a number of challenges, including uncertainty about the extent to which it would help low-income workers accumulate significant retirement savings. Proposals for state-assisted retirement savings programs could raise coverage and, ultimately, savings by involving state governments in facilitating retirement savings for workers without access to an employer-sponsored plan. However, such programs face uncertainty about employer and worker participation levels, as well as legal and regulatory issues."}

The selection of Rio de Janeiro to host the 2016 games marks the first time a South American city has been selected to host an Olympics. Rio de Janeiro was an applicant city for the 2012 Summer Olympics. Rio de Janeiro does have experience hosting major international sporting events, however. The city hosted the 2007 Pan-American Games and the 2014 Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) World Cup. The Olympic Games will be held August 5-21, 2016. It is expected that 10,500 athletes from 206 countries will participate in 42 sports, including 555 athletes on the U.S. Olympic team. Most events will be held at 32 competition venues in 4 main regions, or neighborhoods, in Rio de Janeiro: Barra de Tijuca (Barra), Copacabana, Deodoro, and Maracanã. Figure 1 below shows the four neighborhoods and the specific venues located in each. In addition to Rio de Janeiro (which has two soccer stadiums), soccer matches will be held in the cities of Belo Horizonte, Brasília, Manaus, São Paulo, and Salvador. Figure 2 below shows all six cities. For the first time, the 2016 Rio Games will feature a team consisting of athletes who are refugees. Created by the IOC's Executive Board, the Refugee Olympic Team (ROT) for the 2016 Summer Games has 10 members who were selected from a pool of 43 athletes. The origin countries of the ROT athletes are the Democratic Republic of the Congo (2), Ethiopia (1), South Sudan (5), and Syria (2). The IOC will ensure that the ROT receives uniforms, housing, and technical assistance (e.g., coaches and support staff). The Olympic flag and the Olympic anthem will be used for any official representations, such as possible medal ceremonies, involving ROT. Over the years, host countries and cities have had to deal with a variety of concerns, problems, or criticisms, and Rio de Janeiro is no exception. Separately or collectively, a variety of issues might pose risks to the health, safety, and general well-being of athletes and their families, team personnel, and spectators participating in or attending the 2016 Games. Chief among these are the Zika virus, public safety threats, security concerns, and environmental conditions. This report also discusses the possible implications of hosting the Olympics for Brazil and the issue of doping. Each candidate city for the 2016 Games was required to address 14 themes in its bid—such as environment and meteorology, finance, security, medical services, and doping control. However, in 2009 no one could have foreseen the outbreak of the mosquito-borne Zika virus in 2016. The U.S. Olympic Committee (USOC) has stated publicly that the decision to participate in the 2016 Games is up to each member of the U.S. Olympic team, which will include approximately 550 athletes. In March 2016, the USOC announced that it had recently established an Infectious Disease Advisory Group consisting of three physicians who are infectious disease experts and who have experience managing \"infectious disease in patient populations that frequently travel internationally.\" The advisory group is to assist the USOC by establishing best practices for \"the mitigation, assessment and management of infectious disease.... \" Other steps taken, or planned, by the USOC include making information available to athletes and the public via the Internet and providing Team USA athletes with mosquito netting, bug repellent, and informational materials. The Rio 2016 Organising Committee for the Olympic Games described, in the candidature file it submitted to the IOC, the exiting health care resources that could be used in support of the Games and committed to providing a series of Games-specific health services. However, shortages of health care workers and supplies might compromise the medical services available. Public safety is also a key concern, given the prevalence of criminal activity in and around Rio de Janeiro. More recently, as reported by the Wall Street Journal, criminals stole a truck loaded with broadcasting equipment for the Games, and athletes training in Rio de Janeiro have been robbed on the street. Although it does not mention the Olympics specifically, the State Department's information page for travelers to Brazil cautions that the city of Rio de Janeiro continues to \"experience high incidences of crime, including armed robberies.... Tourists are particularly vulnerable to street thefts and robberies in the evening and at night especially in areas adjacent to major tourist attractions.\" However, U.S. Olympic Committee (USOC) officials reportedly have stated that \"the athletes' and competition venues would be 'the safest place in the world'\" and U.S. \"'athletes will be among the safest people in Rio, just because of all the security there's going to be.'\" The September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in the United States and recent attacks in Belgium, France, and the United States have heightened concerns that the Olympics could be targeted by terrorists. As reported by the Washington Post, Brazil is revising its security plans for the Games in the wake of the incident in Nice, France, in July 2016. On the other hand, the Wall Street Journal reported that a contract for providing screeners who will staff security checkpoints was not awarded until July 1, 2016, and the company awarded the contract is \"a small employment outsourcing firm.\" Hosting the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games may have implications for Brazil that extend beyond the actual events. Although the Brazilian government viewed hosting the Olympics as an opportunity to showcase the country's progress, its international stature has generally declined in recent years and Olympics-related problems that have emerged, or may emerge, could adversely affect the country's standing. For example, as countries' Olympic teams began moving into the Olympic Village in July, they discovered a variety of infrastructure problems. At least one country's delegation chose to stay in a hotel while the plumbing, electricity, and gas problems were fixed. Additionally, the backdrop to the Olympics is a country beset by political and economic issues. Although a host country may anticipate that being selected to stage the Games will enhance its standing in the world, serve as a catalyst for ameliorating (for example) environmental issues, or prompt economic development, hosting the Games may fall short of the Rio 2016 Organising Committee for the Olympic Games' (Rio Organising Committee or Rio2016™) goals or exacerbate existing problems or issues. If Brazil's efforts are successful, the country may regain some of the prestige it may have lost in recent years, and, turning to politics, a successful Games might improve the standing of the interim president. While the city of Rio de Janeiro may benefit from infrastructure improvements, it is unclear how hosting the Games might affect the country (including the city and state of Rio de Janeiro) financially. Of particular to concern to athletes who compete in open water events, such as sailing and rowing, is the quality of the water where those events will take place. Although the Rio 2016 Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (Rio Organising Committee or Rio2016™) had committed, for example, to ensuring to improve the quality of the water at the venue for canoeing, kayaking, and rowing events, the efforts apparently have fallen short. As reported by ESPN.com in early 2016, a USOC memorandum on water quality read, in part, that \"The IOC and Rio Organizing Committee recognize that the water quality in and around Rio is for the most part not at an acceptable level and there [are] significant fluctuations in the bacterial and viral contaminants at the competition venues.\" Precautions taken by the U.S. rowing team include wearing a training suit that has anti-microbial properties. Doping, which is a perennial concern, has taken on added importance in the year leading up to the Rio Games because of revelations regarding Russia's national governing body (NGB) for track and field. Publication of a World Anti-Doping Agency-commissioned report in November 2015 revealed that individuals and sports organizations in Russia had engaged in an orchestrated doping scheme involving track and field athletes. A second WADA report, released in July 2016, documents Russian doping practices during the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics and a multi-year doping methodology that involved the Russian Ministry of Sport. While the relevant international organizations, such as the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), denounced the doping schemes and practices and used their respective authorities to sanction individuals and organizations involved, lingering questions remain regarding, in particular, other Russian Olympic athletes and teams.  In late 2015, health officials in Brazil saw a spike in the number of infants born with microcephaly, a birth defect that may accompany significant, permanent brain damage. The increase in microcephaly was later linked to prenatal infection with the Zika virus, which appears to have arrived in Brazil early in 2015. Between October 2015 and July 2016, more than 1,600 cases of Zika-related microcephaly and other congenital malformations of the central nervous system have been reported among newborns in Brazil. Zika virus is transmitted through the bite of an infected mosquito, or through sexual transmission or blood transfusion from an infected person. No vaccine or specific treatment is available. Most Zika infections are mild. However, rare but serious neurologic disorders may occur in anyone who is infected, and the risk of fetal abnormalities among infected pregnant women may be as high as 13%. Some have voiced concerns that the travel of thousands of tourists and athletes to the Olympic and Paralympic Games and back to their homes could enhance the regional and global spread of the Zika virus. For some time, Brazilian officials have sought to assuage these concerns by noting that the Games will take place during the dry winter season in Brazil, when fewer mosquitoes are present, and that the venues and hotel areas will be regularly fumigated. However, in May 2016, 150 health experts and bioethicists wrote an open letter to WHO Director-General Dr. Margaret Chan urging her to recommend postponing or relocating the Games. The letter cites uncertainties surrounding the emergence of the Zika virus in the Americas, and the severity of the neurologic injuries Zika infection can cause. The letter also states that a long-standing partnership between WHO and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) presents a conflict of interest that compromises WHO's ability to render a neutral opinion on public health in this situation. The World Health Organization (WHO) reaffirmed its support of the Games in June 2016, following the third meeting of a WHO Emergency Committee convened to study the Zika outbreak and the means to contain it. As it had before, the WHO committee determined that \"... there is a very low risk of further international spread of Zika virus as a result of the Olympic and Paralympic Games...,\" and it did not recommend postponing, cancelling, or relocating the Games. In July 2016, researchers at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and their collaborators published a model of the contribution of the Olympics to the international spread of the Zika virus. The model found this contribution to be negligible except for four countries—Chad, Djibouti, Eritrea, and Yemen—that do not otherwise have substantial travel to any country with local Zika virus transmission. The CDC publishes health recommendations for U.S. travelers to other countries. For the Zika outbreak, the CDC has not advised against all travel to Brazil (or other areas with active Zika transmission). It has advised against travel by pregnant women (discussed further below), and advises other travelers to use special precautions while in Brazil and upon return. These precautions include avoiding being bitten by mosquitoes, and practicing \"safe sex\" while on travel and for specified periods of time upon return. The USOC refers members of the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic delegations to CDC guidelines on travel to Brazil. In addition, the USOC says that delegation members who plan to attend the games will be provided with air-conditioned rooms, repellant spray, protective clothing, and a six-month supply of condoms to help them adhere to CDC guidelines. The USOC formed a voluntary advisory group of three infectious disease physicians to advise the committee and individual members of the U.S. delegation on preventing Zika infection. As of early July 2016, several athletes, mostly men, have announced their decisions to forgo the 2016 Games due to concerns about Zika infection. Their concerns have included the safety of a pregnant wife, possible risks for future childbearing, and possible risks to their own health. As the Zika outbreak spreads across South and Central America and the Caribbean, public health officials have focused on protecting pregnant women from infection. Ongoing research shows persistence of the virus in semen of men who have recovered from infection, even when the infection was mild enough to go unnoticed. Based on this, the CDC has made specific recommendations involving travel to Zika-affected areas in order to protect women—and their current or future pregnancies—from sexual transmission of Zika infection. Recommendations involving the Olympic and Paralympic Games are shown in the text box. In light of these complicated recommendations, Olympic and Paralympic athletes, delegation members, athletes' families, and spectators are advised to consider—in addition to their own health status and the risk of Zika infection—the risk of transmitting an infection to a woman who is currently pregnant or who plans to conceive in the future. Brazil offers free health care for its citizens and visitors. Health care services are expected to be provided through \"a comprehensive network of Games hospitals and related health care facilities, including an upgraded World Anti-Doping Agency-accredited laboratory in Rio.\" In addition to the pre-existing health infrastructure, Brazil committed to establishing \"a number of Games-specific services, including designated Games Family hospitals, a comprehensive Polyclinic within the Olympic and Paralympic Village, on-site medical response teams at all Games venues, and a network of medical stations supported by roving first aid teams.\" Brazil has 27 hospitals within 15 miles of the Olympic Village that hold nearly 5,000 beds, and, each of the four cities that will host soccer matches, in addition to Rio de Janeiro, has its own hospital. Nine of the hospitals may be designated as Olympic and Paralympic Reference Hospitals. Rio de Janeiro also maintains a network of emergency services, which is resourced by the Emergency Rescue Group (GSE; a component of the Rio Fire Corps), the Urgent Mobile Attention Service (SAMU), and 1,500 health care professionals. Long waiting times, health worker shortages (particularly specialists), and deficits of key health commodities are a growing concern in some public sector health facilities. A growing proportion of Brazilians are opting to purchase private health insurance to supplement the free public health care. Visitors can purchase travel insurance or purchase a temporary form of private health insurance for health coverage in the local private sector. Despite concerns about health worker shortages, Brazil has committed to ensure that an on-site medical response team will be in place at all Olympic and Paralympic venues to provide first response and medical transfer; at least two ambulance units will be stationed at each competition venue, as well as in many non-competition venues including the Olympic and Paralympic Village, training sites, and the Games Family hotels; well-equipped disaster response teams are trained to respond to a range of possible emergencies, including dangerous weather conditions, multiple casualty situations, and incidents involving biological, chemical, or radiological hazards; and each Games venue will have its own mass casualty response plan with a pre-deployed, fully equipped mass casualty response team remaining on standby. The Brazilian Minister of Health has indicated that \"Rio de Janeiro is prepared to host the Olympic and Paralympic Games. Everything that was promised to host the Games will be fulfilled and on time.\" The International Olympic Committee also indicated that \"Rio 2016 is ready to welcome the world.\" Despite these assurances, in January 2016, some state hospitals reportedly ran out of money to pay for medicines, equipment, and salaries. Another press report indicated that on July 7, 2016, two medical associations reported insufficient space at a state hospital and inadequate training for healthcare personnel responsible for visitors of the Games. Securing the venues, the athletes' village, and tourist locations against an act of terrorism in a city hosting the Olympic Games is a significant undertaking. The host country, with the assistance of international security partners, plans for a long time to ensure that all participants or visitors to the Games can have a safe and enjoyable experience. One type of activity that has caused significant disruption to prior Games is an act of terrorism. Planning for such a terrorist incident during the Olympic Games, while occurring infrequently, requires a great deal of host nation and international support. Safety is also a concern as criminal activity directed at the athletes and visitors could have negative implications for the Games and the Brazilian economy and tourism. According to the State Department, \"crime is the principal threat to visitors in Brazil.\" When the country hosted the 2014 World Cup, thieves engaged in opportunistic street crime, targeting tourists near stadiums, on public transportation, and in other gathering locations. Commonly stolen items included wallets, purses, phones, and other valuables. While thefts were usually non-violent, more serious crimes were also reported, including sexual assault, armed robbery, and express kidnapping. Rio de Janeiro has experienced significant improvements in security conditions over the past decade. The city's homicide rate, for example, fell from 32.4 per 100,000 residents in 2003 to 18.5 per 100,000 in 2015 (a rate similar to that of Miami). Conditions appear to have deteriorated somewhat in 2016, however, with Rio de Janeiro state reporting a 13.6% increase in homicides and a 27.3% increase in street robbery during the first five months of the year. The U.S. State Department asserts that while crime can happen at any place or time within Rio de Janeiro, \"tourists are particularly vulnerable to street thefts and robberies in the evening and at night especially in areas adjacent to major tourist attractions.\" Several Olympic and Paralympic athletes training or participating in test events in Rio de Janeiro reportedly have been robbed at gunpoint. Some analysts have linked the recent increase in crime and violence to the Rio de Janeiro state government's decision to reduce the police budget by a third as a result of financial shortfalls. The state government declared a state of \"public calamity\" on June 17, warning that the state's deteriorating financial situation could lead to a total collapse of public security and other services. Brazil's national government responded to the declaration by transferring $885 million (R$2.9 billion) to the state government, largely to fund security efforts. Although public security is primarily the responsibility of Brazil's states, the national government will be in charge of ensuring security around the Olympic Games. The security presence is expected to comprise 85,000 personnel, including 41,000 military troops; this is roughly twice as many personnel as were deployed for the London Games in 2012. Some 67,000 security personnel will be based in Rio de Janeiro while 18,000 will be deployed to the other five cities hosting Olympic soccer games. In addition to providing security at Olympic venues, Brazilian security forces reportedly will patrol airports, major roadways, public transportation lines, and tourist zones. An act of terrorism occurring at the Olympic Games has long been a concern to international security officials and the nation hosting the event. An act of terrorism can be perpetrated by an international group attempting to call attention to its cause and using the act to leverage a specific action, or a domestic group demonstrating its unhappiness with a nation's policies. Concerns relating to acts of terrorism significantly increased after the 1972 Olympics in Munich, Germany, when members of the Palestinian Black September Organization attacked the Olympic village and in the process of a hostage standoff and attempted getaway, killed 11 members of the Israeli Olympic team. The group desired to bring attention to Palestinian and Israeli issues and also demanded the release of more than 200 Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails. Another confirmed terrorist attack occurred during the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia, whereby an individual detonated a backpack full of material killing two and wounding more than 100. This individual undertook this act of domestic terrorism to protest the nation's abortion laws. Other acts of violence or threats of violence have occurred prior to, leading up to, and during other Olympic Games. Some of these acts or threats have been categorized as possibly having terrorism-related motivations. Due to previous terrorist attacks at Olympic Games and post-9/11 concerns associated with possible vulnerabilities associated with large gatherings of individuals, security officials are closely monitoring potential threats to the 2016 Games. In April 2016, Brazil's Director of Counterterrorism, Brazilian Intelligence Agency, Luiz Alberto Sallaberry, was reported as noting that the threat of terrorism had increased in recent months due to attacks in other countries and a rise in what he described as the number of Brazilian nationals suspected of sympathizing with Islamic State militants. The statement from Director Sallaberry was apparently in response to information relating to a Tweet from November 2015 by a suspected ISIS executioner, French nationalist Maxime Hauchard, that stated, \"Brazil, you are our next target.\" This warning comes approximately a year after a Brazilian newspaper reported that, \"Brazilian intelligence agencies are gearing up to monitor young people, especially men, who may be enticed by online ISIS propaganda to stage 'lone wolf' attacks.\" More recently, on July 21, 2016, Brazilian police arrested 10 Brazilian nationals suspected of planning a terrorist attack on the Games. Given the history of threats directed at the Olympic Games and the specific threats directed at Rio in the past year, many security observers anticipate activities to safeguard these games will be significant. Securing Olympic venues, athletes, and visitors to the Games and the surrounding area takes a great deal of effort and planning. Brazil planned to devote \"approximately 85,000 professionals... to guarantee security in the biggest sporting event ever held in South America.\" In August 2015, the Brazilian government noted that, \"[C]urrent investments totaling R$750 million ($220.98 million), to which about R$220.98 million ($88.39 million) in equipment and infrastructure improvements for troops should still be added by 2016.\" These resources were expected to be devoted to investing in security-related items, including mobile police stations, mobile command and control centers, Elevated Observation Platforms, aerial imagers for helicopter monitoring, and an Integrated Command Center. In the event a security incident does arise that is the cause of significant concerns and the host government is perceived as incapable of safeguarding visitors to the Games, the United States may be of assistance to its citizens located in Rio de Janeiro. Whether the result of criminal- or terrorism-related concerns, U.S. citizens who find themselves in harm's way have a number of options to seek support from the federal government. The Department of State (DOS) is required by law to provide a range of threat-related services to Americans abroad. In all but the most extreme situations, the department will serve primarily in an information-distribution role. However, if the departure of U.S. citizens is advised, additional assistance may be provided. The Department of State is required by law to serve as a clearinghouse of information on any major disaster or incident abroad which affects the health and safety of U.S. citizens abroad. The department carries out this function through the Consular Information Program, which provides a range of products, including Country Spe cific Information, Travel Alerts, Travel Warnings, Worldwide Cautions, Messages for U.S. Citizens, Security Messages for U.S. Citizens, Emergency Messages for U.S. Citizens, and Fact Sheets. These messages are posted online at https://travel.state.gov. The Secretary of State is also required to provide for the safe and efficient evacuation of private U.S. citizens when their lives may be endangered, per 22 U.S.C. §4802. In practice, even when the department advises U.S. citizens to leave a country, DOS will advise citizens to evacuate using existing commercial transportation options whenever possible. In more rare circumstances, when the local transportation infrastructure is compromised, DOS may arrange chartered or non-commercial transportation for U.S. citizens to evacuate to a nearby safe location determined by the department. Given the challenges associated with in-country transportation during crises, the department typically requires citizens to make their own way to the departure point. On arrival at a safe location, evacuees are then typically required to make their own onward travel arrangements. Involvement of the U.S. military in any evacuation of U.S. citizens is a last resort, as most evacuations are able to rely on commercial means and local infrastructure. When those elements are not available, DOS and Defense Department coordination is addressed through a standing Memorandum of Agreement that addresses the roles and responsibilities of each agency. In 1999, the IOC adopted a two-phase procedure for awarding an Olympic Games to a city. The first phase is the \"Candidature Acceptance Procedure,\" during which applicant cities are required to address several potential concerns of hosting the games, including \"environmental conditions and impact.\" They must provide the following: an assessment of current environmental conditions in the city; details of ongoing environmental projects and their organization; an assessment of the environmental impact of staging the Games in that city or region; and information regarding any environmental impact studies carried out on proposed venues and if legislation requires such studies. Responses are assessed by the IOC Candidature Acceptance Working Group in its report to the IOC Executive Board. Thus, environmental conditions, actions, and impact are a consideration in the decision as to which cities become \"candidate cities.\" During the second phase of consideration, a candidate city must prepare a \"Candidature File\" that provides details on environmental and other issues. More details are requested, including air quality, protected areas, public authorities' roles and responsibilities, environmental impact assessments, construction work, work with non-governmental organizations (NGOs), integration of environmental approaches into contracts with suppliers and sponsors, and estimates of Games-time rainfall, wind, temperatures, and humidity levels. This information is considered by the IOC to be a central element in developing a \"Green Games,\" as all commitments regarding actions, programs, and policies are binding and should be carried out and implemented by the Organising Committee. After an Olympic Games is awarded to a city, the host city Organising Committee integrates environmental issues into its planning, logistics, and operations in accordance with commitments made in the Candidature File. It also must work with government authorities and other stakeholders to implement the city-wide and nationwide policy and program developments and actions in the bid in order for a city to fulfill its Host City contract obligations. In addition to external scrutiny by NGOs and the media, the IOC and the Organising Committee monitor progress and implementation of the proposed environmental and sustainability actions and policies to ensure fulfillment of commitments. In preparing its Candidature File, the Rio de Janeiro bid committee developed an agenda for the 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games structured around nine environmental issues. 1. Water treatment and conservation 2. Environmental awareness 3. Use and management of renewable energy 4. Games neutral in carbon, air quality, and transport 5. Protection of soils and ecosystems 6. Sustainable design and construction 7. Reforestation, biodiversity, and culture 8. Shopping and ecological certification 9. Solid waste management. Thus, by 2009, when the Rio Olympics Organising Committee was awarded the 2016 Summer Games, it had made a number of pledges about ensuring that the Games would be environmentally safe and sustainable. The Organising Committee also pledged to prepare a subsequent Sustainability Management Plan expanding on the nine thematic issues identified in the Candidature File and identifying responsible entities. The Sustainability Management Plan identified three overarching strategic objectives, one of which—\"Planet\"—was intended to reduce the environmental impact of projects related to the 2016 Games, leaving a smaller environmental footprint from the preparations and operations of the event. This portion of the plan identified specific objectives for transportation (including expanding the subway system to provide public transport for spectators and workers, using cleaner fuels for buses, and implementing actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in public transportation systems). It also addressed construction (pledging to minimize environmental impacts in the design and construction of facilities, and making large-scale urban redevelopment and improvements around stadium and other sport venue sites). The plan also identified objectives for waste management based on a hierarchy of approaches: avoidance, reducing, reuse, recycling, composting, energy recovery techniques, waste treatment, and conventional incineration. In 2007, among the 92 municipalities in the state of Rio de Janeiro, 76 discarded their waste in uncontrolled dumpsites. According to a state report, a total of 13,738 tons of garbage was produced daily by more than 15 million inhabitants of those municipalities. Less than 1% of the waste was recycled, while 41% was disposed in dumpsites, and 45% went to controlled sanitary landfills. The waste management objectives in the 2013 Sustainability Plan and existing Brazilian policy called \"Dumpsite Zero\" mandated shutting down by 2014 all large untreated dumpsites in Brazil, which were then receiving more than one-third of the country's waste, and replacing them with sanitary landfills. Finally, the Sustainability Management Plan addressed a fourth set of objectives related to environmental conservation and cleanup. These objectives included projects to minimize impacts on existing ecosystems at Games venues and to accelerate forest reforestation activities. Available information on the extent to which these objectives have been met is summarized below. One focus of the environmental conservation and cleanup objectives was improving the quality of waters that would be sites for sailing, rowing, triathlon, and marathon swimming during the 2016 Games. The plan for the Games calls for sailing, rowing, and other outdoor water events to take place at three locations located in the southeast portion of Rio de Janeiro—Marina da Gloria and Guanabara Bay, Rodrigo de Freitas lagoon, and Fort Copacabana beach, collectively referred to as the Copacabana Zone (see Figure 3 ). Even before the Games were awarded to Rio de Janeiro, concern had been widely expressed about these locations, which are highly polluted with untreated sewage and household and industrial wastes. This concern led to fear that high levels of water pollution could harm the health of tourists and athletes, in addition to impacting the competitions themselves. In 2007, the city of Rio de Janeiro treated only 21% of its wastewater to secondary treatment levels, 44% received primary treatment, and nearly 35% was discharged into open waters with no treatment. Untreated sewage is typically discharged directly into Guanabara Bay and other waters where sailing, windsurfing, rowing, and similar events will occur. Exposure to pollutants in untreated sewage can lead to acute illness such as diarrhea, gastroenteritis (\"stomach flu\"), fever, Hepatitis A, and typhoid fever. Facilities that could provide better treatment exist in some parts of the city, but are effectively unavailable due to lack of collector sewers to transport waste to treatment plants. Monitoring of waters in the Copacabana Zone that was done by Rio2016™ during the 2007-2012 period identified levels of pollutants—enterococci and fecal coliform bacteria, as well as nutrients—that exceeded Brazilian public health standards. Concern was raised about pollution at all of the water venue sites but especially about Guanabara Bay, where sailing events will take place, as described in a 2014 report prepared for the Rio Organising Committee. Despite the cyclic renewal of its waters to the sea, which makes it waters saline, the bay is the receptor of a significant watershed, which receives a wide range of liquid and solid discharges. Among the potential pollution sources included are: sewage, various types of industries, marine terminals for oil products, two commercial ports, several shipyards, and two oil refineries, among other economic activities. Population growth and industrial development brought, in addition to pollution, environmental physical issues, such as the destruction of peripheral ecosystems of the Bay, and the embankment of its water surface. It also brought uncontrolled land use and its adverse effects in terms of siltation, bottom sedimentation, flooding, and landslides. Simultaneously, public health problems have characterized the basin region of Guanabara Bay, reflecting the inadequate management of wastewater and solid waste in the region during the expansion of the Metropolitan Region. Throughout this time, the implementation of infrastructure services, such as sanitation and drainage did not follow population growth. The report concluded, \"If this situation is not reversed in time for the Olympics, it will represent a potential health hazard to the athletes and tourists.\" The 2013 Sustainability Management Plan called for accelerating planned improvements to sanitary facilities in the Rio metropolitan area, including a pledge that by the start of the 2016 Games, through projects to be undertaken by the municipal and state governments, collector sewer infrastructure would be constructed throughout the city and 80% of sewage would be treated to at least secondary treatment levels. Although the 2013 Sustainability Management Plan stated that updates would be provided during the seven-year life of the Rio Olympics project (from winning the bid in 2009 to dissolution after the Games in late 2016), only one update has been issued. Called \"Embracing Change,\" it was released in September 2014. It describes activities and progress made in the 2012-2013 period, especially refinement of sustainability strategies contained in the 2013 Plan on topics such as carbon management—Rio2016 TM had a target of reducing Rio de Janeiro's total carbon emissions by 18.2% below 2011 levels by 2016; minimizing ecosystem impacts—through design and avoidance; and waste management. On the latter issue, this report noted that all open dumpsites in Rio de Janeiro were closed in 2012, and that the process for their environmental restoration had begun. By late 2013, 3.7% of potentially recyclable waste was being diverted to recycling centers, while the city's target was to recycle 25% of wastes by 2016. Regarding water quality, the 2014 report said that the percentage of sewage receiving at least some level of treatment had increased to 50% in 2013. Progress toward water quality cleanup plans—or lack of progress—has continued to receive widespread public attention. Watchdog groups say, for example, that official statistics on the percentage of city sewage that is treated assume that all sewage treatment facilities are functioning, an assumption that they believe is not correct. Since 2014, official estimates of the percentage of the city's sewage that will be receiving treatment by the start of the 2016 Games have dropped—from 80% receiving secondary treatment in the 2009 bid for the Games, to 50% receiving some treatment early in 2014, to 30% in early 2016. Some officials now estimate that it could take five to six more years to attain the 80% target, although Rio de Janeiro's Governor Luiz Fernando Pezao said in October 2015 that Guanabara Bay will not be cleaned up until 2035. Approximately 1,700 athletes are expected to participate in events at the Copacabana Zone sites. Throughout 2015, many U.S. and other countries' athletes visited Rio de Janeiro to train and familiarize themselves with conditions and facilities. Athletes reported seeing massive amounts of large debris in Guanabara Bay and other waters—including mattresses, cars, washing machines, trees, tables, televisions, couches, and chairs, as well as dead animals. The Rio de Janeiro state government pledged to install eco-barriers, to catch refuse flowing down rivers, and to employ \"eco-boats\" that sweep the bay picking up garbage to avoid disrupting competitions during the Games. In addition to waste that athletes could see in the water came reports of pollutant contamination. Some athletes reportedly got sick at training and test events in 2015, but none of the cases was definitively connected to the water, as opposed to food or another source. In July 2015, the Associated Press (AP) released findings of a five-month investigation and analysis of water quality at sites where Olympics and Paralympics competitions will be held. The AP investigation tested for rotavirus, which is the most common cause of gastroenteritis, as well as three different strains of adenoviruses, each of which acts as a signpost for human waste in waterbodies. AP said that its tests, which were the first independent comprehensive testing at the Olympic sites, revealed \"dangerously high levels of viruses and bacteria\" above Brazilian or World Health Organization standards. The AP's focus on viruses complicated controversies and publicity that followed release of the report, because neither Brazil nor the WHO (nor the United States) has adopted water quality standards that establish safe levels for viruses in recreational or other waters. Brazilian, WHO, and U.S. standards and water quality criteria are based on bacterial indicators of fecal contamination (enterococci and E. coli ). Although enteric viruses are currently tested in some places as water quality indicators, and some water experts believe that governments should adopt viral as well as bacterial testing to determine whether recreational waters are safe, most scientists believe that testing for viruses has yet to be successfully implemented in routine monitoring of water quality. In response to the AP report, Rio2016™ and IOC officials said that the health and welfare of athletes is always a top priority and that bacterial testing has shown that water quality meets relevant international standards. As noted, there are no international standards for the viral indicators that were included in the AP's analyses. The IOC said that it had no plans to conduct its own water quality tests. The WHO, which acts in an advisory role to the IOC, took several different positions on whether or not viral testing should be carried out, ultimately stating in October 2015 that it did not feel that Olympic officials needed to conduct routine viral testing. The WHO statement added that it was not \"unconcerned with viral pathogens in water\" and that water quality and monitoring would continue to be discussed in relation to the 2016 Games. Swimming's governing body, Fédération Internationale de Natation (FINA), called for virus testing in September 2015, and sailing's world governing body, the International Sailing Federation (ISAF), also said that it could support viral testing. Athletes who might be exposed to contaminated water during the Games have offered mixed responses. Some said that they are concerned about even brief exposure to waters of Guanabara Bay; some sailors said that they will adopt protocols such as getting multiple vaccinations and washing themselves with bleach after competing. Others have said that they believe the issue has been overblown and that athletes typically face potential health risks in many places where they compete. USOC officials and organizations that represent athletes have said that individual athletes can choose whether or not to participate in the Games if they are concerned about these issues. Finally, press reports in April 2016 said that Brazilian federal police are investigating Rio de Janeiro's state utility, Companhia Estadual de Águas e Esgotos (CEDAE), for allegations of fraud at its sewage treatment plants around Guanabara Bay. The police investigations were said to be part of a year-long probe that is targeting the water and sewage utility for pollution from treatment plants and possibly charging for services that it is not adequately providing, which, if proven, would constitute fraud. The benefits of hosting an Olympics Games often include acceleration of a wide range of existing plans, projects, investments, and activities. Rio de Janeiro's expectations in this regard are evident in the 2013 Sustainability Management Plan and other documents that discuss using the opportunity of the Games to benefit the city by improving environmental conditions and practices and incorporating sustainability policies and ethic into the city's future. Most analysts see the biggest gains from hosting an Olympics to be urban upgrades that otherwise would occur over a longer term, if at all. Some believe that it is an obligation of an Olympics hosting city to improve its environmental conditions. It is also believed that countries' hosting bids are greatly bolstered when they include major \"green\" or sustainability pledges. However, once the event is awarded, there are few, if any, consequences for countries if they do not follow through—despite the IOC's statements that commitments are binding. Some observers expect that the environmental legacy of Rio2016™ may be viewed as having positive and negative implications for Brazil, such as public transportation and at least partially improved sewage treatment on the positive side, but other outcomes that are less clear. When the 2016 Summer Games were awarded in 2009, some feared that development pressures associated with the construction would harm nearby natural environments such as the biologically rich Atlantic Forest and Coastal regions and increase the city's population, especially by expanding favelas, urban slums where nearly one-quarter of its inhabitants live. Reportedly, well-financed efforts to clean up Rio de Janeiro's waters have proved disappointing for decades, undercut by mismanagement and allegations of corruption. All Olympic Games have glitches and receive skeptical press ahead of time, and the 2016 Games are no exception. In the weeks immediately ahead of the start of the Games, activist organizations that have been tracking developments say that some promised objectives are succeeding—for example, urban renewal and public transport—but that environmental and sanitation goals will be missed. They report that the promise to plant 24 million trees has been abandoned, and projects needed to mitigate untreated sewage discharges—one of the highest pre-Games priorities—are incomplete; overall, none of the major environmental projects linked to the Olympics will be completed before the Games. Once the deadline of the start of the 2016 Games has passed, international pressure to finish those projects is likely to disappear. For now, the environmental legacy of the 2016 Games for Rio de Janeiro remains to be determined. In 2009, when the International Olympic Committee (IOC) announced that Brazil would host the 2016 Summer Games, then-President of Brazil Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva hailed the decision as recognition of Brazil's arrival as a \"first-class country,\" stating, \"Today we received the respect that people are already starting to show to Brazil.\" As the fifth-largest and fifth most populous country in the world, Brazil has long sought recognition as a global power, and at the time it was awarded the Olympics, it appeared to be on the verge of finally realizing its ambitions. During the previous decade, a boom in global commodity prices fueled a period of rapid economic growth that—combined with the Lula Administration's social policies—significantly reduced poverty and inequality and lifted 36 million Brazilians into the middle class. Brazil's international stature grew along with its economy as the Brazilian government used increased revenues to expand its diplomatic presence and leveraged its economic clout to assert Brazilian influence on global matters ranging from trade to climate change. Like President Lula, many international observers viewed Brazil's successful bids for the 2016 Olympics and the 2014 World Cup as a confirmation of the country's rise. Brazil's international image has been battered in recent years, however, as the country has struggled to address deepening economic and political crises. Economic growth began to slow as commodity prices declined. President Dilma Rousseff's economic policies exacerbated the situation, contributing to rising inflation and fiscal deficits and declining consumer and investor confidence. Brazil's economy contracted by 3.8% in 2015 and is projected to contract by 3.3% this year. Some of the Brazilians who joined the middle class during the boom years have fallen back into poverty as unemployment has risen to 11.2%. At the same time, a sprawling corruption investigation involving the diversion of public sector funds to political campaigns and politicians has implicated prominent business leaders and much of the political class. The Brazilian Congress has sought to channel the resulting citizen discontent into an effort to impeach President Rousseff, ostensibly for violations of the country's fiscal responsibility law; Rousseff is currently suspended from office in order to stand trial. While some Brazilians and international observers view Rousseff's impeachment as a necessary first step to address the economic and political crises, others view it as an illegitimate attempt to remove a left-leaning president and install a more conservative administration that will protect Brazilian legislators from the ongoing corruption probe. These economic and political setbacks have damaged the country's reputation as a successful and socially inclusive democracy and weakened its international influence. The 2016 Olympics will place a spotlight on Brazil, drawing renewed international attention to the country's potential as well as its challenges. The new Brazilian administration led by Interim President Michel Temer views the Summer Games as an opportunity to demonstrate the country's credibility on the international stage. If Brazil is able to host a successful Olympics despite the country's recent setbacks, it may be able to regain some of the prestige it may have lost in recent years. Alternatively, failures to complete construction on facilities and infrastructure, properly plan for logistics, or take appropriate precautions to protect the security and health of the athletes and fans attending the Games would likely further erode the country's international image. The Olympics also could have political implications for Interim President Temer and the politicians governing the city of Rio de Janeiro and Rio de Janeiro state. Temer is expected to carry out official host duties during the Games as the acting head of state, and while domestic support for his administration likely will depend on its ability to resolve the country's economic and political crises, the Olympics could improve domestic and international perceptions of Temer's legitimacy and strengthen his hold on the presidency. On the other hand, any problems that emerge would likely be blamed on Temer and his political party, which controls the city and state governments of Rio de Janeiro. Investments related to the 2016 Olympics are expected to total at least $11.9 billion (R$39.1 billion), using current exchange rates. This includes nearly $2.2 billion (R$7.1 billion) for Olympic venues, $2.3 billion (R$7.4 billion) for the Rio 2016 Organising Committee for the Olympic Games, and $7.5 billion (R$24.6 billion) for infrastructure improvements, environmental cleanup efforts, and other so-called legacy projects. Other costs related to the Summer Games, such as additional security personnel, have yet to be determined. About 57% of the total has been financed with private resources while 22% has been financed by the state government, 12% by the local government, and 9% by the national government. Many Brazilians view public expenditures on the Olympics as wasteful given the country's difficult financial situation and considerable social disparities. The Temer Administration is currently considering cuts to Brazil's pension system and other social services as part of its efforts to reduce the national government's ballooning budget deficit. Likewise, Rio de Janeiro state, which has already cut expenditures steeply, declared a state of \"public calamity\" on June 17, warning that the government's lack of finances could \"lead to the total collapse of public security, health, education, mobility and environmental management.\" Reports that some Olympic funds were siphoned off by corruption have further bolstered critics of the Games. Economic analysts assert that the Summer Games may deliver a temporary boost in tax revenues for Rio de Janeiro's local government but are unlikely to have much of an impact on the broader Brazilian economy. According to Moody's Investors Service, \"the key benefit of the 2016 Olympics for the city of Rio will be lasting transport infrastructure improvements\" that will reduce traffic congestion and potentially lower business costs. The impact and sustainability of those infrastructure projects remains to be seen, however, as efforts to improve Rio de Janeiro's sewage system appear to have done little to clean up the city's polluted waterways and a bike path that was constructed as a legacy project of the Games recently collapsed. Some observers have also called into question the value of the infrastructure improvements, asserting that the funds could have been better invested in upgrading the overburdened infrastructure that Rio de Janeiro residents use on a daily basis. Moreover, human rights advocates maintain that more than 4,100 families have been displaced in Rio de Janeiro as a result of projects associated with hosting the Olympics and World Cup. According to a July 2016 poll, 63% of Brazilians think the Olympics will bring more costs than benefits for the nation's citizens. In the run-up to the 2016 Rio Games, American athletes, as well as athletes from other nations, expressed concerns about doping and whether the organizations charged with protecting clean athletes were up to the task. Prompting this surge of concern were revelations that the Russian track and field team engaged in a doping scheme orchestrated by the Russian Athletic Federation (RusAF; Russia's national governing body [NGB] for track and field) and the perception, if not reality, that the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) was slow to respond when first made aware of the allegations in 2010, as reported by both the New York Times and the television show 60 Minutes. The New York Times reported there had been \"[m]ultiple warnings about Russia\" and doping over the years and suggested that possible conflicts of interest might have played a role in WADA's initially tepid response. Concerns that other Russian sports might be similarly tainted by state-orchestrated doping were validated in July 2016 with the publication of another WADA-initiated report that described, among other things, how Russian sports organizations and authorities tampered with Russian athletes' samples during the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia. Although the U.S. government is not directly involved in WADA or its anti-doping efforts, it does provide support to the agency. As a signatory to the Copenhagen Declaration on Anti-Doping in Sport, the United States is committed to supporting WADA and the World Anti-Doping Code ( Code ), which includes providing financial support through membership dues. Beginning with a payment in 2003 and through 2016, the United States has paid approximately $25 million to WADA. The allegations involving Russia and WADA's anti-doping role have drawn the attention of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. In a June 20, 2016, letter addressed to the president of WADA, the chairman of the Senate committee noted that WADA had been made aware, in 2010, that Russian athletes were involved in a government-sanctioned doping scheme; that WADA's independence had been called into question; and that representatives of Olympic athletes had called upon WADA to expand its investigation to other sports in Russia and other countries. The House Committee on Energy and Commerce raised similar concerns in a July 12, 2016, letter to the President of the IOC while acknowledging the work that the IOC and WADA have done to enhance their efforts to ensure athletes compete in doping-free sports. One of the challenges identified by the committee is that \"neither [WADA nor the IOC] is functionally organized to achieve [the goal of eradicating doping in sport].\" On December 3, 2014, a documentary aired on German television alleging \"the existence of a sophisticated and well established system of state-sponsored doping with the All-Russia Athletics Federation (ARAF).\" In the aftermath of the documentary, WADA formed an Independent Commission (IC) to investigate. The investigation, which began in January 2015, concluded with the publication of two reports, the first of which focused on the allegations presented in the German television documentary. The November 2015 report's findings are summarized as follows: 1. A \"deeply rooted culture of cheating\" exists, meaning \"the acceptance of cheating at all levels is widespread and longstanding.\" 2. The exploitation of athletes is acceptable, which has resulted in \"unethical behaviours and practices... becom[ing] the norm.\" 3. Many Russian athletes have participated in the \"consistent and systematic use of performance enhancing drugs.\" 4. Doctors, coaches, and laboratory personnel have been involved in systematic cheating. The report included two notable caveats. Although there were \"reliable indications\" that other sports in Russia had doping problems, the IC stated these sports were outside the scope of what it had been directed to investigate. The commission also stated that, \"in its considered view, Russia is not the only country, nor track and field the only sport, facing the problem of orchestrated doping in sport.\" Publication of the report in November 2015 was immediately followed by responses from the Council of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), which is the international federation (IF) for track and field, and WADA. The IAAF \"provisionally suspended the All-Russia Athletic Federation (ARAF) [RusAF] as an IAAF Member with immediate effect.\" A significant consequence of this suspension is the prohibition on RusAF athletes and support personnel from competing in international competitions, including the Olympic Games. WADA's response was to suspend provisionally the Moscow Antidoping Center; recommend that the head of the center, Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov, be permanently removed (he immediately resigned); and assess the compliance of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) with the World Anti-Doping Code. In a separate, subsequent press release, WADA announced that RUSADA was not in compliance with the Code. In June 2016, the IAAF Council met to consider whether RusAF had satisfied the reinstatement conditions. The IAAF Taskforce's report to the council stated that several verification criteria had not been met and included several recommendations, all of which were accepted by the IAAF Council. Concurring with the taskforce's recommendations, the IAAF decided that RusAF should not be reinstated, a decision that was supported by both the IOC and WADA, and that no other RusAF personnel (such as officials and athlete support personnel) be allowed to take part in international competitions or the IAAF while RusAF is suspended. In July 2016, the Russian Olympic Committee and individual Russian track and field athletes filed requests for arbitration with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) regarding the IAAF's decisions. The CAS arbitration panel ruled in favor of the IAAF, thus upholding the ban on Russia's track and field athletes. Several months after WADA released the IC's report, allegations surfaced in the media regarding a doping scheme to benefit Russian athletes during the Sochi Games. On May 19, 2016, the President of WADA announced that Professor Richard H. McLaren would lead the investigation. The key findings of Professor McLaren's report, known as the Independent Person (IP) Report and dated July 18, 2016, implicate the Moscow Anti-Doping Laboratory, the Sochi Laboratory, and Russia's Ministry of Sport in doping activities. In addition to documenting the \"urine sample swapping scheme\" that was implemented during the Sochi Games, the IP Report uncovered what it called the \"Disappearing Positive Methodology,\" which it characterized as \"a State directed method [implemented] following the very abysmal medal count\" by Russian athletes at the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics. As documented in the IP Report, the Russian Deputy Minister of Sport would review positive test results provided by the Moscow Anti-Doping Laboratory and issue an order, SAVE or QUARANTINE, to the laboratory for each result. A SAVE order meant that the laboratory was to stop the analytical process and report to WADA's Anti-Doping Administration and Management System (ADAMS) that the sample was negative. A QUARANTINE order directed the laboratory to continue processing the sample. The IP Report states that, generally, the SAVE order was used for athletes who \"tended to be medal winners or athletes of promise,\" while the QUARANTINE order was used for \"[f]oreign athletes, or Russian athletes deemed unpromising.\" The Disappearing Positive Methodology was used \"from at least late 2011 to August 2015... and affected athletes from all sport disciplines whose urine samples were being analyzed by the Moscow Laboratory.\" In the aftermath of the release of the IC Report and the IP Report, on July 24, 2016, the IOC issued conditions Russian athletes must meet to be eligible to compete in Rio de Janeiro. Chief among these is an athlete's anti-doping record, which may include \"only reliable adequate international tests.\" Additionally, the international federations, which are responsible for deciding which athletes are eligible to participate in the Olympic Games, have been advised by the IOC that an absence of positive doping test results will not be considered sufficient in establishing that an athlete has not doped. The IOC will accept a Russian athlete for participation in the Rio Games only if the relevant IF \"is satisfied that the evidence provided\" meets the IOC's conditions and the IF's determination is \"upheld by an expert from the CAS list of arbitrators.... \" Russian athletes who have been sanctioned previously for doping, or who are unable to meet the IOC's criteria, will not be allowed to compete in the 2016 Games. The consequences for the Russian Olympic Committee include an estimated 30% decrease in the size of the Russian team competing in the 2016 Games. As announced by the IOC on August 4, 2016, the Russian Olympic team numbers 271 athletes; the original entry list for the ROC included 389 athletes. The number of Russian athletes competing in Rio de Janeiro may change, however. On August 8, 2016, CBS News reported that seven Russian swimmers who had been banned initially from participating in the Rio Games are now permitted to compete although \"FINA has not fully explained why.\" Reportedly, one of the Russian swimmers participated in a 100-meter breaststroke semifinal on August 7, 2016. Russia's paralympic team has also been affected by the doping revelations. The International Paralympic Committee (IPC) opened suspension proceedings against the Russian Paralympic Committee (RPC) in late July. On August 7, 2016, the IPC announced it had suspended the RPC, effective immediately. The suspension means the Russian Paralympic Committee is not permitted to enter its athletes in the Rio 2016 Paralympic Games, which will be held September 7-18, 2016. However, the RPC may appeal the IPC's decision and has 21 days (August 28, 2016) to do so. On June 21, 2016, the IOC convened an Olympic Summit for the purpose of ensuring \"a level playing field for all athletes participating\" in the 2016 Games. Among other things, the IOC advised IFs and national Olympic committees (NOCs; e.g., U.S. Olympic Committee) to take all necessary actions to prevent \"doped athletes\" from participating in the 2016 Games, to broaden their efforts to include sanctioning any athlete support personnel who are implicated in doping, and to refrain from requesting accreditation for the Games for \"any person currently implicated in an anti-doping rule violation.\" The Olympic Summit also stated that athletes from Russia and Kenya are not entitled to the \"presumption of innocence\" because neither is in compliance with the Code and \"substantial allegations\" exist regarding these countries' sports organizations. Though it does not appear that the scope of Kenya's doping problems approaches that of Russia's, Kenya has been beset by a series of issues. In November 2015, the IAAF Ethics Commission provisionally suspended three Kenyan track and field officials; the commission extended the suspension on May 20, 2016. WADA declared, on May 12, 2016, that the Anti-Doping Agency of Kenya is not compliant with the Code. Also in 2016, a news article reported that the chief executive of Kenya's track and field association, Athletics Kenya, solicited bribes from two Kenyan athletes in return for reducing their suspensions for doping. A journalist for the New York Times summarized Kenya's problems as follows: Kenya cannot assure the world that any of its athletes is drug-free, at least based on evidence collected by its national antidoping program. World Anti-Doping Agency officials say the Kenyan antidoping agency exists in name only. The government established the agency in the past year [2015] but has yet to finance it, WADA officials recently told [the journalist]. \"There's just no political will for it, even though they've been encouraged, persuaded, cajoled by us,\" David Howman, WADA's director general, said of WADA's effort to help Kenya put antidoping measures into effect over the past two-plus years. \"It's reached a crisis point, really.\" In spring 2016, the IOC decided to re-test samples from the 2008 Beijing Games and the 2012 London Games. To date, two of the four rounds, or waves, of re-testing have taken place. Focusing on athletes who might participate in the 2016 Rio Games, 454 samples obtained during the 2008 Beijing Games were re-tested in the first round. The results indicated that 30 athletes from 6 sports and 12 countries had tested positive. The second round involved re-testing 386 samples and yielded 30 positive results, 23 of which were from athletes who were awarded a medal during the Beijing Olympics. These positive results were from four sports and eight nations. On May 27, 2016, the IOC announced that, in the first round of re-testing, analysis of 265 samples from the 2012 London Games resulted in positive tests for 23 athletes from 5 sports and 6 countries. The second round yielded 15 positive tests from a pool of 138 samples involving 2 sports and 9 countries. To summarize, the re-analysis of 1,243 samples from the Beijing and London Games in rounds one and two resulted in 98 positive tests. The implications of this situation, including the IC Report and the IP Report, extend beyond the consequences for Russian sports organizations, athletes, and officials.\n\n### Summary:", "answer": "The 2016 Olympic Games will be held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, August 5-21, 2016, and will be followed by the Paralympic Games, September 7-18, 2016. Notably, these are the first games to be hosted by a South American city. Reportedly, 10,500 athletes from 206 countries will participate in the Olympics, including 555 athletes from the United States. Most Olympic events will take place in and around Rio de Janeiro. In addition to Rio de Janeiro, soccer matches will be held in the cities of Belo Horizonte, Brasília, Manaus, São Paulo, and Salvador. Host countries and cities often have to deal with a variety of questions or issues, which is also true for Brazil and Rio de Janeiro. The list of issues or potential problems that might have implications for athletes, team personnel, and spectators participating in or attending the 2016 Rio Games includes the Zika virus, public safety threats, security concerns, and environmental conditions. It also bears noting that the act of hosting the Olympics may have implications for Brazil. Finally, doping is of particular concern this year because of revelations regarding a state-orchestrated doping scheme perpetrated by Russian authorities and sports organizations. Each candidate city for the 2016 Games was required to address 14 themes in its bid, such as environment and meteorology, finance, security, medical services, and doping control. However, no one in 2009 could have foreseen the outbreak of the mosquito-borne Zika virus in late 2015, when Brazilian health officials noticed an increase in the number of infants born with microcephaly. Although some have called for the Games to be postponed or cancelled, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) have indicated the risk of international transmission due to the Olympic and Paralympic Games is low. The CDC has published specific recommendations for pregnant women, and the U.S. Olympic Committee (USOC) has taken steps to safeguard the U.S. Olympic team. In the candidature file it submitted to the International Olympic Committee (IOC), the Rio 2016 Organising Committee for the Olympic Games stated that visitors to the country would be provided free health care. Additionally, Brazil committed to providing medical response teams and units at Olympic facilities. However, shortages of health care workers and supplies might compromise the medical services available. Public safety and security are key concerns for visitors to Brazil, including Olympic competitors and spectators. The Department of State has noted that crime is a significant threat, and, during the 2014 World Cup, thieves targeted visitors near sports venues and other locales frequented by tourists. Although Rio de Janeiro has experienced significant improvement in public safety in recent years, some criminal activity has increased in the first half of 2016. With respect to security concerns and, specifically, terrorist threats, Brazil's Director of Counterterrorism reportedly has noted that the threat of terrorism has increased in recent months. In July 2016, the Brazilian police arrested 10 Brazilian nationals suspected of planning an attack during the Games. The national government, which is in charge of security for the Olympic Games, plans to muster a force of 85,000 personnel to provide security. U.S. citizens requiring assistance may reach out to the State Department. Organizers of the Rio 2016 Summer Olympics and Paralympics have made many commitments to host Games in which environmental sustainability is integral to design and planning through implementation, review, and post-event activities. These commitments address issues such as impacts of public transportation, construction, and waste management, and needed water quality improvements. For some time, concern has focused on pollution of waters at venues that will host sailing, rowing, triathlon, and similar events, leading to fear that high levels of water pollution could harm the health of tourists and athletes, in addition to impacting the competitions themselves. Organizers of the Games acknowledge that commitments related to sanitation and water quality will not be met before the Games begin. The Brazilian government campaigned hard to win the right to host the 2016 Olympics, viewing the Games as an opportunity to showcase Brazil's economic and social progress and reinforce the country's image as a rising power. Brazil's international stature has generally declined in recent years, however, as the country has struggled to address deepening economic and political crises. While the Olympics could allow Brazil to highlight its potential and regain some of the prestige it may have lost in recent years, any problems that emerge are likely to reinforce negative perceptions some have of the country. The Games are unlikely to have much of an effect on Brazil's domestic political situation or economy. Nevertheless, a successful Olympics could strengthen the current government's hold on power and provide a temporary boost to Rio de Janeiro's economy. Most Brazilians are relatively pessimistic about the Olympics and believe they have brought more costs than benefits to the country. While doping is a perennial concern, it has been, and is, of particular concern in the months leading up to the 2016 Rio Games. The release of two World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) reports, in November 2015 and July 2016, has shown that Russian authorities and sports organizations engaged in doping schemes involving the Russian track and field team and Russian athletes competing in 2014 at the Winter Games in Sochi, Russia. The latter report also revealed a multi-year operation implicating, among other organizations, the Russian Ministry of Sport. The consequences of these reports include, among other actions and decisions taken by the appropriate international sports organizations, a ban on Russia's track and field team, which means the team will not be allowed to participate in the 2016 Games. Additionally, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) stated that the presumption of innocence does not apply to Russian athletes and established conditions other Russian athletes must meet to demonstrate they have clean doping records and thus be eligible to compete in Rio de Janeiro."}
{"original_length": 16436, "trunc_length": 16384, "text": "\n\nSummarize the following text into a summary of less than 800 words.\n### Text:\n\nPresident Donald Trump called for a \"Free and Open Indo-Pacific\" (FOIP) in his remarks to the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) CEO Summit in Da Nang, Vietnam, in November 2017. Congress has a substantial role in overseeing the FOIP initiative and setting resource levels for its policies. As it considers this role, Congress may consider broad U.S. strategy—including the level of priority placed on the Indo-Pacific region within the overall U.S. strategy; the proper strategy for managing China's rise as a global power; and the long-term role the United States seeks to play in the Indo-Pacific region. (See map below.) It has the opportunity to consider questions about resources and policies, and whether existing levels of appropriation for U.S. military activities, State Department operations, foreign assistance, public diplomacy, and other policy tools are proper for pursuing a FOIP strategy. It may also consider whether the initiative is properly balanced among security, economic, and diplomatic initiatives, and whether regional allies and partners are sufficiently incentivized to play a role in supporting U.S. goals and interests. The report outlines the development of the FOIP initiative through policy statements and speeches before discussing some of the critique of the initiative. The report also considers the response of key regional states—including India, Japan, Australia, and China—before identifying issues for Congress, relevant policy documents, and legislation related to the strategy. Other CRS reports provide additional discussion of specific issues mentioned in this report. Through a series of statements and reports, the Trump Administration has outlined a goal to promote a \"free and open Indo-Pacific\" region (FOIP) which also seeks to integrate U.S. strategy toward East Asia and South Asia, two regions that have often been addressed in relative isolation. The 2017 National Security Strategy (NSS) defines the Indo-Pacific as stretching from \"the west coast of India to the western shores of the United States.\" Others have defined the Indo-Pacific region more broadly to include the western reaches of the Indian Ocean littoral as well. The Administration's FOIP concept remains relatively amorphous, but in recent months Administration officials have begun to make policy announcements that further develop the strategic concept. The free and open Indo-Pacific concept adopts many elements of previous administrations' policies. It also responds to a number of challenges deriving from China's continuing economic growth and military modernization, and from its increasingly assertive and outward-reaching economic and security policies. The Administration's NSS, argues that, \"a geopolitical competition between free and repressive visions of world order is taking place in the Indo-Pacific region.\" It further states, Although the United States seeks to continue to cooperate with China, China is using economic inducements and penalties, influence operations, and implied military threats to persuade other states to heed its political and security agenda…. China presents its ambitions as mutually beneficial, but Chinese dominance risks diminishing the sovereignty of many states in the Indo-Pacific. For some analysts, the Trump Administration's FOIP initiative echoes the Obama Administration's policy of \"strategic rebalancing\" to the Asia-Pacific. That initiative sought to promote rules-based political, economic and security regimes for Asia, and under which the United States joined the regional East Asia Summit (EAS) grouping, concluded agreements with Australia and the Philippines to allow U.S. troop rotations, pledged to shift U.S. naval posture to give greater weight to the Asia-Pacific, and concluded the 12-nation TPP (though it did not ratify the pact). The Trump Administration has continued many of these initiatives, with the notable exception of its decision to withdraw the United States from the TPP. The Trump Administration has pursued other initiatives in the Indo-Pacific region, including diplomacy with North Korea over Pyongyang's nuclear weapons program and the imposition of broad-based tariffs against Chinese goods and on steel, aluminum, and autos, which affect others in the region, particularly Japan and South Korea. It has negotiated an agreement in principle to modify the Korea-United States Free Trade Agreement (KORUS) and called on allies, including Japan and South Korea, to bear more of the costs of stationing U.S. troops in Asia. It is unclear how the FOIP concept relates to these initiatives. Apparent contradictions between various initiatives may have increased skepticism in the region about the Administration's goals, and in particular, in light of the TPP decision, its commitment to having a significant economic component to the FOIP. Inherent in the strategic rationale for the FOIP concept is the emergence of India and South Asia as an important strategic region, which generates the argument that U.S. strategy needs to have a more integrated approach to the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) and the Pacific. The Administration has pursued efforts to bring India more directly into regional initiatives, including through reviving a concept first raised in the George W. Bush Administration to form closer cooperation with Japan, Australia, and India as a four-member group called the \"Quad.\" In an April 2018 briefing on the FOIP, a State Department official described the rationale: Number one, it acknowledges the historical reality and the current-day reality that South Asia, and in particular India, plays a key role in the Pacific and in East Asia and in Southeast Asia. That's been true for thousands of years and it's true today. Secondly, it is in our interest, the U.S. interest, as well as the interests of the region, that India play an increasingly weighty role in the region. India is a nation that is invested in a free and open order. It is a democracy. It is a nation that can bookend and anchor the free and open order in the Indo-Pacific region, and it's our policy to ensure that India does play that role, does become over time a more influential player in the region. Strategic dynamics in the Indo-Pacific region are undergoing significant change. Relatively new or renewed security challenges in the East China Sea, the South China Sea, and along the China-India border are being added to older challenges including potential conflict on the Korean Peninsula; tensions between India and Pakistan; and Taiwan. Many regional analysts also view the United States' post-World War II hub and spoke system of alliances as no longer sufficient to underwrite regional security and are seeking to augment this system with new security partnerships and networks. The NSS places a clear focus on the challenges inherent in China's growing influence and marks, in the view of many, a fundamental shift in the U.S. approach to China's rise. It makes the observation that: For decades, U.S. policy was rooted in the belief that support for China's rise and for its integration into the post-war international order would liberalize China. Contrary to our hopes, China expanded its power at the expense of the sovereignty of others. The NSS describes China as seeking \"to displace the United States in the Indo-Pacific region, expand the reaches of its state-driven economic model, and reorder the region in its favor.\" To counter such perceived Chinese aims, the NSS states that the United States will, among other things: \"compete with all tools of national power to ensure that regions of the world are not dominated by one power\"; \"work with our partners to contest China's unfair trade and economic practices and restrict its acquisition of sensitive technologies\"; and \"help South Asian nations maintain their sovereignty as China increases its influence in the region\" and offer African countries U.S. goods and services \"as an alternative to China's often extractive economic footprint on the continent.\" Insight into the Administration's views on China in the context of the Indo-Pacific strategy were provided by former Secretary of State Tillerson, who described China's rise in October 2017 as: at times undermining the international, rules-based order even as countries like India operate within a framework that protects other nations' sovereignty. China's provocative actions in the South China Sea directly challenge the international law and norms that the United States and India both stand for. The United States seeks constructive relations with China, but we will not shrink from China's challenges to the rules-based order and where China subverts the sovereignty of neighboring countries and disadvantages the U.S. and our friends. In this period of uncertainty and somewhat angst, India needs a reliable partner on the world stage. I want to make clear: with our shared values and vision for global stability, peace, and prosperity, the United States is that partner. The Administration appears to be acting in accordance with a central long-term tenet of U.S. strategic thinking, which is that the United States cannot allow any one power, or coalition of powers, to dominate the Eurasian landmass, as such a power or coalition would have the ability to significantly threaten the United States and its interests. Among the challenges the Administration may be responding to in developing the FOIP are: the growth of China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), under which Beijing pledges to finance infrastructure development across the region, and which many analysts argue would strengthen China both geopolitically and economically, at the expense of the United States, and give China leverage with investment recipients; China's continued military modernization, and its militarization of the artificial islands it has built in the South China Sea, which many analysts argue has altered the strategic landscape of East Asia; the expansion of China's naval activities in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) and strategic mistrust between China and India; China's continued growth as a trade, lending, and investment partner for many in the region, which some analysts fear will give Beijing greater leverage over neighbors in both East Asia and South Asia; concerns across the Indo-Pacific about the sustainability of U.S. commitment to the region, given U.S. strategic commitments in other regions and budgetary constraints facing both military spending and overall foreign assistance; the Trump Administration's decision to withdraw the United States from the proposed 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement (TPP) in January 2017, which has contributed to regional perceptions that the United States may lack an overall economic strategy toward the region; and the prospect that China is challenging Western liberal democratic values and the United States' network of alliances and strategic relationships in the Indo-Pacific. The NSS also describes Russia as seeking to undermine the international, rules-based order, and some analysts have raised concerns about signs of increasing cooperation between China and Russia. Chinese military forces participated in the Russian military exercise Vostok in September 2018 in the Trans-Baikal region of Russia, and Russian and Chinese businesses are reportedly considering joint investment projects worth an estimated $100 billion. Vostok-2018 was held in Russia's Far East and the Pacific Ocean and is thought to be the largest Russian war game in three decades. China's Ministry of National Defense has stated that the drills are: aimed at consolidating and developing the China-Russia comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination, deepening pragmatic and friendly cooperation between the two armies, and further strengthening their ability to jointly deal with varied security threats, which are conducive to safeguarding regional peace and security. According to one source, Vostok-2018 \"highlights the growing closeness between Beijing and Moscow as the two great powers make common cause to challenge Washington's dominance of the liberal international world order.\" One study attributes the deepening and broadening of the China-Russia relationship to common objectives and values, perceived Russian and Chinese vulnerabilities in the face of U.S. and Western pressure, and perceived opportunities for the two powers to expand their influence at the expense of U.S., and allied countries that are seen in decline. Another source states, \"Chinese participation in Russia's major annual military exercise is a signal that Beijing is ready to develop a closer partnership with Moscow if relations with the United States continue to deteriorate.\" Yet further analysis describes the relationship as an entente. The Moscow-Beijing relationship, while not an alliance, is also more than the strategic partnership it still calls itself. It is best described as an entente—a basic agreement about the fundamentals of world order supported by a strong body of common interest. While projecting a \"strong and unified image\" suits the interests of both Beijing and Moscow relative to the United States and the West, mutual suspicions between the two nations continue. The Indo-Pacific region's economy is significant and important to the U.S. economy, and the Trump Administration has made adjusting perceived trade and other imbalances a high priority. In 2017, the region accounted for 57.6% of global population and 42.1% of global gross domestic product (GDP) on a purchasing power parity basis. The United States Millennium Challenge Corporation has granted $2.1 billion since 2004 to Indo-Pacific nations and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) \"has a portfolio of $3.9 billion invested in the Indo-Pacific alongside American firms … for every dollar that OPIC has invested, the private sector has invested $2.76.\" According to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the region will need to attract nearly $26 trillion in capital to fund its energy and infrastructure needs. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) expected that the number of middle-class people in Asia would rise from 525 million in 2009 to an estimated 3.2 billion in 2013. China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which seeks to provide financing and investment for building infrastructure across the Eurasian landmass, in many ways presents a new geo-economic challenge and adds to regional perceptions of China's rise and America's relative decline. President Trump's FOIP responds to China's initiative by offering a \"renewed partnership with America to work together to strengthen the bonds of friendship and commerce between all of the nations of the Indo-Pacific, and together, to promote our prosperity and security.\" The President has also described the basis in which future trade relations would be built in the region: [W]e seek robust trade relationships rooted in the principles of fairness and reciprocity. When the United States enters into a trading relationship with other countries or other peoples, we will, from now on, expect that our partners will faithfully follow the rules just like we do. We expect that markets will be open to an equal degree on both sides, and that private industry, not government planners, will direct investment.... I will make bilateral trade agreements with any Indo-Pacific nation that wants to be our partner and that will abide by the principles of fair and reciprocal trade. What we will no longer do is enter into large agreements that tie our hands, surrender our sovereignty, and make meaningful enforcement practically impossible. The Administration's trade strategy was further discussed in its December 2017 National Security Strategy: The United States will encourage regional cooperation to maintain free and open seaways, transparent infrastructure financing practices, unimpeded commerce, and the peaceful resolution of disputes. We will pursue bilateral trade agreements on a fair and reciprocal basis. We will seek equal and reliable access for American exports. We will work with partners to build a network of states dedicated to free markets and protected from forces that would subvert their sovereignty. We will strengthen cooperation with allies on high-quality infrastructure. Working with Australia and New Zealand, we will shore up fragile partner states in the Pacific Islands region to reduce their vulnerability to economic fluctuations and natural disasters. The deterioration of trade relations between the United States and China may affect other aspects of the bilateral relationship, and has raised concerns among regional states whose economies are closely tied to trade with both countries. Some have viewed the evolving trade war with China as marking \"the opening stages of a new economic Cold War,\" leading some to consider the possibility that \"the United States may be in a protracted and economically damaging trade fight for years to come.\" While the Trump Administration has indicated its support for entering into bilateral free trade agreements (FTAs) with countries in the Indo-Pacific region, it has had difficulty finding willing partners. Beginning in early 2017, the Administration began pressing Japan to enter into FTA negotiations. Japanese government officials generally responded by urging the United States to rejoin the TPP. However, on September 26, 2018, the United States and Japan issued a joint statement announcing their intent to negotiate a United States-Japan Trade agreement on goods, and other \"key areas\" (such as services) that \"can produce early achievements,\" and said that they would pursue negotiations on other trade and investment areas. Japan made clear that market access for agricultural, forestry, and fishery products would be no greater than those afforded in previous economic partnership agreements. The United States indicated that it would focus on market access for motor vehicles. The statement further said that the two sides would \"refrain from taking measures against the spirit of this joint statement\" during the process of the trade negotiations. Japan has raised concerns that President Trump may invoke measures under the Section 232 Trade Act to impose increased tariffs on imported motor vehicles and parts, based on \"national security\" considerations. The U.S.-Japan Joint Statement appears to exempt Japan from such tariff increases and may partially explain why Japan agreed to enter into trade negotiations with the United States in the first place. Some analysts contend that the Philippines may be next in line to enter FTA negotiations with the United States. In November 2017, following a meeting between President Trump and Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, the two sides issued a joint statement, which noted that \"the United States welcomed the Philippines' interest in a bilateral free trade agreement.\" During his testimony before the Senate Appropriations Committee on July 26. 2018, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer stated that there were \"a number of countries\" in East Asia that were interested in an FTA with the United States, and he singled out the Philippines as a country that \"would be a first agreement\" because of its \"good location\" and because \"there are a lot of advantages to it.\" Many observers contend that the January 2017 U.S. withdrawal from the proposed TPP, a \"high standard\" FTA between the United States and 11 other Pacific Rim nations, has undermined U.S. credibility with many Asian countries on FTAs, while enhancing China's economic influence in the region because it is pursuing several FTAs in the Asia-Pacific region. For example, it is participating in negotiations with 15 other countries (the 10 countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) plus Japan, South Korea, India, Australia, and New Zealand) for a China-led Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). China is also pursuing a trilateral FTA with Japan and South Korea and has announced the goal of achieving an Asia-Pacific Free Trade Area. Some analysts contend that the ability of the United States to pursue FTAs in the Indo-Pacific region may be marred by the Trump Administration's focus on negotiating bilateral FTAs over regional ones, its insistence that FTAs be \"reciprocal\" and specifically address bilateral trade imbalances, and its efforts to force trading partners to renegotiate past FTAs, such as the U.S.-Korean FTA (KORUS). Others contend that the growing trade conflict between the United States and China over U.S.-imposed increased tariffs on U.S. imports from China under Section 301 has raised concerns among several Asian countries over how their economies could be impacted, which may in turn lessen their desire to sign an FTA with the United States. Beyond concerns about unfair trade practices, many U.S. policymakers have raised concerns over China's large-scale financial support for infrastructure projects in the Indo-Pacific region (and elsewhere) under its Belt and Road initiative. Some analysts have praised the Trump Administration's attempt to become more economically engaged with countries in the region, especially to act as a counterweight to China's growing economic influence, promote best practices in lending, and to encourage the participation of the private sector: The Trump administration is rolling out a plan to offer the countries of Asia another option besides accepting investment from China's massive One Belt, One Road initiative. The nascent American plan is still tiny compared with what Beijing has to offer, but it could mark the beginning of an economic strategy to counter Beijing's growing regional economic influence... The Trump administration now needs to put its money where its mouth is. Countries in Asia can't be expected to reject gobs of Chinese government funding, even if the terms are bad. But they should at least be given the option to do business with the United States, which would be much healthier for their economies and ours. The Trump Administration has sought cooperation with countries such as Japan to provide infrastructure financing as an alternative to Chinese projects. In November 2017, the Overseas Private Investment Corp. (OPIC) signed a memorandum of understanding with its Japanese counterpart, the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), to cooperate on infrastructure financing. It is not clear, however, whether such cooperative ventures can bring resources to bear on a scale that could offer a genuine alternative to Chinese financing. According to one source, some question whether the United States is \"a trustworthy partner or a retreating power.\" Further, \"[t]he countries in the region other than China are very anxious to keep the U.S. in the neighborhood, they don't want to be in debt to China or for China to be the only game in town. But it strikes me that what the Administration is proposing is minimal at best and isn't about to convince anyone that we are serious about our role\" in the region. President Trump outlined his \"vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific\" while speaking to the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) CEO Summit in Vietnam in November 2017. Beyond the National Security Strategy (NSS) and the National Defense Strategy (NDS), Trump Administration officials have sought to articulate the Indo-Pacific strategy in numerous statements including Secretary of State Pompeo's economic and security cooperation initiatives announced in July and August 2018. In a July 2018 speech, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo described the FOIP initiatives goals: When we say \"free\" Indo-Pacific, it means we all want all nations, every nation, to be able to protect their sovereignty from coercion by other countries. At the national level, \"free\" means good governance and the assurance that citizens can enjoy their fundamental rights and liberties. When we say \"open\" in the Indo-Pacific, it means we want all nations to enjoy open access to seas and airways. We want the peaceful resolution of territorial and maritime disputes. This is key for international peace and for each country's attainment of its own national aims. Economically, \"open\" means fair and reciprocal trade, open investment environments, transparent agreements between nations, and improved connectivity to drive regional ties—because these are the paths for sustainable growth in the region. The 2017 National Security Strategy (NSS) of the Trump Administration declares that \"great power competition [has] returned\" and places significant emphasis on the Indo-Pacific while describing China, along with Russia, as revisionist powers and competitors challenging \"American power, influence and interests\" while \"attempting to erode American security and prosperity.\" One observer states that, \"The biggest departure from previous NSS documents is the placement of the Indo-Pacific discussion—at the very top of the regions considered, above Europe and the Middle East.\" The NSS states that, \"we welcome India's emergence as a leading global power and stronger strategic and defense partner.\" It goes on to say that the United States will expand and deepen its security cooperation and strategic partnership with India while supporting India's leadership role in the Indian Ocean region. The NSS also states: \"We will seek to increase quadrilateral cooperation with Japan, Australia and India.\" The 2018 National Defense Strategy frames the reemergence of long-term, strategic competition by revisionist powers as the central challenge to the United States' prosperity and security. The NDS accuses China of \"leveraging military modernization, influence operations, and predatory economics to coerce neighboring countries to reorder the Indo-Pacific region to their advantage.\" Echoing the NSS, the NDS argues that China seeks \"Indo-Pacific regional hegemony in the near-term.\" The NDS goes further, however, in adding that China also seeks \"displacement of the United States to achieve global preeminence in the future. ( e mphasis added )\" The National Defense Strategy also prioritizes expanding Indo-Pacific alliances and partnerships to achieve a \"networked security architecture capable of deterring aggression, maintaining stability, and ensuring free access to common domains... [and] preserve the free and open international system.\" In the maritime security realm, the Administration has echoed statements from previous administrations about protecting freedom of navigation and respect for international law in resolving East Asian maritime disputes, and it has increased the frequency of Freedom of Navigation Operations (FONOPs) in the South China Sea to challenge Chinese maritime claims. It has sought to deepen other regional partnerships, and in March 2018, the USS Carl Vinson made the first visit to Vietnam by a U.S. aircraft carrier since the Vietnam War. President Trump has also supported significant increases in defense spending. According to one source: The Trump administration—with help from the Republican-controlled Congress—has added more than $200 billion to the projected levels of defense spending for fiscal years 2017 through 2019. Shortly after taking office, President Donald Trump added $15 billion to former President Barack Obama's FY 2017 budget, and he proposed a FY 2018 budget of $639 billion. This represented an increase of $56 billion, or 10 percent, over the proposed FY 2017 budget. President Trump signed the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act which authorizes $717 billion in defense spending. It is estimated that the United States will spend $14.5 million in Australia, $83.3 million in the British Indian Ocean Territory, $5,155.3 million in Japan, $3,464.0 million in the Republic of Korea, and $77.5 million in Singapore on Defense related overseas operations and maintenance costs in FY2019. As noted, the FOIP initiative remains relatively amorphous, but the Trump Administration in 2018 has announced a number of actions that analysts suggest begin to fill in some of the details. Its actions include: restarting the \"Quad\" concept by holding senior official meetings with the other Quad members in Manila in November 2017; renaming the United States Pacific Command to be the Indo-Pacific Command; announcing strategic initiatives to provide $300 million in security assistance to improve security relationships across the Indo-Pacific; increasing the frequency of Freedom of Navigation Operations (FONOPS) to challenge Chinese assertions of sovereignty in the South China Sea; announcing economic initiatives totaling $113 million to promote digital connectivity, energy and infrastructure; and seeking partnerships with other institutions, including the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), to provide infrastructure financing alternatives to China's BRI. The Trump Administration revived a concept first raised in the George W. Bush Administration to form closer cooperation with Japan, Australia, and India under a Quadrilateral group called the \"Quad.\" The grouping arose from the devastating 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. The Quad has been defined as \"a loose geostrategic alignment of states concerned with China's potential challenge to their interests.\" As such, some observers view it as a strategic responses to China's rise in the Indo-Pacific. The Quad was first convened on the sidelines of the ASEAN Regional Forum in May 2007. Following this, Australia's then-Prime Minister Kevin Rudd reconsidered Australia's commitment to the Quad in part because of concerns that it would antagonize China, leading to a 10-year hiatus of Australian government interest in participation. Australia, India, Japan, and the United States held senior official consultations on the Indo-Pacific in November 2017 in Manila. Senior officials from the United States, Australia, India, and Japan then met in June 2018 and \"reiterated strong support for ASEAN centrality and ASEAN-led mechanisms in the evolving regional architecture.\" The Quad raises the role of values, as well as interests, in regional security groups. In October 2017, U.S. Acting Assistant Secretary for South and Central Asian Affairs Alice Wells stated, \"I think the idea is how do we bring together countries that share these same values to reinforce these values in the global architecture.\" Wells went on to describe the Quad as \"providing an alternative to countries in the region who are seeking needed investment in their infrastructure\" so that they have \"alternatives that don't include predatory financing or unsustainable debt.\" Some have wondered how less democratic nations would fit into a values based approach to the region. In May 2018, Defense Secretary Mattis announced that the former U.S. Pacific Command would be renamed the Indo-Pacific Command. He did so \"in recognition of the increasing connectivity between the Indian and Pacific Oceans.\" The Indo-Pacific Command is one of six U.S. geographic combatant commands and covers approximately 50% of the world's population. Approximately 375,000 U.S. military and civilian personnel are assigned to the USINDOPACOM area of responsibility. One concern some have raised in relation to the Administration's geographic definition of the Indo-Pacific, which according to the NSS extends from \"the west coast of India to the western shores of the United States,\" is that it excludes the western reaches of the Indian Ocean. The western Indian Ocean falls within the Central Command and Africa Command areas of responsibility. It has been argued that \"This issue of'seams,' or arbitrary bureaucratic separations, bedevils Washington's ability to cover the Indo-Pacific adequately.\" In his 2018 speech to the Shangri-La Dialogue, Secretary of Defense Mattis affirmed the critical importance of the Indo-Pacific, viewed ASEAN centrality as vital, and welcomed cooperation with China wherever possible. Mattis also highlighted the priority of deepening alliances and partnerships in the region. Mattis added that \"while we explore new opportunities for meaningful multilateral cooperation, we will deepen our engagement with existing regional mechanisms at the same time.\" Mattis also stated, \"We do not practice predatory economics, and we stand consistent with our principles. The U.S. strategy recognizes no one nation can or should dominate the Indo-Pacific.\" During his remarks Mattis emphasized several themes including expanding attention to the maritime space, interoperability, strengthening the rule of law, civil society and transparent governance, and private sector-led economic development. Secretary of State Pompeo announced the Trump Administration's intent to provide $300 million in security assistance to improve security relationships across the Indo-Pacific. (See table below.) This security assistance would fund projects related to maritime security—including in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands as well as the Bay of Bengal- Humanitarian Assistance/Disaster Relief, Peacekeeping Operations, and Countering Transnational Crime. On July 30, 2018, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced \"$113.5 million in new U.S. initiatives to support foundational areas of the future: digital economy, energy, and infrastructure,\" and indicated that this represented \"just a down payment on a new era in U.S. economic commitment to peace and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region.\" The three initiatives and initial funding levels include the Digital Connectivity and Cybersecurity Partnership (at $25 million); Enhancing Development and Growth through Energy (nearly $50 million); and Infrastructure Transaction and Assistance Network (nearly $30 million). The United States, Japan, and Australia have formed a trilateral partnership to mobilize investment to \"foster a free, open, inclusive and prosperous Indo-Pacific.\" Secretary Pompeo also referenced legislation in Congress that would reorganize, and in some case expand, U.S. trade and development programs, including the Better Utilization of Investments Leading to Development (BUILD) Act ( H.R. 5105 in the House and S. 2463 in the Senate). He stated that the House-passed bill would more than double (to $60 billion dollars) the U.S. government's development finance capacity (although it is not clear how much would be dedicated to the Indo-Pacific region). While the Trump Administration's Free and Open Indo-Pacific initiative has been viewed by some observers as seeking to reshape America's strategic approach to the region and manage China's rise, one source takes the view that \"allies and adversaries alike are left wondering if the United States really has the will and resources to make it happen\" adding that: While the region welcomes the aspirations of the Indo-Pacific strategy as a sign of broader strategy and regional engagement, the challenge right now is that it's just aspirational—a set of goals with no real strategy, policy enumeration or implantation plan, let alone resourcing and budget. Others argue that the initial set of FOIP related initiatives are relatively small in scope. One South Asia expert has written that \"The $113 million in assistance will clearly not scratch the surface of the financing needs in the Indo-Pacific region.\" Some observers point out that the Trump Administration withdrew the United States from the proposed Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) and have criticized the FOIP's economic initiatives as well short of China's commitments to the region which, while generally believed to be overstated in the media, are also thought to be in the billions. Another key concern some have with the strategy is that it lacks a comprehensive economic component sufficient to accomplish its goals. Others point to problems in messaging related to the FOIP concept. Some analysts argue that regional states tend to underestimate the value and importance of U.S. economic engagement with the region when it is compared with Belt and Road Initiatives by China because U.S. foreign direct investment (FDI) is largely not state-led. The FOIP concept's emphasis on India, Japan, and Australia has led some to question where this leaves the concept of ASEAN centrality in America's strategy towards the region. Similarly, some ask whether U.S. treaty ally South Korea should have greater prominence in the initiative. The Trump Administration has emphasized that its FOIP concept is about an open system, one open to others beyond the Quad countries. Some have observed a reticence on the part of India to engage more fully with the Quad. Some view this as being driven by a reluctance to antagonize China. If this is the case, then there are significant limits on how far such a strategy can go. While the Administration has expressed a desire to work with all like-minded partners in the Indo-Pacific region that \"share its vision of a stable and prosperous Indo-Pacific where sovereignty is upheld and a rules based system is respected,\" the Administration's Free and Open Indo-Pacific strategy has placed relatively more emphasis on relations with India, Japan, and Australia. While generally supportive of the Trump Administration's approach, these potential partners have sometimes divergent views and goals. New Delhi has generally welcomed the U.S. Indo-Pacific strategy to date, seeing in it a qualitatively new recognition of India's growing role in many vital political, economic, and security issues. When then-Secretary of State Tillerson discussed the U.S. strategy in October 2017, it came in the context of a major policy speech on U.S.-India relations. Indian leaders were encouraged by Tillerson's contention that China has risen \"less responsibly\" than India, \"at times undermining the international rules-based order.\" He also said that, \"We need to collaborate with India to ensure that the Indo-Pacific is increasingly a place of peace, stability, and growing prosperity—so that it does not become a region of disorder, conflict, and predatory economics.\" New Delhi has emerged as a leading regional opponent of China's BRI and, in concert with Washington and Tokyo, is seeking to develop regional alternatives to that Beijing-led initiative. The China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), in particular, has spurred efforts by New Delhi to increase its commercial connectivity with Afghanistan and Central Asia via Iran. (Pakistan, for its part, warns that the U.S. Indo-Pacific strategy could create a \"new Cold War\" in Asia through the creation of rival blocs. ) India also anticipates accruing further benefits from the expanding U.S.-India defense partnership and through its new status as a Major Defense Partner of the United States, with Washington expressing eagerness to see India play an increasing role as a \"net security provider\" in the Indian Ocean region. The Indian navy is a regular participant in the annual trilateral \"Malabar\" exercises with the United States and Japan. Yet New Delhi is simultaneously viewed as being hesitant to antagonize its more powerful neighbor to the north, preferring to characterize China's rise as a \"challenge\" rather than a \"threat\" to India, and recently pursuing a \"reset\" of bilateral relations and reduction of tensions. This posture places limits on the extent to which India will engage in multilateral security arrangements that are perceived as being directed at China. Moreover, a U.S. conception of an \"Indo-Pacific region\" that terminates at the western coast of India (\"Hollywood to Bollywood\") is irksome to some analysts who note that India has crucial interests in the IOR to its west. These include relations with Iran (development of the Chabahar port and access to Central Asia), the Persian Gulf (source of essential energy flows and home to millions of expatriate Indian workers), and the eastern coast of Africa (target of the Asia-Africa Growth Corridor—a joint India-Japan initiative—and home to a significant Indian diaspora). More broadly, other Indian analysts criticize New Delhi's alleged zeal for \"bandwagoning\" with the United States as a fruitless enterprise that only benefits Washington while bringing greater tension to the India-China relationship. Such complaints have new persuasiveness among many Indian analysts as India takes a defiant posture toward potential U.S. retaliation for New Delhi's plans to purchase Russia's S-400 system and for ongoing significant Indian imports of oil from Iran. Either of these actions could bring India under new U.S. sanctions, the threats of which provide new fuel for longstanding Indian arguments that the United States is not a reliable strategic partner. To date, the United States has not ruled out sanctions against India if it proceeds with the planned purchase of Russia's S-400 air defense system, and New Delhi appears intent on continuing purchases of Iranian oil beyond the deadline set by Washington. Since Prime Minister Shinzo Abe delivered a speech in front of the Indian Parliament in 2007 during his first term, Japan has been at the forefront of promoting the concept of the Indo-Pacific, and of pursuing quadrilateral cooperation among the region's largest maritime democracies: the United States, Japan, India, and Australia. Japan's eagerness to pursue the Quad appears driven above all by its concern over China's increasing power and influence in the region. Security concerns about China's intentions have spiked in Japan since a territorial dispute over a set of islands in the East China Sea (known as the Senkakus in Japan and the Diaoyutai in China) flared in 2010. As this tension continues, Prime Minister Abe is anxious to establish a regional order that is not defined by China's economic, geographic, and strategic dominance. Expanding the region to include the South Asian subcontinent—some claim that Abe himself coined the concept of the \"Indo-Pacific\"—broadens the strategic landscape. Japan's insecurity is heightened by perceptions that the United States may be a waning power in the region. The concept of the free and open Indo-Pacific is particularly appealing to Japan because of its strong relationships with India and Australia. India and Japan have both been keen to develop stronger ties for several years, particularly under the leadership of Prime Ministers Narendra Modi and Abe. During Abe's first stint as Prime Minister in 2006-2007, he pursued tighter relations with India, both bilaterally and as part of his \"security diamond\" concept. For India, deepening engagement with Japan is a major aspect of New Delhi's broader \"Act East\" policy. Under the two leaders, the countries have developed more bilateral dialogues at all levels of government, supported each other on areas of mutual concern, and bolstered educational and cultural exchanges. Modi and Abe share a forceful leadership style and appear to have established a strong personal rapport. Analysts point to the lack of historical baggage between the two countries, mutual respect for democratic institutions, and the shared cultural and religious ties in Buddhism that have allowed the relationship to flourish. According to India's External Affairs Ministry, \"The friendship between India and Japan has a long history rooted in spiritual affinity and strong cultural and civilizational ties.\" It notes that \"the two countries have never been adversaries. Bilateral ties have been singularly free of any kind of dispute—ideological, cultural, or territorial.\" Over the past decade, Beijing has at times wielded its new influence in ways that have alarmed other regional states, especially when Beijing is perceived as acting too assertively or even aggressively. This has been the case with Japan and India—both of which have long-standing territorial disputes with China—and leaders in the two countries have sought to increase their bilateral cooperation in apparent response. Japan has also been steadily developing defense relations with Australia over the past decade. Australia is Japan's top energy supplier, and a series of economic and security pacts have been signed under Abe. In 2017, Tokyo and Canberra signed an updated acquisition and cross-servicing agreement (ACSA) and are in the process of negotiating a visiting forces agreement. As another U.S. treaty ally, Australia uses similar practices and equipment, which may make cooperation with Japan more accessible. Although Japan had some difficult World War II history with Australia, Abe himself has made efforts to overcome this potential obstacle to closer defense ties. In 2014, during the first address to the Australian parliament by a Japanese Prime Minister, Abe explicitly referenced \"the evils and horrors of history\" and expressed his \"most sincere condolences towards the many souls who lost their lives.\" As Prime Minister, Abe has accelerated reforms to Japan's Self Defense Forces (SDF) to make it a more flexible and advanced military. With a fractured opposition, Abe has been singularly successful in achieving these reforms, despite some misgivings among the public about whether Japan should develop a more muscular posture. Although Abe's political standing appears secure—in September 2018, he secured another three-year term as leader of Japan's ruling party—it is uncertain if his successor will embrace defense commitments that extend far beyond Japan's boundaries. Japan is anxious to ensure that the United States remain a dominant presence in the region, and the Quad formulation demands that the United States assert leadership and stay engaged. In the past, the United States has generally encouraged the development of closer relationships among its allies and partners in Asia. Defense analysts have coined the term \"mini-laterals\" to describe these groupings. Security cooperation—with the United States serving as a facilitator—has expanded, particularly in the maritime arena. The 2017 exercises featured aircraft carriers from all three navies (Japan calls its vessel a \"helicopter destroyer\") and focused on anti-submarine warfare, notable because of the increasing presence of Chinese People's Liberation Army-Navy submarines operating in the Indian Ocean. Some analysts have identified the Malabar exercises as a platform for defense engagement in the Indo-Pacific as a whole, potentially boosting like-minded militaries interoperability in the maritime domain. Recent debate in Australia on regional strategic challenges has focused on China's rising influence and how Australia should respond and position itself relative to related changes in Indo-Pacific power dynamics. This debate is framed by increasing concern in Australia about the influence of China (and those who promote its interests) in Australian politics and society, despite the fact that China remains a key economic and trade partner. Australia's outlook is also affected by uncertainty about President Trump's approach to the alliance with Australia and U.S. engagement with the region. Australian conceptualizations of their strategic geography have taken into account both the Pacific and Indian Oceans for longer than such conceptualizations have been central to strategy documents in the United States. Such strategic conceptualizations are important for a number of reasons. According to one observer: The way policy makers define and imagine regions can affect, among other things, the allocation of resources and high level attention... Thus, the increasing use of the term Indo-Pacific carries implications for the way countries approach security competition or cooperation in maritime Asia. The idea of an Indo-Pacific region involves recognizing that the growing economic, geopolitical and security connections between the Western Pacific and the Indian Ocean regions are creating a single'strategic system.' Former Prime Minister Turnbull stated that, \"in this brave new world we cannot rely on great powers to safeguard our interest. We have to take responsibility for our own security and prosperity while recognising we are stronger when sharing the burden of collective leadership with trusted partners and friends.\" For Australia, values and a rules-based order, as well as interests, are key components of an Indo-Pacific strategic vision. A key Australian fundamental objective, as articulated in Australia's 2017 Foreign Affairs White Paper, is to keep the Indo-Pacific region secure, open and prosperous. The White Paper states, \"the Indo-Pacific is undergoing a strategic transition as profound as the economic transformation that preceded it\" and reasserts a long held view that \"our alliance with the United States is central to Australia's security and sits at the core of our strategic and defence planning.\" The document also states \"The Government will lift the ambition of our engagement with major Indo-Pacific democracies.\" Former Prime Minister Turnbull and President Trump \"reaffirmed the strength of the alliance between the United States and Australia and the close alignment of our interests and values in the Indo-Pacific region and throughout the world\" during their March 2018 meeting in Washington. In their joint statement following the meeting the two leaders agreed \"that the world in which we live is contested, and that it is more important than ever to defend our common values and way of life. We are committed to fostering an Indo-Pacific region where all countries abide by international law.\" The July 2018 Australia-U.S. Ministerial Consultations Joint statement similarly made clear a shared commitment to \"work together—and with partners—to shape an Indo-Pacific that is open, inclusive, prosperous, and rules-based.\" The Joint Statement also announced a joint work plan to advance shared strategic interests in the Indo-Pacific. China's government played down the significance of the Trump Administration's Free and Open Indo-Pacific strategy. At his annual press conference in March 2018, China's Foreign Minister, Wang Yi, described the strategy as just another \"headline-grabbing idea.\" All such ideas, he said, \"are like the sea foam in the Pacific or Indian Ocean: they may get some attention, but soon will dissipate.\" Wang noted that the official position of the United States, Australia, India, and Japan is that the strategy \"targets no one … I hope they mean what they say and their action will match their rhetoric.\" He warned, \"Nowadays, stoking a new Cold War is out of sync with the times and inciting bloc confrontation will find no market.\" In early September 2018, a spokesperson for China's Foreign Ministry said China welcomed the development of U.S.-India relations, adding that China hoped both \"could contribute more to regional peace and stability.\" In July 2018, another Foreign Ministry spokesperson said China welcomed pledges of infrastructure investment in the region from the United States, Japan, and Australia. The spokesperson questioned, however, whether the three countries would make good on those pledges. \"If my memory serves me correctly, this is not the first time for them to make this statement,\" the spokesman noted. \"As a Chinese saying goes, 'talking the talk is not as good as walking the walk.'\" In June 2018, a Ministry of Defense spokesperson acknowledged \"concern\" about a joint U.S.-Japan-India naval exercise, held off the coast of Guam that month. \"China believes that the military cooperation of relevant countries should be conducive to regional peace and stability and not target any third country,\" the spokesman said. PRC scholars and commentators have been less restrained. A senior scholar with China's Foreign Ministry think tank, the China Institute of International Studies, concludes: As FOIP has adopted such a blunt, cutthroat zero-sum, ideological, antagonistic and containment-oriented posture toward China, it's safe to say that the US strategy, up to now, is inherently anti-China, no matter what shining notions it has used or euphemisms it might apply. It is the first time in the four-decade China-US diplomatic relations that a US administration has used such categorical, antagonistic language in its official documents and statements to portray China's behavior and intentions. In August 2018, a research fellow with the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University of China proposed a series of counter-measures China might take to blunt the impact of the U.S. Indo-Pacific strategy. They include: Help construct \"an Indo-Pacific discourse system\" and \"deconstruct some concepts put forward by the U.S. and other countries that are not in China's interests, and replace them with new concepts that are beneficial to China by means of discourse substitution strategies.\" Avoid high-cost direct military confrontation with the United States and instead pursue \"'military operations other than war' (such as the construction work on [China's] own islands and reefs, construction of roads, upgrading of border facilities, etc.).\" On trade, in the short- to medium-term, \"force the U.S. side to negotiate with China through targeted counterattacks,\" and \"by making limited concessions and reaching new agreements that do not harm China's fundamental interests.\" In the long-term, China must \"carry out internal reforms.\" \"[D]emonstrate [China's] goodwill and provide reassurance to the international community by using concepts such as 'community of shared future for mankind' as well as the 'Belt and Road Initiative,' and those of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), and the BRICS New Development Bank.\" Work with major Asian nations such as Japan, India, and Australia \"to safeguard common interests (globalization, multilateralism, fair trade, etc.) and, by so doing, weaken their motivation and determination to join Indo-Pacific countries to contain China.\" Take advantage of what the author sees as the lack of \"vital attention\" to ASEAN in the FOIP by first improving relations with Vietnam and the Philippines, then strengthening economic and trade cooperation with ASEAN, then moving on to security cooperation. \"[P ]rudently strengthen strategic cooperation with Russia, Iran and other countries, and take advantage of the increasing challenges to the U.S. in Eastern Europe and the Middle East\" to reduce pressure on China. Also, stay alert to the potential for any development \"that makes the U.S. feel the compelling urge to seek strategic support from China.\" Counter the \"negative impact\" of U.S. policies on the world order and globalization through \"pragmatic cooperation with mutual benefit and win-win results.\" Use the Belt and Road Initiative, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, the BRICS, and the AIIB, \"to galvanize the support of third parties and jointly build a community of shared future for mankind.\" The Trump Administration's FOIP initiative poses a number of potential policy and oversight issues for Congress, including the following: Administration strategy. Where does the Indo-Pacific lie in the Administration's list of priorities? Does the Trump Administration have a fully developed, whole-of-government strategy for achieving a free and open Indo-Pacific? Does it have such a strategy for implementing the Quad concept? If so, what are the elements of that strategy, and what programs and funding in the Administration's proposed FY2019 budget are intended to begin implementing that strategy? If not, when does the Trump Administration anticipate completing its development of such a strategy? To what extent does the FOIP initiative subsume other Administration initiatives? For example does the Administration consider potential effects of trade policies on attitudes of friends and allies towards the FOIP initiative or are Administration policies towards Iran viewed independently, in tandem with or subordinate to Indo-Pacific objectives? What is the process for determining the Administration's priorities toward the region? Time and attention devoted to issue. Given the need for the United States to monitor and respond to events in other regions, is the Trump Administration devoting adequate time and resources to tracking and responding to developments in the Indo-Pacific? How are new initiatives to be funded? Geographic scope. Have the strategic implications of defining the western edge of the Indo-Pacific region as the west coast of India—rather than farther west—been fully considered? What effect does this have on India's involvement in the strategy? Does this delineation ignore trade, energy, and strategic linkages between the Persian Gulf and the western Indian Ocean and East Asia and the broader Indo-Pacific region? State Department staffing. What impact, if any, does the current staffing situation at the State Department—where many positions are unfilled—have on the U.S. ability to develop and implement a whole-of-government strategy for the Indo-Pacific? Economic elements of the initiative. Following the U.S. withdrawal from the TPP, and given the Administration's more recent trade actions, what are the economic elements of the FOIP strategy? Do potential Indo-Pacific partners view the FOIP as an overly militarized policy approach? What actions could the United States consider to convince regional partners that the FOIP has tangible economic benefits for them? U.S. r elations with o ther countries. What implications does the Indo-Pacific strategy have for U.S. relations with China and other countries in the region? Does it change Administration conceptions of \"ASEAN centrality\" in Asian regional diplomacy? Are initiatives such as the Quad, which have emerged from particular leaders in countries like Japan and India, sustainable beyond the tenure of those leaders? U.S. defense programs and spending levels. What implications does the Indo-Pacific strategy have for U.S. defense programs and spending levels? How might it affect requirements for maintaining forward-deployed U.S. military forces in the region, or for modernizing U.S. military forces, particularly naval and air forces? To what degree can or should the United States rely on U.S. allies or partner countries to counter China's military presence in the region? U.S. arms sales. What implications does the Indo-Pacific strategy have for U.S. arms sales in the region? In light of new and existing strategic challenges in the region, what kinds of arms should the United States sell to regional friends and allies? U.S. foreign assistance. What implications does the Indo-Pacific strategy have for the scale or allocation of U.S. foreign assistance funding to the region? Is the Indo-Pacific receiving too large a share, too little a share, or about the right share of total U.S. foreign assistance funding? Is the allocation of U.S. foreign assistance funding to individual countries in the region appropriate, or should it be changed in some way? Economic architec ture. Is the evolving strategy towards the Indo-Pacific overly reliant on military tools following the United States' withdrawal from the TPP? Should the Trump Administration seek to further develop or engage with an economic architecture for the Indo-Pacific that could promote peace and stability and enhance U.S. interests through enhanced economic interdependencies between regional states including China? What role should U.S. allies and partners play in providing and coordinating infrastructure financing in the region? Under what conditions would President Trump support U.S. reentry into the TPP? What is the Administration's position on the Chinese-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB)? Trade and Investment. What specific policies should the United States take regarding economic and trade ties with the Indo-Pacific region? How important are the Export Import Bank of the United States and the U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corporation in helping to finance U.S. exports to the region? The challenges confronting the Trump Administration and its efforts to establish a Free and Open Indo-Pacific will likely remain part of the regional strategic landscape for many years to come. China's strategic position in the Indo-Pacific, which is to a large extent defined by its Belt and Road Initiative and its increasing military power, is changing the balance of power in the region. Regional states such as India, Japan, and Australia, while looking to the United States to play a stabilizing role in the region, are also looking to develop their own security relationships to hedge against geopolitical uncertainty. Existing flashpoints also have the potential to threaten U.S. interests. Congress can aid this administration's and future administration's efforts to shape the strategic dynamics of the Indo-Pacific in a way that protects and promotes American interests and values.

U.S.\n\n### Summary:", "answer": "The Trump Administration has outlined a goal of promoting a Free and Open Indo-Pacific (FOIP), seeking to articulate U.S. strategy towards an expanded Indo-Asia-Pacific region at a time when China's presence across the region is growing. The FOIP initiative is identified through a number of statements by the President and senior Administration officials. Insight into the initiative's context and perspective is also offered by the Administration's National Security Strategy and the National Defense Strategy. The FOIP concept represents a significant change in U.S. strategic thinking towards the region because of its explicit linkage of South Asia and the Indian Ocean region with the Asia-Pacific region. The FOIP also emphasizes maritime issues. While recent statements by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have provided a more detailed understanding of the strategy, uncertainty remains over the specifics of the initiative. Some critics of the initiative wonder if the United States has the vision, political will, or economic resources necessary to implement a FOIP strategy effectively. Some observers have pointed to inconsistencies with other Trump Administration initiatives toward the region, and to the lack of detail necessary to operationalize the concept. Some also argue that the economic aspects of the initiative are relatively small when compared to either China's lending, including under its Belt and Road Initiative, or the region's infrastructure investment needs. Another often-expressed concern is that the FOIP's initial emphasis on the \"Quad\" with Australia, India, and Japan raises concerns that it risks eroding U.S. influence in Southeast Asia by not sufficiently incorporating that sub-region's leading international body, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, into U.S. strategy toward the region. Regional perceptions of the United States' commitment to the region were shaken by the Trump Administration's decision to withdraw from the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement in 2017. This decision also led to perceptions that the United States lacked an integrated regional strategy despite the region's economic importance to the United States. According to the State Department, two-way trade between the United States and the Indo-Pacific is $1.4 trillion and U.S foreign direct investment in the region is $860 billion a year. The FOIP initiative may raise questions for Congress related to its oversight and appropriations roles: Does the initiative fully account for the strategic and economic environment in the Indo-Pacific, including implications related to but going beyond the rise of China and its Belt and Road Initiative? Does the initiative correctly identify and adequately secure U.S. interests in the Indo-Pacific region? Does it place proper emphasis on developing diplomatic approaches and economic institutions as well as military responses when crafting a strategic vision for the region? Are U.S. Indo-Pacific military forces properly deployed to secure U.S. interests? Is future defense procurement adequately funded to secure U.S. interests? Is the value to the United States of working with friends and allies in the region properly understood and are these alliance and defense relationships being properly managed in order to leverage U.S. strategic posture in the region? Are American values properly taken into account in developing a FOIP strategy?"}

The former Chairman of the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs and the former Chairman of its Subcommittee on Regulation and Government Information asked us to (1) evaluate the performance of four prominent federal statistical agencies using guidelines developed by the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) and (2) provide information on the role of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to coordinate and oversee the statistical activities of the agencies that constitute the federal statistical system. The four agencies were the Bureau of the Census and the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) within the Department of Commerce, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) within the Department of Labor, and the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) within the Department of Health and Human Services. The federal statistical system is not a system in the ordinary sense but rather a designation for the numerous government agencies that collect, process, analyze, and use quantitative data. Few federal agencies have data collection as their sole or primary mission, but OMB in its annual report identifies agencies as conducting statistical activities when they devote $500,000 or more of their annual budgets to such activities. If this criterion is used for definition, the agencies in the federal statistical system could change from year to year, although the list is quite stable over time. For fiscal year 1995, 72 agencies met or exceeded the $500,000 budget level. Although the majority of these agencies produce statistical information on a particular subject as a byproduct of their administrative, regulatory, or operating responsibilities, several agencies have the production of statistical information as their principal mission. Some federal statistics are used by persons with varying information needs; such statistics are frequently called general-purpose statistics. Other statistics are special purpose in character and deal with one subject matter (e.g., education or transportation); they focus on a particular function of government and are primarily designed to aid program administrators and policymakers. The bulk of these other statistics relate to specific federal programs and are essentially a byproduct of the agencies’ administration or monitoring of these activities. The four agencies whose conformance with the selected NAS guidelines we evaluated are major, well-recognized multipurpose agencies of the federal statistical system. Census tabulates and publishes a wide variety of data about the people and the economy of the nation. These data include the Decennial Census of Population and Housing, the economic and agricultural censuses, and data on U.S. merchandise trade. BLS collects, processes, analyzes, and disseminates data on employment, unemployment, characteristics of employment and employees, and prices and consumer expenditures. BEA is a research-oriented statistical agency that prepares, develops, interprets, and publishes the U.S. economic accounts. BEA integrates large volumes of monthly, quarterly, and annual economic data—ranging from construction spending to retail sales—produced by other government agencies and trade sources to produce a complete and consistent picture of the national economy and its international and regional dimensions. NCHS specializes in health statistics, including vital statistics from marriage, birth, and death certificates. It collects, analyzes, disseminates, and carries out research on the U.S. population’s health status, lifestyles, and exposure to unhealthful influences. Although Census, BLS, BEA, and NCHS are responsible for a large portion of the statistics produced by the federal government, they are only 4 of the 72 agencies that constitute the federal statistical system. For example, NCHS is not the only agency that collects health statistics. Within the Department of Health and Human Services, 13 agencies collect health statistics. The largest of these are the National Institutes of Health and NCHS’ parent organization, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. OMB’s Statistical Policy Branch is responsible for coordinating the activities of the 72 statistical agencies by reviewing agency budget requests, issuing statistical standards, facilitating interagency working groups, and reviewing agency information requests. Appendix I lists by department the names of the 72 agencies in the federal statistical system that are expected to spend at least $500,000 on statistical activities in fiscal year 1995. Since the earliest days of the United States, statistics have been collected and used to describe various facets of the national economy and population. The Constitution, notably, mandates a decennial census to count the population. Government policy and private decisions depend on the availability of accurate and timely information. In addition, federal, state, and local governments rely on statistical information to administer programs under their jurisdictions. Census, BEA, BLS, and NCHS are responsible for many of the statistics used by policymakers and those who administer federal programs. The statistical activities of these four agencies influence policymakers in their formulation of national policies. For example, statistics are fundamental to the federal government’s efforts to allocate its annual budget. Federal income tax brackets and some benefit payments, for instance, are adjusted to mitigate the effects of inflation. Statistics are also an important part of many presidential messages and reports. For example, the annual Economic Report of the President contains extensive statistical appendixes, and many of the policies and programs discussed in the report are based on a statistical foundation provided by the four agencies discussed in this report. In addition, Census’ Decennial Census of Population and Housing is the basis on which representation in Congress is apportioned among the states. The uses of federal statistics extend beyond the government. Decennial census data are used widely by businesses and the media to examine social trends. Much of the news on the business and financial pages of the daily press comes from the release of statistics by BEA, BLS, and Census. Business analysts regularly use statistics of economic conditions when planning investments and operations in their own businesses. Labor organizations and management use statistics on earnings, hours, employment, and prices in their collective bargaining negotiations. BLS’ consumer price index (CPI), which measures the change in the prices of a uniform “market basket” of goods and services, is widely used as the measure for “escalator clauses” in contracts. In employment contracts, for example, such a clause might tie increases in wages and pensions to the CPI to keep employee or retiree earnings in line with inflation. The administration and Congress use statistics produced by these four agencies as a basis for measuring the results of government programs. Some data series are built directly into the administration of programs such as BLS’ inflation and Census’ poverty indexes. For example, if the CPI overstated inflation by as little as 0.2 percentage points annually from 1995 through 1999, an estimated $19.1 billion would be added to the deficit over that 5-year period, according to OMB estimates. In addition, current defense industry contracts amounting to $90 billion include a purchases and sales component that is adjusted by BLS’ producer price index. And BEA, BLS, and Census produce local area unemployment, income, and poverty statistics that are important components of formula programs that allocate billions of dollars of federal funds to state and local governments. The statistics that NCHS produces and disseminates offer many indicators of the health of the nation’s population. From a public policy perspective, NCHS data are critical in the government’s monitoring of cost and delivery of health care. The use of these data in research also helps to bring about improvements in the prevention or treatment of diseases. Because data are usually published from each NCHS information system separately, the wide range of NCHS’ data is sometimes not apparent. NCHS’ data systems are used to obtain information from individuals, health care providers, and vital records, such as birth, death, and marriage certificates; the data systems are useful in studying public health. According to OMB, the 72 agencies that had budgets of $500,000 or more for statistical activities requested an estimated total of $2.6 billion in direct funding for statistical activities in fiscal year 1995. Many of these agencies also received reimbursements from other federal agencies, state and local governments, and the private sector to perform requested statistical activities. Of the requested funding for the 72 agencies combined, the 4 agencies’ share of direct funding was about $752 million (29.4 percent). Table 1.1 shows the share that each of the four agencies requested for statistical funding. The Committee on National Statistics (CNSTAT) of NAS developed guidelines that it believed were essential for the operation of federal agencies that conduct statistical activities. CNSTAT is composed of professionals in the statistical field who have no direct relationship with the federal government. Since its founding, CNSTAT has concentrated on reviewing federal statistics on a selective basis. It also prepares reports on special studies that are intended to improve the effectiveness of the federal statistical system. Considering the diversity of the agencies that make up the federal statistical system, it is difficult to devise standards against which to measure the agencies’ performance. However, CNSTAT developed guidelines that it believes are essential for the efficient operation of federal agencies that conduct statistical activities. NAS issued a CNSTAT report in 1992 entitled Principles and Practices for a Federal Statistical Agency. CNSTAT prepared this report partially in response to requests for advice from congressional and executive officials proposing the creation of new statistical agencies, such as a Bureau of Environmental Statistics and a Bureau of Transportation Statistics. These officials were interested in CNSTAT’s views on what constitutes an effective federal statistical agency. CNSTAT also prepared the report because it was concerned that federal statistical agencies might sometimes not meet what it considered acceptable professional standards. In the NAS report, CNSTAT outlined guidelines that it believes should be followed by federal statistical agencies. According to NAS, the guidelines contain principles and practices that are statements of “best practices,” rather than legal requirements or scientific rules. The guidelines, however, were intended to be consistent with current laws and statistical theory and practice. In the report, CNSTAT discussed the following three principles it found to be essential for the effective operation of a federal statistical agency. According to these principles, a federal statistical agency should • be in a position to provide information that is relevant to issues of public • have a relationship of mutual respect and trust with those who use its data • have a relationship of mutual respect and trust with respondents who provide data and with all data subjects from which it obtains information. In the report, CNSTAT also discussed the following 11 guidelines it found to be essential for the effective operation of a federal statistical agency. These guidelines are intended as specific applications of the three broad principles. According to these guidelines, a federal statistical agency needs • a clearly defined and well-accepted mission, • cooperation with data users by soliciting their views on data quality, • established procedures for the fair treatment of data providers, • openness about the data provided to users, • coordination with other statistical agencies, • a wide dissemination of data, • a strong measure of independence, • commitment to quality and professional standards, • an active research program, • professional advancement of staff, and • caution in conducting nonstatistical activities. We undertook this review at the request of the former Chairman of the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs and the former Chairman of its former Subcommittee on Regulation and Government Information. To evaluate the four agencies’ performance, we compared their activities to the seven NAS guidelines for the effective operation of a federal statistical agency that we regarded as the most susceptible to objective assessment. We did not include the other four NAS guidelines that are of a more subjective nature. The original request for this review specified evaluating Census, BLS, and NCHS. With the agreement of the requesters, we added BEA to the review because of its key responsibilities for providing economic data. The requesters also asked us to provide information on OMB’s role in coordinating and overseeing the statistical activities of those agencies that constitute the federal statistical system. Our first objective was to determine to what extent the four statistical agencies followed the seven NAS guidelines that we used for comparison. Specifically, we examined whether the four agencies (1) had clearly defined and well-accepted missions, (2) cooperated with data users, (3) had established procedures for the fair treatment of data providers, (4) were open about the data provided to users, (5) widely disseminated the data, (6) coordinated with other statistical agencies, and (7) had a strong measure of independence. To understand the context for these guidelines, we interviewed CNSTAT officials to document the procedures they used in preparing and issuing the guidelines. We also interviewed executive branch officials and other knowledgeable experts about the NAS guidelines; reviewed relevant literature, such as other NAS publications and reports about the federal statistical system; and compared the NAS guidelines to comparable international guidelines for statistical agencies. To determine agency compliance with the selected NAS guidelines, we interviewed officials from each of the four agencies and OMB and asked them to provide documents to demonstrate their compliance. These documents included information on missions, activities, and resource history; legal basis for agency organization and operations; data dissemination; cooperation with data users; and coordination/contacts with other governmental organizations and professional societies. In general, our criterion for compliance with a guideline was whether agencies had such documentation. We relied upon interviews and other sources of data to ensure that we adequately understood the context of this documentation. The agencies also provided us with background briefing books, descriptions of statistical programs and publications, agency orders and operational procedures, budget documents, and other documentation. We attended meetings of selected agency advisory committees and boards, meetings with independent groups, and agency-sponsored user conferences. We also met with key agency officials to discuss their programs and policies in the context of the selected guidelines. For example, to determine if the agencies had clearly defined and well-accepted missions, we discussed with agency officials the process by which the mission statements were developed (i.e., through planning conferences or other means) and compared the mission statements to authorizing legislation and agency activities to carry out their statistical missions. Our second objective was to provide information on OMB’s role in coordinating and overseeing the statistical activities of those agencies that constitute the federal statistical system. To do so, we reviewed the requirements contained in the Paperwork Reduction Act for OMB’s responsibilities to coordinate the federal statistical system. We also reviewed published studies on organization and coordination of the federal statistical system. In agreement with the requesters, we predominantly focused on OMB’s role in coordinating federal statistical agencies’ budgets and did not address the other aspects of OMB’s role, such as assessing the quality of statistical data, statistical standards, and paperwork reduction. We reviewed OMB’s annual reports on statistical activities of the U.S. government and the four agencies’ budget submissions for fiscal years 1983 to 1995. We met with officials from OMB’s Statistical Policy Branch, which is responsible for coordinating the budgets and policies of the federal statistical system, to discuss the Branch’s budget coordination mission and the resources it has to carry out this mission. We did our work between June 1992 and February 1995 in Washington, D.C., in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. The Department of Commerce, BLS, NCHS, and OMB provided comments on a draft of this report. Commerce’s written comments incorporated comments from BEA and Census. All of Census’ and most of BEA’s comments were suggestions for technical clarifications and corrections, and we have incorporated these suggestions where appropriate. BEA said that our report underscores the efforts statistical agencies have made to operate effectively and to maintain user confidence in the data they produce. BEA also noted that it agrees in principle with the NAS guidelines and the way we applied them to the statistical agencies. BEA expressed its appreciation for our portrayal of how it handled the integrity issues involving previous GDP estimates. BEA also cited two issues that it believed needed to be clarified in the report. First, BEA thought that we portrayed the statistical agencies as passive participants in efforts to enhance data sharing among themselves. This was not our intention, and we have revised the report on page 27 to acknowledge an interagency task force that was formed to develop proposals for enhanced data sharing. The second issue raised by BEA involved our discussion of its efforts to get input from data users. BEA felt we should have mentioned its Mid-Decade Strategic Review and Plan, which is intended to maintain and review the performance of BEA’s economic accounts. According to BEA, this review includes seeking user input on how the accounts can be improved. We have revised the report on page 21 to include a discussion of the mid-decade review and plan. On June 7, 1995, we met with the Chief Statistician and a senior economist in OMB’s Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. The officials generally agreed with our evaluation of the four agencies’ adherence to the selected NAS guidelines. However, the officials said that our report appeared to indicate that coordination among the statistical agencies is limited to their data-sharing arrangements. The officials noted that the agencies coordinate in many ways, including through working groups on statistical standards, survey design, and data collection. We did not intend to convey the impression that agency coordination is limited to data sharing, and we have revised the report on page 27 to clarify the extent of coordination among statistical agencies. The OMB officials also said that the draft did not adequately reflect the full extent of the coordination activities performed by OMB’s Statistical Policy Branch. We have revised the report on pages 43 to 45 to reflect the description of the Branch’s budget coordination function, which includes working with the major statistical agencies and the OMB program examiners assigned to them to coordinate the statistical budgets of these agencies. The officials also said that the draft did not adequately describe the Branch’s role in the coordination of federal statistical policy. We agree that the Branch plays an important role in the coordination of federal statistical policy, but our report focused on its budget coordination function. However, we have revised the report on pages 17, 18, and 43 to clarify that the Branch has other responsibilities in addition to budget coordination. The officials also offered suggestions for technical corrections and clarifications, which we have incorporated where appropriate. BLS and NCHS provided oral comments on the draft report. On June 5, 1995, we met at BLS with the Chief, Division of Management Functions and the Chief, Division of Financial Planning and Management. The officials made suggestions for technical corrections and clarifications, which we have incorporated. On June 6, we spoke with the Chief of NCHS’ Planning, Budget and Legislative staff, who also made suggestions for technical corrections and clarifications, and these have also been incorporated. The four agencies adhered to five of the seven selected guidelines with only minor exceptions. The agencies (1) had clearly defined and well-accepted mission statements, (2) cooperated with data users by soliciting their views on data quality, (3) treated data providers fairly, (4) openly described all aspects of their data to users, and (5) widely disseminated the data they produced. However, we found that the agencies did not or could not meet all aspects of the other two guidelines, which involved the agencies’ coordination with other statistical agencies and their measure of independence. First, although the agencies coordinated to some extent with other statistical agencies, their coordination was limited by data provider confidentiality statutes, and initiatives to modify the limitations through legislative change have not yet succeeded. Second, the agencies themselves were generally politically independent, but we have reported on one instance when a statistical agency—BEA—had not been successful in conveying this independence to data users, judging by allegations of political interference in their work. In a March 1993 report GAO noted that a collection of articles that appeared in the press from October 1991 through November 1992 alleged that BEA had manipulated its first quarter gross domestic product estimates for political purposes. The report concluded that the allegations were not substantiated and recommended actions to avoid such allegations in the future. Following our recommendation, BEA has formulated a strategy to counter misperceptions on the matter of its independence. “An agency’s mission should include responsibility for assessing needs for information and determining sources of data, measurement methods, and efficient methods of collection and ensuring the public availability of needed data, including, if necessary, the establishment of a data collection program.” Each agency provided us with statements that described the mission of the agency, the scope of its program, and its authority and responsibilities. In addition, officials from each agency described the process by which the mission statements were developed (e.g., through planning conferences). We found some mission statements contained in legislation; others were issued by the agencies administratively, which is permissible under the NAS guidelines for agencies that have only very general legislative authority. Implementing regulations and official publication releases also mentioned the missions of the four agencies. All of these agencies had mission statements that had been in effect for a number of years. “A statistics agency should consult with a broad spectrum of users of its data in order to make its products more useful. It should: —seek advice on data concepts, methods, and products in a variety of formal and informal ways, from data users as well as from professional and technical subject-matter experts. —seek advice from external groups on its statistical program as a whole, on setting statistical priorities, and on the statistical methodologies it uses. —endeavor to meet the needs for access to data while maintaining appropriate safeguards for the confidentiality of individual responses. —exercise care to make its data equally accessible to all potential users.” We found each of the four agencies had policies for requesting and receiving feedback from data users, including other statistical agencies, by a variety of means. The agencies also cooperated with data users by maintaining appropriate confidentiality safeguards of respondents and making data available to all potential users. Census, BLS, BEA, and NCHS have communicated with data users mainly through formal advisory committees of users and statistical data centers of individual state governments (such as the Census State Data Center network). The agencies have consulted these advisory committees and state government units on issues of users’ data needs, including the frequency of surveys, content, geographic level, and type of product. For example, in conducting its Mid-Decade Strategic Review and Plan, BEA publicly reviewed the status of its economic accounts and actively solicited wide user input—including organizing a well-attended user conference. In addition to consulting formal advisory groups, all four of the agencies have on occasion contracted with independent groups to receive advice on the agencies’ respective methodologies. These contacts also helped make data accessible to all potential users. For example, BLS contracted with the American Statistical Association to conduct an independent review of BLS’ downward revision of the March 1991 benchmark for the monthly payroll survey of employment estimates. Also, at the request of NCHS, NAS and the Institute of Medicine convened a panel of experts to evaluate NCHS’ plans for the National Health Care Survey. NAS also has convened two ongoing panels of experts, which were formed at congressional and agency request, to advise Census on the data requirements of the 2000 Decennial Census and on possible methodological approaches that Census should take to meet these requirements. Employees of all four agencies frequently participated in statistical conferences to exchange ideas with researchers and statisticians from other federal agencies, universities, and private sector organizations. In addition, agency employees take part in meetings with various organizations and professional associations, such as CNSTAT, the American Statistical Association, the American Economic Association, the National Association of Business Economists, and other organizations and associations that are relevant to their statistical activities and research. Census, BLS, and NCHS have regular conferences with cooperating state statistical agencies. On occasion, these three agencies also sponsor user conferences. For example, BLS sponsored user conferences in 1994 concerning the major redesign of the Current Population Survey and NCHS has biennial user conferences. In addition, other forms of contact with data users can include agencies’ conducting OMB-approved surveys on specific data measures. Comments from users are also sometimes solicited through a published Federal Register notice. As we noted in chapter 1, government agencies are extensive users of federal statistics, and the statistical agencies maintain contacts with these users and among themselves as well. For example, OMB chairs monthly meetings with executive branch statistical agency heads to help coordinate agencies’ statistical activities. “To maintain credibility and a relationship of respect and trust with data subjects and other data providers, an agency must observe fair information practices. Such practices include: — policies and procedures to maintain the confidentiality of individual responses. An agency avoids activities that might lead to a misperception that confidentiality assurances have been breached. — informing respondents of the conditions of participation in a data collection and the anticipated uses of the information. — minimizing the contribution of time and effort asked of respondents, consistent with the purposes of the data collection activity.” We found that all four agencies had laws, regulations, or policies in place to maintain the confidentiality of data providers. The confidentiality provisions of Census, BEA, and NCHS are statutorily based. BLS relies on a commissioner’s order, which is similar in language to a statutory confidentiality provision, to state its treatment of the confidential nature of BLS’ records. Census is subject by law to strict confidentiality provisions controlling data it collects. The Census Bureau cannot “make any publication whereby the data furnished by any particular establishment or individual under this title can be identified.” The law also provides penalties for inappropriate disclosure of information or for uses other than statistical purposes and restricts access to data to Census employees. Two statutes contain confidentiality provisions that apply specifically to BEA. The provision in one statute broadly pertains to “any statistical information furnished in confidence” to BEA and provides that the information “shall be held to be confidential, and shall be used only for the statistical purposes for which it was supplied.” The provision of the other statute—the International Investment and Trade Services Survey Act—covers BEA’s direct investment and international services surveys. The provision specifies that the individual company data collected under the act can be used only for analytical and statistical purposes, and it limits access to the data to officials and employees of government agencies that are specifically designated by the president to perform functions under the act. A 1990 amendment to the act permits BEA to share data with Census and BLS to obtain those agencies’ more detailed, establishment-level data for the foreign-owned U.S. enterprises that report to BEA. NCHS is bound by the Public Health Service Act, as amended. Under the act, no information NCHS obtains in the course of statistical activities may be used for any purpose other than that for which it was supplied, unless authorized under regulations of the Secretary of Health and Human Services. BLS relies on a commissioner’s order to state its treatment of the confidential nature of BLS’ records. The order provides specific detail on how data are to be safeguarded. BLS sought legislation in 1990 to codify certain confidentiality protection, but Congress did not act on the legislation. We did not evaluate the effectiveness of statutory provisions or regulations in maintaining the confidentiality of the four agencies’ data providers. However, in 1993 NAS issued a report that dealt with confidentiality issues.The report concluded that opportunities existed for federal agencies to improve data protection without diminishing data access. Specifically, the report noted that unless pledges of confidentiality are backed by legal authority, they provide an inadequate shield against unauthorized administrative uses. In addition, the four agencies provided us with documentation that shows how they inform respondents of the conditions of participation in agency data collection and the anticipated uses of the data. For example, the agencies print on their questionnaires a notice of the confidential treatment to be accorded the information provided by respondents. The four agencies also attempt to minimize the time and effort asked of respondents by following the processes established by OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act. Under these processes, OMB must review and approve data collection questionnaires to ensure that the paperwork burden on the public is minimized. “An agency should fully describe its data and comment on their relevance to specific major uses. It should describe the methods used, the assumptions made, the limitations of data, the manners by which data linkages are made, and the results of research on the methods and data.” We found that all four agencies had documentation that established procedures for openness with data users in describing all aspects of the agencies’ data. (We did not verify agency compliance with these documented procedures.) Each agency makes a wide range of statistics and related information available to users and provides publications explaining the types of statistics it produces. Each agency also publishes analyses that include the relevance, methodology, assumptions, and results of the data. For example, monthly publications, such as BEA’s Survey of Current Business and BLS’ Monthly Labor Review, contain statistics and articles that describe how those statistics were compiled as well as the limitations of the data. Each of the four agencies provided us with documentation showing the procedures it is to follow for agency operations and data dissemination, including publication policies, types of data products, and publication and release schedules. “— Dissemination of data and information (basic series, analytic reports, press releases, public-use tapes) should be timely and public. Avenues of dissemination should be chosen to reach as broad a public as reasonably possible. — Release of information should not be subject to actual or perceived political interference. — An agency should have an established publications policy that describes, for a data collection program, the types of reports and other data releases to be made available, the audience to be served, and the frequency of release. — A policy for the preservation of data should guide what data to retain and how they are to be archived for secondary analysis.” In its guidelines, NAS included a series of steps that an agency should follow in releasing and preserving the data for which it is responsible. We found that the four agencies have policies in place for data dissemination and preservation that would meet this guideline. However, one aspect of this guideline indicates that the release of data should be free of political interference. As we discuss in the section on the NAS guideline for statistical agency independence, our previous work indicates that BEA has been subject to unfounded accusations that its data have been politically manipulated. The four agencies disseminate statistics and information on those statistics to the public. We found that all four generally choose methods of dissemination of information to reach a broad public audience. The processes and management of the distribution of statistical products (e.g., printed, microfiche, film, CD-ROM) are similar for each of the four agencies. All of the agencies have publications that describe the types of reports and other publications on statistical censuses and surveys that are available to the public. The purpose of these publications is also to introduce users to the data systems, to suggest research opportunities, and to indicate how and when data are made available. Each of these agencies has established orders and policies for the publishing, release, and distribution of statistics. Each agency requires all printed and electronic materials and speeches to be cleared by designated offices (e.g., the Office of Publications and Special Studies in BLS) before their release. The frequency of release of economic statistics for all federal statistical agencies is covered by an OMB directive. The processes and management regarding policies on archival preservation and records management are also similar for each of the four agencies. Each agency is subject to the standards established by the National Archives and Records Administration and the General Services Administration for records maintenance and the disposition of records through transfer to federal records centers. This NAS guideline emphasizes the importance of federal statistical agencies’ coordinating with each other as well as with state, local, foreign, and international statistical agencies when appropriate. The guidelines indicate that the most important aspect of coordination among federal agencies is the sharing of data. The statistical agencies have been active in recommending and supporting efforts to enhance data sharing. For example, for the past several years, the Statistics 2000 task force—composed of members from the major statistical agencies—has worked with OMB and Congress in developing proposals for enhanced data sharing. However, we found that data sharing among federal agencies was limited by the provisions designed to protect the confidentiality of individual data providers. The guideline also states that federal agencies should, when possible and appropriate, cooperate with state and local statistical agencies in the provision of subnational data. We found that the four agencies cooperated with state and local governments to the extent necessary to obtain the subnational data they needed. “Data sharing and statistical uses of administrative records make a statistical agency more effective as well as efficient.” The issue of data sharing among federal agencies for statistical purposes has been a long-standing and complicated problem. Because the federal statistical system is decentralized, different agencies are sometimes responsible for the various stages of statistics production. For example, Census conducts the Current Population Survey, which is the source of the nation’s monthly unemployment estimates, but BLS calculates and releases these estimates. Decentralization also results in different agencies’ obtaining data from the same source; for instance, both Census and the Department of Agriculture survey farm owners. However, agency confidentiality provisions discussed earlier that permit data to be seen only by the employees of a single agency present a formidable barrier to meeting the data sharing envisioned by the NAS guideline. In some instances, to comply with confidentiality requirements, agencies must duplicate the work being done by other agencies. For example, the National Agricultural Statistics Service of the Department of Agriculture must compile its own list of farms because it does not have access to the list of farms compiled by Census for conducting the agricultural census. Similarly, other agencies are not allowed access to Census’ Standard Statistical Establishment List for statistical sampling purposes. Because of provisions limiting access to Census records, other statistical agencies at times have had only limited access to data the agencies had paid Census to collect. While BLS and BEA have recently been allowed more access to these data from the Census Bureau, the problem still exists for other statistical agencies, including NCHS. Over the past decade, OMB has sought legislative changes that would allow greater sharing of data and information on data sources among agencies, but its efforts have met with little success. The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 gave the Director of OMB the authority to direct a statistical agency to share information it had collected with another statistical agency. However, this authority was limited since it did not apply to information that was covered by laws prohibiting disclosure outside the collecting agency. In the early 1980s, the statistical agencies, under OMB’s leadership, tried to further enable federal statistical agencies to share data. They attempted to synthesize, in a single bill, a set of confidentiality policies that could be applied consistently to all federal agencies or their components that collected data for statistical purposes. This effort, known as the “statistical enclave” bill, would have allowed statistical agencies to exchange information under specific controls intended to preserve the confidentiality of the data providers. A bill was introduced in Congress but was not enacted. During the Bush administration, OMB drafted legislation that would have permitted disclosure of information to statistical agencies on a case-by-case basis and only for statistical purposes. The legislation was not introduced in Congress. Some recent laws that established new statistical agencies or data requirements do permit data sharing among federal statistical agencies. The confidentiality provisions of the laws that created the National Agricultural Statistics Service and the National Center for Education Statistics allow these agencies to share their data with other agencies as long as confidentiality is maintained. The National Agricultural Statistics Service, for example, has used its statutory authority to facilitate data exchange agreements with Census. Similarly, to improve the quality of data on foreign direct investment in the United States, the Foreign Direct Investment and International Financial Data Improvements Act of 1990 required BEA and Census to share data and required BEA to provide data to BLS to develop establishment-level information on foreign direct investment in the United States. The act stipulated that the agencies maintain the confidentiality of data providers. The National Performance Review (NPR) recommended the elimination of legislative barriers to the exchange of business data among federal statistical agencies, and we agree with this recommendation. The NPR recommendation does not address the sharing of information on individuals. The NAS guideline on data sharing does not distinguish between data on businesses and data on individuals. Some officials of statistical agencies and Members of Congress, however, have argued that a distinction should be made between the sharing of business data and the sharing of personal data about individuals. They note that breaches of confidentiality protection for personal information may be more serious. “When possible and appropriate, federal statistical agencies should cooperate with state and local statistical agencies in the provision of data for subnational areas.” Each of the four agencies had cooperative arrangements with state and local governments for obtaining and disseminating statistical data. However, the extent and nature of these relationships differed by agency. BEA received most of the data necessary for its estimates on the domestic economy from other federal agencies and, as a result, had less direct contact with state agencies. BEA’s contacts with state and local governments were entirely focused on data dissemination. BEA provides state and county personal income estimates to over 200 state offices that disseminate the data to users within each state. BEA also makes its long-term regional projections of employment available before they are finalized to state planning offices to aid them in preparing their own projections. Census has extensive contact with state and local governments to cooperate in both disseminating and obtaining data. Census makes data available to state and local governments through designated State Data Centers at state statistical agencies or universities. Census also relies heavily upon state governments as data sources for data needed for population estimates, apart from the decennial census, and obtains financial and employment data from state and local governments for the economic census (including the Census of Governments) as well as for current economic reports. It also obtains comments from state and local governments on preliminary decennial census counts. Census does not, however, provide funding to state and local governments for any of the assistance they provide. NCHS has extensive contact with states to cooperate in collecting and disseminating health statistics. NCHS relies heavily on states for health-related information from birth, death, and marriage certificates. In 1995, NCHS provided $12.9 million to states to support their health statistical systems. NCHS also works with the states to develop designated state centers for health statistics that collect and disseminate data, but it does not provide direct funding for these centers. BLS has had extensive contacts with states since 1917 when BLS inaugurated its current employment statistics program. This program encouraged states to develop their own statistical offices to standardize, increase coverage of, and prevent duplication of data on the part of federal and state governments. BLS relies on states to collect data for the Labor Market Information program and the Occupational Safety and Health Statistics program. BLS provides guidance, training, and federal funds for operational expenses. BLS’ fiscal year 1995 budget proposed purchasing $80.8 million in statistical services from state and local governments. “Circumstances of different agencies may govern the exact form independence takes. Some aspects of independence, not all of which are required, are the following: — independence mandated in organic legislation or encouraged by organizational structure. In essence, a statistical agency must be distinct from the enforcement and policy-making activities carried out by the department in which the agency is located. To be credible, a statistical agency must clearly be impartial. It must avoid even the appearance that its collection and reporting of data might be manipulated for political purposes or that individually identifiable data might be turned over for administrative, regulatory, or enforcement purposes. — independence of the agency head and recognition that he or she should be professionally qualified. Appointment by the President with approval by the Senate, for a specific term not coincident with that of the administration, strengthens the independence of an agency head. Direct access to the secretary of the department or head of the independent agency in which the statistical agency is located is important. — broad authority over scope, content, and frequency of data collected, compiled, or published. Most statistical agencies have broad authority, limited by budgetary restraints, departmental pressures, Office of Management and Budget (OMB) review, and congressional mandates. — primary authority for selection and promotion of professional staff. — recognition by policy officials outside the statistical agency of its authority to release statistical information without prior clearance. — authority for statistical agency heads and qualified staff to speak on the agency’s statistical program before Congress, with congressional staff, and before public bodies. — adherence to predetermined schedules in public release of important economic or other indicator data to prevent manipulation of release dates for political purposes. — maintenance of a clear distinction between the release of statistical information and the policy interpretations of such statements by the secretary of the department, the President, or others.” Since the guideline states that agencies need not meet all the aspects to be independent, we generally examined how each agency safeguards its independence. We found that for each agency laws and/or regulations existed to protect the agency’s independence. However, we found that BEA has had problems in one of the most important aspects of this guideline—avoiding the appearance that its data are subject to manipulation. Although we found no evidence that BEA’s data have been subject to political manipulation, BEA at times has had to address allegations that the data were politically tainted. Legislative mandates and organizational placement afford a degree of independence to each of the four agencies. Each agency is organizationally distinct from its department’s enforcement and policymaking activities. Officials from each of the four agencies told us that the agencies were not directly involved in their respective department’s policymaking or program implementation. However, the agencies differ in their organizational placement within their parent departments, ranging from BLS at the highest organizational level to NCHS several levels lower. We were unable to establish whether the level of organizational placement affected the independence of the four statistical agencies. The BLS Commissioner and the Census Director are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, while the directors of BEA and NCHS are appointed within their respective departments and are not subject to Senate confirmation. The BLS Commissioner reports directly to the Secretary of Labor. Census and BEA are in the Economics and Statistics Administration of the Commerce Department, and their directors report to the Under Secretary in charge of that Administration. NCHS is a division of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the Public Health Service, which are all within the Department of Health and Human Services. From its inception in 1977 until 1987, NCHS was placed in the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health. Some observers argue that a statistical agency is more appropriately placed at an assistant secretary level, primarily because this is a higher level within the department and can exercise more budgetary control. We were unable to determine the amount of access the four agency heads had to the secretaries of the departments in which their agencies are located. According to members of the CNSTAT panel that wrote the guidelines, BLS served as a model for CNSTAT in fashioning those aspects of the guideline dealing with the process for appointing agency heads. The BLS Commissioner is appointed by the president, confirmed by the Senate, and has a 4-year term, which is renewable. The fact that the Commissioner can be reappointed has helped BLS maintain its continuity of leadership over the years. The previous Commissioner, who was appointed in 1979, served three terms until December 1991. Since its inception in 1884, BLS has had only 11 commissioners. The Census Director is appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, but the term traditionally has been concurrent with administrations, and the director has served at the “pleasure of the President.” The Director of NCHS is a career position and not a presidential appointment. The BEA Director also is a career position and is appointed by the Under Secretary of Commerce for Economic Affairs. Although the NAS guideline indicates that independence is best ensured when a statistical agency head is appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, BEA and NCHS have benefited from the continuity of having career directors, particularly BEA. Throughout its history, BEA has had stable leadership from career civil servants who have been experts in the field of economic statistics. BEA’s first Director was also Director of BEA’s predecessor, the Office of Business Economics, and he served from 1950 to 1964. The second BEA Director served from 1964 to 1985. The third Director served until 1992, and the fourth Director, who left office this year, previously served as Deputy Director. In contrast to BEA, the recent experiences of Census and BLS illustrate that presidential appointment and confirmation procedures can take a year or longer, leaving an agency without a formal head for extended periods of time. For example, for the last 15 years Census has had an acting director for 42 months (23 percent of the time); in the last 5 years, Census has had an acting director for 23 months (38 percent of the time). The position of Director of the Census Bureau was vacant from January 1993 until October 1994. Similarly, BLS was without a Commissioner from the previous Commissioner’s retirement in December 1991 until the current Commissioner’s confirmation in October 1993. Currently, BEA and NCHS have acting directors. The recent heads of the four agencies have professional qualifications for their positions. Each had advanced degrees in statistics, economics, or other relevant fields (e.g., medicine). Each also came from a profession that entails extensively dealing with statistical data and measurement issues. Congress is a major user of the statistics produced by all four of the agencies. The heads of the agencies testify before congressional committees about the results of their statistical activities and to explain their budget requests. The agency heads also appear regularly at user conferences to discuss aspects of their statistical programs. As the NAS guideline indicates, one of the ways in which the federal statistical system can guard against the perception of political interference is by carefully controlling the release of important statistical data. The release of economic statistical data produced by Census, BLS, and BEA is governed by OMB Statistical Policy Directive No. 3. (Because NCHS produces health and not economic data, it is not subject to this policy directive.) Statistical Policy Directive No. 3 provides guidance to federal statistical agencies on the compilation, release, and evaluation of principal federal economic indicators. The directive establishes the authority of the agencies to release statistical information without prior clearance or policy interpretations. Procedures established by this directive were designed to ensure that key economic data that are the basis for government and private sector actions and plans are released promptly and on a regular schedule, that no one benefits from “inside” access to the data before they are available to the public, and that there is public confidence in the integrity of the data. Also, the directive does not limit the authority of the agencies over the scope, content, and frequency of economic data collected, compiled, or published. Statistical Policy Directive No. 3 has established procedures to protect against manipulation of the timing or content of major economic data. The procedures are also designed to defend against accusations of political interference. NCHS also controls the release of its data, makes the data available through the National Technical Information Service, and publishes its data in other federal publications (e.g., Census’ Statistical Abstracts). Each December, OMB publishes a schedule of the major economic statistical releases for the next year. For example, OMB has announced release dates for quarterly data, such as the GDP and personal income, before the beginning of each calendar year. The agencies responsible for economic statistics provide the information on release schedules to OMB in accordance with the directive. Because most major federal statistics are released according to a set schedule, the four statistical agencies do not need to seek clearance from policy officials in their respective departments. Similarly, these release schedules help to maintain a distinction between the four agencies’ statistical releases and the policy interpretations of the statistics by department or administration officials. The four agencies, for the most part, adhere to the other aspects of this guideline. According to officials from each of the agencies, their agencies have some authority over the scope, content, and frequency of data collection, compilation, or publication. However, this authority is limited by budgetary constraints and federal regulations, such as those intended to reduce paperwork burdens on businesses and individuals. Officials from the four agencies also noted that the heads of their agencies had primary authority for selection and promotion of professional staff. Data such as those issued by the four agencies shed light on economic and social conditions prevailing in the country. The press and public use these data as indicators of the impact of the policies of the administration in office. Political leaders recognize this impact and have occasionally considered attempting to control the release of statistical data in advantageous ways. It is therefore important that the data released by statistical agencies not be manipulated for political purposes nor tainted by a perception that such manipulation may have occurred. However, we noted in our 1993 report that some BEA and BLS actions may have contributed to the perception of interference. In this 1993 report, we examined how BEA had come to be falsely accused of manipulating economic data and how it dealt with these allegations. The incident began in October 1991 when an article appearing in Barron’s alleged that BEA, in order to inflate the first quarter 1991 GDP for political purposes, did not incorporate BLS’ downward revision of employment levels into its estimates of state personal income growth. Another Barron’s article appeared in December 1991 asserting that BEA increased other components of the GDP to ensure that there was no economic impact from the employment revision in the GDP. Through the rest of 1991 and 1992, the press continued to raise questions and concerns about the integrity and accuracy of BEA’s economic statistics as well as BLS employment data. Our 1993 review revealed no evidence of political interference or manipulation of the first quarter GDP estimates. We found that BEA had properly incorporated employment revisions in its GDP estimates. We also noted that both BEA and BLS followed their standard data release policies and that the integrity of the GDP statistics was sound. However, we concluded that BEA had not adequately publicly documented or explained its procedures for incorporating employment data into its GDP estimates. We also concluded that BEA had not responded to the allegations when they first occurred, which fueled suspicions that the estimated GDP had been manipulated. We recommended that BEA formulate a strategy to provide better explanation and documentation of its procedures to general users and assure Congress and the general public of the integrity and credibility of its estimates. Fulfilling this recommendation in May 1993, the Director of BEA forwarded to the Secretary of Commerce “A Strategy to Improve the Perceived Integrity of BEA’s Estimates.” This strategy calls for BEA to communicate more clearly and widely about technical factors affecting its estimates through a combination of new technical notes, testimony, briefings, and availability of the Director to talk with the media. This strategy is to include greater communication about BEA’s procedures and safeguards to protect the independence and integrity of its statistical estimates. All four statistical agencies generally followed most aspects of the NAS guidelines discussed in this report. Each agency had a clear and well-defined mission and procedures designed to enhance cooperation with data users. Each agency had procedures to maintain the confidentiality of data providers, inform respondents of data collection rights and uses of the data, and minimize the time and effort asked of respondents. In addition, each agency was open with data users in describing the statistics available, methodology used, and related information. We found that the four agencies had policies that generally provided for the dissemination and preservation of their data. One of the NAS guidelines calls for coordination among federal statistical agencies. Although the four agencies generally followed this guideline, coordination among federal agencies was sometimes hampered by legal restrictions designed to protect the confidentiality of data providers. OMB and the statistical agencies have unsuccessfully sought legislative changes that would lessen data-sharing restrictions among federal agencies. Finally, while each agency has policies and procedures to ensure its independent authority to release statistical information, we found that a statistical agency can sometimes communicate data in such a way that may leave users with the misperception that the data had been manipulated for political purposes. NAS’ guidelines focused on the principles and practices that NAS determined were essential for the effective operation of federal statistical agencies. However, these agencies do not carry out their statistical activities in isolation but as part of an interdependent federal statistical system. An interdependent system requires good coordination to operate effectively. Such coordination is especially important considering funding limitations faced by all federal agencies. Legislation requires that OMB, among other responsibilities for the statistical system, coordinate the budgets of the statistical agencies to ensure that the budgets conform to governmentwide statistical priorities. Many of the agencies in the federal statistical system produce statistics to aid only in the administration of mission-related programs for which they are responsible. However, several, including the four agencies that are the focus of this report, produce statistics as their primary missions. Since no one agency is responsible for the collection and production of all of the nation’s statistical needs, agencies often must work together to ensure that these statistical needs are met efficiently. Thus, agencies that collect information in a particular statistical area often must coordinate with the agencies that analyze and disseminate this information. For example, BLS relies on Census to conduct the monthly Current Population Survey from which BLS derives monthly unemployment statistics. Similarly, although the U.S. Customs Service collects information on the country’s imports and exports, Census is responsible for analyzing and disseminating this information as the nation’s merchandise trade statistics. The agencies of the federal statistical system also must share the limited funds available for performing statistical activities. The financial interdependence of the federal statistical system is illustrated by the flow of funds among the four agencies and between these and other agencies throughout the government. For example, NCHS pays Census to conduct NCHS’ National Health Interview Survey, which is a source of much of the health data that NCHS issues. Similarly, BLS pays Census for a major part of the cost of the Current Population Survey, which BLS uses to produce unemployment estimates. BEA relies greatly on the data provided by BLS, Census, and other agencies to produce the National Income and Product Accounts. OMB estimated in the President’s 1995 budget that federal agencies provided $467 million to the federal statistical agencies through reimbursements for statistical work, such as conducting surveys. This amount represents about 15 percent of total federal funding for the 72 statistical agencies. Moreover, these statistical agencies were collectively budgeted $232.5 million, which is 9.1 percent of their total direct funding, to purchase, through reimbursable agreements, statistical services from each other. Figures 3.1 and 3.2 show fiscal year 1995 reimbursable services and purchases of statistical data, respectively, as a percentage of total funding among the four agencies discussed in this report. In the past few years, limited funding has been available for all statistical activities, and, as discussed earlier, some statistical agencies reimburse other agencies for performing statistical services. Figure 3.3 shows actual budgets for all federal statistical activities, including decennial censuses, for the period from 1981 through 1995 in current dollars for the year when the budgets were approved and in constant 1995 dollars to adjust for inflation over time. Figure 3.4 shows the same information, excluding the 10-year cycle of spending for decennial censuses, which peaks during the year the census is conducted. (The 10-year cycle of the decennial Census of Population and Housing is not the only periodic cycle in the data. Several other Census programs, such as the Economic Census and the Census of Agriculture, are conducted on a 5-year cycle, including 1992.) Funding for federal statistical activities, excluding the 10-year large spending cycle for decennial censuses, has increased in the past 10 years in constant dollars, from $1,947 million in 1986 to an estimated $2,508 million in 1995. However, the increase was less than the amount of funding that federal statistical agency officials believed would have been needed to adequately maintain the federal statistical system, given the changes in the economy and society. In 1990, the Bush administration introduced the Economics Statistics Initiative to improve the coverage and quality of economic statistics. In fiscal years 1993 and 1994, Census, BLS, and BEA collectively received 51 percent of their requests for funds for Economics Statistics Initiative work. In its 1993 budget message, the Bush administration noted that, because parts of the Economics Statistics Initiative were not funded by Congress, some statistical activities had to absorb reductions in order to provide funding for limited improvements in economic statistics. The message went on to state that further improvements in economic statistics would require more resources. “Our measurements of economic performance are perforated with gaps in areas of vital importance, areas of public policy concern are poorly measured if measured at all, the data gathering system imposes too great a workload on both the agencies that gather the data and the firms that provide it, and the resulting product goes underutilized in a world in which timely and accurate information is often the key to competitive business success.” As a consequence, the budget proposed increases of $8.6 million for Census, $17.2 million for BLS (including $5.2 million for its 10-year CPI revision), $8.1 million for BEA, and $4.4 million for other statistical agencies. The two administrations requested a total of $94 million for fiscal years 1990 through 1994 for improving the quality and coverage of economic statistics; Congress appropriated about $49 million. Because agencies often share responsibilities for the production of federal statistics, it is important that they closely coordinate their efforts to the extent permitted by law so that the quality of the end statistical product is maintained. It is also important that the efforts of these agencies be coordinated in order to avoid duplication and to ensure that the limited funding available for statistical activities is used as effectively and efficiently as possible. The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 assigned responsibility for coordination of the federal statistical system to OMB. Budget reviews are one way to ensure such coordination among statistical agencies. The Statistical Policy Branch in OMB is responsible for, among other responsibilities, coordinating the budgets of these agencies. The Branch prepares a consolidated report on budgets for agency statistical programs that have recently been submitted to Congress after it has begun acting on individual agency budgets. In many respects, this is due to the difficulty in determining resources allocated for statistical programs in the 60 or so agencies that are not primarily statistical in character. Consequently, Congress has not had a current consolidated picture of federal statistical activities during its budget deliberations that would provide a basis for setting priorities and allocating funding accordingly. The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 reauthorizes OMB’s budget coordination responsibilities for statistical activities. OMB and its predecessor, the Bureau of the Budget, have been responsible for oversight of the federal statistical system by coordinating federal statistical agency budgets for decades. During the 1960s, OMB’s Statistical Policy and Coordination Office had a staff of about 50 and was responsible for setting statistical policy and budgetary priorities. The broad-based, detailed budget reviews by the Bureau of the Budget, and later by OMB, were in part intended to determine if agency budgets supported these priorities. OMB also prepared an analysis of budgetary needs for the federal statistical system that was included in the Presidents’ budgets when they were submitted to Congress in January every year. The Statistical Policy and Coordination Office at OMB was abolished in 1977, and its functions and some staff were transferred to the Department of Commerce. While at the Department of Commerce, staff attended OMB decision sessions, but they had little input in decisionmaking. Before the functions were transferred, the office employed 25 staff. In 1980, the Paperwork Reduction Act returned to OMB the statistical policy and coordination functions and the staff to carry them out. Currently, OMB’s Statistical Policy Branch is responsible for these functions and has a professional staff of five. The act does not determine the number of employees needed to carry out these functions. The former broad-based, crosscutting review of statistical programs was not part of the budget process after the 1980 act was implemented. The need for strong oversight and coordination of the decentralized federal statistical system was recognized in law by the enactment of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. The act created the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) in OMB and assigned the Director of OMB and the Administrator of OIRA the responsibility for overseeing the federal statistical system and coordinating its activities. OIRA’s Statistical Policy Branch functions include the following: • developing and reviewing long-range plans for the improved coordination and performance of federal statistical activities and programs; • reviewing agencies’ budget proposals to ensure that the proposals are consistent with the plans; • coordinating the functions of the federal government that concern gathering, interpreting, and disseminating statistical information; • developing and implementing governmentwide policies, principles, standards, and guidelines concerning data sources, data collection procedures and methods, and data dissemination; • evaluating statistical program performance and agency compliance with governmentwide policies, principles, standards, and guidelines; and integrating these functions with other information resources management functions of the government. The Statistical Policy Branch is headed by a chief statistician who is appointed by the Administrator of OIRA. The Statistical Policy Branch currently has a professional staff of four working with the chief statistician, whose professional responsibilities are divided as follows: • An economist is responsible for economic statistics, statistical policy directives, standard industrial classification, standard occupational classification, and the definition of poverty and serves as the BEA paperwork clearance desk officer. • A mathematical statistician is responsible for methodology; natural resource, energy, environment, and agriculture statistics; and statistical legislation and serves as the Bureau of the Census’ economic surveys paperwork clearance desk officer. • A policy analyst is responsible for international statistical coordination; health and education statistics; the Survey of Income and Program Participation; the Branch’s annual report, Statistical Programs of the U.S. Government; a schedule of release dates for principal economic indicators; and classification of race and ethnicity. • A statistician is responsible for demographic statistics, the decennial census, metropolitan areas, and the Federal Committee on Statistical Methodology and serves as Census’ demographic surveys paperwork clearance desk officer. “The greatest industrial nation in the world with the largest, most complex society and economy now lacks effective capacity for central coordination of its statistical activities. This is a crippling loss since ours is the most decentralized, if not fragmented, statistical system in the industrial world.” “Economic policy will require the best possible measure of the factors critical for growth and an awareness of areas where uncertainty prevails. Serving the needs of policy makers in a time of change will require a coordinated response of the Nation’s statistical agencies. The present management of the statistical agencies makes such a response difficult.” In a 1991 report, NAS noted that in addition to budget and staffing constraints, the interagency coordination of the federal statistical system in the previous decade had suffered a reduction in its ability to draw on and integrate information from a range of databases, particularly administrative records, and a lag in the reporting of the classification of business categories, such as the service industry. NAS concluded that the results of this reduction and lag were reductions in the timeliness, quantity, and quality of policy-relevant data and an inaccurate portrayal of the nation’s economy. In a 1992 report, the Congressional Research Service (CRS) came to a similar conclusion. It characterized the coordination of the federal statistical system as “an opera without a conductor.” CRS stated that one of the major barriers to coordinating the statistical system was OMB’s insufficient funding to maintain adequate staff to carry out this coordination responsibility. CRS noted that OMB’s responsibilities for the oversight and coordination of the statistical system and those for the reduction of paperwork competed against other OMB responsibilities for funding and staff. As part of its responsibility for coordinating the federal statistical system, the Statistical Policy Branch is to coordinate the statistical agencies’ budget requests, which it does in detail for the 10 largest statistical agencies. The budget process can be one of the primary tools for ensuring that the nation’s statistical needs are being addressed effectively and efficiently by federal statistical agencies. However, according to published studies of OMB’s coordination role, including those by CRS, the Office of Technology Assessment, and NAS, the Branch does not do the detailed, systemwide budget reviews required by the act. These reviews are to enable OMB to determine if the budgetary resources available for statistical programs are being directed where they are most needed. The Branch’s current role in coordinating federal statistical agency budgets consists of reviewing budget submissions from the major statistical agencies and coordinating with OMB Resource Management Offices responsible for individual agency accounts to promote compliance with the administration’s funding priorities for statistical agencies. The Branch also reviews some other budget requests on an ad hoc basis determined by the importance of the statistical product being funded.\n\n### Summary:", "answer": "Pursuant to a congressional request, GAO evaluated the performance of the Bureaus of the Census, Economic Analysis, and Labor Statistics, and the National Center for Health Statistics based on selected National Academy of Sciences (NAS) guidelines. GAO also provided information on the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) role in coordinating and overseeing the statistical activities of the 72 agencies that constitute the federal statistical system. GAO found that: (1) the four agencies adhered, with only minor exceptions, to five of the seven selected NAS guidelines; (2) the NAS guidelines emphasize the importance of a statistical agency maintaining the credibility of its data and that it be perceived as free from political interference and policy advocacy; (3) coordination and sharing between federal, state, and local statistical agencies increased their effectiveness and efficiency; (4) in general, each agency had a clearly defined and well-accepted mission statement, cooperated with data users, treated data providers fairly, openly described to users all aspects of its data, and widely disseminated its data; (5) the agencies did not fully adhere to the guideline on protecting their independence from political influence because they did not always sufficiently communicate their procedures to data users; (6) the agencies could not fully coordinate with other statistical agencies because of statute limitations to protect data providers' confidentiality; (7) OMB oversight and coordination of agencies' statistical activities is limited by a lack of staff resources; and (8) OMB is revising its formal process for reviewing statistical agencies' budgets in order to allocate its resources for coordination more effectively."}

Self-Employment: For veterans who have the skills to start a business, and for whom self-employment is the best or only option for successful rehabilitation. fiscal year 2011 and is currently 2,700. VR&E anticipates an increase in future demand for IL benefits. All veterans are required to meet VR&E’s basic entitlement criteria before they are assigned to one of its five tracks. To be entitled to VR&E services, veterans must generally have at least a 20 percent service- connected disability rating and be in need of rehabilitation because of an employment handicap. The period of eligibility for which veterans can receive benefits from VR&E is 12 years and begins on either (1) the date of separation from active military duty, or (2) the date that VA notifies the veteran of his or her service-connected disability rating. The 12-year eligibility period may be deferred or extended if certain conditions prevent the veteran from participating in a rehabilitation program or if a veteran has a serious employment handicap. To be considered for the IL track, veterans must meet all of VR&E’s eligibility requirements and be deemed currently unable to pursue an employment goal. VR&E’s Central Office, located in Washington D.C., has responsibility for several areas, including (1) overseeing the implementation of the VR&E program, including the IL track, (2) developing program policies and procedures, and regional guidance, and (3) formulating and monitoring the agency’s budget and program expenditures. Currently, there are 56 VA regional offices with responsibility for administering the IL track in their jurisdiction. Reporting to these regional offices are 179 satellite offices that help ensure veterans who do not live near a regional office are able to access VR&E benefits, including those provided through the IL track (see fig. 1). The VR&E Officer in each regional office is responsible for ensuring that the office complies with national policies and procedures for monitoring performance to ensure VR&E’s national rehabilitation rate is met. In addition, this officer supervises regional Vocational Rehabilitation Counselors (VRCs) who are responsible for working directly with veterans to assess their IL needs and provide benefits. VR&E has established a formal process that all veterans must go through to receive any of the benefits offered through its five tracks (see fig. 2). It is not possible to be assigned to any of the five tracks without first applying and being accepted into the VR&E program. An individualized IL plan is developed for each veteran admitted to the IL track. This plan identifies the veteran’s IL goals, the benefits (goods and services) VR&E will provide to help the veteran meet those goals, estimated time frames for providing benefits, and how improvements in the veteran’s independence will be measured, among other areas (see fig. 3). In general, IL plans may not exceed 24 months except under certain circumstances. According to officials, there is also no statutory limit on the number of IL plans a veteran can have. Veterans can reapply to the VR&E program at any time. Furthermore, all IL plans are required to be reviewed and approved by the veteran, the VRC, and the VR&E Officer before the veteran is admitted to the IL track. Once the plan is approved, VRCs are required to meet with the veteran at least once a month to track progress in meeting the plan’s goals. In addition, VRCs are required to coordinate with other VA programs to determine if they can provide any of the goods and services identified in the veteran’s plan. The VA programs that officials told us they regularly coordinate with are: VBA’s Specially Adapted Housing (SAH) Program, which helps servicemembers and veterans with certain service-connected disabilities purchase or construct an adapted home, or modify an existing home to accommodate a disability. These modifications can include specially adapted bathrooms or the installation of exit ramps. VHA medical centers, which provide a wide range of health-related services to veterans, such as physical therapy and dental and optometry services. In addition, VHA’s Prosthetic and Sensory Aids Service (PSAS) provides a variety of medical devices and equipment to veterans, including artificial limbs, eyeglasses, hearing aids, hospital beds, and wheelchairs. PSAS also administers the Home Improvements and Structural Alterations grant to eligible veterans for home modifications, such as the widening of bedroom or bathroom doorways to allow wheelchair access. If the goods and services needed cannot be obtained through other VA sources, the VR&E program will purchase them directly or contract for them. VR&E may declare a veteran successfully “rehabilitated” when all goals in their IL plan have been achieved, or if not all achieved, when the following three conditions have been met: (1) the veteran has attained a substantial increase in the level of independence; (2) the veteran has maintained the increased level of independence for at least 60 days; and (3) further assistance is unlikely to significantly increase the veteran’s level of independence. “Rehabilitation” does not necessarily mean that a veteran’s disability has improved, but rather that the goals in the veteran’s IL plan have been met to facilitate their independence. When veterans are not successfully rehabilitated, their case may be closed as “discontinued.” When circumstances arise that affect the ability of VR&E to provide the goods and services identified in the IL plan to the veteran, VR&E can temporarily “interrupt” the veteran’s case until it becomes possible to continue. From fiscal years 2008 through 2011, the typical participant in the IL track was an older male Vietnam-era veteran. Of the 9,215 veterans who entered the IL track at some point during these years, most (67 percent) were males 50 years old or older. Most women in the IL track were in their 40s or 50s (see fig. 4). The gender and age distributions of IL track veterans were similar to those of veterans who were receiving VA Disability Compensation cash benefits. In fiscal year 2011, about 92 percent of these veterans were male, and almost 68 percent were age 55 or older. Most of the 9,215 veterans who entered the IL track during fiscal years 2008 through 2011 served in the Vietnam War. However, there was a slight increase in the number of “Global War on Terrorism” veterans— including those who served during the war in Afghanistan as part of Operation Enduring Freedom and the war in Iraq as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom—from 13 percent in fiscal year 2008 to 16 percent in fiscal year 2011 (see fig. 5). In addition, almost 60 percent of IL track veterans served in the U.S. Army and less than 1 percent served in the National Guard or Reserves. Forty-one percent served in the U.S Navy, U.S. Air Force, or U.S. Marine Corps (see fig. 6). With regard to severity of service-connected disabilities, more than three- quarters of IL track veterans had a combined service-connected rating of at least 60 percent. Thirty-four percent of IL track veterans had a combined service-connected disability rating of 100 percent. Many IL track veterans may have also been eligible for the VA Disability Compensation program’s Individual Unemployability cash benefit. Indeed, 38 percent of IL track veterans were eligible for this supplement to their disability compensation payments. Moreover, of those IL track veterans who were at least 60 years old, 85 percent had combined service-connected disability ratings of at least 60 percent and more than a third had combined ratings of 100 percent. IL track veterans had a wide variety of service-connected disabilities, and most had more than one. Regardless of disability rating level, the most prevalent disabilities among this group were Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), tinnitus (“ringing in the ears”), and hearing loss. As shown in figure 7, many of these disabilities—7 of the top 10 we identified in these cases—are similar to the most prevalent conditions among veterans rated by VA’s Disability Compensation program in fiscal year 2011. Our review of the case files of 182 randomly selected IL track veterans in fiscal year 2008 shows that they were provided a wide range of goods and services to help them live independently. Goods and services ranged from individual counseling and the installation of ramps to improve accessibility of veterans’ homes, to a boat, camping gear, and computers intended by VA to help decrease veterans’ social isolation. Figure 8 provides examples of the types of benefits provided in four IL track cases we reviewed. (See appendix III for a complete list of goods and services we identified in 182 IL track cases.) While VR&E can provide a wide range of benefits to IL track veterans, VR&E’s policy as of November 2012 prohibits providing courses of study and training to veterans that would lead to academic degrees, and purchasing certain types of equipment, such as lawn tractors. Our review of fiscal year 2008 IL cases shows instances where VR&E purchased lawn tractors and a riding mower. However, VR&E officials told us that there was no specific guidance prohibiting provision of such equipment in that year. As shown in table 1, we classified the wide range of goods and services we found in the 182 IL track case files we reviewed into nine general categories: Although we were unable to estimate the number of times certain goods and services were provided in the 182 IL track cases we reviewed, we generally found that the most common type of goods or services provided in the cases we reviewed were in three categories: 1) counseling, 2) education and training, and 3) computer and camera equipment. We were, however, able to estimate the costs of the goods and services purchased for IL track cases. For all veterans who entered the IL track in fiscal year 2008, we estimate that VR&E purchased a total of almost $14 million in goods and services. The average spent on purchases of goods and services per IL track case that year was nearly $6,000. In the 182 IL track cases we reviewed, the total amount VR&E spent on purchases of goods and services per veteran varied from $20 to over $33,000. Nearly 40 percent of the 182 veterans received $4,000 or more on purchases of goods and services (see fig. 9). Based on our analysis of IL track veterans who began only one plan during fiscal year 2008, we found that most of these veterans were classified by VR&E as “rehabilitated”—successfully reaching and maintaining the goals identified in their IL plan. By the end of fiscal year 2011, as shown in figure 10, about 89 percent of veterans who began an IL plan in fiscal year 2008 had been classified by VR&E as “rehabilitated.” About 5 percent of cases were “discontinued” or closed by VR&E because the rehabilitation goals in the veteran’s IL plan were not completed. The remaining 6 percent of veterans’ cases were still open at the end of fiscal year 2011. Of the 122 IL cases from fiscal year 2008 that had been discontinued, we found that about half were discontinued because the veteran declined benefits or did not respond when VA attempted to contact them. Another 29 percent were discontinued because the veteran died. Also, some VR&E officials and staff we spoke with during our site visits told us that veterans may drop out of the IL track for other reasons, such as their condition worsens or they experience family problems. Furthermore, while most veterans were classified by VR&E as “rehabilitated,” we found that the nature and complexity of IL plans can vary based on veterans’ individual disabilities and needs. As such, some plans are easier for VR&E to close as rehabilitated than others. For example, in one case we reviewed, the IL plan for a veteran with rheumatoid arthritis only called for the purchase and installation of eight door levers and a grab rail for the bathtub, so that the veteran could enter the rooms of his home without pain or assistance, and be able to safely enter and exit the bathtub without fear of falling. Other cases were more complex to close as rehabilitated because of the nature of services being provided to the veteran. For instance, another case we reviewed called for providing a veteran who used a wheel-chair with medical, dental, and vision care as needed and about $24,000 in modifications to the veteran’s home, including modifying the veteran’s bathroom, widening doors and modifying thresholds, and installing an emergency exit ramp in a bedroom. While the overall IL rehabilitation rate nationwide of 89 percent is fairly high, we found that the percentage of veterans who began an IL plan in fiscal year 2008 and were rehabilitated by the end of fiscal year 2011 varied by regional office. IL rehabilitation rates in these cases ranged from 0 to 100 percent across regional offices, although about two-thirds of regional offices had rehabilitated 80 percent or more of 2008 IL track veterans by the end of fiscal year 2011. (See appendix IV for a complete list of rehabilitation rates for all regional offices.) In addition, VR&E’s IL rehabilitation rate was higher in regional offices with larger IL caseloads. Among veterans who entered the IL track in fiscal year 2008, an average of 90 percent were rehabilitated at offices with more than 25 IL entrants, compared to an average of 79 percent at offices with 25 or fewer IL entrants (see fig. 11). Furthermore, we found that fiscal year 2008 IL track veterans nationwide completed their IL plans, i.e., were classified rehabilitated, in an average of 384 days (about 13 months). About 50 percent of these veterans completed their IL plans within 1 year, 79 percent within 2 years, and 88 percent within 3 years. Average days for these IL track veterans to complete their plans varied by regional office from a low of 150 days at the St. Paul Regional Office to a high of 895 days at the Roanoke Regional Office. However, at most regional offices (49 of 53) the average time to complete IL plans ranged from 226 to 621 days (8 to 21 months). (See appendix V for a complete list of rehabilitation times for all regional offices.) Also, as shown in figure 12, IL track veterans generally completed their plans in less time at regional offices with larger IL caseloads than at offices with smaller caseloads. The average time for veterans to complete their IL plans also varied by veteran age. The oldest veterans completed their plans slightly more quickly than the youngest. More specifically, veterans who were 70 to 79 completed their plans in an average of 369 days, while those who were 20 to 29 completed them in an average of 413 days (see fig. 13). Because differences in the length of time to complete IL plans could have occurred by chance or be explained by many factors—including the type and severity of disability or veteran age—we used a statistical model to estimate the amount of time it would take certain groups of IL track veterans to complete their IL plans while controlling for type and severity of disability and other demographic characteristics. (See appendix II for more detailed information on our model and analysis.) The results of our model showed that the chance of rehabilitation within 2 years varied by regional office. At four regional offices the chance of being rehabilitated within 2 years was less than 50 percent. At 18 offices the chance was between 50 and less than 90 percent. At 16 offices the chance was 90 percent or greater. Our model also estimated that a veteran served by a regional office with a large IL caseload had a higher probability of completing an IL plan more quickly than a veteran served by an office with a small IL caseload. More specifically, we determined that a typical IL track veteran at an office with a total of 75 IL cases entering the IL track during fiscal years 2008 through 2011 had a 48 percent chance of completing an IL plan within 1 year and a 92 percent chance of completing an IL plan within 3 years, while a veteran at a regional office with 700 IL cases had a 57 percent chance of completing an IL plan within 1 year and a 96 percent chance of completing their plan within 3 years (see fig. 14). Finally, based on our model we estimated that older veterans had a higher probability of completing an IL plan more quickly than younger veterans. For example, a 75 year old veteran had a 41 percent chance of completing an IL plan within one year, while a 30 year old veteran had a 33 percent chance. We found no meaningful differences in the time it takes to complete an IL plan as “rehabilitated” according to veteran gender and most disability types. However, we found small differences according to length of military service, education, and combined service-connected disability rating (see appendix II). National oversight of VR&E’s IL track is limited in four key areas: (1) ensuring compliance with case management requirements; (2) monitoring regional variation in IL track caseload and benefits provided; (3) adequacy of policies and procedures for approving expenditures on goods and services for IL track veterans; and (4) availability of critical program management information. Based on VR&E’s compliance reports from two of the regional offices we visited and interviews with staff in these offices, we found that some offices may not be complying with certain VR&E case management requirements governing the IL track. Specifically, some Vocational Rehabilitation Counselors (VRC) are not fulfilling VR&E’s requirement to meet in-person each month with IL track veterans to monitor progress in completing their IL plans. Site visit monitoring reports from two regional offices we visited indicated that these offices faced difficulties complying with this requirement. According to these reports, some VRCs were not able to schedule monthly in-person meetings with IL track veterans to check their progress in completing their IL plans. In addition, VRCs we spoke with during our site visits said that compliance with this requirement continues to be a challenge due to the size of their caseloads and the distances that they have to travel to meet with veterans. While VR&E’s Central Office acknowledges that it can be challenging for some offices to comply with this requirement, officials stated that face-to-face contact with IL track veterans is extremely important due to the nature of their disabilities and the need for more intensive rehabilitation services. Furthermore, while VR&E and VHA both have policies that require them to coordinate on the provision of goods and services for IL track veterans, we found that some VRCs experience challenges in doing so. Specifically, VA regulations governing VR&E’s IL track require that if a veteran needs special equipment and is eligible for such equipment under another VA program, the items will be provided under that program. Therefore, prior to VR&E purchasing services for veterans, officials told us that VRCs are required to refer cases to other VA providers, such as VHA’s Home Improvements and Structural Alterations (HISA) program and VA medical centers, to determine whether veterans are eligible to receive the goods and services identified in their plan from these providers. In addition, VHA ‘s policy directive for coordinating with VR&E is intended to ensure that all VR&E participants, including those in the IL track, receive timely access to VHA health care services. The directive requires medical center directors to (1) provide clinically appropriate care to VR&E participants, (2) establish procedures to manage these participants’ timely access to care, and (3) ensure that clinical staff are trained in these procedures, including how to alert appropriate VBA officials when timeliness of care could be an issue, among other requirements. Despite these VR&E and VHA policies, our review of 182 IL track records found some instances where VR&E purchased goods and services that appear to be medically related, such as ramps and grab bars, and could have been provided by VHA. There may have been little coordination on IL track cases because, as VR&E officials and staff at the five VA regional offices we visited told us, coordinating with VHA medical center staff can be challenging. Several VRCs indicated that when they refer IL track cases to VHA physicians to determine whether any of the medical-related benefits identified in the IL plans—such as grab bars, wheelchairs, and safety rails—had been or could be provided by VHA, in many instances, VHA physicians do not respond or respond too late. As a result, services for IL track veterans were either delayed or purchased by VR&E instead of VHA. According to some VHA staff, lack of or delays in coordination are sometimes due to differences in VR&E rehabilitation goals and VHA long-term medical goals for veterans. For example, VHA staff members mentioned they would not approve VRCs’ requests for lift chairs unless veterans absolutely needed them because VHA staff members said their medical goal is to promote continued mobility. While IL track caseload size and benefits vary across regions, VR&E does not systematically monitor these variations. We found regional differences in the size of IL caseloads, the range of needs covered in a veteran’s IL plan, and the types of goods and services provided. As shown in figure 15, the total IL track caseload during fiscal years 2008 through 2011 ranged from over 900 cases in the Montgomery Regional Office in Alabama to 4 cases in the Wilmington Regional Office in Delaware. (See appendix VI for annual IL caseload data.) While one would expect differences in caseload size based on the number of veterans in an office’s service area, some differences in IL caseload could not be explained by the size of the veteran population in an office’s service area. For example, while the estimated size of the veteran populations in Alabama and Massachusetts are similar, Montgomery’s IL caseload of over 900 veterans was more than 100 times as large as Boston’s IL caseload of 8 veterans. VR&E officials told us they are aware that some offices have low IL participation levels, and attributed some of the difference to factors, such as the presence of specialized treatment centers in certain areas of the county that can increase caseload numbers in those regions. However, evidence from our site visits suggests that there may be other factors that drive the number of veterans entering a region’s IL track. For example, officials from the Detroit Regional Office—which had the second highest total IL caseload across fiscal years 2008 through 2011—attributed the size of their caseload to their office’s focus on IL cases and community outreach efforts, including the involvement of veteran service organizations. The Atlanta Regional Office also mentioned that in addition to the size of the veteran population in Georgia and the presence of army bases, the size of their IL caseload is influenced by increased community interest in the IL track in recent years, and the informal efforts of past IL participants to provide information about the IL track to other veterans. Based on discussions with regional personnel and our review of the results of past studies, IL plans and the goods and services provided can also vary by region. According to VR&E officials, the law gives VA broad discretion in defining the range of needs covered in an IL track plan, as well as in choosing the types of goods and services required to achieve the plan’s goals. VR&E’s policy does, however, prohibit the agency from providing courses of study and training leading to academic degrees, and purchasing certain types of equipment, such as lawn tractors. As a result, some regions appear to develop IL plans that address a broader range of needs while others elect to develop more focused plans. Officials we spoke with during our site visits also confirmed that regions differ in their approach to developing IL plans, and in one region, officials commented that some regions may develop simpler plans with fewer benefits to achieve VR&E’s rehabilitation goal. Moreover, VR&E’s 2008 study of the IL track reported that some regions relied repeatedly on the same types of benefits to meet veterans’ IL needs. For example, in the New York and Hartford regional offices, nearly 90 percent of IL participants were provided computer training. This was almost twice the rate of Detroit—the office with the next highest rate of providing veterans with computer training—in 44 percent of its IL cases. Other offices focused more heavily on providing goods or services to support veterans’ avocational interests or on finding veterans volunteer opportunities, while some consistently focused on providing veterans with health club memberships. For example, the St. Petersburg Regional Office accounted for 33 percent of veterans receiving volunteer opportunities. In addition, the 2004 VR&E Task Force report noted significant differences in field office philosophy regarding the scope and administration of the IL track, and also recommended providing VR&E Central Office greater “line-of-site authority” over VR&E field operations. As noted earlier, VBA’s Office of Field Operations rather than VR&E’s Central Office has direct line of authority over regional VR&E staff and operations. While VA officials acknowledged the existence of regional variation in these areas, VR&E’s current oversight approach may not be adequate to ensure consistent administration of the IL track across regions. The standards for internal control in the federal government emphasize the need for federal agencies to have timely information to effectively monitor and mitigate program risks. To oversee administration of the IL track, VR&E has relied on the information provided through its general quality assurance (QA) activities and a series of periodic ad hoc studies. The QA activities are conducted by each region as well as VR&E’s QA staff located in Nashville, Tennessee. However, these activities are limited in scope, frequency, and how the information is used. At the national level, a team of VR&E QA staff are required to perform periodic site visits to each VA regional office at least every 3 years, although officials told us they have not been able to meet this goal in recent years because of budgetary constraints. This team also periodically reviews a sample of veterans’ records from VR&E’s IL and employment tracks in selected regions. After each site visit and case review, the QA team produces a report for the particular region under review. While VR&E officials told us that QA results are “analyzed to determine trends,” it is unclear how VR&E uses these results to ensure that consistent procedures are used by regional offices nationwide. In addition to these QA activities, VA has funded two studies over the past several years on the VR&E program, including implementation of the IL track, and a third is under way. In 2003, VA appointed a task force to evaluate the overall VR&E program and recommend ways service delivery could be improved. In 2008, as mentioned, a study was issued by VR&E on the types of services received by IL track participants and the impact those services had on veterans. This study found, among other things, that IL participants received a broad range of services, and that some regional offices favored providing certain types of services to IL track veterans. Finally, in October 2012, VR&E awarded a contract for about $890,312 to study the IL track service delivery process, barriers and incentives for field staff when considering the provision of services, current and future training strategies, and other areas. VR&E officials anticipate receiving the final results from this study in July 2013. Considering the broad discretion VR&E provides to regions in determining the range of needs covered in IL track plans and the types of goods and services selected to meet these needs, VR&E’s current policy for approving IL track expenditures may not be adequate. To guard against fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement, the standards for internal control emphasize the need for agencies to have appropriate levels of supervision and controls in place to prevent one individual from having responsibility for all key aspects of a transaction or event. VR&E Central Office is responsible for managing the program’s national budget. While officials told us that VRCs are required to include all cost estimates when they submit veterans’ IL plans to be reviewed and approved by the region’s VR&E Officer, VR&E was unable to provide any written policy or guidance that explicitly states this requirement for all IL expenditures. VR&E’s current written policies allow each region to unilaterally approve construction-related expenditures up to $25,000 per case and non- construction expenditures up to $100,000 per case without approval from VR&E Central Office. In addition, VRCs can spend up to $2,000 on construction-related expenditures and up to $25,000 on non-construction expenditures without supervisory review of any kind (see table 2). Under this policy, regional offices are permitted to purchase a broad range of items without any Central Office approval, resulting in some offices purchasing goods and services that may be questionable or that are costly. For example, in one of the 182 IL cases we reviewed, VR&E Central Office would not have been required to approve total expenditures of $18,829 for a riding lawn mower—which VR&E policy prohibits—and other IL goods and services including a bed, bed frame, desktop computer, and woodworking equipment. In another case, VR&E Central Office approval would not have been required for the purchase of a boat, motor, trailer, and the boat’s shipping cost to Molokai, Hawaii, among other items, totaling about $17,500. Without appropriate approval levels, VR&E’s IL track may be vulnerable to potential fraud, waste, and abuse. VR&E does not collect or report critical program management information—such as the costs of goods and service purchased, the types of benefits provided, and the number of IL veterans served—that would help the agency in its oversight responsibilities. Specifically, VR&E’s Corporate WINRS case management system—commonly referred to as “CWINRS”—lacks information on the total amount of funds VR&E expends on IL benefits because the agency does not maintain specific cost information on each of its five tracks or the key program areas these tracks represent, which are employment services and independent living. VR&E aggregates costs across all its tracks, despite VA’s managerial cost accounting policies that require the costs of products and services to be captured for management purposes. Federal financial accounting standards also recommend that costs of programs be measured and reported. According to officials, they do not collect cost information on the IL track alone because they view the five tracks as a single program with the same overarching goal—to help veterans achieve their employment goals. However, in our 2009 report on the VR&E program, we reported that VR&E serves veterans with fundamentally different program goals and outcomes—those seeking to obtain employment and those seeking to live independently. As a result, we recommended that VR&E separately track its IL rehabilitation rate. In addition, the CWINRS system does not collect information on the types of IL benefits provided to veterans in a standardized manner that can be easily aggregated and analyzed for oversight purposes. Currently, VRCs are required to write in a description of the benefits they purchased for IL track veterans in CWINRS. We found, however, that the recorded descriptions lack consistency and vary in their level of detail. In several of the IL track cases we reviewed, the goods and services purchased were grouped together under a general description, such as “IL equipment” or “IL supplies,” without any further details. In other cases, VRCs recorded each purchase separately. For instance, in one case, the VRC created separate entries for each item purchased, for example, “desktop computer,” “computer desk,” “Queen Mattress,” “all in one printer,” “USB cable and ink,” “threshold ramp,” and “washer.” In addition, we found that controls for data entry are not adequate to ensure that all important data is recorded. For example, we estimated that the service provider field was either missing or unclear for one or more services in about 15 percent of all IL cases that began in fiscal year 2008. Moreover, in another 7 percent of IL cases that began during fiscal year 2008, we found that service provider data was unavailable because CWINRS had overwritten veterans’ 2008 IL plans with subsequent plans. CWINRS only retains veterans’ current IL plan. Furthermore, CWINRS does not provide VR&E with the information it needs to account for the actual number of IL track veterans it serves to monitor its statutory entrant cap and program operations. The law allows VR&E to initiate “programs” of independent living services and assistance for no more than a specified number of veterans each year, which is currently set at 2,700. A VR&E policy letter to VA regional offices, dated December 14, 2010, states that “VR&E Service will monitor new IL programs by tracking the number of veterans entering independent living case status in each fiscal year and notify the field of any necessary action if the 2,700 statutory limit is being approached.” However, in analyzing VR&E’s administrative data, we found that VR&E counts the number of IL plans developed annually and not the number of individual veterans admitted to the track. VR&E officials told us that the law does not limit the number of IL plans that can be developed for a veteran in a single fiscal year. Because multiple IL plans can be developed for an individual veteran during the same fiscal year, veterans with multiple plans are counted more than once towards the statutory cap by CWINRS. Based on data from CWINRS, 403 (4 percent) of the 9,215 veterans beginning an IL plan during fiscal years 2008 through 2011 had more than one plan during that time. About 22 percent of these veterans had more than one IL plan in the same fiscal year. From fiscal years 2008 through 2011, VR&E did not exceed the statutory cap (see fig. 16). Moreover, VR&E officials indicated that they were unaware that CWINRS was calculating the number of plans and not individual veterans. As a result, VR&E lacks complete information on the number of veterans it is serving through the IL track at any given time—information it could use to better manage staff, workloads, and program resources. According to the standards for internal control, it is important for program managers to have reliable and timely “operational” information to ensure agency goals are met, resources are used efficiently and effectively, and requirements under various laws and regulations are being complied with. Finally, recent evaluations of CWINRS have determined that the system does not meet VR&E’s current needs and limits its oversight abilities because important data elements are not captured to support the agency’s “evolving business needs.” According to a 2012 VR&E report, VR&E plans to improve CWINRS by (1) increasing data automation to reduce instances of human error, and (2) enhancing system controls to improve the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the data, among other improvements. However, it appears that the CWINRS redesign will not enable VR&E to obtain data on IL track expenditures from the system or to use the system to accurately and efficiently track the types of goods and services the IL track provides. While officials told us that they plan to modify the system to enable them to track individual veterans served through the IL track, they could provide no time frame for this project and noted that it could take up to 3 years to obtain funding for it. VR&E’s IL track can provide a wide range of benefits to help veterans with service-connected disabilities maximize their ability to live independently when the achievement of an employment goal is not currently feasible. Under the law, each VA region has broad discretion in determining the range and types of goods and services each IL track veteran should receive. Consequently, adequate oversight at the national level is extremely important in ensuring that IL track case management requirements are met, the track is administered consistently across regions, expenditures for goods and services are appropriate, and critical IL track information is collected and used. In this context and absent better coordination with VHA, VR&E will continue to face challenges in ensuring goods and services for IL track veterans are provided by VHA, when appropriate, in a timely manner. With regard to VR&E’s Central Office oversight, its current policy governing the review and approval of expenditures might not effectively mitigate the risk of fraud, waste, abuse, or mismanagement inherent in activities, such as the development and implementation of IL plans, where there are few limitations on the types and cost of goods and services that can be provided. Furthermore, without collecting information on cost and the types of benefits regional offices provide to IL track veterans, and maintaining an information system that ensures IL track data are recorded consistently and are accurate and complete, VR&E cannot effectively oversee the performance and activities of its IL track. Finally, as more servicemembers from the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan transition into civilian life and veterans’ programs and as the overall veteran population ages, the demand for IL services will likely increase. VR&E must, therefore, be able to accurately count the number of individual IL track veterans served to ensure it can effectively manage its cap and assess program performance and resource needs. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs should direct the Undersecretary for Benefits to take the following actions: 1. Work with the Undersecretary for Health to explore options on ways to enhance coordination to ensure IL track veterans’ needs are met by VHA, when appropriate, in a timely manner. This could include improving staff education, response times to IL referrals, and the provision of medically related goods and services. 2. Implement an oversight approach that enables VR&E to better ensure consistent administration of the IL track across regions. In developing this approach, consider ensuring that VR&E’s CWINRS system: Tracks the total cost and types of benefits provided to each veteran in the IL track by regional office. Accounts for the number of individual veterans served to ensure that the agency has the information it needs to adequately manage the IL track. Contains stronger data entry controls to ensure that IL track information is recorded in a consistent manner and is accurate and complete. 3. Reassess and consider enhancing the agency’s current policy concerning the required level of approval for IL track expenditures, given the broad discretion individual regional offices have in determining the types of goods and services IL track veterans receive. We provided a draft of this report to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs for review and comment. VA generally agreed with our conclusions, and concurred with our three recommendations. VA’s written comments are reproduced in appendix VII. In addition, VA provided technical comments that we have incorporated in the report where appropriate. With regards to our recommendation that VA enhance coordination between VR&E and VHA on the provision of IL benefits to veterans, VA noted there are efforts underway that will permit VR&E counselors to make IL referrals to VHA providers through VHA’s Compensation and Pension Record Interchange system, also referred to as CAPRI. In addition to these efforts, we encourage VR&E and VHA to continue to explore other options to enhance coordination, such as engaging in staff education and training efforts to improve the timely provision of IL benefits and prevent any duplication. Furthermore, with regards to our recommendation to improve IL track oversight, VA said that it will perform an assessment of its current IL track oversight procedures and consider including enhancements to CWINRS. Because having a sound information system plays such a critical role in helping program managers monitor agency performance and operations, we urge VA to take steps to prioritize enhancements to CWINRS. Finally, VA noted that, in response to our recommendation that it reassess its current policy for approving IL track expenditures, it plans to make any needed improvements by March 2014. As part of its assessment process, we believe that VA should review its existing cost- thresholds for approving all IL expenditures, including non-construction related expenditures, to ensure adequate oversight of goods and services purchased for veterans.

Staff members who made key contributions to this report are listed in appendix VIII. The objectives of this report were to examine (1) the characteristics of veterans who have participated in the IL track, as well as the types and costs of benefits they were provided; (2) the extent to which their independent living plans were completed, and the time it took; and (3) the extent to which the IL track has been administered appropriately and consistently. To answer these objectives, we used a variety of methodologies, which are described in greater detail below. Specifically, we analyzed VA administrative data from fiscal years 2008 through 2011 to provide information on the characteristics and outcomes of veterans who participate in the IL track, and how long it takes to achieve these outcomes. We also used statistical models to determine any differences in rehabilitation times. In addition, to determine the types of benefits provided and their costs, we conducted a case file review of a random, generalizable sample of 182 veterans who started in the IL track during fiscal year 2008. Lastly, to examine the administration of the IL track, we visited five VA regional offices and interviewed officials and staff from VR&E, Specially Adapted Housing (SAH), Prosthetics and Sensory Aid Service (PSAS) under the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), and veteran service organizations. We also reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations, standards for internal controls and managerial cost accounting, as well as VR&E policies, procedures, and other relevant studies and documentation. We analyzed VA administrative data in the Corporate WINRS system— commonly referred to as “CWINRS”—from fiscal years 2008 through 2011 to describe the characteristics and outcomes of veterans in the IL track, and how long it takes veterans to achieve these outcomes. VR&E has used the CWINRS system since 2001 to track veteran cases through its process and to manage program costs. The “WINRS” part of the acronym represents the first 5 regional offices that tested the original system. These offices include Waco, Texas; Indianapolis, Indiana; Newark, New Jersey; Roanoke, Virginia; and Seattle, Washington. we found the data to be sufficiently reliable for our purpose, unless otherwise noted. To identify our universe of 9,215 veterans who started in the IL track during fiscal years 2008 through 2011, we counted the number of individual veterans who had an “IL status” recorded in CWINRS during our time frame. While veterans can enter into the IL track more than once in a given fiscal year, we counted a veteran only once if he or she had more than one IL status during these years. To determine the characteristics of the 9,215 veterans who began in the IL track during fiscal years 2008 through 2011, we examined several demographic variables in CWINRS, including veterans’ age, gender, types of disabilities, and combined disability rating. Data on the war era in which veterans served was obtained from VA’s Benefits Delivery Network. To examine the outcomes of veterans in the IL track, we limited our analysis to veterans who began only one IL plan at some point during fiscal year 2008. This accounted for about 92 percent of the 2,465 veterans who began an IL plan during fiscal year 2008. The remaining 8 percent of veterans who had more than one plan were excluded from our analysis because of potential data reliability issues associated with how certain case actions were recorded. In our analysis of IL veteran rehabilitation rates, we excluded veterans whose cases were transferred to one of VR&E’s employment tracks. To estimate the difference in rehabilitation times across regional offices and groups of veterans with various characteristics, we used different statistical models. These “survival modeling” methods allowed us to appropriately estimate rehabilitation probabilities at various points in an IL plan, even when a significant proportion of the cases are discontinued or in progress. Our models used the same VA administrative data noted above for veterans in the IL track who began only one IL plan at some point during fiscal years 2008 through 2011. Consequently, our model results only apply to a subset of veterans, which make up about 95 percent of the veterans who began in the IL track during this time frame. For a detailed discussion of our statistical models, see appendix II. To obtain information on the types of benefits provided through the IL track, as well as the costs and coordination of these benefits, we conducted a case file review of a random, generalizable sample of 182 veterans whose cases started in the IL track at some point during fiscal year 2008. To track and manage IL cases, VR&E utilizes both paper records located at each regional office, and electronic case records in the CWINRS system. For the purpose of our file review, we used veterans’ electronic records in CWINRS, and found the information in these records to be sufficient for our purpose. We selected fiscal year 2008 because it allowed us to follow veterans’ progress in the IL track beyond 24 months—the authorized benefit duration time frame unless a 6-month extension is approved. We stratified our sample of 182 cases into three groups—those veterans’ whose cases were (1) rehabilitated, (2) discontinued, or (3) still open. We used this approach to obtain information on any differences in IL benefits and expenditures by veteran groups. We also elected to use a sample design that mixes the features of a proportional allocation and equal sample per stratum. Table 3 provides more detailed information on our sample stratification. To produce population estimates from our sample of cases, information collected from each case reviewed was weighted in the analysis to account statistically for the total population of all IL track cases started in fiscal year 2008. Because our estimates for the entire population of IL track cases that started in fiscal year 2008 are based on a probability sample of these cases, they are subject to sampling error. To recognize the possibility that other samples drawn from this population might yield different results, we express our confidence in the precision of our sample’s results as a 95 percent confidence interval. A 95 percent confidence interval is expected to include the actual value for the population in 95 out of 100 samples drawn from the population. With regard to expenditures in IL track cases, at the 95 percent confidence interval, the amount of total expenditures across all IL track cases that started in fiscal year 2008 falls between $11.3 million and $16.6 million; the actual amount expended, on average, in these cases falls between $4,835 and $7,104. To conduct our case file review, we developed a web-based data collection instrument to record information from the electronic printouts VR&E provided us with of veterans’ records. After these records were collected, GAO staff members entered the information into the electronic data collection instrument for each veteran case in our sample. Once the data was entered, a second GAO staff member reviewed each entry for clarity and accuracy. With regard to the types of benefits provided to IL track veterans, we cannot generalize the types of goods and services provided because we recorded in our data collection instrument information on only eight goods and services identified in each of the 182 IL case files we reviewed. However, we were able to generalize information we obtained on IL track service providers from the IL cases we reviewed because in less than 3 percent of these cases, there were at least eight service providers. Our estimate of the number of cases where service provider information was missing, unclear, or overwritten in CWINRS may be slightly understated. The 95 percent confidence interval for the 15 percent of cases where the service provider information was unclear or missing for one or more service ranged from 9 to 21 percent. The 95 percent confidence interval for the 7 percent of cases we reviewed where one or more service was overwritten in CWINRS ranged from 4 to 11 percent. To better understand the extent to which the IL track is being effectively administered, we visited five VA regional offices—San Diego, California; Atlanta, Georgia; Detroit, Michigan; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and the District of Columbia. We selected these sites because they were geographically diverse, and have varying levels of IL track participation and success in achieving VR&E’s IL rehabilitation goal. During each of our site visits, we interviewed VR&E Officers and vocational rehabilitation counselors (VRCs) using a standard set of questions to identify how IL cases were managed and any factors that may have affected the administration of the IL track. In particular, during our Detroit and Atlanta site visits, we interviewed VRCs who specialized in working on IL cases. Moreover, we obtained the perspectives of veteran service organizations that work with IL track veterans at two regional offices we visited—Detroit and Atlanta. Furthermore, we interviewed SAH and PSAS officials at the national level and relied on our case file review to determine the extent to which the IL track cases were referred to VA and non-VA service providers. In addition, we interviewed SAH and PSAS staff during our site visits to determine the extent to which VR&E, SAH, and PSAS coordinate in the provision of goods and services to IL track veterans. We used statistical models to estimate the difference in rehabilitation times across regional offices and groups of veterans with various characteristics. These “survival modeling” methods can appropriately estimate rehabilitation probabilities at various points in an IL plan, even when a significant proportion of the cases are discontinued or in progress. In addition, survival methods allowed us to estimate the unique association between rehabilitation times and various other factors, described below. In this appendix, we describe the data we used to fit the models and their structure, assumptions, and estimates. We estimated our models using VA administrative data on veterans who began exactly one IL plan from fiscal years 2008 through 2011. Due to the data reliability issues described in appendix I, our analysis excluded veterans who began multiple IL plans during this period. Consequently, our results only apply to this subset of 8,737 veterans, who made up 94.8 percent of the original population. We measured the length of time each veteran spent in his or her IL plan as the duration between the start of the plan and one of three later times: entering rehabilitation status, discontinuing the plan, or being in progress on September 30, 2011, the end of our observation period. We modeled rehabilitation as the outcome of interest, treating discontinued or in progress plans as having rehabilitation times that were censored. Among the veterans starting IL plans from fiscal years 2008 through 2011, 3.2 percent discontinued their IL plans prior to rehabilitation, and 35.9 percent had plans that were in progress on September 30, 2011. These data imply that 91.7 percent of the censored observations were in-progress cases, which suggests that most of the censoring is likely to be uninformative. We found no large differences in the probability of dropping out of an IL plan across the covariates we included in our models. This group also excluded veterans who transferred to a VR&E employment track and veterans who had more than one instance of rehabilitation. Missing data on age and length of service further reduced our sample size to 8,655 veterans for modeling purposes. We fit the data to several types of Cox proportional hazards models. The primary model took the following form: 𝜆𝑖𝑗(𝑡) denotes the hazard rate of rehabilitation at time t after veteran i enters an IL plan, and 𝜆0𝑗 (t) denotes the baseline hazard rate for the reference veteran with covariates equal to zero, served by one of j = 1, 2, to 908. 𝑥ij is a vector of the following covariates: age, length of military …,36 regional offices. We combined a number of offices that served less 𝜆𝑖𝑗(𝑡)=𝜆0𝑗 (t) exp(𝑥ij𝛽) reference veteran with covariates equal to zero, served by one of j = 1, 2, …,36 regional offices. We combined a number of offices that served less than 50 veterans into a residual group, in order to ensure sufficient sample within each office. The sample sizes within offices ranged from 58 service, and indicators for sex, branch of service, era of service, education, year the IL plan began, partial vs. full disability, and disability type. We coded the covariates such that the baseline reference veteran was substantively meaningful—a male Army veteran with a high school education, who served in the Vietnam era, entered an IL plan in fiscal year 2008, was processed by the Detroit Regional Office, and had a full musculoskeletal disability—either by setting values of categorical variables to the appropriate levels or by centering continuous variables at their means. All categorical variables included levels for missing data. In this application, the proportional hazard structure of the model implies that the instantaneous rate of rehabilitation at any time during an IL plan, or the hazard, varies across values of the covariates by a constant amount over time. For example, the model assumes that rehabilitation rates vary by the same amounts among veterans with different types of disabilities after 12 months, 18 months, or any other point in an IL plan. In our initial exploratory data analysis, Kaplan-Meier estimates of the hazard and survival functions suggested that the hazard was not proportional across regional offices. Using an unstratified version of the model above that included fixed effects for regional offices, we found that the Schoenfeld residuals for many offices were correlated with time at a sufficiently high level to reject the hypothesis that the hazard functions were proportional across the covariates (p <.0001). These results are consistent with our interviews and document reviews suggesting that program administration varied across offices, which could produce variation in hazard functions. (The body of this report summarizes these administrative inconsistencies in more detail.) For these reasons, we stratified the baseline hazard function by regional office, and we used this version of the model to calculate hazard rate ratios and elasticities, along with their standard errors, in table 3. Under the stratified model, we failed to reject the proportional hazards assumption for 𝛼 <.47. The estimated rehabilitation (failure) probabilities discussed in the body of this report came from a version of the model that did not stratify by office and, instead, assumed office fixed effects. This allowed us to calculate illustrative rehabilitation probabilities by various follow-up points and for specific covariate values, without having to produce 36 sets of estimates implied by separate hazard functions for each office. The differences in the estimated probabilities across covariate values should resemble estimates that we would have calculated from the stratified model, because estimates of 𝛽 and their variances were similar in both versions. The hazard rate ratios and elasticities in table 3 are consistent with our estimated rehabilitation probabilities in the body of the report. To calculate these probabilities, we fixed the value of each covariate at its sample mode or mean, depending on whether the variable was categorical or continuous. For this profile of covariate values, we calculated survival probabilities at various times using the estimated parameters of the unstratified model, and transformed them to failure probabilities by subtracting the survival estimates from 1. We estimated a final version of the model that used neither office strata nor fixed effects. This allowed us to estimate the association between office workload, measured by the total number of IL plans developed from fiscal year 2008 through 2011, and rehabilitation timeliness. Stratifying the model by office or estimating fixed effects would have absorbed the variation needed to estimate the coefficient on workload, as an office- level covariate. Table 3 provides estimates of 𝛽 and hazard ratios derived from them, along with standard errors and p values for the hypothesis that each ratio equals 1. These estimates come from the stratified model above. Figure 17 presents the failure functions implied by the separate hazard functions the model assumes for each regional office. These results are generally consistent with those discussed in the body of this report, where we interpret the results in more detail.

These benefits can include counseling, assistive devices, and other services or equipment. GAO was asked to review issues related to the IL track. This report examines (1) the characteristics of veterans in the IL track, and the types and costs of benefits they were provided; (2) the extent to which their IL plans were completed, and the time it took to complete them; and (3) the extent to which the IL track has been administered appropriately and consistently across regional offices. To conduct this work, GAO analyzed VA administrative data from fiscal years 2008 to 2011, and reviewed a random, generalizable sample of 182 veterans who entered the IL track in fiscal year 2008. In addition, GAO visited five VA regional offices; interviewed agency officials and staff; and reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and agency policies and procedures. Of the 9,215 veterans who entered the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) Independent Living (IL) track within the Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (VR&E) program in fiscal years 2008 to 2011, most were male Vietnam era veterans in their 50s or 60s. Almost 60 percent served in the U.S. Army, and fewer than 1 percent served in the National Guard or Reserve. The most prevalent disabilities among these veterans were post-traumatic stress disorder and tinnitus. GAO's review of 182 IL cases from fiscal year 2008 found that VR&E provided a range of IL benefits to veterans. Among these cases, the most common benefits were counseling services and computers. Less common benefits included gym memberships, camping equipment, and a boat. GAO estimated that VR&E spent nearly $14 million on benefits for veterans entering the IL track in fiscal year 2008--an average of almost $6,000 per IL veteran. Most veterans completed their IL plans, which identify their individual goals to live independently and the benefits VR&E will provide. About 89 percent of fiscal year 2008 IL veterans were considered by VR&E to be \"rehabilitated,\" that is, generally, to have completed their IL plans by the end of fiscal year 2011. VR&E discontinued or closed about 5 percent of cases for various reasons, such as the veteran declined benefits. Six percent of cases were open at the end of fiscal year 2011. Because the complexity of IL cases varied depending on veterans' disabilities and needs, some cases were fairly simple for VR&E to close. For example, one IL case only called for the installation of door levers and a bathtub rail. Another more complex case involved the provision of a range of IL benefits, including home modifications. Rehabilitation rates across regions varied from 0 to 100 percent, and regions with larger IL caseloads generally rehabilitated a greater percentage of IL veterans. While IL plans nationwide were completed in 384 days, on average, completion times varied by region, from 150 to 895 days. VR&E exercises limited oversight to ensure appropriate and consistent administration of the IL track across its regions. First, some regions may not be complying with certain case management requirements. For instance, while VR&E is required to coordinate with the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) on IL benefits, VR&E counselors have difficulty obtaining timely responses from VHA. VHA physicians respond to VR&E's IL referrals late or not at all, resulting in delayed benefits or VR&E providing the benefits instead of VHA. Second, VR&E does not monitor regional variation in IL caseloads and benefits provided. Instead, it has relied on its quality assurance reviews and ad hoc studies, but these are limited in scope. Third, given counselors have broad discretion in selecting IL benefits, VR&E's written policies for approving IL expenditures may not be appropriate as regions were permitted to purchase a range of items without any Central Office approval, some of which were costly or questionable. For example, in one case, Central Office review would not have been required for expenditures of $18,829 for a riding mower, which is prohibited, and other items. Finally, VR&E's system does not collect IL costs and benefits provided. VR&E also lacks accurate data on the number of IL veterans served. While the law currently allows 2,700 veterans to enter the IL track annually, data used to monitor the cap are based on the number of IL plans developed, not on the number of individual veterans admitted. Veterans can have more than one plan in a fiscal year, so one veteran could be counted multiple times towards the cap. GAO recommends that VR&E explore options to enhance coordination with VHA; strengthen its oversight of the IL track; and reassess its policy for approving benefits. VA generally agreed with GAO's conclusions and recommendations."}

Furthermore, the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) in DOI reported that for 2005—the most recent year for which data are available—the total number of enrolled members in federally recognized American Indian and Alaska Native tribes and villages was nearly 2 million. American Indians have high rates of poverty, unemployment, single-parent families, and substance abuse relative to the population as a whole. BIA reported that the unemployment rate for American Indians living on or near a reservation was 49 percent in 2005, the most recent year for which data are available, while the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported a national unemployment rate of 5 percent for the same year. A recent study by the Economic Policy Institute noted that from the first half of 2007 to the first half of 2010, the national American Indian unemployment rate—which includes individuals living in both urban areas and on tribal lands—increased 7.7 percentage points to 15.2 percent, while it increased 4.9 percentage points to 9.1 percent among Caucasians. Additionally, in 2009, 53 percent of American Indian children lived in single-parent families, compared with 34 percent of all children nationwide. HHS data estimates for 2004 through 2008 indicate that the percentage of American Indians or Alaska Native adults who needed treatment for alcohol or illicit drug use problems in the past year was higher than the national average (18 percent and 10 percent, respectively). As of October 2010, there were 565 federally recognized tribes—340 in the continental United States and 225 in Alaska. Federally recognized Indian tribes are Native American groups eligible for the special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians. Under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, as amended, federally recognized Indian tribes can enter into self- determination contracts or self-governance compacts with the federal government to take over administration of certain federal programs for Indians previously administered by the federal government on their behalf. Tribal lands vary dramatically in size, demographics, and location. The largest reservation, that of the Navajo Nation, is about 24,000 square miles in size and is inhabited by more than 176,000 American Indians. In comparison, some of the smallest tribal lands, held by California tribes, take up less than 1 square mile and some tribal lands have fewer than 50 Indian residents. Some Indian reservations have a mixture of Indian and non-Indian residents. In addition, most tribal lands are rural or remote, although some are near metropolitan areas. Although tribal members were previously served through state AFDC programs, under PRWORA, they can be served through tribal or state TANF programs. Tribal and state TANF programs may use TANF funds in any manner reasonably calculated to accomplish the purposes of TANF. These purposes are to (1) provide assistance to needy families so that children can be cared for in their own homes or in the homes of relatives; (2) end needy parents’ dependence on government benefits by promoting job preparation, work, and marriage; (3) prevent and reduce the incidence of out-of-wedlock pregnancies; and (4) encourage the formation and maintenance of two-parent families. Like states, tribes generally have the flexibility to set their own TANF eligibility requirements, to determine what policies will govern mandatory sanctions for noncompliance with program rules, and to determine what types of work supports they will provide to recipients, such as child care, transportation, and job training. However, some of the federal requirements for state TANF programs differ from those for tribal TANF programs (see table 1). Before the 1996 welfare reforms, some tribes were operating their own Tribal Job Opportunities and Basic Skills (JOBS) programs that provided work and training activities. These tribes remained eligible to provide these services through the Native Employment Works (NEW) program when PRWORA repealed the JOBS program. As of January 2011, 31 tribes and tribal organizations operate both a tribal TANF program and a NEW Program. More recently, in 2006, DRA made several modifications to state TANF programs, none of which applied to tribes. DRA also reauthorized TANF through fiscal year 2010, and the Claims Resolution Act of 2010 extended it through fiscal year 2011. TANF has a maintenance-of-effort (MOE) provision that requires states to maintain a significant portion of their historic financial commitment to their welfare programs. States are not required to provide funding to tribal TANF programs, but many do so. As of July 2010, HHS data indicate that 54 of 64 tribal TANF programs received state funding. Contributions made by states to tribal TANF programs generally count toward a state’s MOE requirement. The Office of Family Assistance within the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) in HHS is the main federal agency responsible for overseeing tribal TANF programs. Both HHS’s headquarters office and 6 out of 10 regional offices have staff that work directly with tribes to help them implement and maintain their tribal TANF programs. Tribal TANF is a block grant, and we have previously found that building accountability into block grants is an important, but difficult, task requiring trade-offs between federal and state—or in this case, tribal—control over program finances, activities, and administration. HHS holds tribes accountable, in part, through the tribes’ reporting requirements, which are similar to those for state TANF programs. For example, tribes have to submit quarterly reports that include caseload data, data used to calculate work participation rates, and financial information. In addition, per the Single Audit Act, as amended, all states—including tribal governments—local governments, and nonprofit organizations expending $500,000 or more in federal awards during one fiscal year are required to obtain an audit in accordance with the requirements set forth in the Single Audit Act. In addition to the TANF block grant that tribes receive from HHS, the Recovery Act’s TANF Emergency Contingency Fund provided up to $5 billion to help states and tribes in fiscal years 2009 and 2010 that had an increase in caseloads or in certain types of expenditures. HHS provides these funds to tribes as a reimbursement for expenses incurred no later than September 30, 2010. According to HHS, the funds a jurisdiction receives as reimbursement are available without fiscal year limitation and can be spent in any way permissible under TANF. According to HHS, 24 tribes have received Emergency Contingency Fund grants totaling approximately $14 million as of June 2011. The Indian Employment, Training and Related Services Demonstration Act of 1992 provides tribes with additional program and funding flexibilities. Specifically, it allows DOI to authorize federally recognized Indian tribes to combine funds they receive from various federal agencies and programs for employment, training, and related services, such as TANF, into one program, called a “477 plan.” These plans help tribes streamline funding from as many as 11 different federal sources by utilizing a single budget and a single reporting system. According to a DOI official, eligible grant funds include formula-funded programs in HHS, DOI, and the Department of Labor. DOI oversees these plans at the federal level. As of July 2011, 15 tribes incorporate their tribal TANF programs into these plans. The number of tribal TANF programs has increased from 36 in 2002 to 64 in 2010 (see fig. 1), and several additional tribes are actively pursuing administering their own programs. Most of the tribes that have begun administering their own program since 2002 had no previous experience managing a TANF program; however, according to information provided by HHS, at least two tribes that were previously served as part of a larger tribal TANF consortium of tribes have decided to administer their own programs. For a list of all tribes administering a TANF program, including those tribes who were previously served as part of a larger tribal TANF consortium, see app. II. In addition to the 64 tribal TANF programs in operation in 2010, HHS officials stated that as of April 2011, 11 more tribes were actively pursuing starting their own program. The number of tribes served by tribal TANF programs has also increased from 174 in 2002 to at least 272 in 2010, and more of the tribes administering their own programs are serving Native families outside of their own tribe. Tribes have the flexibility to determine whom their program will serve as well as their service area—the geographic area that their TANF program will cover. In 2002, we reported that 16 out of 36 tribes (44 percent) served only their own enrolled tribal members. According to our review of tribes’ TANF plans, 16 out of 64 tribes (25 percent) administering a program serve only members of their tribe whereas 48 tribal TANF programs (75 percent) extend their services and benefits to families who are not enrolled members of their tribe. For example, according to their most recently approved TANF plan, the Oneida Tribe of Indians of Wisconsin serves both enrolled tribal members as well as other Indians who are members of federally recognized tribes residing on its reservation who are eligible for TANF, whereas the Hopi tribe serves only its own enrolled tribal members. We also found that according to HHS data, 11 of the 64 tribal TANF programs have expanded in order to serve more Native families in nearby or surrounding areas. For example, the California Tribal TANF Partnership began administering TANF in 2003 and has expanded its program at least three times since then to include more tribes. As of May 2011, this partnership was associated with 35 tribes and other organizations, and its TANF program service area spanned 14 different counties in California. Nationwide, the total number of families receiving tribal TANF cash assistance has increased since 2002, primarily because the number of programs has grown, but also because of varied caseload increases among existing programs. Figure 2 below shows the changes in the nationwide average monthly number of families receiving tribal TANF cash assistance since 2002. As shown, the total nationwide average monthly caseload increased almost every year between 2002 and 2009; in some years, increases were driven primarily by the addition of new programs. However, aggregate changes from year to year hide significant variation in caseload trends among programs. For example, between 2008 and 2009, the majority of tribal TANF programs experienced increases in their average monthly caseloads, but some saw their caseloads decline. And even where increases occurred, they varied widely. A couple of smaller programs—which serve a dozen or fewer families on average per month— saw their average monthly caseloads increase by as few as four families, which represents caseload increases of about 33 and 67 percent, respectively. In comparison, a couple of the larger programs saw their average monthly caseloads increase by more than a hundred families, representing caseload increases of about 16 percent and 21 percent, respectively. While tribal TANF programs range in size, the majority of these programs are relatively small, and according to preliminary fiscal year 2009 caseload data provided by HHS, 41 out of 63 tribes reporting caseload data had an average monthly caseload of less than 200 families. Tribes report that the flexibility they are given to tailor their tribal TANF programs allows them to address the specific needs of their TANF families. All 50 of the tribes responding to our survey reported that the flexibility to provide employment-focused and education-related services to families was a very major or major benefit to administering their own TANF program (see fig. 3). In addition, 49 out of 50 tribes reported that the ability to administer and deliver TANF services in a culturally sensitive manner and the ability to tailor the program to the needs of their community were very major or major benefits to administering TANF. One tribe responding to our survey reported that administering TANF encourages nation-building by strengthening the tribe’s social fabric and by helping to develop their tribal workforce. Similarly, a study conducted by Mathematica Policy Research, Inc. notes that tribal control of TANF affords tribes the opportunity to improve services for program participants and expand program coordination. In addition, we found that tribes continue to use the flexibility to set their own work participation requirements. According to tribes’ fiscal year 2009 work participation data provided by HHS, participation rate requirements for both newer and more-established programs combined ranged from 20 to 50 percent. In 2002, we reported that most of the tribes’ work participation rates generally ranged from 15 to 30 percent over the first few years of the tribal TANF program. We also found that some tribes have increased their rates over time. For example, more than half of the 36 tribes that have been administering a TANF program since 2002 have raised their work participation rate goals over time. One tribe gradually raised its work participation rate goal for all families more than 10 percentage points over the course of 8 years, from 35 percent to 48 percent. According to tribes’ TANF plans, minimum work requirements vary among tribes, and while one newly established program required 22 percent of all tribal TANF families to participate in 16 hours of work each week in fiscal year 2010, another more-established program required 35 percent of all families to participate in a minimum of 40 hours of work each week. According to HHS data, of those tribal TANF adults required to participate in work activities, a higher percentage were participating and meeting minimum requirements in 2009 than in 2002 (see fig. 4). Our review of tribes’ TANF plans shows that the majority of tribes administering TANF programs count work activities beyond the 12 identified in PRWORA toward meeting work participation requirements, and over time tribes have increased the number and types of activities they count as work activities. PRWORA provides tribes the flexibility to count a wide spectrum of activities as work activities, which helps them accommodate the training needs and cultural traditions of their recipients. Some tribes count cultural activities (including beading and participating in tribal ceremonies), NEW participation (including educational activities and training and job readiness activities), and commuting time toward meeting work participation rate requirements. For example, the California Tribal TANF Partnership allows tribal TANF recipients to participate in cultural activities, such as basket weaving, to help meet work participation requirements (for a related photo of the basket weaving activity, see app. III). Furthermore, in 2002, we reported that 1 out of 36 tribal TANF programs (3 percent) counted commuting time toward meeting work participation requirements. In 2010, according to our analysis of tribes’ TANF plans, we found that 35 out of 64 tribes (55 percent) counted commuting time toward meeting work participation requirements. Some of the activities tribes count as work activities, including receiving counseling, substance abuse treatment, and participating in life skills and parenting classes, are used by tribes to support the more family-oriented goals of the TANF program, such as preventing and reducing out-of- wedlock pregnancies, promoting marriage, and encouraging the formation and maintenance of two-parent families. For example, the Forest County Potawatomi tribe offers classes such as Positive Indian Parenting, Healthy Relationships, and Nurturing Fathers, and counts time spent in these classes toward work participation requirements (see fig. 5). These types of activities may benefit TANF families, even when they do not lead directly to paid employment. For more examples of work activities that tribes use to meet their work participation rate requirements, see photos from our site visits in appendix III. Both in our survey and during our site visits, tribes reported that the recent economic downturn has contributed to an increase in the size of their TANF caseloads, in part because it has exacerbated the scarcity of job opportunities within and near their service areas. In all, 30 of the 50 tribes that responded to our survey question reported that as of September 2010, their average monthly caseload was larger than when their tribal TANF program first began providing services; and of those, 12 reported that the increase was due to economic conditions or high unemployment. One tribe in particular said that its caseload was higher in September 2010 because there had been job layoffs and because companies in their area had been consolidating positions or not hiring. According to preliminary data provided by HHS, seven out of 55 tribes were serving at or above their program capacity in fiscal year 2009. An Oneida tribal TANF staff member told us that because there are fewer jobs available in their area, there could be over 100 people to apply for an entry-level position at a fast food restaurant. Another tribe we met with, the Hopi tribe, said that, despite the lack of employment opportunities on the reservation, many tribal members have moved back to the reservation after the economic recession caused them to lose their jobs, which has further strained the tribes’ resources and contributed to an increase in their average monthly caseload. Changing economic conditions have in some instances led to reductions in state contributions to tribal TANF programs. Most states with tribal TANF programs have in the past provided tribes with state funding, but some are revisiting this commitment in light of tight fiscal conditions. In an effort to address a growing shortfall in its budget for TANF, the state of Washington, for example, reduced funding for tribal TANF programs effective January 2011, reducing funding that tribes in the state have relied on to help administer their TANF programs. Similarly, in the state of Arizona, a tribe we spoke with said that the state has had to cut back on funding for TANF-related programs. For example, the tribe said that its parenting program used to be funded by five different grants from the state, but because the state faces budget deficits, it has cut both the number of grants and the amount of funding for the program. In response to the economic recession that began in 2007, the Recovery Act created the $5 billion TANF Emergency Contingency Fund for states and tribal TANF programs. Tribes can qualify for these funds based on increases in the number of families receiving cash assistance or in TANF expenditures for nonrecurrent, short-term benefits or subsidized employment. As of June 2011, 24 tribes had received Emergency Contingency Fund grants totaling approximately $14 million. According to our review of tribes’ HHS-approved Emergency Contingency Fund applications, 21 out of the 24 tribes demonstrated an increase in the number of families receiving basic assistance. Fifteen tribes showed increased expenditures for funding for nonrecurrent, short-term benefits, and 9 tribes requested funds due to increased expenditures for subsidized employment needs. Once a tribe received the Emergency Contingency Fund grant, the funds could be spent on any TANF-related purpose for TANF-eligible families. For example, 22 of the tribes responding to our survey applied for and received Emergency Contingency Fund grants, and of these 22 tribes, 17 reported using these grants to expand existing tribal TANF services and programs. Furthermore, more than half of these 22 respondents reported using Emergency Contingency Fund grant funding to issue more cash grants or to fill TANF budget gaps caused by the recession. While two of the tribes we visited said that they used Emergency Contingency Fund grants to fund cash grants for families, another tribe said they used the funds for supportive services, such as providing approximately 700 children with school clothes. According to our survey and site visits, the recent economic downturn has also affected the types of TANF services some tribes are providing to participants. Of the 49 tribes that responded to our survey question, 39 (80 percent) reported that since the beginning of the economic recession in 2007, they have increased their provision of nonrecurrent, short-term benefits—emergency payments to families to cover housing, utilities, transportation, or other expenses. For example, the Forest County Potawatomi stated in their application to HHS for Recovery Act funds that as a result of current economic conditions, they have been providing more assistance to help families with car repairs and utilities. Other tribes have had to cut back on supportive services so that they could provide more TANF families with basic cash assistance. The Lac du Flambeau tribal TANF staff reported having to reduce spending on alcohol and other drug abuse programs as a result of economic conditions. The majority of tribal TANF programs that responded to our survey reported that they have faced administrative challenges related to initial program implementation, staff development and retention, and development of adequate data systems (see fig. 6). In addition, all 11 tribes we visited talked about other challenges related to overcoming the various barriers to self-sufficiency that their TANF participants face, such as a lack of transportation and limited employment opportunities. According to survey respondents, some of the top challenges were:  Staff development and retention. Many tribes face challenges in finding, developing, and retaining their TANF staff. One tribe we visited said that it has been difficult for them to hire knowledgeable staff, such as a TANF program manager that is familiar with the program’s goals. According to HHS officials, another tribe lost their tribal TANF director 3 years ago and has struggled to find someone to permanently fill that position. Our survey results also indicate that 38 out of 49 tribes (78 percent) responding to the question have had difficulty in developing expertise in the staff they do employ. For example, one tribe said that while it was important for them to hire locally based staff for its TANF program, it was difficult to do so because not only were there very few qualified applicants, but also because there was a lack of training opportunities for new staff not familiar with the administration of TANF. Another tribe noted that they had to train and develop their own staff, as state TANF caseworkers often had Master’s degrees in Social Services, while most of their own caseworkers did not. Furthermore, once tribes have hired and developed their staff, it is increasingly difficult for them to retain that staff. One tribal TANF administrator we spoke with said she had about three to four different supervisors during the last 4 years. An HHS official also told us that, in his opinion, staff turnover can affect tribal TANF programs more dramatically than state TANF programs since tribes may lack the institutional knowledge and experience necessary to administer the program and provide training to staff. systems that can support their TANF programs. While tribes can use a percentage of their TANF grant for developing a new information system, this would decrease the amount of funding available for direct services to TANF families. With a reservation spanning about 24,000 miles and three states—Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah—the Navajo Nation refers to its TANF program as the Program for Self-Reliance, in order to reflect its mission to empower families to become self-sufficient. A tribal TANF administrator said that having the flexibility to design a program that incorporates the Navajo teaching of Taa’ hwo ajit eego laid the groundwork to “break the cycle” of dependence and instill self-confidence. In addition to the challenges outlined above, tribes we visited identified several barriers to self-sufficiency faced by their TANF participants that present challenges to their programs. These barriers include limited public transportation, employment opportunities, child care options, and educational attainment, among others. All 11 tribes we visited mentioned the availability of transportation as a challenge, with tribal TANF officials noting that many of their program participants lack a valid driver’s license or have limited or no public transit options. Many tribes also said that their TANF participants have limited job opportunities. The Forest County Potawatomi tribe, for instance, told us that few jobs exist for TANF participants because of recent closures of logging mills and because seasonal jobs are only available during the summer months. This same tribe said that due to its rural setting and recent child care facility closures, TANF participants have limited options for child care, hampering their ability to work. A lack of education among participants also affects their ability to secure employment. One tribe told us that its TANF participants, some of whom have only earned their General Equivalency Diploma, have had a harder time competing for jobs during the economic recession. Furthermore, of the 11 tribes we visited, 6 mentioned substance abuse, domestic violence, or both as barriers to their TANF participants’ self-sufficiency. When tribes experience challenges administering their TANF programs, they often turn to other entities for assistance, such as HHS, other tribal and federal programs, and consultants, among others. In particular, those responding to our survey reported that they most commonly contact HHS regional office staff, other tribes, and private consultants (see fig. 7). In addition, 9 out of the 11 tribes we visited indicated that they also work with other federal programs to help address challenges. According to our survey, tribes most commonly contacted HHS regional office staff for assistance. All 48 tribes responding to this question (100 percent) selected “yes” for this question in our survey. According to HHS officials, tribes often reach out to their regional offices for guidance and technical assistance to address challenges that can occur during the initial implementation of their TANF programs. Regional offices provide most of HHS’s training and technical assistance to tribes, and the majority of their assistance focuses on the development and oversight of tribal TANF plans. Regional offices also inform tribes about policy and procedural updates and provide clarification if needed. For example, when the Recovery Act’s TANF Emergency Contingency Fund became available, HHS provided technical assistance and outreach through its regional offices. HHS regional offices also provide regional tribal TANF conferences, typically held once per year. In addition, one senior HHS official said that their regional staff can also conduct in-person site visits to provide direct one-on-one assistance to tribes, but generally they lack the resources to do any extensive travel. To enhance employment and training opportunities for program participants, tribal TANF programs reach out to other programs within their tribe (see fig. 8), and many also contact other tribes when they experience challenges administering their program. The Menominee Tribe has worked with its local tribal college to provide different education and training opportunities to its tribal TANF participants, such as degree and trades programs (for a related photo of the Menominee tribal college, see app. III). In our survey, 46 out of 47 tribes (98 percent) responding to the question indicated that they contact other tribes when they experience challenges administering their own TANF programs. For example, tribal TANF administrators from one program we spoke with participated in meetings with other tribal TANF programs in their state, which they found more valuable than HHS regional meetings for coordinating with other tribal TANF programs on particular issues and sharing information about such topics as data, tribal TANF plans, and HHS guidance. To enhance employment opportunities for tribal TANF participants and address some of their barriers to self-sufficiency, tribes also collaborate with other federal programs. Tribes seek out these partnerships, in part, because their TANF programs are typically serving areas with high unemployment rates. Some tribes we visited told us they collaborated with such programs to create opportunities for individuals to help meet their work participation requirements. For example, at least three tribes we visited—the Lac du Flambeau, Zuni, and Hopi tribes—placed participants at their Head Start offices to gain work experience (for a related photo of the Lac du Flambeau Head Start program, see app. III). The Hopi tribe has also sent some participants to an orientation for the Job Corps program, an education and training program that helps young people learn a career, earn a high school diploma or General Equivalency Diploma, and find and retain employment. To facilitate further coordination with federal programs and address challenges related to program implementation and staffing, tribal TANF programs can also participate in a “477 plan” administered by DOI. According to DOI, when TANF is integrated into a comprehensive “477 plan,” participants may receive additional support services, such as longer-term job preparedness, and “477 plan” case managers can receive additional training from DOI to better assist unemployed tribal members with finding jobs. DOI also noted that consolidating resources into a single plan helps to minimize overhead costs, maximize client participation, and integrate services. Of the 11 tribes responding to our survey that include their TANF program in such a plan, nearly all indicated that doing so improved service delivery coordination (10 out of 11), increased continuity of service provision (10 out of 11), and improved administrative and staff coordination (9 out of 11). For example, one tribe we visited said their participation in a “477 plan” allowed them to reduce paperwork and duplication among their various federal programs, including TANF, and to provide a one-stop service location as well. Tribal TANF programs also coordinate with other federal grant programs under HHS, such as the Native Employment Works (NEW) program. Of the tribes we surveyed, 18 out of 22 (82 percent) that operate both NEW and TANF programs reported improved service delivery coordination as a benefit of operating both programs. In addition, 16 out of the 22 tribes indicated that they had benefited from increased continuity of service provision and improved administrative and staff coordination as a result of administering both programs. In our survey, 37 out of 46 tribes (80 percent) reported that they contact private consultants when they experience challenges administering their TANF programs. During our site visits, we learned that tribes reach out to consultants to address some of the top challenges reported in our survey, such as developing data systems and staff expertise. For example, to address challenges related to developing adequate data systems, we learned that the majority of tribes use data systems and receive training on these systems from consultants, according to HHS. Another tribe we visited consulted with the University of California, Davis to help facilitate the development of goals for their tribal TANF plan, which included clarifying the tribe’s definitions for performance and results. In addition, the Center for Human Services at the University of California, Davis annually presents a National Tribal TANF Institute to provide information, tools, and networking opportunities to support the development and operation of tribal TANF programs that meet the needs of Native people. According to HHS officials, the single audit is the primary oversight mechanism for tribal TANF programs, and single audit findings are used to target technical assistance to tribes. At least 19 tribes have had repeat single audit findings since 2002, most often in the areas of allowable costs/cost principles, reporting, eligibility, cash management, and equipment and property management. One official from an HHS regional office explained that a lack of infrastructure and the inability to retain qualified staff in tribal TANF programs are often the main causes of repeat audit findings such as these. HHS officials described how record keeping can be a challenge for tribal TANF programs as a result of inadequate computer systems. More specifically, one senior HHS official stated that one of the most common findings from tribes’ audits is weaknesses in procurement systems, where documents supporting procurement purchases are missing and incomplete, or inventory lists are missing. One HHS regional official added that tribes are especially susceptible to financial audit findings because of staff turnover—a tribe could be making progress with addressing their audit findings, but then a key staff member may leave, and the tribe is “back to square one.” To help tribes prevent financial audit findings resulting from new or inexperienced staff, one regional official stated that they invite new tribal TANF financial officers to come to their offices for basic training on the TANF program and fiscal issues. Another HHS official described how they have also used single audit report findings to target their training and technical assistance by holding sessions on common audit findings and resolutions at some of their annual tribal TANF conferences. HHS has also included guidance on single audits in some of its policy manuals available on its tribal TANF Web site, such as an audit supplement guide that outlines common tribal TANF audit findings and program activities that can ensure compliance with government regulations. Additionally, HHS has the authority to impose financial penalties if it decides they are warranted. However, we found that HHS’s tracking of single audit reports was fragmented, with multiple systems tracking different sets of reports with tribal TANF findings. An HHS Office of Inspector General (OIG) official explained that audits are tracked in an agencywide single audit database that HHS’s OIG oversees, and some program offices, including ACF, have their own database for tracking audits they are responsible for resolving. However, audits with tribal TANF findings may not always be tracked in ACF’s database, because depending on the nature of the finding, another HHS program office or even another federal agency may be responsible for resolving it. For example, HHS officials explained that audit reports with crosscutting findings affecting multiple programs usually do not show up in ACF’s database, as they are assigned to and tracked by HHS’s Office of Finance, Division of Systems Policy, Program Integrity and Audit Resolution, which is responsible for handling or resolving these specific types of findings. However, a summary of all audit findings are sent to the HHS tribal TANF program office for their review. One senior HHS tribal TANF official confirmed that due to workload priorities, they are behind in reviewing these summaries of audit findings for both state and tribal TANF programs. One HHS OIG official explained that these summary reports contain all audit findings for tribal TANF programs, including those that the tribal TANF office is not responsible for resolving. If these summary reports are not reviewed in a timely manner, tribal TANF officials may not be aware of all recurring audit findings related to tribal TANF programs. For example, one tribe was found to have not met compliance requirements for allowable costs or cost principles for each of the five consecutive years it submitted single audit reports. According to information provided by the OIG, ACF was responsible for resolving some but not all of the findings, and thus may not have known that these findings had occurred every year if they did not review the summary reports in a timely manner. Our Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government provide that internal control monitoring should ensure that findings of audits and other reviews are promptly resolved. Due to the delays in reviewing the summaries and the fragmented systems for reporting and tracking single audit findings, HHS tribal TANF officials may not consistently be aware of all the single audit findings related to tribal TANF programs, or be in a position to promptly identify and address recurring problems and mitigate risk. In addition to HHS officials’ use of the single audit as the primary oversight mechanism for tribal TANF programs, quarterly data reports used to calculate work participation rates and financial reports, as well as other program reporting requirements, also help HHS oversee program performance and ensure program integrity (see table 2). Through quarterly data reports, HHS reviews tribes’ data used to calculate work participation rates and follows up with tribes to make updates and changes to the data as necessary (see fig. 9). One tribe we visited mentioned that it is helpful to have HHS review their data to make sure that both HHS and the tribe itself are calculating the work participation rates correctly and arriving at the same numbers. While one of the tribes we visited noted that it was helpful to have HHS review their data, HHS does not consistently update and review tribal TANF quarterly work participation data submitted by tribes in a timely manner. We found that in some cases, it has taken HHS several years to review, update, and share the results of its work participation rate data review with tribes, even though these rates help tribes measure the degree to which TANF families are engaged in work activities that can lead to self-sufficiency. According to our survey, 22 out of 49 tribes (45 percent) indicated that failing to receive data reports from HHS in a timely manner has been a very major or major challenge to administering their tribal TANF program. One tribe in particular stated that they received an official response from HHS regarding their fiscal year 2009 participation rates two years later, in fiscal year 2011. The tribal official noted in our survey that “tribes have deadlines to meet and we have to wait years for a response.” Another tribe responding to our survey stated that while they submit their data reports to HHS each quarter, they are waiting up to three years to receive their reports back from HHS. Because HHS does not review and share work participation rate data with tribes in a timely manner, tribes may not know of any errors in their data reporting until years later, which could impact not only the data reporting for that year, but also for subsequent years. An HHS contractor primarily responsible for working with tribes on their TANF work participation data said that, in his opinion, tribal TANF data present different challenges for HHS than state TANF data. For example, updating information on tribes’ work participation rates requires keeping track of 64 different TANF plans, where the work participation rates or work hours often change every year, which, according to the HHS contractor, is not as common with state TANF programs. In addition, the number of plans will continue to grow as more tribes have expressed interest in starting their own programs. The same HHS contractor noted that while it would be useful for tribes to see their work participation calculations or to access information for a specific month or year, access to that type of information would require additional programming. Furthermore, he said it would take a more sophisticated program than what HHS is currently using—such as a program flexible enough to define the different tribal TANF variables—to help make updating the data to share with tribes a little easier. HHS uses different methods to provide guidance to tribes on their TANF programs (see fig. 10). Tribal TANF programs are generally satisfied with the assistance they receive from HHS, but some cited deficiencies. When asked to rate different types of assistance received from HHS headquarters and regional offices, the majority of the tribal TANF respondents in our survey indicated that they found guidance and policy documents, technical assistance, training and conferences provided to them by HHS to be somewhat to very useful (see fig. 11). However, many tribes noted that the assistance that HHS headquarters and regional offices provided to them for data reporting and data system development was only slightly or not useful, with some tribes also indicating that they had not received these types of assistance from HHS at all (see fig. 11). For example, 13 out of 40 tribes (33 percent) indicated that data system development assistance from HHS headquarters was only slightly or not useful, while 14 (35 percent) indicated that they had not received any assistance in this area. Tribes also reported that HHS regional and headquarters offices’ timeliness varied in responding to requests for assistance. Specifically, tribal TANF survey respondents indicated greater satisfaction with the speed of HHS regional offices compared to headquarters (see fig. 12). For example, 33 out of 48 tribes (69 percent) responding to our survey said that they were very satisfied with the speed of HHS regional office staff, while only 18 of 46 tribes (38 percent) were very satisfied with the speed at which HHS headquarters office staff respond to their requests. However, some of the survey respondents and tribes we interviewed described situations where HHS regional and headquarters assistance was not timely. For example, some tribes we interviewed described how they had repeatedly sent emails to their regional office asking for information, but the region was unresponsive. Some tribes we interviewed at regional conferences and who responded to our survey also indicated that delayed responses from HHS were particularly frustrating when they were trying to figure out new policies or when they had a limited time in which they could act—such as implementing the new financial form or submitting their Emergency Contingency Fund applications. One senior HHS official explained that even those questions that seem simple on the surface may have greater implications, so all questions must be reviewed and vetted to provide an accurate response, which takes time. However, one tribe stated that HHS made a general announcement about the new financial reporting form in 2007, and then they never heard anything else about the development or implementation of the form until 2 years later, when they were required to start using it. This tribe also noted that HHS held a training meeting with tribes to discuss its requirements after tribes were already required to begin reporting program data using the new financial form. As a result, they did not have an opportunity to include in the reports what they learned in the training. In our survey, another tribe described how they do not receive notifications about program changes from HHS in a timely manner, stating that “we are expected to implement... federal requirements immediately, without immediate guidance or training if needed.” Tribes also indicated in our survey that tribal TANF guidance provided by HHS regional and headquarters offices via phone, email, and training conferences was not always clear or consistent. In our survey, 18 out of 50 tribal TANF respondents (36 percent) indicated that HHS policy on subsidized employment was not clear. HHS officials stated that the timeframes for implementing the Recovery Act did not allow for the issuance of proposed and final rules. HHS posted questions and answers on subsidized employment on their website and sought to provide guidance when they could. However, some tribes explained that in general, they receive mixed messages from HHS’s regional offices and headquarters, and sometimes even from different staff members within the same regional office. Tribes told us that there seems to be some confusion at HHS over how and what information is communicated to tribes, with HHS staff sending tribes incorrect or inconsistent information on tribal TANF policies. For example, one tribe responding to our survey noted that their regional office contact does not always provide direct answers to tribal leaders, which can lead to misinterpretation, while another tribe we visited noted that different HHS regional offices had different interpretations of what types of activities count as cultural activities. HHS officials stated that because tribes are very diverse, it is difficult to have a “one size fits all’ approach to developing some of the policies that tribes want guidance on, such as cultural activities allowed to meet work participation requirements. Federal officials would prefer to give tribes broad flexibility to determine themselves what constitutes an appropriate activity. However, some tribes expressed frustration with this approach, citing how the cultural activities they choose to include in their tribal TANF plans are still subject to review by HHS, and some are not always approved. In addition, tribes have received different kinds of guidance in different formats, and not all tribes were satisfied with the way in which HHS provided it. One tribe described how all of the guidance they received on subsidized employment was shared informally via phone calls and emails—there was no official policy memo from HHS that detailed this guidance. This tribe also acknowledged that it can be difficult to provide policy information to all of the tribal TANF programs at one time, and suggested that HHS leverage its Web site to provide relevant guidance and ensure that all tribes have access to the same information. For example, documents related to past regional tribal conferences, Web casts, and information on tribal TANF technical assistance services are posted on a different HHS Web site, and are not linked to the tribal TANF Web page. As a result, tribes may not know that this information is related to tribal TANF and available to them online. Further, some tribes cannot always attend HHS’s annual regional training conferences, and as a result they miss out on training opportunities and access to key information or guidance. One HHS regional office added that regional offices are not universally consulted or pulled in by HHS headquarters to strategize on technical assistance efforts, or to come up with collective objectives and goals. As a result, the types and amount of technical assistance provided to tribes by each of the different regions varies. The majority of the HHS regional offices we interviewed said that they would like to be able to visit tribes in person to provide more one-on-one training and guidance when tribes need or want it, but recognized that there are limited resources for travel. HHS headquarters officials also described how limited travel funds impacted their ability to visit tribal TANF programs in person as well. Additionally, tribes indicated in our survey that they would like to receive more assistance from HHS—33 out of 44 respondents (75 percent) wanted additional assistance from HHS regional offices, while 30 out of 38 respondents (79 percent) wanted more assistance from HHS headquarters. Regional offices do not always receive clear and consistent guidance from HHS headquarters on new policies, either. HHS officials told us that tribal TANF policies are primarily created in their headquarters office, and then it is up to the regional offices to provide much of the training and technical assistance to tribes related to these policies. One regional official stated that they do not have written policies or guidance on what they should do if tribes are having difficulties administering their tribal TANF program, but that this is the same for state TANF programs, too. Another regional official said they had asked the HHS headquarters office for guidance for the new financial reporting form for a year before they received it. As one tribe indicated, this resulted in the regional office being unable to answer questions from tribes about the new form. Further, because HHS and DOI did not always agree on how to coordinate oversight of tribal TANF programs incorporated in “477 plans,” tribes with “477 plans” were sometimes confused over which agency’s rules and regulations they are required to follow. For example, one tribe responding to our survey described how HHS and DOI still needed to provide them a definitive answer as to whether or not the Emergency Contingency Fund grant which was transferred to their “447 plan” program could be expended until the end of fiscal year 2011. One HHS official described how in the past, DOI did not provide HHS with written regulations or terms and conditions for “477 plans” in general, and this made it difficult for them to know how to implement tribal TANF as part of the “477 plan.” In response, a DOI official explained that DOI purposely did not develop any regulations because adding more rules would diminish the flexibility of the plans, which is contrary to their principal goals. However, both DOI and HHS officials told us that they have been coordinating more to share information with each other and develop policies together, such as recent joint consultations with tribes with “477 plans” on using one funding instrument. While the tribal TANF program as a whole is relatively small in comparison to the TANF program for states, Congress designed tribal TANF in recognition that tribes, like states, would be better equipped to understand and meet the needs of their own communities. However, since the creation of tribal TANF, HHS’s administration of the program has not kept pace with the growth of tribal TANF or with tribes’ changing needs. Improved access to information on how to implement parts of their TANF program or policy changes that could affect their programs can facilitate tribes’ achieving program goals. Further, more prompt, consistent collection and review of all tribal TANF-related single audit report findings and work participation rate, caseload, and financial data, could help HHS to more effectively monitor tribal TANF programs and determine how it could better target its technical assistance and guidance to address areas where tribes may be having difficulty. In addition, more timely HHS data analysis could improve both the accuracy of tribes’ data reporting and the ability of HHS and tribal administrators to determine if tribal TANF programs are effectively maintaining program integrity and meeting their goals. Given the fiscal pressures facing the federal government and the continued demands placed on assistance programs, it is critical that programs designed to serve those most in need are in a position to provide benefits and services as effectively and efficiently as possible while maintaining program integrity. Unless HHS makes improvements in the consistency and availability of single audit report findings, tribal TANF policy guidance, and program data, tribal TANF program administrators will not have the complete information they need to improve the effectiveness and integrity of their programs. To improve guidance and oversight of tribal TANF programs, we recommend that the Secretary of Health and Human Services take the following three actions:  Review and revise, as appropriate, HHS’s process for monitoring, tracking, and promptly resolving tribal TANF single audit findings so that it can more systematically target training and technical assistance to better address recurring problems and mitigate risk. Improve processes for maintaining and monitoring tribal TANF data— such as work participation rate, caseload, and financial data—that can be shared with tribes in a timely manner.  Create procedures to provide more timely, accessible, and consistent guidance on tribal TANF policies that is clearly communicated to tribal TANF programs, and ensure that all tribal TANF policy developments and procedures are readily and easily accessible on HHS’s Web site. For example, HHS could consider more effective ways to provide training to tribes on how new guidance or policy decisions will affect the administration of their programs, and consistently update its Web site to provide information on related tribal TANF technical assistance and training. We provided a draft of this report to the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Health and Human Services for review and comment. HHS provided us with written comments on a draft of our report which are reprinted in appendix IV. Both DOI and HHS also provided us with technical comments that we incorporated, as appropriate. HHS agreed that effective monitoring and continuous improvement of its guidance and technical assistance to tribes as well as to states and other grantees is important, and stated their appreciation for our findings on areas where monitoring, guidance and technical assistance could be improved to tribal TANF programs. HHS also stated that it would be mindful of our overall recommendations and specific examples of ways to improve its efforts, and it is already outlining actions they plan to take to address our recommendations. Specifically, with regard to our first recommendation, HHS commented it would review and seek to identify opportunities for improvement at each step of its process for monitoring, tracking and resolving tribal TANF audit findings, including the identification of recurring problems and risks, and the identification of technical assistance needs identified through the audit resolution process. During the course of our audit work, HHS officials could not find some single audit reports, but they were recently able to provide them, so we removed our finding related to this from the report. HHS also stated that it will take follow-up steps to ensure that all audits with tribal TANF findings will be promptly addressed, and has committed additional staff to working on audit issues. In response to our second recommendation, HHS recognized the need for more timely sharing of data with tribal TANF programs, and cited efforts it is undertaking to address this, including the hiring of an additional tribal TANF data specialist and its continuing work on improving reporting and publishing of preliminary and final caseload and work participation data for recent years. With regard to our third recommendation, HHS stated it would strengthen its efforts to be attentive to opportunities for improvement in training and technical assistance, but it also commented on how we presented findings on its guidance to tribal TANF programs. First, HHS noted that while our report title and text highlight the need to improve guidance, the data provided in the report generally indicate a high level of satisfaction with the guidance and technical assistance currently being provided. We state in our report that tribal TANF programs responding to our survey were generally satisfied with the assistance they received from HHS, but some respondents did cite specific weaknesses in areas such as data system development and reporting. Additionally, in multiple survey open- ended responses and interviews with us, tribal TANF staff cited instances where the timeliness, clarity, and consistency of guidance could be improved, and our title reflects the need for HHS to examine these areas further. In regard to the specific survey findings on data system development and reporting, HHS clarified that the need for additional data system development assistance reflects a need to increase capacity across a broad range of HHS programs, but it is training new employees to assist with data reporting. In addition, HHS noted that the regional and headquarters offices work together, and that a tribe may be unaware that the headquarters office contributed to assistance received through a regional office. HHS also stated that a question raising complex issues would typically be reviewed by both the regional and headquarters offices, and would likely take longer to resolve. We point out in our report that tribes often cited frustration with not receiving consistent and timely information from both regional and headquarters offices, especially on policy changes that had a limited time in which they could act. Thus, it is important that if both offices are indeed collaborating to provide assistance to tribal TANF programs, that their information be consistent and timely for all tribes in all regions. It can be challenging to work with multiple tribes who each have their own unique tribal TANF programs, but if it is taking the regional and headquarters HHS offices longer to resolve a particular question, if would be helpful if they communicated this to the tribes, especially if it is related to a policy change with a specific timeframe or deadline. Finally, HHS described how ACF has committed to undertake additional research initiatives to better understand the needs of tribal members, operations of tribal TANF programs and effective practices. These studies could be helpful in providing HHS with more information on better ways to support the tribes. As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce its contents earlier, we plan no further distribution of this report until 30 days from its issue date. At that time, we will send copies of this report to appropriate congressional committees, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Secretary of the Interior, and other interested parties. The report will also be available at no charge on the GAO Web site at http://www.gao.gov. If you or your staff have any questions about this report, please contact me at (202) 512-7215 or brownke@gao.gov. Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. Key contributors to this report are listed in appendix V. To obtain information on how tribal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) programs have changed since 2002 (when we last reviewed the program), the challenges tribes face in administering their own programs and what tribes have done to address them, and federal agencies’ guidance and oversight of tribal TANF programs, we analyzed federal TANF data, documents and tribal TANF single audit data collection reports for selected years; surveyed all tribal TANF administrators; conducted site visits at 11 tribal TANF programs in four states, and interviewed federal officials. We conducted our work from June 2010 to September 2011 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. Because the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is responsible for collecting tribal TANF data and reporting on tribal TANF programs nationally, we reviewed relevant TANF data compiled by that agency. Specifically, we reviewed both published and unpublished data for fiscal years 2002 to 2009 on (1) the work participation status of all tribal TANF adults, (2) work activity data for those TANF adult recipients with activities, (3) tribes that met and did not meet work participation rates, (4) tribes’ caseloads, and (5) tribes’ expenditure data. The expenditure data analysis also includes tribal TANF expenditure data provided by the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) for those 15 tribes that include TANF in a “477 plan” for fiscal years 2002 to 2009. We also reviewed fiscal year 2009 and 2010 expenditure data from HHS for the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act) Emergency Contingency Fund and tribes’ applications for these funds. We interviewed HHS officials to gather information on the processes they use to ensure the completeness and accuracy of the tribal TANF work participation, work activity, caseload, and expenditure data, but we did not independently verify these data with tribes. However, we did follow up with HHS during the course of our analysis whenever we found any inconsistencies or errors with the data in order to ensure that the data were complete, reasonable, and sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report. In some cases, we received revised information from the agency. We also reviewed DOI documentation related to expenditure data reporting. We found these data to be sufficiently reliable for our purposes. In addition, we reviewed selected documents submitted by tribes to HHS, which the agency does not publish. For example, we reviewed all 24 tribes’ HHS-approved applications for the Emergency Contingency Fund as of June 2011, mentioned above, and all 64 tribal TANF plans approved by HHS as of October 2010. In addition, we reviewed published and unpublished documents from HHS and DOI, such as all seven of the Welfare Peer Technical Assistance Network needs assessments for tribal TANF and Native Employment Works (NEW) programs and a sample of four “477 plan” assessments selected and provided by DOI officials. HHS does not regularly perform on-site reviews of tribes’ TANF data, but auditors periodically review tribal TANF programs to comply with the Single Audit Act of 1984, as amended. To determine if there were any significant tribal TANF or “477 plan” single audit compliance findings, we reviewed all 398 Office of Management and Budget Circular No. A-133 single audit data collection reports for fiscal years publicly available as of May 2011 that included tribal TANF or “477 plan” programs for fiscal years 2002 through 2010. Then we reviewed the specific types of compliance findings in all 114 available single audit data collection reports for tribal TANF programs in existence for 2 years or longer with significant compliance findings for the majority of years that their program was in existence for fiscal years 2002 through 2010. To better understand tribal TANF programs, we conducted a Web-based survey of all tribal TANF administrators for all 64 tribal organizations that administer their own TANF program. The survey included questions about the benefits and challenges of administering a tribal TANF program, changes to TANF service delivery related to the economic recession, and HHS assistance to tribes after the Recovery Act. The survey was conducted from October to December 2010 with 50 out of the 64 tribal TANF administrators (78 percent) responding. We obtained contact information for surveyed tribal TANF administrators from HHS. Beginning on October 25, 2010, we sent e-mail notifications to these officials, and we sent two follow-up e-mails over a period of about 2 weeks to encourage tribes to respond to our survey. We also made follow-up phone calls to encourage nonrespondents to complete our questionnaire. Because this was not a sample survey, there are no sampling errors. However, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey may introduce nonsampling errors, such as variation in how respondents interpret questions and their willingness to offer accurate responses. We took steps to minimize nonsampling errors, including pretesting draft instruments and using a Web-based administration system. Specifically, during survey development, we pretested draft instruments with three tribal TANF administrators from three states (Alaska, California, and Washington) in September and October 2010. We selected the pretest tribes to provide variation in selected program characteristics and geographic location. In the pretest, we were generally interested in the clarity, precision, and objectivity of the questions, as well as the flow and layout of the survey. For example, we wanted to ensure that definitions used in the survey were clear and known to the respondents, categories provided in closed-ended questions were complete and exclusive, and the ordering of survey sections and the questions within each section was appropriate. We revised the final survey based on pretest results. Another step we took to minimize nonsampling errors was using a Web-based survey. Allowing respondents to enter their responses directly into an electronic instrument created a record for each respondent in a data file and eliminated the need for and the errors associated with a manual data entry process. To further minimize errors, programs used to analyze the survey data and make estimations were independently verified to ensure the accuracy of this work. While we did not validate specific information that tribal TANF administrators reported through our survey, we reviewed their responses, and we conducted follow-up, as necessary, to determine that their responses were complete, reasonable, and sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report. For example, we reviewed responses and identified those that required further clarification and, subsequently, followed-up with those tribes to ensure the information they provided was reasonable and reliable. In our review of the data, we also identified and logically fixed skip pattern errors for questions that respondents should have skipped but did not. On the basis of these checks, we believe our survey data are sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our work. To gather additional information on how tribal TANF programs have changed since 2002, the challenges tribes face in administering their own program and what tribes have done to address them, and federal agencies’ guidance and oversight of tribal TANF programs, we conducted site visits to 11 selected tribes administering TANF programs in Wisconsin, New Mexico, Arizona, and California to interview tribal TANF administrators and their staff about their programs (see table 3). We visited these tribes from November 2010 to January 2011. We selected these tribes because they varied in geographic location and selected tribal TANF program characteristics, including the size of the tribal service population, the number of years operating their tribal TANF program, program structure (e.g., tribes with “477 plans”), and type and amount of TANF and TANF-related program funding received (e.g., NEW grants, the Recovery Act’s Emergency Contingency Fund, and state funding). We also selected tribes that were located in both urban and rural areas to ensure that we captured any related differences in TANF program implementation as well as the types of challenges tribes may face. During the site visits, we interviewed tribal TANF officials and staff as well as TANF participants. Through these interviews, we collected information on tribes’ TANF services and work activities, the benefits and challenges of administering a TANF program, the impacts of the economic recession, and tribes’ working relationship with federal agencies as well as with other tribes administering a TANF program. We cannot generalize our findings beyond the tribes we visited. To learn more about federal agencies’ oversight and guidance of tribal TANF, we conducted interviews with DOI officials and HHS officials in headquarters and all regional offices serving areas where tribal TANF programs were located. These six regional offices are located in Chicago, IL; Dallas, TX; Kansas City, MO; Denver, CO; San Francisco, CA; and Seattle, WA. We also attended HHS regional tribal TANF conferences in California and Washington. In addition, we interviewed tribal TANF consultants and reviewed relevant information from past GAO, HHS, DOI, nonprofit, academic, and research institutions’ reports on tribal TANF, and reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and guidance related to tribal TANF.

(serves all members of federally recognized tribes in the Municipality of Anchorage) Central Council Tlingit and Haida Indian Tribes of Alaska (serves 20 Indian and Alaska Native villages) Bristol Bay Native Association (serves 29 Alaska Native villages) Navajo Nation (also in New Mexico and Utah) San Carlos Apache Tribe California Robinson Rancheria/California Tribal TANF Partnership (serves 16 tribes) North Fork Rancheria of Mono Indians Owens Valley Career Development Center (serves 8 tribes) Morongo Band of Mission Indians Southern California Tribal Chairmen’s Association, Inc.\n\n### Summary:", "answer": "The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA) gives American Indian tribes the option to administer their own Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant programs. GAO first reported on the use of this flexibility by tribes in 2002 (GAO-02-768), and given the upcoming expected reauthorization of TANF, GAO was asked to examine (1) how tribal TANF programs have changed since 2002, especially in light of changing economic conditions; (2) the challenges tribes face in administering their own TANF programs and what tribes have done to address them; and (3) the extent to which the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has provided guidance and oversight to promote the integrity and effectiveness of tribal TANF programs. GAO analyzed federal TANF data; interviewed federal officials; surveyed all tribal TANF administrators; and conducted site visits at 11 tribal TANF programs in four states. Since GAO first reported on tribal TANF programs in 2002, the number of programs has increased--from 36 in 2002 to 64 in 2010. In addition, more tribes use program flexibilities to both tailor services to meet the needs of their TANF families and cope with changing economic conditions. GAO also found that some tribes have increased their work participation rate goals over time. For example, more than half of the 36 tribes that have been administering a TANF program since 2002 have raised these goals over time. Many tribes also allow a wide range of activities families can use to meet work participation rates, such as cultural activities or commuting time. Tribes also reported in GAO's survey that changing economic conditions have adversely affected their caseloads, funding, and services provided. For example, some tribes reported that since the beginning of the economic recession in 2007, they have larger average monthly caseloads, use other federal funding to fill budget gaps, and cut back supportive services to provide more cash grants. According to GAO's survey results, tribal TANF programs face challenges with initial program implementation, staff development and retention, and the development of adequate data systems. Moreover, all 11 tribes GAO visited talked about the various barriers to self-sufficiency facing their TANF participants, such as a lack of transportation and limited employment opportunities. To address these challenges, many tribes reach out to HHS regional office staff, other tribal and federal programs, and private consultants. For example, to address challenges related to developing adequate data systems, GAO learned that the majority of tribes use consultants to develop their systems and provide training. In addition, to enhance employment opportunities, some tribes have placed participants at their Head Start offices, while another tribe has partnered with its modular housing plant. HHS provides oversight and guidance for tribal TANF programs, but does not always do so in a timely or consistent manner. HHS officials told GAO that they use tribal TANF single audit report findings to target training and technical assistance to tribes. However, the systems that HHS uses to track these reports are fragmented, and as a result, tribal TANF officials may not consistently be aware of all the single audit findings related to tribal TANF programs, or be in a position to promptly identify and address recurring problems and mitigate risk. Other oversight tools, such as quarterly data reports used to calculate work participation rates, are not consistently updated by HHS in a timely manner, which, according to GAO's survey, is a challenge to tribes' administration of their TANF programs. HHS headquarters and regional offices provide guidance such as basic policy manuals, training at yearly conferences, and one-on-one assistance over the phone. However, some tribes expressed difficulty in finding and receiving clear, consistent, and timely guidance from HHS, which hinders their ability to successfully manage tribal TANF programs and finances. GAO recommends that HHS review its process for tracking related single audit reports, improve processes for maintaining tribal TANF data that can be shared in a timely manner, and provide timely, accessible and consistent guidance that is clearly communicated to its tribal TANF programs. HHS commented it will be mindful of these recommendations as it examines ways to improve its efforts."}

To pre-empt the need for or, if necessary, facilitate, evacuations of American citizens, State has tools for warning American citizens about potential crises. It also provides varying degrees of assistance to Americans wishing to leave a country. A number of State units, including the affected post, are involved in planning for and implementing an evacuation, which typically takes the form of an authorized or ordered departure of staff and dependents; State ends a departure of post staff and dependents by terminating the authorization or order. State evacuates staff, dependents, or private American citizens in response to various crises, including civil strife, terrorist incidents, natural disasters, conventional war threats, and disease outbreaks. For example, according to information compiled by State, of the 89 evacuations over the past 5 years, almost half were clustered in the Middle East, Turkey, and Pakistan (see fig. 1). Twenty-three of these evacuations were due to the impending U.S. invasion of Iraq in early 2003; the remaining evacuations in the Middle East, Turkey, and Pakistan were due primarily to terrorist threats or attacks. Ten other evacuations in Southeast Asia resulted from the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in the spring of 2003, and nine in the Caribbean were due to hurricanes. During 2006 and 2007, State evacuated 11 posts for various reasons, including civil unrest, elections that could lead to civil unrest, a coup attempt, a U.S. embassy bombing, a hurricane, and war. Evacuations differ considerably in scope, size, and complexity and can involve (1) authorized departure of post staff and dependents, (2) ordered departure of post staff and dependents, or (3) assisted departure of American citizens. When authorizing departure, State grants permission to nonemergency post staff and all dependents to voluntarily depart the country at U.S. government expense. In contrast, when State orders departure, State directs nonemergency post staff and all dependents to leave the country. The number and type of post staff and dependents actually departing a country can vary greatly depending on the size of the post, the nature of the crisis, and the type of departure. For example, evacuations can range from massive, complex events like the safe extraction of almost 15,000 Americans and family members from Lebanon in the summer of 2006, to the relatively small-scale evacuation from Conakry, Guinea, in February 2007 during a period of civil strife. The latter involved flying a few dozen people (dependents of embassy staff, State employees temporarily deployed to the embassy, and private American citizens) to a nearby city in another West African country, where U.S. embassy personnel assisted the evacuees in obtaining commercial flights back to the United States or an alternate approved safe haven. While authorized departures and ordered departures of post staff and dependents typically occur several times a year, according to State and DOD officials large-scale evacuations of private American citizens are rare. Based on the information State compiled, the department has implemented 271 authorized and ordered departures from overseas posts since 1988. According to the results of our survey, approximately 20 percent of posts reported that they had experienced an authorized departure within the past 5 years, and about 10 percent reported experiencing an ordered departure within this period. State has several tools for helping American citizens during crises overseas, including evacuation. These tools include (1) travel warnings, (2) registration and warden systems, and (3) varying degrees of assistance to Americans wishing to leave a country. State issues travel warnings to urge Americans considering trips abroad to stay away from potentially dangerous areas. For example, as of July 2007, State had current travel warnings for 27 countries. The reasons for these warnings include the threat of terrorism, civil strife, violent crime, and targeted attacks against U.S. citizens. Almost 45 percent of posts reported that State has issued a travel warning for their country within the past 5 years. State also encourages, but cannot require, U.S. citizens to register with the department when traveling abroad. According to State officials, this allows State to have better information on the number and location of American citizens in a country should a crisis arise. In the event of a crisis, wardens—which consist of business contacts, hotel representatives, nongovernmental organization officials, or other individuals connected to communities of Americans in the country who have agreed to serve as a liaison between the post and the parties they have agreed to contact— forward messages from the post to these parties. These messages, often conveyed via phone trees in the past but now typically sent via mass e- mails, text messages, or faxes, contain information about potential security threats or urgent directives such as where and when to gather in the event of an evacuation. Almost three-quarters of posts reported issuing a threat or security warning within the past 5 years. Although State cannot order American citizens to leave a country due to a crisis, State officials said they provide varying degrees of assistance to Americans wishing to leave. State officials told us American citizens typically leave on commercially available flights; the U.S. government does not generally arrange transportation for departing American citizens. State sometimes assists by creating greater availability of commercial transport, such as by requesting U.S. flag carriers to schedule more flights. Infrequently, when commercial transportation is not available, State officials contract transportation for American citizens. More serious crises may require the assistance of DOD; according to data compiled by State, DOD has provided assistance on only four occasions in the past 5 years. For example, during a period of civil unrest in a Caribbean country in 2004, DOD provided military assistance to help embassy personnel and their families depart the country. On very rare occasions, large numbers of American citizens depart the country on U.S. government-contracted and U.S. military transportation. A number of State units are involved in planning for and implementing the authorized or ordered departure of staff and dependents and assisting American citizens who wish to leave (see fig. 2). In Washington, D.C., State headquarters provides guidance and training to prepare for evacuations. A Crisis Management Support unit coordinates crisis response with other State units and U.S. government agencies, supports taskforces that assist posts in handling crises, and trains headquarters staff in evacuation procedures and policy. Several State bureaus also are involved in preparations for possible evacuations and implementing evacuations. These include the Bureau of Diplomatic Security, which generates emergency guidance and oversees planning for crises; the Bureau of Human Resources, which includes a Family Liaison Office that assists evacuated spouses and dependents; the Consular Affairs Bureau, which responds to the needs of American citizens abroad; and the Bureau of Administration, which is responsible for chartering flights or other transportation out of the country, if needed. In addition, FSI in Arlington, Virginia, provides training for staff before they leave for their first overseas post or rotate to a new post, and conducts periodic CME training at each post. Overseas, posts also are responsible for preparing for crises, including a potential evacuation of staff, dependents, and private American citizens in the country. For example, the post’s EAC develops an EAP to prepare for crises; the plan includes trip wires that can be used to determine when to authorize or order the departure of staff and dependents. Each post also prepares an estimate of the number and location of private American citizens present in the country and practices responding to crises that could lead to an evacuation through CMEs and other drills. During a crisis, the ambassador can request that State headquarters approve a departure of post staff and their families and is expected to recommend post evacuations on a timely basis when circumstances warrant it. These evacuations may be approved “when it is of national interest to require the departure of some or all employees and/or their eligible family members, or if there is imminent danger to the life of the employee or the lives of the immediate family of the employee.” The formal decision on evacuating post staff and dependents is made by the Under Secretary for Management in an Action Memorandum. The decision is communicated to the relevant overseas post via an approval cable, or if necessary, by other means. The Bureau of Diplomatic Security, which is responsible for providing a safe and secure environment for the conduct of U.S. foreign policy, also plays a role in this decision. Beyond security concerns, other factors such as staff morale or political considerations can affect an ambassador’s decision regarding whether to request evacuation of post staff and dependents. For example, according to State officials, an ambassador may be reluctant to disrupt the lives of staff and their families, particularly those staff who would have to remove their children from school. The officials also said an ambassador may be hesitant to authorize or order people to leave due to concern that a drawdown of staff and dependents could send a signal to the host country that the United States no longer considers the country safe for its employees and their families. Former and current State officials noted that these factors can sometimes create tension between State headquarters in Washington, D.C., which often is focused primarily on security concerns and therefore in favor of evacuation, and leadership at post, which may be more reluctant to initiate an evacuation. While a post is in evacuation status, there is generally a change in the composition of staff and an increased workload, both of which can affect staff morale. Some staff, whom the ambassador considers critical for addressing the crisis, assisting American citizens in the crisis, or keeping the post up and running, remain at the post. In addition, non-U.S. staff also generally remain at the post. These staff, referred to as locally employed staff, are typically from the country in which the post is located, although they can also be from third countries. Locally employed staff range from professional office staff to drivers, groundskeepers, and others. These remaining U.S. and local staff are often joined by U.S. government officials from State and other agencies who are sent to the post temporarily to help manage the crisis. The changed work environment, including the absence of family members, the crisis-related workload that can involve long hours, and the addition of new co-workers can affect staff morale both positively and negatively. According to State officials, the crisis atmosphere can create a special bond among the remaining post staff. In addition, these staff may feel freer to dedicate more time to their work knowing they will not be neglecting their families, who also are safely removed. On the other hand, State officials said that staff remaining at the post can experience extreme stress and feel isolated without the support of their families. When the ambassador, in consultation with State officials at headquarters, determines that it is safe for departed staff and families to return to a post, the Under Secretary for Management concludes an authorized or ordered departure by terminating the authorization or order. If an authorized or ordered departure is not terminated within 6 months, the post switches to “unaccompanied” status. Since such posts have experienced prolonged crises, State deems them more dangerous and Foreign Service officers rotate there for just 1 year instead of the more typical 2 to 4 years. Unaccompanied status means that there are restrictions on whether spouses, children, or any other dependents can stay at the post. There can be several gradations of unaccompanied status. For example, Abidjan, Côte D’Ivoire, is currently a partially unaccompanied post, where spouses and preschool-aged children are allowed; however, State does not consider the post safe enough for school-aged children who generally travel to and from school and other activities on their own. A post can continue on unaccompanied status for some time. Three posts in one Persian Gulf country were placed on ordered departure in April 2004 and switched to unaccompanied status in August 2004; all three remain unaccompanied as of April 2007. Deficiencies in State’s guidance and plans can hinder post efforts to prepare for a possible evacuation of post staff, dependents, and American citizens. State’s primary crisis management guidance, the EPH, has limited usefulness in preparing overseas posts for evacuation. In addition, posts are not comprehensively reviewing and updating their EAPs in order to plan and prepare for potential evacuation. Post-produced estimates of American citizens in country are frequently inaccurate best guesses, and weaknesses in a State and DOD MOA need to be corrected to prepare for large-scale evacuations. The EPH contains State’s emergency policies and procedures and is State’s primary crisis management guidance. State officials said the EPH was revised in November 2005 to minimize boilerplate language and simplify its presentation. However, we found in our survey conducted from January 2007 to April 2007 that posts do not consider the EPH particularly useful in preparing for the possibility of evacuation. In our survey to posts’ EACs, we asked respondents to rate the usefulness of eight resources a post could use to prepare for the possibility of evacuation. Among these eight resources, posts rated the EPH last in terms of being “very useful” in preparing for the possibility of evacuation. Almost 60 percent of respondents rated the EPH, at best, only “somewhat useful” in preparing for the possibility of evacuation. In addition, a number of State officials reported that the EPH, which is hundreds of pages long, was too generic, formulaic, and voluminous, all of which inhibits its usefulness in preparing for possible evacuation. For example, one post reported that the EPH had too much boilerplate language, which concealed important information, and another reported that the EPH was a large, unwieldy document with no easy index and information that was not easy to access. One senior State official told us that the EPH was not helpful during a major evacuation because it was quickly rendered irrelevant by fast-moving events. Moreover, the EPH is missing some elements that could be useful to prepare for the possibility of large-scale evacuation of American citizens. For example, while the EPH provides guidance on communicating with the media in various crisis situations, we found it has no specific guidance for addressing the public through the media during a mass evacuation of American citizens from a war zone. In addition, it does not contain guidance, such as lessons learned, best practices, or tips from experienced consular officers, on producing accurate estimates of the number of American citizens in country for F-77 reports. The handbook is also a post’s principal reference for preparing and revising its EAP. However, over half of posts reported that the EPH was, at best, only “somewhat useful” in developing the post’s EAP. For example, some posts reported that the EPH is too general and cumbersome to use to develop an EAP. Posts are required to create and periodically update an EAP that includes planning for crises and “trip wires” used to determine when to authorize post staff and dependants to leave, order them to leave, close down the post, or initiate the evacuation of American citizens. According to State guidance, all posts are required to conduct a comprehensive review and update of their EAPs once a year. However, we found almost 40 percent of posts who gave a date reported that it has been 18 months or longer since they most recently updated their EAP. When EAPs are not comprehensively reviewed and updated on a timely basis, important logistical information that is critical during an evacuation may not be available to post. For example, State officials told us that updated contact lists of local government officials in an EAP are particularly important for the Consular Section at post in the event that American citizens need assistance to evacuate from a country. Moreover, some posts have not updated trip wires in their EAPs to cover likely threats. According to State officials, each post is required to develop trip wires (an event such as the closure of the main road from an embassy to a country’s only airport) that can trigger a post response (such as evacuation of post staff and dependents). Posts reported that (1) protest and demonstrations, (2) natural disasters, and (3) terrorism are the top three most likely threats at their posts. Figure 3 illustrates posts’ responses to the survey question, “Which three of the following threats are the most likely to occur at your post?” However, almost 25 percent of posts reported that they do not know whether their trip wires cover likely threats or, at best, their trip wires leave some likely threats unaddressed. Trip wires in a post’s EAP need to be reviewed and updated to ensure that likely threats at post are covered. In addition, State guidance encourages posts to plan and coordinate with other foreign missions during crises, such as evacuations. However, almost 60 percent of posts reported that they do not have standing arrangements with foreign missions on evacuation planning and coordination or do not know if such arrangements are in place. The importance of working with other foreign missions in planning, preparing, and coordinating an evacuation was highlighted by the July 2006 evacuation from Lebanon. State officials said that good coordination with other foreign missions was an important contributor to the success of the evacuation. Close coordination and communication with other foreign missions can also be important for smaller evacuations. For example, a State official reported that during an evacuation of about 400 American citizens from West Africa in 2004, the post extensively coordinated and communicated with foreign missions because all American citizens were evacuated on foreign government-arranged aircraft. State’s estimates of the number of American citizens in countries abroad are frequently inaccurate. Posts are supposed to provide an estimation of the number of private American citizens in a country in F-77 reports, based in part on traveler registration. These reports play a central role in State and DOD’s planning for and conducting evacuations of American citizens. However, we found that more than three-quarters of posts reported that the last F-77 at post was, at best, only somewhat accurate in its estimation of the American citizen population. In addition, of those posts able to provide an estimate of the nature of the inaccuracies, over two-thirds reported that the F-77 report tends to underestimate the American citizen population. Several factors may complicate the estimation of American citizens in country. First, according to State officials, countries can experience wide fluctuations in their American citizen populations at certain times of the year (such as the summer tourist season, religious festivals, or pilgrimages) and it can be challenging to estimate the location of American citizens in country. Second, State encourages American citizens to register with the department whenever they travel internationally, and State relies on registration numbers to generate estimates of American citizens in country. However, State officials said that American citizens often do not register and cannot be compelled to register. Third, State officials also said it is difficult to estimate the number of dual nationals. For example, according to a State official, there are a number of Saudis in Saudi Arabia who were born in the United States when their parents were studying or traveling abroad. These Saudis are eligible for U.S. citizenship and may choose to obtain U.S. passports at any time, depending on the situation in their country. In addition, State officials said sometimes dual nationals with passports are not captured in any U.S. citizen entry data received from the host government. Dual nationals may use their non-American passports to enter foreign countries to avoid host country-imposed fees or to maintain a non- American profile in country. Even when a post can make estimates of the number of dual nationals in country, it can be difficult to predict when and if they would evacuate from a country. Dual nationals often have close ties with friends and relatives in country, which can influence their decision on when to evacuate. According to State officials, the estimates posts produce in the F-77 are best guesses and not based on a particular methodology. Based on our review of F-77 reports, the reports typically do not contain the source data used to generate estimates or explanations from consular officers on how they used these data to generate estimates. Considering the complications of producing accurate estimates of American citizens in country, consular officers need to document the processes and data sources used to produce their estimates. If processes and data sources used were documented, consular officers would have an understanding of how prior estimates were generated using available information. According to a State official, State is in the process of updating the instructions for producing F-77 reports to include frequently asked questions (FAQ) on preparing estimates of American citizens. However, in our review of the FAQs, we found only basic guidance with little detail on how to produce estimates or how to address the complexities of estimating a diverse and changing American citizen population overseas. In addition to the above challenges to producing an accurate estimate, some posts are not updating their F-77 reports on a timely basis. According to State guidance, posts are to submit F-77 reports annually. However, over one-quarter of posts reported that their F-77 was updated 18 months or longer ago or that they do not know when the F-77 was updated. The F-77 plays a central role in evacuation and other crisis management planning and provides the figures that State and DOD rely on when planning for and conducting evacuations of American citizens. If the F-77 reports are not updated on a timely basis, State and DOD risk planning and preparing for evacuations with out-of-date information. When State requires assistance with a large-scale evacuation (e.g., during the 2006 evacuation from Lebanon), it may request help from DOD. Guidance for coordination between State and DOD is included in an MOA meant to define the roles and responsibilities of each agency in implementing such large-scale evacuations. According to the MOA, State is responsible for the protection and evacuation of all U.S. citizens abroad and is generally responsible for evacuating U.S. citizens. However, State may request assistance from DOD to support an evacuation. Once DOD assistance has been requested, DOD is responsible for conducting military operations to support the evacuation in consultation with the U.S. ambassador. During an evacuation, the MOA calls for coordination between State and DOD through a liaison group responsible for evacuation planning and implementation. However, we found weaknesses in the MOA (and its amendments) that could reduce State and DOD’s ability to quickly and effectively work together during a crisis. The MOA does not address the logistical capabilities and limitations of each department, such as DOD’s substantial capability to contract and track large volumes of aircraft and ships. In addition, unlike EAPs at post, the MOA does not reference contact lists (which could be updated on a regular basis) that could expedite practical communications between State and DOD personnel in a crisis. Moreover, a majority of posts reported that they have had little or no training or preparations for a potential large-scale evacuation with DOD. Since large- scale DOD-assisted evacuations occur infrequently and posts have minimal training with DOD for such evacuations, explicit guidance between State and DOD is needed to speed communication and coordination between the departments. The lack of readily available, hands-on information needed to quickly arrange logistics could limit State and DOD’s ability to quickly coordinate and collaborate during a large-scale evacuation. For example, as we reported previously, weaknesses in the MOA and other factors, such as State and DOD having different institutional cultures and systems, resulted in miscommunication between State and DOD and possible delays in chartering ships and planes to evacuate American citizens from Lebanon in July 2006. A State official in charge of logistics said State personnel did not know DOD’s chain of command, and it took time to determine whom to contact at DOD for transportation logistics. State officials found a DOD organization chart online, but it did not have names and contact information. Consequently, State may have lost time during the evacuation trying to determine whom to contact within DOD. While State provides general crisis management training to overseas- bound staff, there are gaps in this training as it relates to preparing for and implementing evacuations. For example, insufficient EAC training and infrequent drills can hurt posts’ readiness to act in the event of an evacuation. In addition, while CMEs are recognized as useful, posts reported that they could be more relevant and practical. Further, FSI crisis management training at its campus in Arlington, Virginia, for new and returning Foreign Service officers covers a variety of topics, including evacuation, and uses a variety of tools; however, it does not regularly include input from colleagues with evacuation experience. State is beginning to implement new training tools that allow for more relevant, frequent, and inclusive training. As mentioned earlier, EAC members at overseas posts are responsible for assisting the ambassador in planning and preparing for crises, including possible evacuation. Almost 90 percent of posts reported that the EAC has enough staff to meet its assigned emergency responsibilities. According to the EPH, a “robust training program” for staff manning overseas posts “is essential for emergency preparedness,” including possible evacuation. Despite this guidance, we found that insufficient training of EAC members, coupled with infrequent drills for post staff, can hurt posts’ readiness to act in the event of an evacuation. The EAC is required to conduct at least one tabletop exercise per year to ensure that all members understand their roles and responsibilities, are familiar with the EAP, and to identify out-of-date or flawed information in it. However, we found that EAC members at several posts are not receiving the training needed to be prepared to assist the ambassador in the event of an evacuation or other crisis. About 24 percent of posts reported that EAC members are only somewhat aware or not aware of their responsibilities and need to make more preparations for evacuation under the EAP. For example, officials from several posts reported that newer staff have not received training necessary to meet their assigned emergency responsibilities. EAC members at one post reported that their newer EAC colleagues are not familiar with retrieving and using evacuation-related information in the EAP and could use more training in this area. Over 75 percent of posts reported that EAC members receive training or rehearse their assigned emergency action functions on the EAC at most once a year, if at all. One post reported that no formal training of EAC members or tabletop exercises have been conducted at the post since April 2003. Even when exercises are conducted, not all EAC members are fully engaged. For example, a Regional Security Officer who has led several training exercises stated that there is little participation from other EAC members and as a result, they are not prepared to make decisions in a crisis. He added that other EAC members should be prepared to make such decisions because the regional security officer often is engaged in specific tasks during crises and does not make all the decisions related to addressing them. In addition, over one-quarter of posts reported that EAC members have not received training necessary to meet their assigned emergency responsibilities. For example, one post noted that the frequent turnover at unaccompanied posts, where staff serve for only 1 year, means that EAC members at these posts need training to make them better equipped to work as a team. Another post suggested that EAC members should be better trained on how to coordinate crisis response with U.S. government agencies other than State. A third post, which had received a large influx of temporary duty staff to assist with the evacuation of American citizens from Lebanon in the summer of 2006, commented that its human resource officer needs training in coordinating temporary duty staffing. Without such training, posts trying to address the needs of temporary staff and deploy them where they would be most useful risk diverting resources from the evacuation effort itself. The EAC also is tasked with preparing and conducting briefings, drills, exercises, and other crisis preparedness functions for the post as a whole. For example, the EAC is supposed to conduct drills that test the post’s emergency notification system and the consular warden system, which is used to notify American citizens in the country in the event of a crisis. However, over 40 percent of posts reported that they had never used drills or exercises to test parts of their EAP related to drawing down post staff and dependents, and almost half of posts reported that they had never used drills or exercises to test parts of their EAP related to evacuation of private American citizens. In addition, even though the EPH recommends that posts consider involving host country response services in the training and drills conducted, less than a third of posts reported that host government officials have participated in evacuation drills or exercises to test the post’s EAP. While CMEs are widely recognized as an important tool, they could be made more relevant to posts. CMEs are simulations meant to prepare staff at overseas posts for handling crises, including evacuations. According to the EPH, these exercises are supposed to be conducted at each post every 2 to 2-1/2 years, and every year at 1-year (unaccompanied) posts. FSI designs the exercise scenarios and hires contractors to conduct them at the posts. FSI officials said the training typically lasts 2 days, starting with an overview of the EPH and EAP followed by several crisis simulations for all post staff on the first day and continuing on the second day with longer and more involved simulations for EAC members. Over 70 percent of posts reported that they have used these exercises to refine their EAP, and more than three-quarters of this group reported that the exercise was very or extremely useful in doing so. Staff from a few posts characterized the exercises as realistic and timely, and FSI officials cited several instances in which the exercises improved crisis preparedness in a concrete manner, such as by prompting post staff to identify a location for their alternate command center. State guidance directs that scenarios in CMEs be post-specific and drafted with post input. However, staff from some posts described the exercises either as not practical or relevant, too long, tying up too many resources, or “too far-fetched.” For example, staff at one post said the exercises focused on a catastrophic but unlikely scenario, such as a weapons of mass destruction attack, rather than smaller-scale, more likely events, such as an ordinary bomb blast. Staff at another post pointed out that such catastrophic scenarios are inappropriate because they involve post staff making decisions that would normally be made at a much higher level in Washington, D.C. The Defense Attaché at this post said it would be helpful if after action reports were collected on crises that have actually occurred, and if CMEs could be designed to simulate those scenarios. The post’s management counselor added that FSI should do a better job of gathering ideas on how to improve CMEs, and that one way to make the exercises more realistic would be to have the post’s more experienced staff develop them and the more junior staff run through them. This would allow the junior staff to prepare for possible crises, during which they may have to fill in for more senior colleagues who may be absent. Some post staff reported that more practical, frequent, and less formal, hands-on exercises would be helpful, for example, “so people can learn who does what, and when.” Staff at one post cited examples of shorter, more practical exercises, or “mini CMEs,” lasting only a few hours each that they had found useful. For example, these included an exercise focused on bird flu, which preceded an actual case of bird flu in the country, and one in which they practiced text messaging their colleagues to warn of a car bomb at the embassy so people would know not to go back to the building after returning from lunch. Staff at this post also have used their crisis management training time to discuss lessons learned after an event. The event in this case was a large-scale evacuation of American citizens, during which this post served as a temporary safe haven for the evacuees. In a cable describing this CME, the ambassador wrote that it “enabled us to ‘Monday-morning quarterback’ our recent experiences while they were still fresh in our collective minds, and before transfer season robbed us of considerable institutional knowledge.” He also said that the exercise allowed EAC members to consider lessons learned and “allowed the crisis management trainer to hear firsthand many of the difficulties overcome, which are details that often slip through the cracks in the final wrap-up versions of after action reports.” According to a State document on evacuations, locally employed staff should be involved in all stages of emergency planning. The EPH also encourages posts to include locally employed staff in crisis management training. Further, a majority of posts reported that input from local staff is “very useful” in preparing for the possibility of an evacuation. A number of State officials with evacuation-related experience said that these staff, who generally remain at the post during a crisis, often at great risk to themselves, have played critical roles during evacuations because of their contacts with the host government and fluency in the local language. According to FSI, local staff are included in the first day of crisis management training. Crisis management training at FSI in Arlington, Virginia, for new and returning overseas staff covers a variety of topics. However, those portions of the training we attended, which covered evacuation-related information, were limited to tabletop exercises and ad hoc input from participants who happen to have experienced evacuations or other crises. FSI trains State and other U.S.-government staff for their postings overseas. It provides courses for new Foreign Service officers about to be sent to their first post and for more experienced staff rotating to new posts. It also provides courses targeted to specific positions, such as ambassadors and deputy chiefs of mission, or Community Liaison officers (CLO). All these courses have crisis management segments, which last anywhere from a few hours to a few days, and cover evacuation-related information, including a brief description of the EPH, EAP, EAC, the warden system, and the post’s obligations to private American citizens, among other evacuation-related information. As a result, all staff receive some training to prepare for possible evacuation before being sent overseas. The training we attended included lectures accompanied by PowerPoint presentations. Two of the three course segments we attended also included tabletop exercises with hypothetical crisis scenarios involving escalating trip wires and role playing as part of a mock EAC. While the material presented in the courses provided some useful information, such as descriptions of the EPH, EAP, and EAC, some of the most practical, as well as engaging, parts of these course segments— comments from participants who happened to have been through evacuations—were included by chance rather than being formally incorporated into the program. For example, a participant in one class who had been evacuated twice from Jakarta, Indonesia provided much more specific information than the instructor was able to provide regarding the importance of contact information for evacuating family members. Fifty percent more posts rated advice from experienced colleagues as “very useful” in preparing for the possibility of evacuations compared to the number that rated crisis management training at FSI “very useful.” Given this finding, FSI crisis management training could be improved by incorporating guest speakers who have been through evacuations (either as evacuees, critical staff remaining at post, or temporary staff sent to help with the crisis). A consular official at the embassy in Beirut who worked through the 2006 evacuation of American citizens from Lebanon told us such training would be valuable and she would like to contribute to it. State is beginning to implement training tools through which staff with evacuation experience can share their insights with colleagues, and it is experimenting with new mechanisms to allow more frequent and inclusive training. For example, the Consular Affairs Bureau recently conducted two workshops in the aftermath of Hurricanes Wilma and Katrina that featured staff with experience evacuating American citizens from hurricanes. In addition to State employees, the first hurricane workshop included officials from other U.S. government agencies, the private sector, and other entities, so participants could learn what the roles of these entities were in the evacuations and discuss any challenges in coordination. The second workshop primarily included State employees but was conducted via videoconference, which allowed local staff from affected posts to participate. According to the Director of Consular Affairs’ Office of American Citizen Services, these staff are especially valuable because they tend to remain at a post much longer than rotating U.S. staff and therefore have long institutional memories and a wealth of experience. The Consular Affairs Bureau also is in the process of developing training based on lessons learned from staff involved in the 2006 evacuation of American citizens from Lebanon. FSI is beginning to use new tools as well, including conducting some exercises via videoconference. For example, it has used videoconferencing to conduct exercises tailored to specific upcoming, potentially crisis-prone events, such as major sporting events held in overseas cities. It also has conducted videoconference-based exercises from hubs in several countries that have allowed staff from outlying posts to participate without having to travel to the training location. While posts in some developing countries may lack the needed infrastructure to participate in videoconferencing and differing time zones can create scheduling problems, this technology can allow for more frequent, on- demand exercises with greater participation from staff at all posts as well as locally employed staff. In addition, a State official involved in training said FSI would consider other options for improving CMEs, including possibly reevaluating their 2-day structure and introducing online training. State lacks a systematic process to collect, analyze, and incorporate lessons learned from previous evacuations, which constrains posts’ efforts to prepare and plan for future evacuations. The majority of posts do not complete after action reports detailing lessons learned following an evacuation, and there is no State entity responsible for ensuring their production. Evacuation-related after action reports do not have a standardized format, and these reports could include lessons learned on recurring staff and morale issues. State has no systematic mechanism to ensure lessons learned included in after action reports are analyzed and incorporated into modifications of training and guidance. Although State headquarters has disseminated some ad hoc guidance based on lessons learned from prior evacuations, the guidance is sometimes vague and may be overlooked by posts due to the high volume of material they receive. Post staff have limited institutional knowledge of earlier evacuations, which points to a need for a more comprehensive process that captures and disseminates lessons learned from prior evacuations to all post staff. Following an authorized or ordered departure, posts are required to complete an after action report that includes lessons learned. Furthermore, State guidance for cables terminating authorized or ordered departure directs that posts submit an after action report within 15 days. Despite this explicit guidance, almost 60 percent of posts that have experienced an authorized or ordered departure in the past 5 years reported that they have not produced an after action report. As a result, State does not have the opportunity to assess most posts’ evacuation experiences. It is therefore difficult for State to determine common themes or trends among evacuations. There may also be similarities among posts that do produce after action reports that would not be truly representative of post evacuations as a whole. According to State officials, there is no single entity at State responsible for ensuring that posts produce after action reports following an evacuation. We were told of specific cases where valuable lessons were learned during a recent post evacuation, but this information remained generally unknown because State has not systematically collected after action reports. For example, one evacuation was due to civil unrest where several hundred Americans were evacuated from an African country. The official told us the warden system collapsed during the crisis; wardens either fled the violence, could not get to their phone lists, or could not charge their cell phones and make calls. The post had purchased a computer program that allowed it to send text messages over cell phones en masse. The official said this capability was critical to getting messages out to American citizens, and the system undoubtedly saved lives. The official further stated that the ability to text message is crucial in a crisis and should be a standard tool for assisting American citizens. While some posts also are implementing this communication tool, the lessons learned from using this technology during an actual crisis may have been lost because the official did not report the lessons learned to State headquarters. In another example, a post in Asia went to authorized departure during the SARS epidemic. An official who served at the post during the epidemic said that before the event, there had not been much thought on how posts would deal with a worldwide epidemic, but the experience increased the post’s preparedness for such an event. However, the official said the post did not produce an after action report detailing lessons learned during this event. Though required after action reports are to include lessons learned, policies to be clarified, resource needs, training needs, and an assessment of host government actions, their lack of a standard template may cause key information to be missed and make the information hard to use and assess. We reviewed about a dozen after action reports and found that while they were well-organized and presented information in a logical manner, they generally varied in style and presentation. For example, some after action reports we reviewed presented information as a narrative, in which the author described the event and reported observations. Other after action reports we reviewed presented information on what went well, followed by what could be improved or recommendations for action. A single post also may produce multiple reports from different State entities at that post, such as one report for lessons learned by Consular Affairs and another report from the management officer. The lack of a standard template that highlights key information to guide posts in their reporting makes it possible that posts may omit important information. For example, an ambassador at a post involved in a recent evacuation noted that many challenges posts encounter during evacuation are not included in after action reports. State’s guidance to posts does not include providing lessons learned in response to recurring staffing and morale issues, such as the process of deciding whom to evacuate and what happens at a post after nonemergency staff and family members have left. Problems involving staff and morale can occur at posts during evacuations and may affect the ability of posts to effectively carry out operations during and after a crisis. According to State officials, a challenge during evacuations is determining which personnel will be designated as “emergency” and required to stay at post and which staff will be designated “nonemergency” and told to leave. There often are tensions over who leaves and who stays. For example, some post staff have appealed their designation as “nonemergency” in the hope of staying. While certain senior and security- related positions would likely be designated “emergency” positions in any situation, one State official said that decisions regarding emergency personnel are often made based on individual employees’ ability to handle crises or their family situation rather than their position. As a result, making these decisions and communicating them to employees often requires considerable skill and tact. State officials said that decisions regarding the reasons for evacuations are sometimes not transparent, and a State official said post staff can be suspicious of why certain personnel were designated to leave. The State official said staff may be concerned that an evacuation is really an attempt to “right size” a post. After action reports could provide lessons learned on how to improve personnel decisions in order to minimize damage to staff morale and allow the post to function smoothly both during the crisis and when the departing staff return. Locally employed staff at two posts and one State official said another concern is that local staff, who are generally from the host country or a third country and typically remain at a post during an evacuation, may be nervous over job security, since their supervisors are leaving the post. They also may be unprepared for carrying out their duties in the absence of a familiar supervisor. A State document to posts recommends posts address local staff supervision issues before departure and establish a clear chain of command for remaining personnel. However, a State official said post staff who are evacuated often do not explain to local staff who they will report to or what their new responsibilities will be. In addition, State officials said that local staff may fear for their personal safety during a crisis, after nonemergency staff and dependents depart. A State official and a State document emphasized that it is important to keep local staff as informed as possible about an unfolding crisis, what actions the post is taking and why, and what their roles should be. After action reports could provide lessons learned on how to best keep local staff informed about an unfolding crisis and what their new roles will be when nonemergency staff and dependents leave. Further, two State officials with extensive overseas experience told us that after nonemergency staff and dependents leave the post, the role of the CLO, who is responsible for addressing staff morale and related issues, remains important. However, the CLO typically departs the post with family members. These officials said post morale can drop substantially when family members depart and staff can suffer burnout, working exceedingly long hours. A State document to posts recommends that posts retain as many CLO functions as possible after nonemergency staff and dependents have left. After action reports could provide lessons learned on the role of the CLO in maintaining staff morale and could include best practices, such as the designation of a temporary or backup CLO after the CLO departs. State has no systematic mechanism to ensure lessons learned from after action reports are analyzed and incorporated into modifications of State training and guidance. According to State officials, there is no entity at State responsible for systematically reviewing and analyzing the evacuation lessons learned contained in after action reports, and no entity responsible for determining whether modifications to State evacuation guidance and training are necessary. As a result, lessons learned from evacuation-related events are not being comprehensively analyzed, and lessons learned are not systematically incorporated into guidance and training. Under the current system, the majority of posts reported they have not received, or do not know if they received, written guidance from State headquarters on earlier evacuations. Although State headquarters has disseminated some ad hoc guidance based on lessons learned from evacuated posts, the guidance can be overlooked and is sometimes vague. State headquarters issued two lessons-learned cables to all posts following the evacuation of almost 15,000 American citizens from Lebanon in the summer of 2006. State also has issued cables on lessons learned from evacuations related to hurricanes and avian flu. However, the current system involves distributing cables on lessons learned together with numerous cables on other subjects, and posts easily can overlook these important lessons due to the volume of cables received. In addition, cables do not always include actions posts should take to prepare for evacuation. As a result, the lessons from these sources can be inconsistent and vague. Posts reported that advice from colleagues experienced in evacuations is one of the most useful tools in preparing for evacuations. However, State’s policy of changing staff assignments at overseas posts every 1 to 3 years limits the knowledge gained from evacuations, since staff who experienced an evacuation at a post soon move on. The most frequent rotations occur at unaccompanied posts, which are often in dangerous and unstable areas. According to State officials, staff at unaccompanied posts often are less experienced than other posts, and staff generally change every year. Additionally, midlevel positions at many hardship posts continue to be staffed by junior officers who lack experience and have minimal guidance. According to State officials, the number of positions at unaccompanied posts is at its highest level in history. State officials said less experienced staff can be stationed at unaccompanied posts for several reasons; they have less seniority in State’s posting process, they often do not have families and are less affected by unaccompanied status, or they may seek out placements at unaccompanied posts because such postings may enhance their career development. For example, State recently made service in a hardship post a prerequisite for promotion to the senior Foreign Service. This may result in a trend toward less experienced personnel serving shorter terms at unaccompanied posts that could be vulnerable to future crises and potential evacuations. Since post staff have limited institutional memory of prior evacuations, particularly at unaccompanied posts, it is important to have a process that captures and disseminates lessons learned from prior evacuations to all post staff. State’s diplomatic mission requires its staff and dependents to work in posts all over the world, including in unstable, dangerous, or crisis-prone regions from which staff and dependents might have to be evacuated. In recent years, evacuations have occurred on a regular basis—over the past 5 years, State has authorized or ordered the evacuation of an average of one overseas post every 3 weeks. Private American citizens also are present in increasing numbers all over the world, sometimes in unstable, dangerous, or crisis-prone regions where they might need evacuation assistance. To meet these challenges, State has made a concerted effort to prepare staff to manage the wide variety of crises they might face. For example, State has developed crisis management guidance, plans, and training such as the EPH, EAP, and instruction in Washington, D.C., and at post. State also has been proactive in seeking to improve its ability to prepare for and implement evacuations. However, while we found no major adverse impacts, we did find deficiencies in State’s guidance and plans and gaps in its training to plan, prepare for, and manage evacuations of post staff, dependents, and American citizens. In addition, State lacks a systematic process to collect, analyze, and incorporate lessons learned from previous evacuations. As a result, State misses opportunities to assess its performance and make modifications to improve its evacuation guidance and training. Further, the memorandum of agreement governing State and DOD’s division of responsibility has weaknesses that could hamper communication and cooperation between the two departments. State should improve its planning, preparations for, and management of evacuations through updating its guidance and plans and improving the training for overseas staff with emergency responsibilities. With thousands of U.S. government personnel and their families working at U.S. posts and ever-increasing air travel of private American citizens living and traveling overseas, evacuations will continue, and large-scale operations such as the evacuation of American citizens from Lebanon could happen again. To help improve State planning, preparations for, and management of evacuations of post staff, dependents, and American citizens from overseas posts, we recommend the Secretary of State designate an entity within State to (1) ensure that EAPs are prepared annually, (2) ensure that posts generate standardized evacuation after action reports with lessons learned, and (3) systematically collect and analyze these reports to assess State’s performance and recommend modifications to State guidance, plans, training, and exercises, if direct posts to complete narrative sections in the F-77 report documenting the processes and data sources used to produce their estimates, as well as lessons learned on generating estimates for that particular country; review post and FSI crisis management training for EAC members to meet assigned emergency responsibilities, including planning and preparing for possible evacuation, and identify areas for improving training, particularly for less experienced EAC members; and strengthen CMEs by having posts play a greater role in designing them and incorporating the most likely threats to occur at the post into exercise scenarios. To help improve State planning, preparations for, and management of large-scale evacuations of post staff, dependents, and American citizens from overseas posts when State requires DOD assistance, we recommend the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense review the MOA between State and DOD (and its amendments) to ensure it expedites practical communication and coordination between the two departments before and during a large-scale evacuation, particularly in areas regarding logistical capabilities and limitations of each department (such as capabilities to contract and track passenger aircraft and ships). We provided a draft of this report and our survey results to the Secretaries of State and Defense for their review and comment. We received written comments from the Departments of State and Defense that are reprinted in appendixes III and IV. State concurred with three of our five recommendations and partially concurred with two. State also provided us with technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate. DOD partially concurred with the recommendation regarding the MOA between State and DOD (and its amendments), which was the only recommendation relevant to DOD, and did not comment on any other aspect of the report. Specifically, State concurred with our recommendations that the Secretary of State direct posts to complete narrative sections in the F-77 report documenting the processes and data sources used to produce their estimates, as well as lessons learned on generating estimates for that particular country; review post and FSI crisis management training for EAC members to meet assigned emergency responsibilities, including planning and preparing for possible evacuation, and identify areas for improving training, particularly for less experienced EAC members; and strengthen CMEs by having posts play a greater role in designing them and incorporating the most likely threats to occur at the post into exercise scenarios. State partially concurred with our recommendation that the Secretary of State designate an entity within State to ensure that EAPs are prepared annually. In its response, State said that this task is already covered under existing State regulations and added that the department is currently deploying a new software application that should facilitate keeping EAPs up to date. While we welcome these efforts, it is not clear that they are adequate to ensure that EAPs are updated on an annual basis. State concurred with the rest of this recommendation, which asks the Secretary of State to designate a central entity to ensure that posts generate standardized evacuation after action reports with lessons learned and systematically collect and analyze these reports to assess State’s performance and recommend modifications to State guidance, plans, training, and exercises, if necessary. Both State and DOD partially concurred with our recommendation regarding the MOA between State and DOD (and its amendments). While both agencies agreed to review the document, they misunderstood part of our recommendation. We did not recommend that a contact list be added to the MOA. Furthermore, State and DOD said they believed existing interagency communication channels are adequate for managing and implementing large-scale evacuations. In addition, DOD expressed concern that explicitly specifying general capabilities and limitations in the MOA could adversely affect ongoing military operations. In response, we have modified the recommendation to clarify that the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense review the MOA (and its amendments) to ensure it expedites practical communication and coordination between the two departments before and during a large-scale evacuation, particularly in areas regarding logistical capabilities and limitations of each department (such as capabilities to contract and track passenger aircraft and ships). State also questioned whether the survey results, as we presented them in our report, accurately reflect posts’ assessment of the usefulness of existing crisis planning resources and whether survey results contradict anecdotal comments/criticisms regarding FSI training. We obtained a high response rate to our survey of overseas posts; the survey results are a statistically valid reflection of posts’ views on the guidance and training available to plan and prepare for potential evacuation. The survey results and findings derived from them are both factually correct and methodologically valid. The survey was developed based on a review of State documentation and interviews with State officials and was reviewed with State officials from Crisis Management Support, Consular Affairs, Diplomatic Security, and the regional bureaus. Survey methodology experts at GAO were directly involved in the collection, analysis, and review of survey results, as well as the findings and conclusions derived from those results. We are sending copies of this report to interested Congressional Committees and to the Secretaries of State and Defense. We will also make copies available to others upon request. In addition, the report will be available at no charge on the GAO Web site at http://www.gao.gov. If you or your staffs have questions about this report, please contact Jess T. Ford at (202) 512-4128 or fordj@gao.gov. Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. GAO staff who made contributions to this report are listed in appendix V. To examine the Department of State’s (State) efforts to plan, prepare for, and manage evacuations of post staff, dependents, and American citizens from overseas posts, we (1) assessed State’s guidance and plans to prepare for possible evacuations of post staff, dependents, and American citizens; (2) assessed the training, drills, and exercises used to prepare staff at overseas posts for crises, including possible evacuation; and (3) evaluated State’s efforts to collect, analyze, and incorporate lessons learned from previous evacuations into modifications of guidance and training. We employed several methodologies to address these three objectives. We conducted a survey of all Emergency Action Committees (EAC) at State embassies and consulates worldwide. In addition, we conducted structured interviews with State employees who had experienced a variety of evacuation-related events over the last 5 years. We also examined State and Department of Defense (DOD) documents regarding efforts to plan, prepare for, and manage evacuations. We met with State and DOD officials overseas in Cyprus, Lebanon, and Saudi Arabia; in Washington, D.C.; and at U.S. Transportation Command headquarters at Scott Air Force Base in Illinois. As part of our efforts to collect information on all three objectives, we conducted a survey of all 243 EACs at State embassies and consulates (posts) worldwide. EACs are responsible for crisis management at post and therefore are best qualified to discuss crisis management activities, including preparing for and implementing evacuations. The survey consisted of 49 questions covering a range of topics on how posts plan, prepare for, and implement evacuations, as well as how lessons learned are reported. The survey was sent to the principal officer at each post (typically the deputy chief of mission or consul general). We requested that the survey be completed collectively by members of the post’s EAC, and completed surveys were intended to reflect the views of the EAC as a whole. We received 210 completed surveys, for an overall response rate of 86 percent. State posts are divided into six different geographical bureaus. The Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs had the highest response rate for any geographical bureau at 92 percent, and the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs had the lowest response rate at 73 percent. The survey was distributed by the heads of the State regional bureaus to posts under their supervision via e-mail as a Word attachment on January 30, 2007, and recipients were requested to complete the survey within 2 weeks. On February 15, 2007, the regional bureaus sent targeted e-mail reminders to posts that had not yet responded. We contacted all remaining posts that had not yet responded by telephone, starting on February 28, 2007. Completed surveys were accepted until April 4, 2007. The survey was developed based on a review of State documentation and interviews with State officials. We conducted face-to-face pretests with two former State regional security officers as well as two current State officials who had recently served on an EAC. We also reviewed the survey in a meeting with State officials from Crisis Management Support, Consular Affairs, Resource Management, Human Resources, Diplomatic Security, and the regional bureaus. We conducted the review and pretests to make sure that (1) the questions were clear and unambiguous, (2) terminology was used correctly, (3) the survey did not place an undue burden on agency officials, (4) the information could feasibly be obtained, and (5) the survey was comprehensive and unbiased. We made changes to the content and format of the survey after the meeting with State officials and after each of the four pretests, based on comments received. The majority of questions in the survey were close ended, which allowed us to develop statistics that are representative of the entire universe of Emergency Action Committees. The survey also allowed for some open- ended responses. Commentary from open-ended questions is reflected in the body of the report, but is not summarized statistically. Survey percentages reported do not include nonresponses to each question in our survey. Of responses analyzed in this report, there were relatively few nonresponses to individual questions. Survey questions, results, and number of respondents per question are presented in an electronic supplement, which may be accessed at GAO-08-24SP. We conducted 22 structured interviews, via e-mail and in person, with State personnel who had served on an EAC and experienced a draw down or evacuation within the last 5 years. Eighteen responded to our e-mail with the structured interview questions. We also conducted four structured interviews in person. The purpose of the structured interview was to collect detailed qualitative information related to evacuations through open-ended questions, such as training, guidance, policies, implementation, morale, and lessons learned. We pretested the structured interview in-person with two State officials currently serving on an EAC who had experienced at least one evacuation. We made changes to the content and format of the structured interview based on comments from the pretests. To identify candidates for structured interviews, we sent a brief questionnaire, along with the survey, to all 243 EACs. The questionnaire and survey were pretested at the same time to check for clarity and usefulness. We made changes to the content and format of the questionnaire based on comments we received. We received approximately 100 completed questionnaires with respondents indicating a willingness to participate in a structured interview via e-mail. We reviewed the completed questionnaires and selected interview candidates in order to obtain a wide variety of experiences. All six State geographical bureaus were represented in the structured interviews. Structured interview respondents had experienced many different crisis situations, including natural disasters, disease epidemics, war threats, and civil unrest. The respondents had experienced authorized departure, ordered departure, assisting private American citizens in evacuations, serving as a transit point for evacuees, departing posts during evacuations, and traveling to posts to serve as temporary employees while the post was in evacuation status. The respondents held different positions at posts; such as ambassador, deputy chief of mission, regional security officer, management officer, Consular Affairs chief, public affairs officer, general services officer, U.S. Agency for International Aid country director, and Peace Corps country director. To review State and DOD’s planning, preparation for, and managing of evacuations, we examined State and DOD documents, including State’s Emergency Planning Handbook, numerous post Emergency Action Plans, several post-produced F-77 reports of potential evacuees, the Memorandum of Agreement between State and DOD on the Protection and Evacuation of U.S. Citizens and Nationals and Designated other Persons from Threatened Areas Overseas, and various other State cables and documents related to evacuations, including situation reports, lessons- learned cables, and other documents discussing lessons learned. In the United States, we met with numerous State and DOD officials to assess how State and DOD plan, prepare for, and manage evacuations. In Washington, we met with the Under Secretary of State for Management; the Assistant Secretary of State for Consular Affairs and other officials from the Consular Affairs Bureau; officials from State’s regional bureaus; and from State’s bureaus of diplomatic security, administration, resource management, and political military affairs. We also met with Crisis Management Support officials, who support State taskforces during a crisis and train staff in evacuation policy and procedures, and toured State’s Operations Center, where taskforces are located. In addition, we met with officials from State’s Foreign Service Institute, which conducts crisis management training. To review how State and DOD implement staff draw downs and evacuations of American citizens, and make observations on these agencies’ successes and challenges in doing so, we traveled to Lebanon, Cyprus, and Saudi Arabia, where we met with U.S. embassy and host country officials involved in staff draw downs and evacuations. State officials in Lebanon and Cyprus implemented one of the largest evacuations of American citizens in U.S. history. The consulate in Jeddah and the embassy in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, have each experienced three evacuations in the past 5 years. To assess how State interacts with DOD during DOD-assisted evacuations or draw downs, we met with DOD officials in the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Defense Intelligence Agency, and the U.S. Transportation Command’s Military Sealift Command. We also traveled to Scott Air Force Base in Illinois to meet with officials at U.S. Transportation Command headquarters and its Air Mobility Command. In addition, we spoke by telephone with Central Command officials in Tampa, Florida. We performed our work from June 2006 to July 2007 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. The following are GAO’s comments on the Department of State letter dated October 2, 2007. 1. State notes an “apparent contradiction” between our reference to lengthy and cumbersome State guidance and a recommendation that State “provide additional, more comprehensive guidance on specific aspects of crisis management to the field.” Our report contains no such recommendation. According to the audit work we conducted, as detailed in appendix I, we found the Emergency Planning Handbook (EPH) to be both “too generic” and “voluminous,” as well as lacking in information useful in preparing for and implementing a large-scale evacuation of American citizens. 2. We disagree with State’s assertion that some of the conclusions in this report are at variance with the actual survey data collected by GAO about the usefulness of existing crisis planning resources. The survey results and findings derived from them are both factually correct and methodologically valid. Survey methodology experts at GAO were directly involved in the collection, analysis, and review of survey results, as well as the findings and conclusions derived from those results. 3. State has mischaracterized our statement.\n\n### Summary:", "answer": "Since 1988, the Department of State (State) has ordered over 270 evacuations from overseas posts due to civil strife, terrorist incidents, natural disasters, conventional war threats, and disease outbreaks. To prepare for evacuation, overseas posts rely on a variety of guidance, plans, and training, such as Emergency Action Plans (EAP). GAO was asked to assess State's (1) guidance and plans to prepare for evacuation, (2) training and exercises to prepare post staff for crisis, and (3) efforts to collect, analyze, and incorporate evacuation lessons learned into guidance and training. GAO examined State and Department of Defense (DOD) documents, spoke with State and DOD officials, conducted a survey of 243 overseas posts, and completed 22 structured interviews with State personnel. Using its guidance and training, State has carried out numerous evacuations in the recent past--notably the safe evacuation of nearly 15,000 American citizens and family members from Lebanon. However, GAO found areas where State can improve its guidance, plans, and training to prepare for and manage evacuations of post staff, dependents, and American citizens. For example, posts do not find State's primary guidance particularly useful in preparing for evacuation. In addition, while State requires posts to update EAPs annually, almost 40 percent of posts surveyed have not updated their plans in 18 months or longer. Post-produced estimates of American citizens in a country are best guesses and more than three-quarters of posts said their last estimate was, at best, only somewhat accurate. We also found weaknesses in a memorandum of agreement (MOA) between State and DOD that could limit these agencies' ability to effectively work together during a large-scale evacuation. While State provides crisis management training to post staff, GAO found gaps in training related to preparing for evacuations. Over one-quarter of posts reported that Emergency Action Committee (EAC) members have not received training necessary to meet their emergency responsibilities. In addition, officials from several posts reported that newer staff have not received training for their EAC roles. Although posts reported that crisis management exercises are an important training tool, post staff said exercises should be more practical and reflect scenarios more likely to occur at post. State's evacuation preparations are constrained by the lack of a systematic process to collect, analyze, and incorporate evacuation lessons learned. Almost 60 percent of posts evacuated in the past 5 years said they did not produce an evacuation \"after action\" report, as required. Further, State has no entity to ensure posts are producing after action reports and no formal review process to analyze and incorporate lessons learned from these reports into guidance and training. Although State has developed some documents on evacuation lessons learned and distributed them to all U.S. overseas posts, the documents are sometimes vague and can be overlooked by posts due to the volume of material they receive. Limited institutional memory of prior evacuations at posts reinforces the need for a process to collect, analyze, and disseminate lessons learned from evacuations to all post staff."}
{"original_length": 16504, "trunc_length": 16384, "text": "\n\nSummarize the following text into a summary of less than 800 words.\n### Text:\n\nPolice corruption, according to the academic and other literature and anticorruption commission reports we reviewed, is not a new problem and dates back to the establishment of the first organized local police forces. According to a report by the Knapp Commission, when the NYPD was established in 1844 as the first municipal police department in this country, it experienced immediate problems with extortion and other corrupt activities. Subsequently, the NYPD has experienced scandals and investigations approximately every 20 years. As in New York City, corruption has plagued police departments in many major cities at some point in their history, including Boston, Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles, Miami, New Orleans, and Philadelphia. While it has been a persistent problem for law enforcement, the nature of police corruption has varied over time. Historically, police corruption involved such low-level and passive activities as bribery schemes and nonenforcement of the law. Also, early police corruption was often depicted as the result of a few dishonest individuals—commonly referred to as “rotten apples”—in an otherwise honest department. However, during the police corruption scandals of the 1970s and 1980s, the corruption uncovered in several cities was found to be systemic, rather than attributable to individual behavior. “The overwhelming majority of those who do take payoffs are ‘grass-eaters,’ who accept gratuities and solicit five- and ten- and twenty-dollar payments from contractors, tow-truck operators, gamblers, and the like, but do not aggressively pursue corruption payments. ‘Meat-eaters,’ probably only a small percentage of the force, spend a good deal of their working hours aggressively seeking out situations they can exploit for financial gain, including gambling, narcotics, and other serious offenses which can yield payments of thousands of dollars.” The Knapp Commission concluded that, while the meat-eaters receive the large payoffs and the newspaper coverage, the grass-eaters are the heart of the problem because their greater numbers make corruption respectable. Despite this history, disagreement still exists among criminal justice practitioners, researchers, and the public as to what type of behavior constitutes police corruption. Some definitions include behavior that ranges from brutality to questionable behavior such as verbal attacks on citizens. Two key elements of the various definitions of police corruption, as found in the academic literature we reviewed, are that the acts involve (1) the “misuse” of the officer’s professional role—“authority” or “official position”—and (2) the receipt or expected receipt of material rewards or personal gain. Enforcement of laws against all forms of vice (e.g., gambling, prostitution, and drugs) reportedly afford opportunities for police corruption. However, drug enforcement often exposes police officers to large amounts of cash and drugs held by individuals who are not likely to complain about illegal police behavior. Recent newspaper accounts, commission reports, academic studies, and other literature we reviewed suggest that today there are more opportunities than in the past for drug-related police corruption. Although the FBI and DOJ have jurisdiction for investigating and prosecuting public corruption, police corruption is generally investigated internally by local police departments and/or prosecuted by local district attorneys. The FBI, DOJ, and other federal agencies are involved in only some local public corruption cases, including police corruption, and the extent of that involvement varies among cities across the country. A number of the commission reports, academic publications, and other literature we reviewed and the officials and academic experts we interviewed described differences between the nature of drug-related police corruption and the nature of other types of police corruption; however, opportunities for financial gain were a key factor in both forms of corruption. Unlike other types of corruption, officers involved in drug-related corruption were found to be actively committing crimes, not just passively ignoring them or protecting criminals. These crimes ranged from stealing drugs and money from drug dealers to lying under oath about illegal searches. Usually these activities were carried out by small groups of officers, rather than by lone individuals. Moreover, drug-related police corruption was not found to be a systemic problem that infected entire departments or precincts. Although cases of drug-related police corruption have been identified in a number of large cities, we found that only limited data on the extent of the problem were available. Several of our sources described differences between the types of illegal activities generally associated with drug-related police corruption and those associated with other types of police corruption. Traditional police corruption usually involved a mutually beneficial arrangement between criminals and police officers (e.g., the former offered the latter bribes in exchange for immunity from arrest). In contrast, several studies and investigations of drug-related police corruption found on-duty officers engaged in serious criminal activities, such as (1) conducting unconstitutional searches and seizures; (2) stealing money and/or drugs from drug dealers; (3) selling stolen drugs; (4) protecting drug operations; (5) providing false testimony; and (6) submitting false crime reports. According to NYPD officials, some police officers also engaged in drug-related crimes while off duty. The Mollen Commission reported in 1994 that the most prevalent form of police corruption in New York City was police committing crimes, especially in connection with the illegal drug trade, whereas the Knapp Commission reported about 20 years earlier that the prevalent form of corruption was police taking money to overlook illegal activities, such as bookmaking. In summary, the Mollen Commission, in contrast to the Knapp Commission, found that the meat-eaters, as opposed to the grass-eaters, had become the rule among corrupt police officers, rather than the exception. The types of reported drug-related corruption engaged in by police officers, as well as the types of police corruption tolerated, differed among cities and even differed among precincts within the same city. Several academic experts, as well as officials in New York City, indicated that the levels of acceptance for different types of offenses committed in connection with drug enforcement activities varied, and that the perceived line between corrupt and acceptable police behavior was not fixed. For example, some of these sources suggested that an officer might view stealing money from a drug dealer as acceptable behavior, while the officer would draw the line at stealing and selling drugs. Over time, behavior, such as dealing in illegal drugs, which was previously viewed as unacceptable by even corrupt officers might become acceptable or at least tolerated. However, our sources also indicated that formerly acceptable behavior, such as lying under oath, might become unacceptable. In addition, certain sources suggested that in one department, officers might be more likely to report drug-related corruption but not acts of brutality; while in another department, the reverse might be the norm. As in the case of other types of police corruption, a primary reported motive for drug-related police corruption was financial gain, but profit was not the only motive identified. The Mollen Commission identified three motivating factors for corruption: (1) profit, (2) power, and (3) perceived “street” law enforcement ends. The commission further explained that while corrupt police officers usually raided drug locations for profit, they sometimes carried out raids because they (1) wanted to show that they were in control of the precinct’s “crime-ridden streets,” (2) wanted to feel the “power” and “thrill” of their badges and uniforms, or (3) believed that vigilante justice was the way to punish those who might otherwise go unpunished. Similarly, some of the officials we interviewed suggested such motives as job cynicism due to the perception that the revolving door of justice lets criminals go free, or officers’ dissatisfaction with how they were viewed and treated by the people in the community. Our sources also identified differences between the pattern of drug-related police corruption and patterns of other types of police corruption. The commissions and academic experts reported that drug-related police corruption typically involved small groups of officers. For example, the Mollen Commission described these groups, such as those found in New York City’s 73rd precinct case, as “crews” akin to street gangs. Similarly, the Chicago Commission reported that the officers they surveyed characterized corruption as isolated in small groups. In other cities, identified drug-related police corruption cases usually involved from 9 to 30 officers often working together, not individuals or entire departments. Drug-related police corruption usually did not involve such non-drug-related patterns as (1) just a few isolated individuals within a department who engaged in illegal acts or (2) low-level corruption pervading entire departments or precincts. The commission reports, as well as several federal and New York City officials and academic experts we interviewed, generally described drug-related police corruption as being organized differently from the corruption of earlier eras; however, these sources varied in their characterization of the new organizational forms. For example, in describing New York City’s 30th precinct case, a DOJ official said that, although numerous officers were involved, it was not one large enterprise. Rather, officers moved in and out of groups, depending on how opportunities presented themselves. The Mollen Commission compared the “standardized and hierarchical—almost bureaucratic” organizational forms of traditional corruption with the street-gang-like structure of the drug-related crews, which were “small, loyal, flexible, fast moving and often hard hitting.” The commission also noted that, in some cases, there were explicit agreements or pacts between officers to help ensure that officers observing criminal behavior would not report this behavior. The information sources used in this report generally concurred in their description of the nature of drug-related police corruption. However, since these sources’ observations were based on publicly identified cases of such corruption, which may not be representative of all drug-related police corruption cases, these observations may not completely portray the nature of the problem. We did not locate any centralized, systematically gathered, nationwide source of data that could be used to estimate the extent of the problem nationally. Some data on drug-related police corruption were available from federal agencies, such as the FBI, and local agencies. These data usually included only information about cases in which the reporting organization had been involved or were of limited use because of inconsistencies or anomalies in the data-gathering and tabulating methodologies. However, our sources provided accounts of some drug-related police corruption cases in several large cities. During our review, we were unable to identify nationwide data sources for quantifiable information on the extent of drug-related police corruption. In this regard, we contacted appropriate DOJ agencies, including the National Institute of Justice (NIJ), the Bureau of Justice Statistics, the Criminal Division’s Public Integrity Section and Narcotic and Dangerous Drug Section, the FBI’s Public Corruption Unit, and the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP); national and state police organizations; and academic experts in the field of police research. However, various acedemic experts and officials we interviewed and the commission reports reviewed expressed the view that, by and large, most police officers are honest. Although we could not locate any databases from which to estimate the extent of drug-related police corruption, DOJ agencies provided us with some data. DOJ investigative and prosecutorial agencies, including the FBI’s Public Corruption Unit, EOUSA, the U.S. Attorneys’ Offices in the Southern and Eastern District of New York, and the Criminal Division’s Public Integrity Section, had data on the number of corruption cases in which they were involved. BOP maintained some data on former law enforcement officers in federal correctional facilities. NIJ provided us with information on two NIJ-sponsored police integrity studies. However, officials indicated that NIJ did not collect or maintain quantitative data. The FBI provided us with data on the number of drug-related corruption cases involving state and local law enforcement, between fiscal years 1993 and 1997, in which it was the lead law enforcement investigative organization. (See app. II for a comparison of total and drug-related FBI-led law enforcement corruption cases/convictions for fiscal years 1993-97.) An official in the FBI’s Public Corruption Unit told us that the FBI has jurisdiction in local police corruption cases (i.e., when an officer is alleged to have abused his or her official capacity to advance a criminal cause). However, this official also indicated that the FBI usually only investigates local police corruption matters when (1) “systemic” corruption problems were identified but were not being addressed by local officials, (2) no one was designated at the local level to investigate allegations of corruption, (3) the police department’s internal investigative bureau was unwilling or unable to investigate itself, or (4) a police department or local government requested an FBI investigation. These situations generally involved small police departments with 20 or fewer officers. Frequently, according to the official, the FBI provided the local police department with the resources, expertise, and required technology to conduct the investigation. Because the FBI is selective in the drug-related police corruption cases it handles, for the reasons discussed above and because of resource constraints, these cases may not be representative of the nature, geographic distribution, or other characteristics of drug-related police corruption cases. Moreover, the number of cases handled by the FBI may not be indicative of the total number of drug-related police corruption cases occurring in cities across the country. The DOJ Criminal Division’s Public Integrity Section provided us with data, reported annually, on public corruption cases handled (1) solely by the Section, (2) by the Section in conjunction with a U.S. Attorney’s Office, or (3) solely by a U.S. Attorney’s Office. These data included public corruption cases involving illegal drug activities. However, not all cases involving such activities by public officials are handled as public corruption violations and, therefore, would not be included in the database. Furthermore, these data were not categorized by the type of officials committing the corruption (e.g., an elected political official or a police officer) but by the level of government—federal, state, or local—at which the corruption occurred. Therefore, these data indicated the number of federal prosecutions of corrupt local officials, but not the number of police officers prosecuted. According to a BOP official, the BOP database identifies “special supervision cases,” which include former law enforcement officers who have been convicted of various offenses, including drug-related corruption, and incarcerated in federal correctional facilities. He said that this category of cases could include some state and local police officers, but these officers could not be identified. In addition, the official indicated that this category could be analyzed by offense code to determine whether the offender’s current conviction was drug-related. However, he noted that drug-related corruption cases could not be identified for two reasons. First, the database does not distinguish between drug-related corruption convictions and other drug-related convictions. Second, some officers involved in drug-related police corruption may have pled guilty to non-drug-related offenses, such as conspiracy; therefore, these officers would not be identified in the database as having been convicted of a drug-related offense, including police corruption. Thus, it was not possible to determine from the BOP database the number of state and local police officers who were incarcerated in the federal system for drug-related corruption. Officials from the U.S. Attorneys’ Offices for the Eastern and Southern Districts of New York told us that they maintained information on the drug-related police corruption cases they handled, but that most drug-related police corruption cases in New York City were investigated by the NYPD’s IAB and prosecuted by the local district attorneys. According to these officials, their offices become involved in a police corruption case when the case (1) is egregious and warrants federal involvement—that is, it is precinctwide or large in scope; (2) is generated by their offices; (3) is brought to them by the NYPD’s IAB; (4) is cross-jurisdictional—crosses city or state boundaries; or (5) is a case closed by NYPD’s IAB or local authorities that a U.S. Attorney decided to review. According to the Eastern District official, that district handled five or fewer cases of police corruption each year. The Southern District official indicated that that district was involved in a small number of police corruption cases referred to it by the NYPD’s IAB, and that it also conducted numerous investigations, every year, of police corruption allegations made to the office. Both districts participated in the prosecutions of drug-related corruption cases uncovered during the Mollen Commission investigation. Academic experts and various U.S. Attorney and FBI officials indicated that the primary repository for any data on drug-related police corruption was at the local level, particularly the internal affairs section of local police departments. However, they cautioned that obtaining, analyzing, and trying to create a national database on police corruption from local data sources may present several problems. First, data from local agencies may not be readily accessible because internal affairs units may view the data as proprietary or confidential. Second, drug-related police corruption cases may not be readily identifiable as such. For example, an officer investigated for such corruption may be charged with perjury, rather than a drug-related offense. Third, available data provided by local officials may not be verifiable because of the lack of access to case files. Even if the files were available, academic experts we interviewed believed that other files concealing allegations of corruption might exist in some police departments. Fourth, available data reflect who has been caught, identified, and recorded, but not necessarily all of those officers who have engaged in drug-related police corruption. Fifth, local information may not be available from a single source, since cases of drug-related police corruption may be handled administratively by the police department, prosecuted by the local district attorney, or prosecuted by the local U.S. Attorney’s Office. Finally, available data are not likely to be comparable across police departments because of variations in the definition and handling of drug-related police corruption cases, as well as differences in data collection methods. One researcher characterized local police department corruption data as measures of a department’s energy for investigating and its ability to measure corruption, not as reliable indicators of trends in the overall level of corruption in a department. Our sources did identify examples of publicly disclosed cases of drug-related police corruption in several cities during the past decade. The Mollen Commission investigated and uncovered drug-related police corruption in New York City. The Chicago Commission described identified cases of drug-related police corruption in Chicago, New York City, Philadelphia, Miami, New Orleans, Los Angeles, and Detroit. In addition, we identified accounts of drug-related police corruption in Atlanta and Cleveland. (App. III contains a synopsis of drug-related cases in several cities.) However, since the publicized cases only provided information about those officers convicted of identified drug-related corruption offenses in cities where the problem had been reported, these individuals and cities may not be representative of officers who commit such offenses or of the locations where such crimes are committed. From the case information available, no conclusions can be drawn about (1) which types of officers are involved in drug-related corruption; (2) the extent of drug-related police corruption within cities where it has been identified; or (3) the incidence of drug-related police corruption in cities across the country. The commission reports, much of the academic and other literature we reviewed, and officials and academic experts we interviewed, identified a variety of factors as being associated with drug-related as well as other types of police corruption. These factors included (1) opportunities to commit illegal acts or crimes on the job—for example, the availability of large sums of money; (2) the maturity-level (age) and education-level of the officer; (3) inadequate training, particularly integrity training, in the police academies and on the job; (4) a police culture that supported or ignored corruption; (5) ineffective headquarters and field supervision; (6) management’s failure to enforce a code of integrity; (7) weaknesses in a police department’s internal investigative structure and practices; (8) involvement in police brutality; and (9) pressures arising from an officer’s personal neighborhood ties. Our sources did not rank the factors according to their impact on drug-related police corruption; therefore, we had no basis on which to assess their relative importance. Moreover, since these factors were only associated with identified drug-related police corruption cases that have been publicly disclosed, they may not be all inclusive or necessarily representative of the universe of drug-related police corruption cases. Also, to our knowledge, no systematic studies of the causal link of these factors to drug-related police corruption have been undertaken. Our sources described police recruits, generally, as individuals who had become police officers for the right reasons. They also said that once on the job, however, officers working in precincts with a high level of drug activity may be confronted with opportunities to commit illegal acts or crimes, such taking large sums of money from drug dealers, who are generally reluctant to complain about thefts by police officers. Without support and experience, these temptations are hard for some officers to resist. Moreover, federal officials, academic experts, and the commission reports described how some police officers who engaged in illicit drug-related activities were able, through a “de-sensitizing” or rationalization process, to justify their behavior on the basis of, for example, the notion that they were only harming or disrupting illegal drug dealers. Academic sources and DOJ Criminal Division Public Integrity Section officials suggested that police officers working in certain situations, such as in undercover operations, could be more vulnerable to involvement in illegal drug-related activities. For example, the nature of undercover work generally places an officer in a criminal environment conducive to corruption. In addition, these federal officials opined that corruption was more likely to result from day-to-day contacts between police officers and informants. Academic and other sources also suggested that special drug investigation units with low levels of supervision were also considered to be high-risk environments for drug-related corruption. The commission reports we reviewed and various officials and academic experts we interviewed indicated that certain recruitment policies, such as lower age and education requirements, might be related to incidents of police corruption. An official in the U.S. Attorney’s Office of the Southern District of New York and academic experts indicated that in New York City and Chicago, for example, most of the officers involved in recent drug-related corruption cases would not have been hired under previous higher age and education criteria. Moreover, rapid recruitment initiatives to meet major, time-critical hiring demands appeared to be associated with episodes of drug-related police corruption in some cities. For example, police departments in Miami and Washington, D.C., went through major hiring initiatives during the 1980s, and these departments subsequently experienced corruption problems. Academic sources and some federal officials suggested that, for various reasons, including inadequate screening (e.g., inadequate or incomplete background checks), such rapid recruitment initiatives might have permitted the hiring of recruits who might not otherwise have been hired. Inadequate training, particularly integrity training, in the police academies and especially on the job, was identified as another factor associated with drug-related corruption. According to a member of the Mollen Commission we interviewed, before the establishment of the commission and the implementation of its recommendations, the NYPD’s integrity training consisted of the message “don’t get caught.” Moreover, the Mollen Commission found that the NYPD police academy’s integrity training at that time was based on the types of corruption uncovered by the Knapp Commission, such as gambling and vice rackets. The Mollen Commission concluded that this training not only had little relevance to the temptations confronted by police officers about 20 years later, but the training sent a message of departmental disinterest in integrity matters. Asserting that the real test of the effectiveness of the Chicago Police Department’s training strategies comes when new police officers are assigned to districts and begin to face the challenges inherent in their work, the Chicago Commission found that the department could do a better job in this crucial area. The relationship between police culture and police corruption, including drug-related police corruption, was a recurring theme articulated by our various sources. They generally concurred that although police culture may be positive (i.e., supportive of integrity), a negative culture (i.e., one that supported or generally ignored corruption) was a key factor associated with drug-related police corruption. Among the attitudes and values identified as characteristics of a police culture that supported corruption were the following: (1) a code of silence with grave consequences for those violating it; (2) loyalty to other officers above all else; (3) police cynicism or disillusionment about their jobs, the criminal justice system, and public support for those who performed properly; and (4) indoctrination on the job as to what is acceptable behavior—for example, ignoring corruption. The Mollen Commission concluded that such aspects of a police culture primarily facilitated corruption by (1) setting the standard that nothing was more important than the loyalty of officers to each other (e.g., not stopping even the most serious forms of corruption) and (2) thwarting efforts to control corruption, thereby leading officers to cover up for other officers’ crimes. The literature we reviewed and some academic experts suggested that the relationship between culture and corruption is complex. For example, one expert asserted that police behavior was affected by three levels of culture: (1) the culture of the police profession in general, (2) the culture of a particular police department, and (3) the culture of the city. He also suggested that the code of silence may be a characteristic that is common to the culture of police departments in general, while attitudes toward brutality or stealing illegal drugs may be more a part of a particular police department’s culture. The literature indicates that tolerance of corruption varies among cities and even within a city, over time. In addition, the previous discussion on the lack of integrity training suggests an acculturational process, whereby new officers learn the rationalizations and accepted behaviors from more experienced officers. At the systemic level, the commission reports identified poor or inadequate supervision in police departments from the top down—at headquarters and in the field—as a factor associated with corruption. For example, the Mollen Commission found a widespread breakdown in field supervision in the NYPD. The commission asserted that this breakdown fueled and protected the police corruption they observed, and it primarily blamed NYPD’s management for the poor state of police supervision. The Chicago Commission found the Chicago Police Department lacking in supervisory accountability and emphasized the importance of the supervisory role of sergeant to an effective police organization. Various sources acknowledged the critical role of department management in promoting ethics and integrity and the serious consequences of management’s failure to provide such leadership. Although major police departments historically have distributed rules and guidelines proscribing unethical and potentially corruptive conduct, an article from a recent symposium sponsored by the FBI and Major City Chiefs Administrators concluded that these guidelines may be confusing or misleading, and consequently can contribute to corruption. Moreover, in some departments, operational goals conflict with written policies. For example, a police department may have rules, which are consistently enforced through disciplinary actions, against accepting gratuities from the business community with corresponding sanctions, but the chief and other high-ranking commanders may be the guests of these same business representatives at their country clubs. Also, police organizations have generally claimed the privilege of self-regulation. The Mollen Commission concluded that the failure of NYPD’s corruption controls reflected the inevitable consequence of allowing the police to “police themselves.” Our sources identified problems in a police department’s internal investigative structure and practices as another aspect of inadequate management associated with drug-related police corruption. Corruption control was negatively affected by such factors as the lack of respect for internal affairs units; flaws in investigative techniques; the lack of resources; inadequately skilled internal affairs staff; the lack of autonomy of the internal affairs bureau; and the minimizing or concealing of police corruption incidents (e.g., by putting allegations of police corruption in a special file rather than initiating an investigation). By 1992, according to the Mollen Commission, NYPD’s corruption control system had collapsed, but no one in the department had the incentive to fix what was broken. Also, the Chicago Commission reported hearing evidence of substantial delays in addressing the corruption in one district. At the same time, however, the commission asserted that the Chicago Police Department’s leadership, particularly its Internal Affairs Division, should be given some credit for taking a proactive role in exposing recent police corruption scandals. Our literature review and expert interviews indicated that cities varied in the structures, procedures, and practices employed to identify and investigate corruption. For example, New York used field associates—line officers recruited to report covertly to the internal affairs unit on any misconduct or illicit activities that they observed while at work—but other cities did not. Among other factors that the commission reports and several academic experts we interviewed found could be associated with drug-related police corruption was police brutality. In Chicago, for example, one researcher found that, while not all officers involved in police brutality were also engaged in drug-related police corruption, a number of police officers involved in drug-related corruption also had histories of the use of excessive force. The Mollen Commission reported a similar finding. DOJ public integrity officials suggested that, if there is a violation of the civil rights of a drug dealer, little support for the dealer would come from other police officers; rather, the code of silence would likely be invoked, creating an environment supportive of corruption. Still another factor associated with drug-related police corruption and identified during our review was pressure arising from an officer’s personal neighborhood ties. That is, some sources indicated that neighborhood ties to friends, family members, or even associates, for example in gang-plagued areas, might make it difficult for officers raised in those communities to avoid situations that promote corrupt behavior. Alternatively, however, some sources suggested that neighborhood ties might deter corruption because officers would have a stake in the community. The commission reports and many of the academic and other publications we reviewed and the officials and academic experts we interviewed identified and/or recommended various practices to prevent and detect drug-related police corruption. We did not evaluate and do not necessarily endorse these practices. Although these practices generally are said to address the previously discussed factors that are associated with drug-related police corruption, the practices may also combat other types of corruption. The prevention practices that were identified included (1) making a commitment to integrity from the top to the bottom of the department, (2) changing the police culture, (3) requiring command accountability, (4) raising the age and educational requirements and implementing or improving integrity training in the police academy for recruits, (5) implementing or improving integrity training and accountability measures for career officers, (6) establishing an independent monitor to oversee the police department and its internal affairs unit, and (7) community policing. Among the detection practices recommended and/or implemented were integrity testing, early warning systems to detect potential problem officers, and proactive investigations of individual officers or precincts with a high number of corruption-related complaints. Several factors, such as available resources or the culture of the department, affected the appropriateness or implementation of these practices in particular cities. While some departments were already implementing some of the recommended prevention and/or detection practices, a recommendation usually was based on the perceived merits of the practice, which were grounded in policing experience, rather than a formal evaluation of that practice. In addition, we identified several federal initiatives that were directed toward assisting state and local governments in preventing police corruption. Our various sources identified and/or recommended practices to prevent police corruption in general and drug-related police corruption in particular. Although some practices, such as making a commitment to integrity, were generally recommended, the merits of other practices, such as establishing an independent monitor to oversee the police department and its internal affairs unit, were the subject of some disagreement and debate. Focusing on a positive approach to preventing police corruption, commission reports and a recent NIJ symposium emphasized the importance of police departmental leadership in instilling a commitment to integrity. According to the Mollen Commission, such a commitment cannot be just an abstract value statement but must be reflected in the actions of the Police Commissioner, the department’s top commanders, and the field supervisors who shape the attitudes of the rank and file. The message must be sent throughout the department that corruption will not be tolerated. Similarly, the Chicago Commission asserted that supervisors must constantly reinforce the value statement and code of ethics through example and through a system of rewards for proper behavior. The NIJ symposium underscored the importance of developing a “healthy” police organization to reinforce and maintain the good character and constructive motivations of individuals who join law enforcement. Our various sources generally concluded that instilling a commitment to integrity and developing a healthy police organizational environment required changes in the police culture. Even though police culture was identified as a negative factor associated with drug-related police corruption, a positive police culture, supportive of integrity and commitment, was also identified as a factor that could prevent such behavior. For example, the police culture of the San Diego Police Department, a department reportedly not experiencing drug-related police corruption, was characterized by one source as discouraging an officer from taking anything except his or her paycheck. Among the aspects of a positive police culture that the sources identified were loyalty to the department’s integrity, rather than loyalty to corrupt colleagues; positive peer pressure, supportive of integrity, that helped the department to regulate itself; pride in the organization; and positive incentives for reporting corruption. The commissions, in particular, emphasized command accountability (i.e., requiring a commitment to corruption control throughout the entire department, especially by field commanders) as a key component of a department’s anticorruption strategy. The Mollen Commission concluded that command accountability was the cornerstone of a department’s anticorruption strategy. Similarly, the Chicago Commission affirmed its belief in the principle of supervisor accountability and asserted that supervisors who did not know of or did nothing to stop wrongdoing in their command should be disciplined. Moreover, the commission recommended a meaningful ethics training component and a probationary period for new supervisors. Our sources recommended several recruiting practices to help prevent police corruption. These practices included (1) better candidate screening, for example, completion of background checks; (2) raising the age of recruits; (3) raising educational standards, for example, requiring at least some college education; (4) incorporating integrity training into police academy curricula; (5) reviewing police officers’ integrity as part of probationary period evaluations; and (6) extending the probationary period. Some of these recommendations emphasized selection of those candidates with the maturity to deal with the temptations and pressures presented by modern policing, particularly in neighborhoods with high levels of drug-related activities. Generally, some college or military experience was considered an indicator of maturity because it provided an opportunity for prospective candidates to live away from home and establish a work record. However, the commission reports, studies, and experts often differed regarding the specific age and educational requirements recommended (e.g., 22 or 23 years old and 2 or 4 years of college). Our sources stressed that, since drug-related police corruption and the influences of a negative police culture continue to confront officers during their careers, prevention activities should continue beyond the police academy. The prevention practices that our sources advocated included (1) integrity training as part of the continuing education of officers, (2) the inclusion of integrity assessments in in-service evaluations, and (3) a consideration of integrity assessments when determining promotions. In addition, DOJ public integrity officials suggested rotational assignments, that is, moving officers to different precincts as a means to remove local police officers from the pressures of personal ties in their own communities that provide opportunities for corruption. This is a practice generally followed by some federal law enforcement agencies. To ensure the accountability of police departments to the public, one approach our sources recommended was external oversight of police departments, particularly their internal affairs bureaus, by an independent review board or commission, special prosecutor, or inspector general. The Mollen Commission recommended an independent oversight commission with (1) a small permanent staff; (2) the ability and authority to bring on additional staff, as needed, from law enforcement agencies, such as the FBI and Drug Enforcement Administration; and (3) subpoena power to enable the commission to carry out its own investigations. Subsequently, the Commission to Combat Police Corruption was established by the current New York City Mayor to oversee the NYPD’s implementation of its anticorruption systems and controls. However, according to commission officials and documents, the commission has no independent subpoena power or authority to conduct its own independent investigations. According to various sources, because police departments historically have been self-regulating, some departments may oppose proposals for independent review mechanisms, particularly with independent investigative authority, as recommended by the Mollen Commission. NYPD officials told us they did not oppose the creation of an independent commission, but opposed its having independent investigative authority because it duplicated the authority of local district attorneys and federal agencies. Among the new approaches to local law enforcement being implemented in numerous cities is community policing. We found differences of opinion among our sources regarding the effectiveness of community policing in preventing police corruption. The Chicago Commission reported anecdotal evidence suggesting some connection between building community relations and a reduction in aggressive forms of police corruption. The commission concluded that once the community is exposed to positive reform and gang and drug violence are reduced it is no longer fertile ground for police corruption. Nevertheless, the Mollen Commission, noting the concern of many in law enforcement that the close relationship between officers and citizens required for successful community policing may also increase opportunities for police corruption, concluded that “the value of the program to effective law enforcement and its commensurate benefits to the community far outweigh the risks involved.” Our various sources also identified and/or recommended several practices to detect police corruption in general and drug-related police corruption in particular. As with police corruption prevention practices, we found differences of opinion among our sources regarding the effectiveness of particular practices. A recurring theme among the officials we interviewed was that departments should apply their drug enforcement investigative techniques to investigations of drug-related police corruption. For example, investigators might employ such techniques as (1) placing officers suspected of being involved in illicit drug-related activities under surveillance, (2) getting drug dealers and corrupt officers to testify against other dealers or traffickers or other corrupt officers, or (3) debriefing arrested drug dealers to obtain information on police corruption. New York City officials recommended that police departments engage in proactive investigations of areas showing a high concentration of drug-related corruption complaints against police officers. NYPD officials told us that the department was using pin-mapping to track precincts with high levels of corruption complaints. This technique is typically used to identify high crime areas by putting pins on a map where crimes have occurred. Some departments, such as the NYPD, used and recommended integrity testing to detect drug-related police corruption. According to NYPD officials and documents, the IAB conducted both targeted integrity testing, which is directed at officers suspected of involvement in corrupt activities (about 25 percent of the total tests conducted), and random integrity testing, which is directed at precincts or duty shifts that might be prone to corruption based on statistical data. Generally, NYPD’s targeted integrity testing is more sophisticated and might involve setting up a sting. For example, as part of a sting operation, undercover officers might pose as a married couple involved in the local drug trade. The operation would then be videotaped to determine whether the targeted officer(s) would commit corrupt acts, such as buying drugs from the couple. Academic experts we interviewed indicated that police departments disagreed about the cost-effectiveness of integrity testing, particularly random testing, in terms of the number of prosecutions it is likely to generate. Chicago Commission staff indicated that several commission members were concerned that integrity testing might (1) constitute entrapment, (2) have a deleterious effect on the morale of the department, and (3) involve the inefficient use of resources. NYPD officials, in contrast, told us that integrity testing often helped convince corrupt officers to cooperate with the investigation and identify other corrupt officers. However, a study of New York’s random integrity-testing program, carried out by KPMG Peat Marwick LLP for the New York City Commission to Combat Police Corruption, found that, although random integrity testing was not an effective tool for identifying and weeding out corrupt police or serving as a barometer of corruption in the department, it can be useful for identifying patrol officer training needs. The KPMG study did not attempt to determine whether the program had a deterrent effect or met its objective of creating a sense of IAB’s “omnipresence” (i.e., to have each officer believe that each assignment might be an integrity test). NYPD officials told us that, on the basis of another consultant study, they found that officers believed many more random integrity tests were being conducted than actually were, and that the program was having a deterrent effect. Our sources also indicated that many police departments have some type of early warning system consisting of identified factors, or patterns of behavior, that may indicate a corruption problem. Some systems are less formal in terms of the criteria used to select potentially corrupt officers to be targeted for observation, while other systems have a formal set of criteria for selecting such officers. Moreover, the factors a police department looks at may also vary. Factors relating to an officer that might be monitored include standard of living, indebtedness, type of car driven, and the number of complaints lodged against him or her. Also, how departments address findings may differ. For example, a potentially problem officer may be sent back to the academy for training or to an employee assistance program. The Chicago Commission also highlighted the need for computerized resources to support such systems to allow for the analysis of data indicative of potential misconduct, including corruption. In addition, according to our sources, drug use was a reported concern and drug testing—whether targeted or random—was a practice employed by some police departments to detect drug use, although such use was not necessarily found to be an indicator of drug corruption. However, how departments treated positive test results varied. For example, in Chicago, drug use is treated as a medical problem. In New York City, according to NYPD officials, an officer who (1) fails a drug screening test; (2) is found in possession of illegal drugs; or (3) refuses to take a drug screening test is dismissed. In either case, positive drug test results are typically not treated as a crime. Particularly in larger police departments, special internal affairs units may be responsible for implementing detection practices, such as those identified in this report. Both the Mollen Commission and Chicago Commission reports emphasized the need for police department internal affairs units to have high-quality staff and sufficient resources to carry out investigations. However, the Mollen Commission also emphasized that the NYPD’s IAB had to first establish its credibility if it were to fight corruption effectively. Our sources also identified variations among cities in the prevention or detection practices recommended and implemented. According to academic experts, possible explanations for these differences included the (1) availability of resources; (2) strength of and opposition from police unions; (3) police culture; and (4) form of city government (e.g., mayor-council or city manager). During our review, we also identified federal efforts to assist local law enforcement in preventing and detecting drug-related police corruption. According to FBI Public Corruption Unit officials, in addition to leading or providing assistance to state and local officials on law enforcement corruption investigations, the FBI is working on a proposal with the IACP and National Sheriffs’ Association to proactively address systemic corruption in law enforcement. By using covert investigative techniques, identifying causal factors, and developing and promoting the implementation of internal control models in concert with the law enforcement community, the FBI hopes to assist local law enforcement organizations in preventing and detecting corruption. In addition, the officials told us that the FBI assists local organizations by providing training in corruption prevention and detection techniques. In July 1996, NIJ and the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services sponsored a symposium on police integrity. Attendees at the conference, which provided a forum for the discussion of policing issues such as corruption, included law enforcement executives, researchers, police officers, labor organizations, community and political leadership, and related disciplines. The symposium achieved consensus, and made short- and long-term recommendations, on a number of issues. The recommendations included (1) continued dialogue at a level closer to the practitioners, through additional national or regional meetings at which information could be collected and shared; (2) national workshops inviting representatives from leading police development programs throughout the country (e.g., the FBI National Executive Institute) to discuss infusing integrity and ethics throughout the curriculums for greater effectiveness in police leadership development programs; (3) the development and implementation of a national “teach the teachers” program to create a corps of instructors versed in ethical theory and practice in police services; and (4) assessment of entry-level screening and hiring processes to determine if they are reliable predictors of ethical behavior. Further information on the practices for preventing and detecting police corruption recommended appear in the DOJ publication, Police Integrity: Public Service With Honor. Presently, NIJ is also sponsoring studies on police misconduct and police integrity. Finally, the 1998 National Drug Control Strategy, prepared by ONDCP, discusses additional federal programs that assist state and local law enforcement or deal with public corruption. DOJ’s Edward Byrne Memorial State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance Program provides support to state and local law enforcement organizations in the form of grants that can be used to, among other things, improve the investigation and prosecution of drug-related public corruption crime. Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces, which were established in 1982 and typically consist of members of 11 federal agencies and state and local law enforcement organizations, have public corruption as 1 of their targeted activities. Moreover, through ONDCP’s High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA) Program, federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies undertake cooperative investigations that could involve drug-related activities by police officers. ONDCP officials told us that, while ONDCP presently has no strategic initiatives that directly address drug-related police corruption, they are likely to consider specifically addressing this issue in the future. As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce its contents earlier, we plan no further distribution of this report until 30 days from the date of this letter. At that time, we will send copies of this report to the Chairmen and Ranking Minority Members of the congressional committees with jurisdiction over drug control and criminal justice issues; the Attorney General and heads of Justice’s law enforcement agencies; the Secretary of the Treasury and heads of Treasury’s law enforcement agencies; the Director of ONDCP; and the heads of nongovernmental organizations and associations representing law enforcement interests, such as the IACP, that we contacted during our work. Copies will also be made available to others upon request. The major contributors to this report are listed in appendix IV. If you have any questions about this report, please call me on (202) 512-8777. Congressman Charles B. Rangel requested that we conduct a study on the impact of drug trafficking on the corruption of police in large cities having a high incidence of drug trafficking and abuse. In conducting our preliminary work, we sought to identify commission reports and research studies on drug-related police corruption, as well as relevant databases and other pertinent information. However, we could not identify any central data sources to quantify the extent of drug-related police corruption and the linkage between illegal drugs and corruption. Therefore, we agreed to provide descriptive information on the (1) nature and extent of drug-related police corruption in certain large cities, (2) factors associated with drug-related police corruption, and (3) practices that have been recommended or implemented to prevent or detect drug-related police corruption. To address our three objectives, we conducted an extensive literature search, using automated information services, such as the National Criminal Justice Reference Service and Westlaw, to identify relevant academic publications, symposium reports, and reports issued by city police commissions established to investigate and propose methods for countering police corruption. The number and scope of the reports and studies we identified were limited, and the results they provided may not be entirely reliable, nor generalizable. The studies and reports identified and used in the preparation of this report are listed in the bibliography. We interviewed officials with the Department of Justice’s (DOJ) Bureau of Justice Statistics, Bureau of Justice Assistance, Criminal Division’s Public Integrity Section and Narcotic and Dangerous Drug Section, National Institute of Justice, Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys; the Federal Bureau of Prisons; and the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) Public Corruption Unit. We also contacted the Office of National Drug Control Policy. In addition, we contacted several international, national, and state law enforcement associations to determine whether they could identify any related studies and provide us with additional information sources. These associations included the Fraternal Order of Police, International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP), National Organization for Black Law Enforcement Executives, National District Attorneys Association, National Association of Police Organizations, National Sheriffs’ Association, Police Executive Research Forum, and Police Foundation. We also discussed the issues with a number of academic experts in police research. We conducted our fieldwork in New York City, where we met with officials from the New York City Police Department’s (NYPD) Internal Affairs Bureau (IAB), U.S. Attorneys’ Offices for the Eastern and Southern Districts of New York, the current City of New York Commission to Combat Police Corruption, and officials associated with New York City’s former Commission to Investigate Allegations of Police Corruption and the Anti-Corruption Procedures of the Police Department, commonly referred to as the Mollen Commission. We also interviewed representatives of the current City of Chicago Commission on Police Integrity and contacted the current City of Philadelphia Police Corruption Task Force, which is presently conducting its study. Regarding our first objective, we obtained some descriptive information on the nature of drug-related police corruption from the Mollen Commission and Chicago Commission reports and our interviews with officials from the FBI and the U.S. Attorneys’ Offices in the Eastern and Southern Districts of New York. We also obtained information from academic reports and studies from our literature search and by discussing the issues with academic experts. These sources provided descriptive information about drug-related police corruption. However, since these observations were based on a limited number of publicly disclosed, large-city, drug-related police corruption cases, this information may not accurately portray or be representative of the nature of such corruption in all large-city cases. To determine the extent of drug-related police corruption in large cities and the extent of any link between drug trafficking and police corruption, we attempted during our preliminary work to identify a central repository or collection point for relevant quantitative data. DOJ component agencies, law enforcement organizations, and academic experts could not identify any such central repository. The FBI was able to provide us with limited data on FBI-led drug-related law enforcement corruption cases. We have used these data to show the extent of the FBI’s involvement in drug-related law enforcement corruption investigations. However, they do not reflect the overall extent of drug-related police corruption. Moreover, we did not independently verify the accuracy of the data provided by the FBI. Regarding our second objective, to determine the factors associated with drug-related police corruption, we reviewed the Mollen Commission and Chicago Commission reports. Moreover, we reviewed academic studies identified during our literature search and obtained the views of several academic experts. We also included those factors identified by officials during our interviews with the NYPD’s IAB, the DOJ Criminal Division’s Public Integrity Section and Narcotic and Dangerous Drugs Section, and the U.S. Attorneys’ Offices in New York City. The same factors were often identified independently by several different sources. Regarding our third objective, to determine some of the practices recommended or adopted by city police departments to prevent and/or detect drug-related police corruption, as well as police corruption in general, we reviewed and summarized the findings and recommendations of the Mollen Commission and Chicago Commission reports; observations from academic sources; and information provided by federal law enforcement officials, the NYPD’s IAB, and the New York City Commission to Combat Police Corruption. We also discussed this topic with academic experts. Moreover, we obtained information from the FBI on its proposed joint initiative with the IACP and National Sheriffs’ Association to develop internal control models to prevent and detect police corruption. It is important to emphasize that we derived the information presented in this report from our review of a limited number of existing reports and studies and interviews with federal and local law enforcement officials and academic experts. We did not undertake any primary data collection and analysis. We found only a limited number of studies and reports, which were carried out in a small number of large American cities. The results of these studies may not be entirely reliable or generalizable. We did not attempt to verify the adequacy of the methodologies used to produce the various findings, nor did we attempt to assess the appropriateness of the conclusions or recommendations. Accordingly, our presentation of reported findings and conclusions should not be viewed as our endorsement of them. Moreover, although we recognize that the policies and practices of the police departments discussed in the reports and studies may subsequently have changed, reviewing current policies and practices in particular departments was beyond the scope of this report. Example of publicly disclosed investigations In 1995, six police officers were convicted of or pleaded guilty to federal corruption charges stemming from an FBI undercover sting. Five other officers were suspended but not charged. (1) Seven officers of the Tactical Unit of the 15th District were indicted in December 1996 on federal charges for allegedly using their positions, skills, and experiences as police officers to rob and extort money and narcotics from drug dealers on Chicago’s west side. (2) Stings conducted by the Police Department’s Internal Affairs Division and the FBI led to the arrest in 1997 of three 6th District tactical officers for conspiracy to commit robbery and sales of illegally confiscated narcotics. As a result of an FBI undercover operation, 44 police, sheriff’s department, and corrections officers from 5 law enforcement agencies were charged in January 1998 with taking money to protect cocaine trafficking operations in Cleveland and northern Ohio. Eight of the officers had pled guilty as of April 10, 1998. As a result of an FBI undercover operation, nine officers were charged in 1991 with conspiracy to aid and abet the distribution of cocaine, attempted money laundering, and other charges. As a result of an FBI undercover operation, 27 Sheriff’s deputies and 1 police officer had been convicted by 1994 for skimming millions of dollars of drug money, while members of an elite narcotics unit. The Miami Police Department experienced a series of drug-related cases during the late 1980s, which resulted in the arrest, suspension, or punishment of more than 100 officers. For 6 months in 1994, New Orleans police officers protected a cocaine supply warehouse containing 286 pounds of cocaine. As the result of an FBI undercover investigation, 11 officers, who were paid nearly $100,000 by undercover agents, were convicted. Two more officers are under indictment and are scheduled to stand trial at the end of April 1998. The undercover part of the investigation was terminated when a witness was killed under orders of a New Orleans police officer. (continued) Example of publicly disclosed investigations (1) Six police officers from two Brooklyn precincts were arrested in 1992 by Suffolk County, Long Island, police and charged with narcotics crimes arising from their association with a Suffolk County drug ring. (2) Between 1992 and 1996, federal and city investigations and prosecutions led to the conviction of 30 officers in Manhattan’s 30th precinct for primarily narcotics-related offenses. An additional officer was acquitted, but later found guilty of administrative charges and fired by the New York City Police Department. Since 1995, 10 police officers from Philadelphia’s 39th District have been charged with planting drugs on suspects, shaking down drug dealers for hundreds of thousands of dollars, and breaking into homes to steal drugs and cash. As a result of an FBI undercover operation, 10 officers were convicted in 1994 for protecting drug dealers. Officers took guns and drugs from drug dealers on the street and sold them to undercover agents portraying drug dealers. Washington, D.C. As a result of an FBI undercover operation, 12 officers were arrested and convicted in 1994 for protecting an undercover agent portraying a drug dealer who was transporting hundreds of kilos of cocaine into Washington, D.C.

GAO noted that: (1) drug-related police corruption differs in a variety of ways from other types of police corruption; (2) in addition to protecting criminals or ignoring their activities, officers involved in drug-related corruption were more likely to be actively involved in the commission of a variety of crimes, including stealing drugs and money from drug dealers, selling drugs, and lying under oath about illegal searches; (3) although profit was found to be a motive common to traditional and drug-related police corruption, New York City's Mollen Commission identified power and vigilante justice as two additional motives for drug-related police corruption; (4) the most commonly identified pattern of drug-related police corruption involved small groups of officers who protected and assisted each other in criminal activities, rather than the traditional patterns of non-drug-related police corruption that involved just a few isolated individuals or systemic corruption pervading an entire police department or precinct; (5) federal agencies either do not maintain data specifically on drug-related police corruption or maintain data only on cases in which the respective agency is involved; (6) the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) provided GAO with data on FBI-led drug-related corruption cases involving state and local law enforcement officers; (7) however, since the total number of drug-related police corruption cases at all levels of government is unknown, the proportion constituted by FBI cases also is unknown; (8) one commonly identified factor associated with drug-related corruption was a police culture that was characterized by a code of silence, unquestioned loyalty to other officers, and cynicism about the criminal justice system; (9) officers lacking in experience and some higher education were considered to be more susceptible to involvement in illicit drug-related activities; (10) GAO's sources also identified practices that they believed could prevent or detect drug-related police corruption; (11) these practices, although often directed toward combatting police corruption in general, also were viewed as effective steps toward specifically addressing drug-related police corruption; (12) the detection practices GAO's sources discussed included integrity testing, early warning systems to identify potential problem officers, and proactive investigations of individual officers or precincts with a high number of corruption complaints; and (13) lastly, GAO identified several federal initiatives that were directed toward assisting state and local governments in preventing and detecting police corruption."}

Critical infrastructure includes, among other things, banking and financial institutions, telecommunications networks, and energy production and transmission facilities, most of which are owned by the private sector. As these critical infrastructures have become increasingly dependent on computer systems and networks, the interconnectivity among information systems, the Internet, and other infrastructures creates opportunities for attackers to disrupt critical systems, with potentially harmful effects. To better manage cyber-based risks that the nation’s cyber-reliant critical infrastructure faces, public and private organizations use available cybersecurity standards and guidance that promote the security of their critical systems. Threats to systems supporting critical infrastructure are evolving and growing. In February 2011, the Director of National Intelligence testified that, in the past year, there had been a dramatic increase in malicious cyber activity targeting U.S. computers and networks, including a more than tripling of the volume of malicious software since 2009. Cyber threats can be unintentional or intentional. Unintentional threats can be caused by software upgrades or maintenance procedures that inadvertently disrupt systems. Intentional threats include both targeted and untargeted attacks from a variety of sources, including criminal groups, hackers, disgruntled employees, foreign nations engaged in espionage and information warfare, and terrorists. GAO, Information Security: TVA Needs to Address Weaknesses in Control Systems and Networks, GAO-08-526 (Washington, D.C.: May 21, 2008). continue to move to networked operations, the threat will continue to grow. Table 1 provides descriptions of common types of cyber exploits. Reports of cyber attacks illustrate that such attacks could have a debilitating impact on national and economic security and on public health and safety. In June 2011, a major bank reported that hackers had broken into its systems and gained access to the personal information of hundreds of thousands of customers. Through the bank’s online banking system, the attackers were able to view certain private customer information. In February 2011, media reports stated that computer hackers had broken into and stolen proprietary information worth millions of dollars from the networks of six U.S. and European energy companies. In July 2010, a sophisticated computer attack, known as Stuxnet, was discovered. It targeted control systems used to operate industrial processes in the energy, nuclear, and other critical sectors. It is designed to exploit a combination of vulnerabilities to gain access to its target and modify code to change the process. Federal law and policy have established roles and responsibilities for federal agencies working with the private sector and other entities in enhancing the cyber and physical security of critical public and private infrastructures. These include the Homeland Security Act of 2002, Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7 (HSPD-7), and the National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP). In addition, regulatory entities oversee entities within critical infrastructure sectors and develop and publish various types of cybersecurity guidance to assist their examiners and organizations. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 created the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Among other things, it assigned the department the following critical infrastructure protection responsibilities: (1) developing a comprehensive national plan for securing the key resources and critical infrastructures of the United States; (2) assisting in the development and promotion of private sector best practices to secure critical infrastructure; and (3) disseminating, as appropriate, information to assist in the deterrence, prevention, and preemption of, or response to, terrorist attacks. HSPD-7 established DHS as the principal federal agency to lead, integrate, and coordinate the implementation of efforts to protect cyber- critical infrastructures and key resources. In addition, HSPD-7 identified lead federal agencies, referred to as sector-specific agencies, which are responsible for coordinating critical infrastructure protection efforts with the public and private stakeholders in their respective sectors. For example, the Department of the Treasury and the Department of Health and Human Services are the sector-specific agencies for the banking and finance and the health care and public health sectors, respectively. The NIPP states that, in accordance with HSPD-7, DHS is a principal focal point for the security of cyberspace and is responsible for coordinating efforts to protect the cyber infrastructure to ensure its confidentiality, integrity, and availability. These responsibilities, among other things, include providing guidance on effective cyber-protective measures, assisting the sector-specific agencies in understanding and mitigating cyber risk, and assisting in developing effective and appropriate protective measures. To accomplish these responsibilities, DHS is to help in the development of comprehensive cybersecurity guidance that homeland security partners may adopt to meet accepted industry-based standards that measurably reduce the risk of cyber disruption or exploitation. The NIPP also describes a partnership model as the primary means of coordinating government and private sector efforts to protect critical infrastructure. For each sector, the model requires formation of government coordinating councils—composed of federal, state, local, or tribal agencies with purview over critical sectors—and encourages voluntary formation of SCCs—composed of owner-operators of these critical assets (some of which may be state or local agencies) or their respective trade associations. These councils create the structure through which representative groups from all levels of government and the private sector are to collaborate in planning and implementing efforts to protect critical infrastructure. The sector councils are envisioned to be policy- related and to represent a primary point of contact for government to plan the entire range of infrastructure protection activities, including those associated with mitigating cyber threats. According to the NIPP, sector-specific agencies are to work with their private sector counterparts to understand and mitigate cyber risk by, among other things, determining whether approaches for critical infrastructure inventory, risk assessment, and protective measures address assets, systems, and networks; require enhancement; or require the use of alternative approaches. They are also to review and modify existing and future sector efforts to ensure that cyber concerns are fully integrated into sector security activities and protective activities. Table 2 shows the 18 critical infrastructure sectors and the sector-specific agencies assigned to each sector. Further, the NIPP called for the sector-specific agencies, in close collaboration with the sector coordinating councils, government coordinating councils, and others, including state, local, and tribal critical infrastructure key resources partners, to develop sector-specific plans and sector annual reports to address how the sectors would implement the national plan, including how the security of cyber and other (physical) assets and functions was to be improved. More specifically, according to the NIPP, sector plans were to, among other things, describe how the sector will identify and prioritize its critical cyber and other assets and define approaches to be taken to assess risks and develop programs to protect these assets, and sector annual reports were to provide status and progress on each sector’s efforts to carry out the sector plans. In September 2009, we reported that sector-specific agencies had made limited progress in updating their sector-specific plans to fully address key cyber elements. As a result, we recommended that the Secretary of Homeland Security, consistent with any direction from the Office of the Cybersecurity Coordinator, (1) assess whether the existing sector- specific planning process should continue to be the nation’s approach to securing cyber and other critical infrastructure and, in doing so, consider whether proposed and other options would provide more effective results and (2) if the existing approach is deemed to be the national approach, work with the sector-specific agencies to develop their plans to fully address DHS cybersecurity criteria. In response to our recommendations, DHS took steps to make sector-specific planning a priority. For example, in 2009 and 2010, DHS met and worked with the sector-specific agencies and sector representatives to update sector plans with the goal of fully addressing cyber-related criteria. As of October 2011, of the 18 plans, DHS reported that 17 have been finalized and approved and 1 is still in the process of being reviewed. In addition, DHS’s Quadrennial Homeland Security Review Report identified key strategic outcomes for the department’s safeguarding and securing cyberspace mission, including, among others, that the (1) homeland security partners develop, update, and implement guidelines, regulations, and standards that ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and reliability of systems, networks, and data, and (2) critical infrastructure sectors adopt and sector partners meet accepted standards that measurably reduce the risk of cyber disruption or exploitation. In addition to public-private partnership-related efforts, regulatory entities oversee entities within critical infrastructure sectors that are under the purview of federal law, regulation, or mandatory standards pertaining to securing privately owned information systems or data. For example, depository financial institutions (such as commercial banks and credit unions) in the banking and finance sector are regulated by members of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC). The mechanisms used to perform oversight include continuous examinations, periodic examinations, self-reporting, and compliance reviews, and various types of mechanisms exist to enforce compliance. Federal regulators also develop and publish various types of cybersecurity guidance to assist (1) the examiners and inspectors in carrying out their responsibilities and (2) the regulated entities in fulfilling requirements, addressing specific threats, or mitigating identified risks. For example, FFIEC has issued handbooks that are intended to provide guidance to examiners and organizations. Cybersecurity guidance provides general guidelines and principles as well as technical security techniques for maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information systems and data. When implementing cybersecurity technologies and processes, organizations can avoid making common implementation mistakes by consulting guidance developed by various other organizations. Public and private organizations may decide to voluntarily adopt this guidance to help them manage cyber-based risks. Some entities may also be required to meet regulations or mandatory requirements that address cybersecurity. Many organizations exist that develop standards and guidance that, among other things, promote the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of computer systems and information. Examples of such organizations include the following: International Organization for Standardization (ISO): a nongovernmental organization that develops and publishes international standards. The standards, among other things, address information security by establishing guidelines and general principles for initiating, implementing, maintaining, and improving information security management in an organization. International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC): an organization for standardization comprising all national eletrotechnical committees. The commission publishes international standards, technical specifications, technical reports, and publicly available specifications and guides. The information security standards address safety, security, and reliability in the design and operations of systems in the power industry, among other things. The International Telecommunication Union: a United Nations agency whose mission includes, among other things, developing technical standards and providing technical assistance and capacity building to developing countries. The union has also developed technical standards for security and, more recently, engaged in other cybersecurity activities. For example, the union has established a study group for telecommunications security to focus on developing standards and recommendations associated with network and information security, application security, and identity management. Similarly, the union, through its members’ efforts, prepared a report on cybersecurity best practices for countries seeking to organize national cybersecurity efforts. The International Society of Automation (ISA): a global and nonprofit organization that develops standards for automation. It has developed a series of standards to address security in industrial automation and control systems. The American National Standards Institute (ANSI): a U.S. organization that is responsible for coordinating and promoting voluntary consensus-based standards and information sharing to minimize overlap and duplication of U.S. standards-related efforts. In addition, it is the representative of U.S. interests in international standards-developing organizations. Individual industries and sectors also have their own specific standards. These include standards or guidance developed by regulatory agencies that assist entities within sectors in complying with cybersecurity-related laws and regulations. In addition, organizations that operate in a specific industry develop cybersecurity standards and guidance and promote practices for their industries. In the United States, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), a standards-setting agency under the U.S. Department of Commerce, issues Federal Information Processing Standards that, pursuant to the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA), are mandatory for federal agencies and special publications that provide guidance for information systems security for non-national security systems. For example, NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-39, Managing Information Security Risk: Organization, Mission, and Information System View, provides guidance for an integrated, organizationwide program for managing information security risk to organizational operations, organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, and the nation resulting from the operation and use of NIST also developed a risk management federal information systems.framework that is one of several NIST guidelines for federal agencies to follow in developing information security programs. The framework is specified in NIST SP 800-37, Revision 1, Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems: A Security Life Cycle Approach, which provides agencies with guidance for applying the risk management framework to federal information systems.framework consists of a six-step process involving (1) security categorization, (2) security control selection, (3) security control implementation, (4) security control assessment, (5) information system authorization, and (6) security control monitoring. It also provides a process that integrates information security and risk management activities into the system development life cycle. NIST SP 800-53, Revision 3, Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations, provides a catalog of security controls and technical guidelines that federal agencies use to protect federal information and information systems. such as those in the nation’s critical infrastructure sectors, are encouraged but not required to use this NIST guidance where appropriate. Table 3 lists SP 800-53’s 18 control families and the 198 recommended controls. DHS’s National Cyber Security Division’s Control Systems Security Program has also issued recommended practices to reduce risks to industrial control systems within and across all critical infrastructure and key resources sectors. For example, in April 2011, the program issued the Catalog of Control Systems Security: Recommendations for Standards Developers, which is intended to provide a detailed listing of recommended controls from several standards related to control systems. A wide variety of cybersecurity guidance from national and international organizations is available to critical infrastructure sector entities. Much of this guidance is tailored to the unique characteristics of each sector. Further, entities within regulated subsectors have specific cybersecurity guidance that is required or recommended to be used, while entities operating outside of a regulatory environment have standards and guidance available, but not required, for their use. Furthermore, industry regulators, associations, and other groups have also developed and issued voluntary guidance available for use by entities within their respective sectors that is tailored to the business needs of entities or provides methods to address unique risks or operations. While SCC representatives confirmed lists of cybersecurity guidance that they stated was used within their respective sectors, the representatives emphasized that the lists were not comprehensive and that additional standards and guidance are likely used within the sectors. In addition, SCC representatives stated that they were not always aware of the extent to which the identified guidance was used by entities within their sectors. The following discussion describes cybersecurity guidance identified for each of the sectors in our review. A list of specific guidance for each sector is provided in appendix II. Banking and finance sector: The guidance documents for the banking and finance sector are diverse. For example, federal regulatory entities within the various sector segments issue specific risk-based cybersecurity requirements. In addition, financial institutions and the payment card industry have developed voluntary standards and practices. FFIEC has issued handbooks that outline cybersecurity requirements for depository institutions within the sector. In addition, federal financial regulators have issued regulations that cover a comprehensive set of high-level requirements, including security programs, risk management, data security, incident response and anti-identity-theft. These regulations are in response to laws such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the Fair Credit Reporting Act. The banking and finance sector-specific plan identified applicable laws, regulations, and a multitude of sector-specific guidance, especially for depository and financial institutions, that covered many cybersecurity topics such as access control authentication and phishing. Each of the FFIEC agencies often issues guidance that is similar in content but tailored to meet its legal requirements. The agencies deliver this guidance through their respective transmittal documents, such as bulletins, financial institution letters, letters to credit unions, and supervisory letters. In addition, according to an SCC representative familiar with cybersecurity guidance associated with the sector, the revision associated with the latest sector-specific plan will have more guidance on the investments and securities subsector. Communications sector: The guidance documents for the communications sector cover a variety of topics such as telecommunication industry security standards, network engineering standards, and security configuration guides. The SCC representatives familiar with cybersecurity guidance associated with the sector stated that the identified guidance is all widely used within the sector. In addition, the representatives acknowledged that a number of the documents are overlapping and cover similar areas, and that on the basis of its particular needs an entity may select among several. Further, decisions on whether or not to implement a specific practice within guidance depend on the role of the responsible implementer (e.g., service provider, network operator, or equipment supplier) and an understanding of the impact on factors such as the systems, networks, and organizations. According to SCC representatives responsible for cybersecurity efforts, cybersecurity standards and practices promoted and used by SCC members include those developed by the Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions, Internet Engineering Task Force, and the International Telecommunication Union. For example, the Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions issued a U.S. Standard for Signaling Security–Security Roadmap. In addition, the Communications Security, Reliability, and Interoperability Council recently published a key guidance document to update and combine a large body of sector cybersecurity practices from a variety of sources. The guidance addresses the following areas: identity management, encryption, vulnerability management, and incident response for wireless, Internet protocol services, network, people, and legacy services. The document includes 397 cybersecurity practices intended to ensure the security of networks and systems for all segments of the communications industry. According to the document, the practices are not overly prescriptive, allowing network service providers, operators, and equipment suppliers enough latitude to make deployment decisions that best suit their business practices, which revolve around technology, capability, and customer requirements. Energy sector: The energy sector is divided between the electricity and oil and natural gas subsectors. Within the electricity subsector, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) certified the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) as the Electric Reliability Organization that is responsible for developing reliability standards, subject to FERC oversight, review, and approval. If approved, the standards become mandatory and enforceable in the contiguous 48 states. NERC developed eight cybersecurity standards, which FERC approved in 2008, that address the following topics: critical cyber asset identification, security management controls, personnel and training, electronic security perimeter(s), physical security of critical cyber assets, systems security management, incident reporting and response planning, and recovery plans for critical cyber assets. NERC also publishes security guidelines for companies to consider for protecting electric infrastructure systems, although such guidelines are voluntary and are typically not checked for compliance. For example, NERC’s June 2010 Security Guideline for the Electricity Sector: Identifying Critical Cyber Assets is intended to assist entities in identifying and developing a list of critical cyber assets as described in the mandatory standards. Cybersecurity guidance for the oil and natural gas subsector has been issued by various related organizations, as has applicable guidance from closely related sectors, such as transportation and chemical. Among others, sector-specific guidance was identified from the American Petroleum Institute, American Gas Association, and the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America. For example, the American Petroleum Institute’s Security Guidelines for the Petroleum Industry address cyber/information technology in the petroleum industry and endorse the ISO/IEC international standard 17799 for creating a cybersecurity program as voluntary guidance.covered various topics, including cryptography, third-party connections, and control systems. Health care and public health sector: Cybersecurity guidance for the health care and public health sector covers a variety of topics specific to the security of health information. For example, ISO and ASTM International have issued health sector cybersecurity guidance. issued guidance for security management in health, and ASTM International issued guidance on user authentication and authorization. Also, according to a sector coordinating council representative, Electronic Data Interchanges are critical to data exchange within the sector and have cybersecurity implications.and public health sector annual report, the sector is engaged in an international effort to develop standardized security guidelines for health information technology that will facilitate the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of health information systems and the data residing on those systems. ASTM International was previously known as the American Society of Testing and Materials. implementing an information security program. In addition, a Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office for Civil Rights official familiar with health information privacy issues said that the department developed guidance on how to develop a risk-based approach for protecting electronic health information and is working with NIST to develop a self-assessment tool that entities in the health sector can use to assess their security posture. Information technology sector: Cybersecurity guidance for the information technology sector covers a number of topics, including security management system requirements, operational security, and identity management. Also, the information technology sector’s 2010 sector annual report and information provided by DHS’s National Protection and Programs Directorate reference the following organizations as providing cybersecurity guidance relevant to the sector: the Internet Engineering Task Force, an international organization that develops Internet standards and protocols; ISO/IEC, which provides standards and practices for managing information security systems; the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, which establishes standards and practices for managing information security systems;and NIST, which issues special publications and interagency reports. According to the chairperson of the IT SCC, the IT sector is very complex and there is no “short list” of cyber standards. From the industry’s perspective, there is an “ecosystem of cybersecurity standards” that includes many different components, comprising hundreds, or even thousands, of individual standards related to technologies, practices, and products and that perform a variety of functions such as enabling interoperability and assurance of security policies and controls. Further, the standards ecosystem constantly evolves in response to new technologies, cyber threats and risks, and business models. The SCC chairperson confirmed the identified cybersecurity guidance, as shown in appendix II, as an illustrative list containing examples of cybersecurity guidance available to sector entities. Nuclear reactors, materials, and waste sector: The cybersecurity- specific guidance for this sector includes documents issued by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and Nuclear Energy Institute. SCC representatives stated that the NRC and Nuclear Energy Institute guidance documents were widely used for nuclear power plants within the sector. NRC, under its regulatory authority, requires, among other things, that licensees provide high assurance that digital computer and communication systems and networks are adequately protected against cyber attacks. Both NRC and the institute have issued guidance containing methods that entities may use to meet the regulatory requirements. This guidance includes NRC’s Regulatory Guide 5.71 for cybersecurity programs at nuclear facilities, the most recent version of which was issued in January 2010, and the institute’s cybersecurity plan for nuclear power reactors, the most recent version of which was issued in April 2010. NRC officials and institute representatives familiar with both guides stated that they contain similar cybersecurity controls. However, these guides are not substitutes for compliance with regulations, and compliance with the guides is not mandatory. According to NRC representatives responsible for NRC’s cybersecurity-related efforts, the guides provide an approach that the NRC staff deems acceptable for complying with the commission’s regulations regarding the protection of digital computers, communications systems, and networks from a cyber attack. Although licensees may use methods other than those described within this guidance to meet the commission’s regulations, the NRC representatives said that all licensees have used one of these two methods. In addition, the NRC representatives said that they are developing a new guide to facilitate inspections of cybersecurity programs. NRC’s cybersecurity regulations are currently only applicable to power- generating facilities. The NRC representative familiar with cybersecurity guidance said that, in general, NRC’s rule-making process is based on the risk to the public and has included the issuance of regulations for the power generation facilities first, which are then typically promulgated to and then to other nuclear facilities (such as research fuel cycle facilities,reactors), as needed. Also, NRC issued a series of orders recommending greater cybersecurity after September 11, 2001. According to the 2010 sector annual report, the Nuclear Sector Cyber Subcouncil is working on a road map to secure control systems in the nuclear sector. The annual report states that the road map will build on existing government and industry efforts to enhance the security of control systems in the power and nonpower reactor segments of the sector, taking into account NRC’s cybersecurity requirements. According to a DHS official, the scope of the road map was limited to commercial nuclear power plants. Water sector: Cybersecurity guidance for the water sector covers a number of topics, including risk analysis and management and industrial control systems. However, information compiled from the SCC membership and provided by the Secretariat of the Water SCC showed that several documents cited as relevant to cybersecurity were not widely used by entities within the sector for various reasons, including the lack of resources and funding to implement a cybersecurity program. The representatives further stated that while the larger utilities have the staffing levels and budgets that enable them to more fully implement cybersecurity for their control systems, many medium-size or small utilities struggle to maintain the staff needed just to keep their systems properly running. Furthermore, Water SCC representatives familiar with cybersecurity guidance associated with the sector said that while they have not specified any specific cybersecurity guidance that water utilities are to use, some utilities are using and implementing cybersecurity guidance that has been used in other sectors. Also, the Cybersecurity Working Group of the Water SCC prepared with DHS a road map to define gaps and a strategy for addressing outstanding needs in securing process control systems. It states that planned cybersecurity activities include (1) isolating control systems from public switched networks and (2) adopting recommended practices for control systems in the water sector. Cross-sector guidance: In addition to sector-specific guidance, cybersecurity guidance from national and international organizations can be and is utilized by sector entities and was frequently mentioned as important in developing sector-specific guidance. These include NIST’s risk management framework and security controls for information systems and industrial control systems; DHS’s recommended security controls for control systems; ISO guidance on establishing an information system security control program, including security control guidance; and the International Society of Automation’s security guidance for industrial control systems. Implementation of cybersecurity guidance can occur through a variety of mechanisms, including enforcement of regulations and voluntarily in response to business incentives; however, responsible federal entities could take additional steps to promote the most applicable and effective guidance throughout the sectors. Entities operating under a federal regulatory environment are required to adhere to cybersecurity standards to meet their regulatory requirements or face enforcement mechanisms. Entities not subject to regulation do not face such enforcement mechanisms, but may voluntarily implement cybersecurity guidance in response to business incentives, such as mitigating risk, ensuring interoperability among systems, or protecting intellectual property. With respect to promoting cybersecurity guidance, sector-specific agencies, and, in particular, DHS, have specific roles to play in coordinating cybersecurity efforts, which include the promotion and dissemination of guidance and practices. While DHS and other agencies have taken a number of steps in this area, more could be done to identify guidance and standards applicable to entities within the sectors and to promote their implementation. Critical infrastructure entities covered under regulation, such as depository institutions in the banking and finance sector; the bulk power system in the electricity subsector of the energy sector; health care and public health sector; and the nuclear reactors, materials, and waste sector, are regulated by the federal government and thus are required to meet mandatory cybersecurity standards established by regulation under federal law. When an entity is determined to be not compliant with these requirements, various types of enforcement mechanisms can be employed. These mechanisms include administrative actions such as a supervisory directive or memorandum of understanding. More severe enforcement actions include cease and desist orders, remedial directives, revocations of license or certification, and civil monetary penalties. Depository Institutions (Banking and Finance Sector) Cybersecurity oversight functions are conducted by FFIEC member agencies through examinations. Subcommittee Chairperson, for most larger financial institutions, examiners have a continuous, on-site presence and are constantly evaluating their assigned financial institutions’ programs, in particular in regard to cybersecurity, which is considered high risk, to ensure that the institutions operate safely and soundly. For smaller financial institutions, examinations for cybersecurity risks occur every 12 to 18 months or after the issuance of significant regulatory guidance. For example, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation can initiate enforcement actions and orders against state nonmember banks, and insured foreign banks. The National Credit Union Administration can initiate enforcement actions and orders against federally insured credit unions and credit union–affiliated parties. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency can initiate enforcement actions and orders against national banks and federal savings associations, federally chartered branches, and agencies of foreign banks. The Federal Reserve System can initiate enforcement actions and orders against state member banks; financial, bank, and thrift holding companies; and U.S. operations of foreign banking organizations. weaknesses identified by the examiners. Informal enforcement actions can consist of the following: a memorandum of understanding or document of resolution, a supervisory directive, a notice of deficiency and request for a safety and soundness individual minimum capital requirement directives. Formal actions are authorized by statute and mandated in some cases, are generally more severe, and are disclosed to the public. Depending on whether the institution is a credit union or a bank, formal enforcement actions for any violations of laws and regulations, including various cybersecurity provisions, can take the following forms: cease and desist orders, termination of insurance, and liquidation. For example, an agency can assess civil monetary penalties of $7,500 per day for any violation of law or regulation, or assess a fine up to $37,000 per day for a violation that is, for instance, likely to cause more than a minimal loss to the financial institution, or assess a penalty of up to $1,375,000 million per day for knowingly engaging, for instance, in any unsafe or unsound practice when the offender knowingly or recklessly caused a substantial loss to the financial institution or received a substantial pecuniary gain or other benefit. However, according to the FFIEC IT Subcommittee Chairperson, while depository institutions have been cited for operating in an unsafe and unsound manner as it relates to cybersecurity, none of these cases have reached the level of formal actions with civil monetary penalties. Bulk Power System (Electricity Subsector of the Energy Sector) NERC, as the Electric Reliability Organization, has the authority to enforce compliance with mandatory cybersecurity standards through its Compliance Monitoring and Enforcement Program, subject to FERC review. While FERC has authorized NERC to enforce mandatory reliability standards in the United States, the commission retains its own authority to enforce the same standards and assess penalties for violations. The commission also has the ability to review each penalty NERC proposes for noncompliance with a reliability standard in the United States, either by its own action or upon an appeal by a penalized entity. Monitoring functions are carried out by NERC inspectors through a number of actions: Performing compliance audits for bulk power system owners, operators, and users on a schedule established by NERC. Periodically conducting a self-certification to attest to compliance or noncompliance with reliability standards. Initiating spot checks or performing compliance violation investigations in response to an event or complaint. Encouraging self-reporting versus formal NERC reporting when a user, owner, or operator of the bulk power system becomes aware of a violation of a reliability standard or of a change in the violation severity level of a previously reported violation. Requiring periodic data submissions. Under this circumstance, a team of industry experts is established to review the data and provide a report to NERC. Requiring technical feasibility exception reporting for the reliability standards that allow such exceptions. Those reliability standards require reporting of exceptions to compliance with the reliability standard and approval by NERC of the exceptions as a form of compliance monitoring. Reviewing complaints received alleging violations of a reliability standard to determine if a compliance violation investigation is required. Enforcement mechanisms include monetary penalties, nonmonetary sanctions, and remedial actions, according to NERC sanction guidelines. NERC can levy monetary penalties for the violation of requirements of the reliability standards. For example, NERC or regional entities, upon delegation of NERC’s authority, can impose a monetary penalty or fine of up to $1 million per day per violation, depending on the risk factors and level of violation severity involved. NERC must file all penalties it or a regional entity proposes to impose with FERC. If FERC takes no action after 31 days, the penalties go into effect, or FERC can either reject or take up the proposed penalty for further action. Entities can appeal the penalties with FERC. For the month of July 2011, a Notice of Penalty was issued for violations of NERC Cyber Security Standards, one of which included a high violation risk factor that had a monetary penalty of $75,000 imposed, according to NERC’s publicly available enforcement information on penalties. In addition, there were 65 cybersecurity violations with a medium violation risk factor reported that had total monetary penalties of approximately $496,000 imposed and 24 cybersecurity violations with a low violation risk factor that had total monetary penalties of approximately $375,000 imposed. NERC, the regional entities, and FERC can also levy nonmonetary sanctions against a violator that include limitations or restrictions that may result in economic or other impacts. In addition to monetary and nonmonetary sanctions, NERC, the regional entities, and FERC can direct bulk power system entities to take remedial action to correct conditions, practices, or any other relevant action or activity underlying the noncompliance involved, including cybersecurity-related issues. For example, remedial actions may include the following: specifying operating or planning criteria, limits, or limitations; requiring specific system studies; defining operating practices or guidelines; requiring confirmation of data, practices, or procedures through inspection testing or other methods; requiring specific training for personnel; and requiring development of specific operating plans. HHS’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) is responsible under HIPAA for oversight and enforcement of the protection of electronic protected health information held by covered entities within the health care and public health sector. Cybersecurity requirements are also applicable to this sector’s reimbursement and supply chain functions. Oversight of HIPAA’s Security Rule is carried out through compliance reviews and complaints that can be received through one of HHS’s 10 regional offices. According to an OCR official familiar with health information privacy issues, HHS has undertaken oversight of Security Rule compliance. For example, during calendar year 2010, HHS reported opening 243 complaints and compliance reviews involving Security Rule issues, which represents a 95 percent increase in the number of Security Rule cases opened over the average caseload of the previous 4 years. In addition, OCR reported resolving a total of 128 complaints, which is an increase of 16 percent over the average number of resolved complaints in the previous 4 years. More importantly, 55 percent of the resolved complaints required the regulated entity to take corrective action to achieve compliance with the Security Rule, whereas on average only 18 percent of the resolved complaints in prior years required such action. Additionally, HIPAA-covered entities and their business associates are to provide notification following a breach of unsecured protected health information. Clinical Health Act’s Breach Notification Interim Final Rule, OCR processes and initiates investigations of reports involving 500 or more individuals. According to the OCR health information privacy official, since the inception of the breach notification requirement, over 70 percent of the 280 major breaches reported (as of May 30, 2011) involved electronic protected health information, and thus required investigation for Security Rule compliance. Of these cases, the official stated that 6 percent of breach reports involving more than 500 individuals have been due to hacking or cybersecurity incidents, compared with 67 percent of these breaches being due to the physical loss or theft of protected health information. Under the Health Information Technology for Economic and Enforcement mechanisms include the imposition of civil money penalties for violations. HHS can levy fines or penalties for failure to comply with the cybersecurity standards or specifications of the Security Rule, Privacy Rule, and Breach Notification Interim Final Rule. Breach notification was implemented under the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act. When considering civil monetary penalties, there are four categories of violations that reflect increasing levels of culpability. The categories and minimum penalties are as follows: For each violation, the maximum penalty amount in every category is $50,000. For multiple violations in a calendar year, the maximum penalty amount in each category is $1.5 million. HHS determines the penalty amounts based on the nature and extent of the violation, resulting harm, and other factors. The OCR health information privacy official also indicated that the office has executed resolution agreements and corrective action plans in several cases where investigation has found systemic failures to comply with the Security Rule for protecting electronic health information. For example, the official stated that OCR executed a resolution agreement with a major university in the amount of $865,000, which also included a 3-year corrective action plan to implement stronger safeguards for electronic protected health information as well as comprehensive employee training on the appropriate use of patient information. In another case, OCR executed a resolution agreement with a major hospital in the amount of $1 million that included a 3-year corrective action plan to address stronger safeguards for the removal of protected health information from the hospital by employees for work-related purposes, including the removal of electronic protected health information. Nuclear Reactors (Nuclear Reactors, Materials, and Waste Sector) NRC is responsible for both physical security and cybersecurity oversight. To enhance its current cybersecurity program, NRC has issued a cybersecurity-focused regulation and a cybersecurity regulatory guide. Current cybersecurity oversight functions are carried out through inspections of licensed facilities to ensure that they are in compliance with NRC regulations and the terms of their licenses. Although NRC has not imposed a civil penalty for cybersecurity violations at its facilities under its current enforcement policy, failure to comply with NRC’s regulations may result in the imposition of enforcement sanctions such as notices of violation, civil penalties, and the issuance of orders. Prior to implementing its new cybersecurity program, NRC must review and approve the cybersecurity plans for all operational nuclear power plants. Once a cybersecurity plan is approved for a particular nuclear power plant, implementing the program defined within that plan becomes both a condition of that plant’s operating license and an inspection requirement. In addition to approving cybersecurity plans, NRC is also developing a cybersecurity inspection program that is scheduled for implementation during 2012 and is in the early stages of revising its cybersecurity enforcement policy to account for the new cybersecurity inspection program. The cybersecurity inspection program will be implemented in three stages. In the first stage, NRC intends to develop its initial inspection guidance. In the second stage, NRC intends to commence specialized inspector cybersecurity training and education in preparation for on-site cybersecurity inspections at licensed facilities. In the final stage, NRC will leverage the results of and the insights gained from its initial inspections to develop program guidance and procedures for future periodic inspections. Finally, NRC is in the early stages of revising its cybersecurity enforcement policy to account for the new cybersecurity inspection program. According to officials familiar with cybersecurity issues in their respective SCCs, the information technology, communications, and water critical infrastructure sectors and oil and natural gas subsector of the energy sector are not subject to direct federal cybersecurity-related regulation. Although the use of cybersecurity guidance is not mandatory, entities may voluntarily implement such guidance in response to business incentives, including to mitigate risks, protect intellectual property, ensure interoperability among systems, and encourage the use of leading practices. For example, officials familiar with cybersecurity issues from both the communications sector and information technology sector stated that the competitive market place, desire to maintain profits, and customer expectation of information security—rather than federal regulation—drive the adoption of best practices. Oil and gas SCC officials said that their member companies are not required to follow industry guidelines, but legal repercussions regarding standard of care may motivate the incorporation of such cybersecurity standards into their operations. As recognized in federal policy, the dissemination and promotion of cybersecurity standards and guidance is a goal in enhancing the security of our nation’s cyber-reliant critical infrastructure. The NIPP states that, in accordance with HSPD-7, DHS is a principal focal point for the security of cyberspace and is responsible for coordinating efforts to protect the cyber infrastructure to ensure its confidentiality, integrity, and availability. These responsibilities, among other things, include providing guidance on effective cyber-protective measures, assisting the sector-specific agencies in understanding and mitigating cyber risk, and assisting in developing effective and appropriate protective measures. To accomplish these responsibilities, DHS is to help in the development of comprehensive cybersecurity guidance that homeland security partners may adopt to meet accepted industry-based standards that measurably reduce the risk of cyber disruption or exploitation. In this regard, DHS and the other sector-specific agencies for the sectors selected for review have disseminated and promoted cybersecurity guidance among and within sectors. For example, officials from DHS’s National Cybersecurity Division (NCSD) stated that they work within the public-private partnership model to identify and prioritize cybersecurity risks within sectors, then coordinate with the sectors to encourage entities to adopt cybersecurity guidance to mitigate identified vulnerabilities. NCSD also engages with standards-developing organizations to provide input, resources, and support. For example, NCSD has provided resources, including time and expertise, supporting the development of security standards with NIST, ANSI, ISO, and the International Telecommunication Union. In addition, NCSD leverages a variety of resources to promote specific cybersecurity standards and practices. For example, through its Control Systems Security Program, NCSD has taken several actions, such as developing a catalog of recommended security practices for control systems, developing a cybersecurity evaluation tool that allows asset owners to assess their control systems and overall security posture, and collaborating with the Industrial Control Systems Joint Working Group to promote control standards and system security. In addition, officials from the Department of Energy’s Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability stated that the department, as the energy- sector-specific agency, is involved in many ongoing efforts to assist the sector in the development, assessment, and sharing of cybersecurity standards. For example, the department is working with NIST to enable state power producers to use current cybersecurity guidance. The department is also the Vice Chair of the Cyber Security Working Group and provides funds that will enable private sector power producers to share practices. In addition, according to Department of Energy officials, the department is currently leading an initiative to develop a risk management guideline for the electric grid to ensure that cybersecurity risks are addressed at the organization, mission or business process, and information system levels. This is modeled after NIST Special Publication 800-39 and tailored to the needs of the energy sector. Further, Department of Health and Human Services officials responsible for the agency’s sector-specific efforts also stated that they encourage the sharing of existing standards. For example, a public-private cybersecurity workgroup was formed that developed a cybersecurity primer to educate members of the sector. While these are significant steps, DHS and the other sector-specific agencies have not identified the key cybersecurity guidance applicable to or widely used in each of their respective critical infrastructure sectors. In addition, DHS guidance for preparing the sector-specific critical infrastructure protection plans calls for, among other things, outlining the sector’s cyber protection and resilience strategies; however, these plans largely do not identify key guidance and standards for cybersecurity. Specifically, only one of the seven sectors reviewed (banking and finance) listed cybersecurity guidance in its current sector-specific plan. The other six sectors mentioned certain guidance in these plans, but did not list applicable guidance. Sectors reported that they did not identify this guidance in their plans in part because DHS did not specifically address listing cybersecurity guidance in its guidance for the revision of the sector-specific plans. In addition, officials from DHS’s NCSD noted that their engagement in the area of standards focuses on promoting standards and practices from a cross-sector perspective, rather than focusing on individual sectors. However, given the plethora of guidance available, individual entities within the sectors may be challenged in identifying the guidance that is most applicable and effective in improving their security posture. Improved knowledge of the guidance that is available could help both federal and private sector decision makers better coordinate their efforts to protect critical cyber-reliant assets. Sector cybersecurity guidance related to three subsectors (electricity, depository institutions, and nuclear reactors) is substantially similar to guidance applicable to federal agencies. Specifically, sector cybersecurity guidance and supplementary documents that we analyzed addressed most of NIST’s risk management framework steps and most of the 198 recommended security controls in NIST SP 800-53 (listed in table 3) that are specified for federal information systems. In cases where differences existed in terms of security controls, sector representatives provided supplementary documents with controls that resolved the difference, or explained that some federally recommended security controls were not applicable for sector-specific reasons. NERC Cyber Security Standards 002 through 009, Version 3, and supplementary documents are substantially similar to guidance applicable to federal agencies. As discussed previously, the NIST risk management framework describes the activities important to an effective information security program (e.g., categorize information systems, select security controls). Similarly, the NERC Cyber Security Standards provide a cybersecurity framework for the identification and protection of entity- identified critical cyber assets to support reliable operation of the bulk power system.Security Management Controls and Systems Security Management), which contain mandatory and enforceable minimum security requirements (e.g., critical cyber asset identification and cyber vulnerability assessment). The standards also cover eight cybersecurity areas (e.g., As discussed previously, NIST SP 800-53, Revision 3, addresses one of the steps in the NIST risk management framework, which is to select a baseline of security controls and tailor and supplement the baseline based on an organizational risk assessment. SP 800-53 contains 18 control families (e.g., Access Control and Risk Assessment), which in total, contain 198 recommended security controls (e.g., Account Management and Malicious Code Protection) for federal information systems and organizations. We determined that the eight NERC Cyber Security Standards and supplementary documents addressed 151 of the 198 SP 800-53 controls, and NERC officials responsible for the Cyber Security Standards deemed 46 of the remaining controls to be not applicable, and stated that 1 control—transmission integrity—was not considered when revising the latest NERC Cyber Security Standards. The NERC officials provided specific reasons as to why the 46 controls were not applicable to the bulk power system, as illustrated by the following examples: A control had the potential to increase risk to operations of bulk power system entities. A control was inappropriate and not feasible in a real-time control system environment. A control did not have universal applicability. A control based on FISMA compliance did not apply to the bulk power system environment. Additionally, the NERC officials expressed their concerns about comparing NERC Cyber Security Standards with those of SP 800-53. They said that the authority and scope of their standards derived from Section 215 of the Federal Power Act, as amended, while SP 800-53 derived from FISMA; therefore, the intended purpose of their standards is different from that of the guidance for federal agencies. The officials also said that the NERC Cyber Security Standards are mandatory and enforceable, whereas SP 800-53 provides a menu of possibilities to choose from depending on the specific situation and relies on the concepts of compensating controls and risk management to make trade- offs. Table 4 provides a summary of the comparison between the electricity subsector guidance and federal guidance, including the controls deemed not applicable by sector officials. Examples of commonalities between the electricity subsector cybersecurity guidance and federal guidance, as well as the controls deemed not applicable, are described below. Commonality: SP 800-53 recommends that personnel report suspected security incidents to the organizational incident response capability and report security incident information to designated authorities. The NERC Cyber Security Standard on Incident Reporting and Response Planning contains a similar control by requiring that the responsible entity report cybersecurity incidents to the Electricity Sector Information Sharing and Analysis Center. Commonality: SP 800-53 recommends protecting the confidentiality of transmitted information. NERC Security Guidelines for the Electricity Sector, Protecting Potentially Sensitive Information, Version 1.0, contain a similar control by specifying that, among other things, critical infrastructure owners and operators should have an information security or confidentiality policy in place as an integral part of their business-level policies and that the policy should address the production, storage, transmission, and disposal of both physical and electronic information. Commonality: SP 800-53 recommends maintaining and monitoring temperature and humidity levels within the facility where the information system resides to prevent fluctuations potentially harmful to the information system. The NERC officials stated that the physical infrastructure requirements in the Emergency Preparedness and Operations Reliability Standards require backup control center functionality in the event of any kind of failure of the primary control center. Not applicable: SP 800-53 recommends implementing a session lock control after a period of inactivity or upon receiving a request from a user. According to the NERC officials, this control is not applicable and not feasible in a real-time control system environment because session lock on an operational console could result in a loss of system operations and system monitoring, leading to a loss of present situational awareness. The NERC officials also stated that a lack of situational awareness was a key factor leading to the August 14, 2003, blackout. Not applicable: SP 800-53 recommends employing virtualization techniques to present information system components as other types of components, or components with differing configurations. According to the NERC officials, given the variety of technology and scale implemented by their members, this control would not have universal applicability. Not applicable: SP 800-53 recommends separating duties of individuals as necessary to prevent malevolent activity without collusion. According to the NERC officials, the control is not applicable because it would have the potential to increase risk to operations of bulk power system entities. The NERC officials also stated that the electricity industry typically maintains a practice of separation of duties between IT system developers and support, but placing further separation of duties requirements on operations personnel would result in decreased operational responsiveness and reliability. The FFIEC IT Examination Handbook (IT Handbook), which is composed of 11 booklets, is substantially similar to guidance applicable to federal agencies. Similar to the NIST risk management framework, the IT Handbook addresses various information technology topics (e.g., information security, operations, and management). Specifically, the Information Security Booklet is intended to provide guidance to examiners and organizations for assessing the level of security risks to the organization and evaluating the adequacy of the organization’s risk management. In addition, this booklet states that financial institutions protect their information by instituting a security process that identifies risks, forms a strategy to manage the risks, implements the strategy, tests the implementation, and monitors the environment to control the risks. We determined that the IT Handbook addressed 196 of 198 SP 800-53 controls; the FFIEC officials deemed the remaining 2 controls to be not applicable. Additionally, FFIEC officials responsible for cybersecurity- related issues and guidance expressed concerns about comparing NIST guidelines with those of the IT Handbook. According to the FFIEC officials, although the general purpose for both information resources is to protect information security assets, the process by which they communicate their intended purpose is different. Specifically, according to these officials, while many NIST controls directly compare with those of the IT Handbook, the target audiences are vastly different. The IT Handbook provides a higher-level overview (i.e., risk-based principles) detailing the controls and standards, while NIST describes specific controls for a standard. Therefore, comparisons between the two sets of guidance can best be accomplished by comparing information security concepts and principles. Table 5 provides a summary of the comparison between the banking and finance sector cybersecurity guidance and federal guidance, including the controls deemed not applicable by sector officials. Examples of commonalities between the banking and finance sector cybersecurity guidance and federal guidance, as well as the controls deemed not applicable, are described below. Commonality: SP 800-53 recommends implementing a session lock control after a period of inactivity or upon receiving a request from a user. The IT Handbook contains a similar control by specifying that controls include automatically logging the workstation out after a period of inactivity and heuristic intrusion detection. Commonality: SP 800-53 recommends usage restrictions and implementation guidance for wireless access. The IT Handbook contains a similar control by specifying that financial institutions determine whether appropriate device and session authentication takes place, particularly for remote and wireless machines. Not applicable: SP 800-53 recommends identifying specific user actions that can be performed on the information system without identification or authentication. According to the FFIEC officials, this control is not applicable because it would be excessive and burdensome to identify user actions within systems that do not require controls to protect sensitive, classified, or nonpublic information. In addition, the Information Security Booklet provides guidance as to how access should be given (i.e., sufficient access required to perform the work to be done). Not applicable: SP 800-53 recommends employing diverse information technologies in the implementation of the information system to reduce the impact of the exploitation of a specific technology. According to the FFIEC officials, this control is not applicable because it could add complexity and management overhead that could lead to mistakes and misconfigurations that could increase overall risk. NRC Regulatory Guide 5.71, Cyber Security Programs for Nuclear Facilities (RG 5.71) and supplementary documents are substantially similar to guidance applicable to federal agencies. According to NRC representatives responsible for NRC’s cybersecurity-related efforts, RG 5.71 sets forth methods that NRC has found acceptable for licensees to use in complying with the requirements of 10 CFR §73.54. Similar to the NIST risk management framework, these methods describe the activities important to an effective cybersecurity program for nuclear power plants. For example, RG 5.71 provides a method to aid in the categorization and identification of digital assets that must be protected from cyber attacks. It also provides a method to address and manage the potential cybersecurity risks of digital assets by applying a defensive architecture and a collection of security controls. Moreover, according to RG 5.71, it is based on standards provided in NIST SP 800-53 and NIST SP 800-82, among others. Further, we determined that RG 5.71 and supplementary documents addressed 178 of 198 SP 800-53 controls, and the NRC representatives deemed the remaining 20 controls to be not applicable to their sector. Although not exactly a one-to-one match, the security controls in RG 5.71 often closely resembled the language and terminology of security controls found in SP 800-53. However, according to NRC, where applicable, the security controls in RG 5.71 have been tailored for nuclear power plants by leveraging NIST guidance in appendix I of SP 800-53 on tailoring security controls for industrial control systems. The NRC representatives provided specific reasons why the 20 controls were not applicable, as illustrated by the following examples: A control is not allowed because it would have a direct impact on the operational integrity of safety functions at a nuclear power plant. A control is not within the scope of NRC’s regulatory authority. A control was not selected because it is not included in the NIST security control baseline for industrial control systems in NIST SP 800-53, Revision 3, Appendix I. Table 6 provides a summary of the comparison between the nuclear sector cybersecurity guidance and federal guidance, including the controls deemed not applicable by sector representatives. Examples of commonalities between the nuclear sector cybersecurity guidance and federal guidance, as well as the controls deemed not applicable, are described below. Commonality: SP 800-53 recommends basic security awareness training to all information system users. RG 5.71 contains a similar control by specifying that, among other things, the licensee or applicant establish, implement, and document training requirements for training programs to provide basic cybersecurity training for facility personnel. Commonality: SP 800-53 recommends protection against supply chain threats by employing defense-in-breadth strategy. RG 5.71 contains a similar control by specifying that the licensee or applicant protect against supply chain threats and vulnerabilities by employing the following measures: establishing trusted distribution paths, validating vendors, and requiring tamper-proof products or tamper-evident seals on acquired products. Commonality: SP 800-53 recommends enforcing a limit of consecutive invalid access attempts by a user. RG 5.71 contains a similar control by specifying that the licensee or applicant ensure that security controls are implemented to limit the number of invalid access attempts by a user. Not applicable: SP 800-53 recommends limiting the number of concurrent sessions for each system account. According to the NRC representatives, the concurrent session control is not applicable because it was determined that implementation of this control presents a safety risk to digital safety systems, or that systems under the scope of NRC regulations cannot support concurrent session control. Not applicable: SP 800-53 recommends protecting information systems from damage resulting from water leakage by providing master shutoff valves that are accessible to key personnel. According to the NRC representatives, as a result of their tailoring process, the control was not selected as part of the final security control baseline in RG 5.71 because systems used at nuclear power plants are designed and built to maintain the safe operation of the plant in the event of flooding. Additionally, plant operators who are licensed by NRC are authorized to manipulate components in the facilities to control their plants. Not applicable: SP 800-53 recommends all capital planning and investment requests include the resources needed to implement the information security program and document all exceptions to this requirement. According to the NRC representatives, this security control is not necessary as licensees, by definition, must have the resources to implement their cybersecurity programs. A wide variety of cybersecurity guidance is available to owners and operators of our nation’s cyber-reliant critical infrastructure. Both required and voluntary guidance has been developed and issued by industry regulators, associations, and other groups that is tailored to the business needs of entities or provides methods to address unique risks or operations. While entities operating in a federal regulatory environment face enforcement mechanisms for not adhering to standards in regulatory requirements, entities not subject to regulation do not face such enforcement mechanisms, but implement such guidance to, among other things, mitigate risks, maintain profits, and meet customer expectations. In carrying out their responsibilities for coordinating efforts to protect the cyber-critical infrastructure, DHS and the other sector-specific agencies have taken steps to disseminate and promote cybersecurity guidance. However, these agencies have not identified the guidance applicable to or widely used in each of their respective critical infrastructure sectors. In addition, most sectors reviewed had not specified available guidance in their respective planning documents, in part because DHS’s planning guidance did not suggest the inclusion of cybersecurity guidance. Given the plethora of guidance available, individual entities within the sectors may be challenged in identifying the guidance that is most applicable and effective in improving their security posture. Greater knowledge of the guidance that is available could help both federal and private sector decision makers better coordinate their efforts to protect critical cyber- reliant assets. Finally, the sector-specific cybersecurity guidance that we compared was substantially similar to guidance applicable to federal agencies. We recommend that the Secretary of Homeland Security, in collaboration with the sector-specific agencies, sector coordinating councils, and the owners and operators of cyber-reliant critical infrastructure for the associated seven critical infrastructure sectors, determine whether it is appropriate to have key cybersecurity guidance listed in sector plans or annual plans and adjust planning guidance accordingly to suggest the inclusion of such guidance in future plans. DHS provided written comments on a draft of our report (see app. III), signed by DHS’s Director of Departmental GAO/OIG Liaison Office. In its comments, DHS concurred with our recommendation and stated that the department will initiate steps to implement it. In particular, DHS stated that it will work with its public and private sector partners to determine whether it is appropriate to have cybersecurity guidance drafted for each sector. DHS also indicated that the National Cyber Security Division will explore these issues with the cross-sector community. NRC also provided written comments on a draft of our report (see app. IV), signed by the Executive Director for Operations. NRC generally agreed with the draft report. DHS, NRC, the Department of Commerce, the Department of the Treasury, EPA, FERC, FFIEC, and HHS, also provided technical comments, which we incorporated, where appropriate. In addition, we provided relevant sections of the draft report to private sector participants. We received technical comments via e-mail from some, but not all, of these parties and incorporated their comments, where appropriate. As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the report date. At that time, we will send copies to the appropriate congressional committees; the Secretaries of Commerce, Energy, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, and the Treasury; Administrator, Environmental Protection Agency; Executive Director, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission; Executive Secretary, Federal Financial Institutions Council; Executive Director for Operations, Nuclear Regulatory Commission; Director, Office of Management and Budget; and other interested congressional and private sector parties. In addition, the report will be available at no charge on the GAO website at http://www.gao.gov. If you or your staff members have any questions about this report, please contact Gregory Wilshusen at (202) 512-6244, or by e-mail at wilshuseng@gao.gov. Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. Our objectives were to identify (1) cybersecurity guidance for entities within selected critical infrastructure sectors, (2) the extent to which implementation of cybersecurity guidance is enforced and promoted within selected sectors, and (3) areas of commonalities and differences that exist between sectors’ cybersecurity guidance and guidance applicable to federal agencies. We focused our efforts on seven sectors: banking and finance; communications; energy (electricity and oil and natural gas); health care and public health; information technology; nuclear reactors, materials, and waste; and water. We selected these seven sectors because they are cyber-reliant or have a pervasive impact on the public’s health and welfare. This determination was based on our analysis of the critical infrastructure sectors and interviews with agency officials and representatives from the sector coordinating councils. Our findings and conclusions are based on information gathered from the seven critical infrastructure sectors and are not generalizable to a larger population.\n\n### Summary:", "answer": "Critical infrastructures are systems and assets critical to the nation's security, economy, and public health and safety, most of which are owned by the private sector. These assets rely on networked computers and systems, thus making them susceptible to cyber-based risks. Managing such risk involves the use of cybersecurity guidance that promotes or requires actions to enhance the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of computer systems. For seven critical infrastructure sectors, GAO was asked to identify (1) cybersecurity guidance for entities within the sectors, (2) the extent to which implementation of this guidance is enforced and promoted, and (3) areas of commonalities and differences between sector cybersecurity guidance and guidance applicable to federal agencies. To do this, GAO collected and analyzed information from responsible private sector coordinating councils; federal agencies, including sector-specific agencies that are responsible for coordinating critical infrastructure protection efforts; and standards-making bodies. In addition, GAO compared a set of guidance in each of three subsectors with guidance applicable to federal agencies. A wide variety of cybersecurity guidance is available from national and international organizations for entities within the seven critical infrastructure sectors GAO reviewed--banking and finance; communications; energy; health care and public health; information technology; nuclear reactors, material, and waste; and water. Much of this guidance is tailored to business needs of entities or provides methods to address unique risks or operations. In addition, entities operating in regulated environments are subject to mandatory standards to meet their regulatory requirements; entities operating outside of a regulatory environment may voluntarily adopt standards and guidance. While private sector coordinating council representatives confirmed lists of cybersecurity guidance that they stated were used within their respective sectors, the representatives emphasized that the lists were not comprehensive and that additional standards and guidance are likely used. Implementation of cybersecurity guidance can occur through a variety of mechanisms, including enforcement of regulations and voluntarily in response to business incentives; however, sector-specific agencies could take additional steps to promote the most applicable and effective guidance throughout the sectors. A number of subsectors within the sectors included in GAO's review, such as electricity in the energy sector, are required to meet mandatory cybersecurity standards established by regulation under federal law or face enforcement mechanisms, such as civil monetary penalties. By contrast, entities not subject to regulation may voluntarily implement cybersecurity guidance to, among other things, reduce risk, protect intellectual property, and meet customer expectations. Federal policy establishes the dissemination and promotion of cybersecurity-related standards and guidance as a goal to enhancing the security of our nation's cyber-reliant critical infrastructure. DHS and the other lead agencies for the sectors selected for review have disseminated and promoted cybersecurity guidance among and within sectors. However, DHS and the other sector-specific agencies have not identified the key cybersecurity guidance applicable to or widely used in each of their respective critical infrastructure sectors. In addition, most of the sector-specific critical infrastructure protection plans for the sectors reviewed do not identify key guidance and standards for cybersecurity because doing so was not specifically suggested by DHS guidance. Given the plethora of guidance available, individual entities within the sectors may be challenged in identifying the guidance that is most applicable and effective in improving their security posture. Improved knowledge of the guidance that is available could help both federal and private sector decision makers better coordinate their efforts to protect critical cyber-reliant assets. Sector cybersecurity guidance that GAO compared in three subsectors within the banking and finance, energy, and nuclear sectors is substantially similar to guidance applicable to federal agencies. Specifically, one set of guidance for each subsector, along with supplementary documents, addressed most risk management steps and most recommended security controls that are specified for federal information systems in guidance from the Commerce Department's National Institute of Standards and Technology. GAO is recommending that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), in collaboration with public and private sector partners, determine whether it is appropriate to have cybersecurity guidance listed in sector plans. DHS concurred with GAO's recommendation. GAO is recommending that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), in collaboration with public and private sector partners, determine whether it is appropriate to have cybersecurity guidance listed in sector plans. DHS concurred with GAOs recommendation."}

However, these functions were transferred to DHS under the Homeland Security Act when the U.S. Customs Service was merged with parts of the Immigration and Naturalization Service and the Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service to form CBP in March 2003. At that time, CBP’s priority mission was homeland security, but the agency was also responsible for facilitating the movement of legitimate trade and people. Congress required in Section 412(b) of the Homeland Security Act that the Secretary of DHS, at a minimum, maintain the level of staff and associated support staff in certain customs revenue functions, which was in part defined as those functions performed by staff in nine positions that were present in the U.S. Customs Service when it became part of DHS in 2003. These customs revenue functions involve trade functions, including trade enforcement. For the purposes of our report, we refer to these as the nine mandated trade positions. Since the creation of CBP, Congress has passed additional legislation that relates to CBP’s trade functions. For example, the Security and Accountability for Every Port Act of 2006 (SAFE Port Act) requires CBP to prepare a resource model to determine the optimal staffing levels that are required to carry out commercial operations, including inspection and release of cargo and the revenue functions described in Section 412(b) of the Homeland Security Act. Accordingly, CBP developed the Resource Optimization Model for trade positions. In its model, CBP identified the staffing levels for 15 positions, of which 9 were the mandated trade positions from the Homeland Security Act, and 6 were nonmandated trade positions that also perform trade functions. According to CBP, the Resource Optimization Model generated a staff level range that projects the optimal staffing levels necessary for each of the 15 positions to conduct trade processing and enforcement across the seven Priority Trade Issue areas for a given fiscal year. CBP’s Resource Optimization Model is based on projected workloads, staffing needs, and attrition levels for trade positions, according to officials from CBP’s Office of Trade. The Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 acknowledged many existing CBP trade practices and enforcement processes, such as Priority Trade Issues and partnerships with the trade industry, and also placed additional requirements on CBP, such as enforcing revised U.S. laws concerning imported goods made using forced labor. The Act covers trade facilitation and trade enforcement issues such as import safety, protection of intellectual property, and prevention of evasion of duties. The Act also requires the development and implementation of Centers of Excellence and Expertise (Centers) that CBP had already been piloting and, among other things, centralizes CBP’s trade enforcement and trade facilitation efforts. According to CBP officials, the Act complements and bolsters CBP’s existing initiatives to enhance trade enforcement and facilitation. According to CBP officials, two strategic documents inform the agency’s approach to trade enforcement. CBP Trade Strategy, Fiscal Years 2009-2013 is the most recent CBP trade-specific strategy, according to CBP officials. The strategy lays out four trade goals: (1) facilitate legitimate trade and ensure compliance, (2) enforce U.S. trade laws and collect accurate revenue, (3) advance national and economic security, and (4) intensify modernization of CBP’s trade processes. According to officials in the Office of Trade, CBP’s current trade priorities are reflected in CBP’s Vision and Strategy 2020 document. The document lays out four overarching strategic goals with objectives for CBP and addresses the agency’s dual security and trade mission. Two of these four goals address trade enforcement. CBP’s Priority Trade Issues are high-risk issue areas in which violations can cause significant revenue loss, harm the U.S. economy, or threaten the health and safety of the American people, according to CBP. Priority Trade Issues focus CBP’s actions and resources to better direct an effective trade facilitation and enforcement approach, according to CBP. Table 1 provides information on CBP’s Priority Trade Issues and examples of violations and enforcement actions that can occur. The Act required CBP to establish seven Priority Trade Issues, of which five already existed prior to being mentioned in the Act, according to CBP. CBP is led by a Commissioner who oversees CBP’s dual mission of protecting national security objectives while promoting economic prosperity and security, according to CBP documents. This mission was being carried out by more than 60,000 employees as of March 2017, with less than 20 percent working on trade-related issues, according to CBP officials. Two of CBP’s six offices are involved in carrying out trade enforcement: the Office of Trade and the Office of Field Operations (see fig. 1). Two other CBP offices, Enterprise Services and Operations Support, provide the Office of Trade and the Office of Field Operations with technical and administrative support for trade enforcement. The flow of imports, or goods, into U.S. commerce is a regulated, multifaceted process that CBP is responsible for facilitating and enforcing. Imported goods enter at over 300 ports by air, land, or sea. The flow of goods can be characterized by three stages: pre-entry, entry, and post- entry (see fig. 2). At pre-entry, before goods leave their country of origin and prior to goods arriving at a U.S. port of entry, importers and carriers file paperwork and provide required advance electronic information for CBP to review. At entry, importers or brokers file entry documents when goods reach a U.S. port of entry where CBP scans and possibly examines them for import security and trade enforcement purposes before they enter into U.S. commerce. In some cases, CBP may target cargo for examination based on a risk assessment. Cargo that is scanned or inspected may be deemed as nonadmissible because of trade law violations, among other things. If CBP finds such violations, it may seize the cargo and issue penalties and/or fines. If the goods pose a risk of nonpayment of duties, and the shipment meets certain requirements, CBP may require additional bond coverage. Admissible goods are released from the port and enter into U.S. commerce. At post-entry, importers or brokers file an additional set of entry summary documents that CBP reviews to ensure trade compliance, after entry of the goods has been authorized. CBP verifies the importer’s cargo classifications and calculation of customs duties, taxes, and fees owed, taking action when needed. For example, CBP may determine that an importer misclassified cargo in an attempt to pay lower duty rates, such that the agency issues the importer a bill for a greater amount based on the proper classification and possibly applies a penalty. CBP also continues to review and process trade information provided by the importer. For example, CBP may conduct audits and reviews and validate information provided by the importer to check for importer compliance. CBP’s trade policy, processing, and enforcement are primarily carried out by two offices—the Office of Trade and the Office of Field Operations. The Office of Trade develops policies to guide trade enforcement efforts, while the Office of Field Operations conducts a range of trade processing and enforcement activities at ports. CBP staff in a variety of positions, including import specialists and CBP officers, conduct a range of trade processing and enforcement activities. CBP’s previously port-centric approach to trade enforcement has shifted to a national-level, industry- focused approach with the establishment of the Office of Field Operations’ 10 Centers of Excellence and Expertise. These Centers represent a shift in trade operations, centralizing the processing of imported goods on a national scale through a single industry-related Center rather than individual ports of entry. Within CBP, the Office of Trade is the lead entity for trade policy and operational guidance. The Office of Trade is responsible for developing policy and practices to ensure that importers comply with U.S. trade laws and regulations, directing enforcement when compliance does not occur, and facilitating processes with industry partners. The Office of Trade guides the Office of Field Operations’ trade enforcement efforts at the ports through policy documents and directives, according to CBP officials. The Office of Trade is composed of six directorates: five are focused on trade issues, and one provides human capital and financial support to the office (see table 2 for a description of the directorates and app. III for an organizational chart of the Office of Trade). The Trade Policy and Programs directorate oversees CBP’s seven Priority Trade Issues, according to CBP officials. Each branch within this directorate is headed by a director who oversees components covering policy, enforcement, targeting, and operations as they relate to enforcement of the Priority Trade Issues at the field office and port level. See figure 3 for an organizational chart of the Trade Policy and Programs directorate and its branches. While the Office of Trade focuses solely on trade, the Office of Field Operations is responsible for both border security and the facilitation of lawful trade and travel at U.S. ports of entry. The Office of Field Operations operates 20 field offices located throughout the United States. The field offices, which are organized by regions, manage over 300 ports where cargo enters. The Office of Field Operations is composed of seven directorates, six with responsibility for trade enforcement and border security, and one that provides human capital and financial support. According to CBP, four of the seven directorates and relevant divisions are involved in carrying out CBP’s trade enforcement. Table 3 describes the four directorates that carry out trade enforcement as well as one directorate that carries out human capital and financial support. (See app. III for the organizational chart of the Office of Field Operations.) Within the Office of Trade and the Office of Field Operations, trade operations and enforcement are carried out by CBP staff in various positions at ports located throughout the United States and CBP headquarters. In the Resource Optimization Model, CBP’s Office of Trade identified 15 positions that carry out trade functions, including the 9 mandated trade positions and 6 nonmandated trade positions that may perform security functions in addition to trade functions. In this report, we refer to these 15 positions as trade positions. Thirteen of the 15 trade positions are located within the Office of Trade or the Office of Field Operations, one is in Enterprise Services, and one is in Operations Support (see table 4). CBP’s 10 Centers of Excellence and Expertise have changed the way in which CBP conducts trade operations, centralizing the processing of imported goods on a national scale through a single industry-related Center rather than through individual ports of entry. Within the Office of Field Operations, the Centers of Excellence and Expertise are organized by industry, with staff located in ports across the United States (see fig. 4). Each Center is responsible for performing trade functions related to its industry sector, such as the processing of entry summary and post-entry summary documentation and account management, regardless of the cargo’s port of entry. Each Center is located within a CBP field office and has a Center director. Each Center is organized into three divisions – Validation and Compliance, Enforcement, and Partnership Programs – each covered by an assistant Center director. Center staff are located at ports across the United States. The Centers have made it easier for CBP to gain a national perspective on the movement of trade, compliance issues, and enforcement patterns; they also have enhanced commodity expertise and industry-based knowledge for import specialists, according to CBP officials. Before CBP established the Centers, documents associated with the imported goods were processed by import specialists at the ports where the goods physically entered, so importers had to communicate with multiple import specialists at ports across the United States to process goods if they imported goods into more than one port (see fig. 5). As a result, it was harder for CBP to uniformly process entries and detect import patterns across the nation. For example, a potential trade violation caught by an import specialist at one port might not have been caught by an import specialist at another port. Now, after the establishment of the Centers, goods are processed by import specialists assigned to specific Centers, and importers work with one Center. In addition, the Centers have centralized CBP’s support for the trade community; now the trade community can reach out to one Center instead of multiple ports with questions about the import process, according to CBP officials. With the 10 Centers fully operationalized, Center staff are adjusting to a new work environment that involves remote teams. Prior to the creation of the Centers, import specialists were reporting to and managed by a supervisor and port director located at their port, while national account managers reported to the Office of Trade. Now, import specialists and national account managers are reporting to and managed by the Center they are assigned to, even though they may not be physically co-located with their supervisors or Center director. According to CBP officials, entry specialists are currently reporting to their local port supervisors and managers, but will be reporting to and managed by 1 of the 10 Centers later in fiscal year 2017. Figure 6 illustrates an example of the remote management environment of the Electronics Center. According to CBP officials, Centers and their staff face challenges that stem mainly from the transition to working in a remote environment and are making efforts to address these challenges: Virtual communication. Management and staff are increasing their usage of technology, teleconferences, and webcams and undergoing training to facilitate building remote teams. In addition, division directors and supervisory import specialists may teleconference once a month to discuss challenges in remote management. New policies and procedures. Managers are learning different administrative policies such as leave policies as well as union rules that vary by port and operating across different time zones. In general, managers cover one geographic region, so they do not need to learn every port’s policies. Funding and support structure. While the Centers do not have a separate budget to support activities such as travel and do not have mission support staff, the field offices have generally been supportive, according to CBP officials. The CBP field offices that house each of the Center directors have discretion on budget matters and mission support for the Centers. The Centers also find alternatives to activities that may require funds, such as attending webinars instead of in- person training. CBP uses a layered, risk-based approach to guide its trade enforcement activities across its Priority Trade Issues but generally does not set performance targets to assess the effectiveness of its activities. CBP’s trade enforcement activities leverage many different units within CBP and at other government agencies, according to CBP officials. See figure 7 for examples of these activities by stage of entry of goods into the United States. CBP has created plans to set goals and objectives for its Priority Trade Issues; these plans contain some performance measures but generally lack targets to measure achievements and effectiveness. CBP focuses on creating partnerships with industry to support its goal of increasing compliance among importers, according to CBP, and thereby reducing the risk of allowing noncompliant goods to enter the United States. According to CBP, partnership with industry helps expedite the flow of legitimate trade shipments and reduces the examination rate of low-risk importers, allowing CBP to focus its trade enforcement efforts on higher-risk importers. Examples of CBP’s partnership programs include the following: The Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT) program. Through this public–private partnership program, members of the trade community volunteer to adopt tighter security measures throughout their international supply chains in exchange for enhanced trade facilitation, such as expedited processing. According to CBP, over 50 percent of the imports into the United States by value in 2016 are C-TPAT imports. The Importer Self-Assessment (ISA). Current members of C-TPAT can apply to be ISA-certified, which means that importers have developed and implemented internal controls and assessed risk based on self-testing. The benefits of ISA to industry, according to CBP, include importers’ exemption from comprehensive CBP audits, fewer cargo exams, and faster clearance of cargo at the ports of entry. The Trusted Trader Program (currently in a pilot phase). The Trusted Trader Program’s goal is to unify the current C-TPAT and ISA processes in order to integrate supply chain security and trade compliance and further increase the low-risk importer population, which allows CBP to focus on the high-risk importers. The development of Trusted Trader is a coordinated effort with members of the trade community, CBP, and partner government agencies. The program is carried out by the Partnership Divisions of the Centers of Excellence and Expertise, which is composed of national account managers, import specialists, and entry specialists who work with the Trusted Trader accounts. According to CBP, this arrangement enables CBP and partner government agencies to provide additional incentives to participating entities and enhance efficiencies by managing supply chain security and trade compliance within one partnership program. In addition to partnership programs, according to CBP officials, staff at the Centers work closely with company representatives through meetings and seminars to enrich their knowledge of products and better understand the nuances of a particular industry to enhance their ability to identify high- risk importers. According to CBP, such partnerships with the private sector include participation in the Commercial Customs Operations Advisory Committee (COAC) to U.S. Customs and Border Protection working groups, roundtable meetings with industry representatives, and educational seminars. Another partnership is through E-allegations, CBP’s online referral process for alleging trade violation(s) by importers, which provides a means for industry and the public to report to CBP any suspected violations of trade laws or regulations related to the importation of goods into the United States. CBP’s targeting efforts are carried out by different targeting groups at the national and port levels, and can support or help identify enforcement actions that are carried out on high-risk shipments. Targeting involves obtaining information about the shipment entering U.S. ports and those parties involved in moving the cargo and goods, such as the importer. Targeting groups develop user-defined rules (targeting rules) based on advance data, research, and other information that might show trends or emerging trade issues. The targeting rules are generally entered into CBP’s Automated Targeting System and flag certain cargo and goods for CBP officials responsible for trade enforcement to inspect or review documentation for potential trade violations. The targeting rules are ranked as mandatory, or high-, medium-, or low-risk, providing CBP officials some discretion on the need to take action. At the national level, CBP’s targeting efforts are carried out by different units, according to CBP. Within the Office of Trade, the National Targeting and Analysis Groups (NTAG) and Commercial Targeting and Analysis Center (CTAC) target for further review high-risk imports that are related to the Priority Trade Issues. Currently there are five NTAGs, located in various locations across the country and staffed mainly by international trade specialists who specialize in targeting mainly at post- entry for their respective Priority Trade Issue. The CTAC facilitates information sharing among partner government agencies on targeting and enforcement at all stages of the import process – pre-entry, entry, and post-entry – focusing on a variety of issues, including import safety and environmental crime, natural resources, wildlife trafficking, and cultural property, according to CBP. These targeting groups also collect information to develop targeting rules from import specialists who are assigned to 1 of the 10 Centers that cover their respective industry. Also at the national level, the Office of Field Operations’ National Targeting Center provides advance targeting, research, and coordination for CBP field units, the intelligence community, foreign counterparts, and investigative and law enforcement agencies in support of CBP’s antiterrorism mission and includes a cargo component focused on trade called the Tactical Trade Targeting Unit. This unit provides a national targeting perspective and is focused on developing user-defined rules that have a high probability of leading to investigations, according to National Targeting Center officials. The National Targeting Center established an integrated operational network, known as the Integrated Trade Targeting Network (the network), between all of CBP’s national level trade targeting assets in the Office of Trade and the Office of Field Operations. According to CBP officials, the purpose of the network is to improve communication, coordinate actions, and standardize procedures for more effective trade targeting. The network provides training to enhance the knowledge of relevant CBP field and headquarters personnel in the areas of automated targeting and reporting systems and targeting techniques. At the port level, CBP’s targeting efforts are also carried out by CBP officers who utilize user-defined rules to identify high-risk cargo coming through the port for examination, according to CBP officials. CBP officers located at ports must examine all shipments that have a mandatory rule in the Automated Targeting System, but are given discretion to examine or not examine cargo for all other nonmandatory rules, according to CBP. For example, the targeting rules may trigger a requirement that CBP hold up the movement of a specific shipment at a port (called “holds”) until CBP officers can examine the shipment or import specialists can review documentation to determine whether there are possible trade violations. CBP may also conduct targeting based on advance information it receives on shipments coming into ports (see fig. 8 for an example of goods seized as a result of targeting). CBP’s targeting efforts can support enforcement operations that are carried out by numerous CBP entities such as import specialists, agriculture specialists, and CBP officers as well as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) Department of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), a partnering component agency of CBP under the Department of Homeland Security, and other partner government agencies. For example, CBP reported in December 2016 that it conducted several operations in the last quarter of fiscal year 2016 focused on targeting counterfeit goods—such as apparel, footwear, auto parts, and handbags—coming through express consignment and international mail facilities. CBP reported that these operations resulted in seizures of 948 shipments of counterfeit goods with an estimated manufacturer’s suggested retail price of over $20 million for the goods. CBP conducts post-entry audits and validation activities to assess trade compliance and identify possible trade violations across the Priority Trade Issue areas. Customs auditors in the Regulatory Audit directorate within CBP’s Office of Trade reported that they use a risk-based approach to select candidates for assessment. According to officials from Regulatory Audit, their audit plans tend to focus on examining importers with high dollar value shipments and potential risk to revenue—generally large and midrange importers. Regulatory Audit conducts various types of audits and reviews, including the following: Focused assessment–comprehensive audits of major importers. These audits assess internal control over import activities to determine whether the importers pose acceptable risk for complying with CBP laws and regulations. Such assessments can look at value, classification, free trade agreements, intellectual property rights, free trade zones, prior disclosures, and antidumping and countervailing duties. Quick response audits–targeted compliance audit with narrowly defined objectives. These audits focus on a single issue or specific concern referred to Regulatory Audit by CBP’s NTAG or ICE, and cover Priority Trade Issues and other areas. Such audits can cover antidumping, intellectual property, import safety, textiles and wearing apparel, drawback, and foreign trade zone issues. Surveys of importers. These surveys are performed as a result of an assertion or allegation, such as an e-allegation, with an objective to obtain an understanding of a company’s importing practices to determine if there are concerns that merit future CBP consideration. Regulatory Audit officials we met with in Los Angeles and New York told us that the majority of their assignments are made up of quick response audits and surveys. According to CBP officials, the audits and reviews can result in the collection of additional revenue. For example, Regulatory Audit in headquarters reported that for fiscal year 2015, it identified, through its audit recommendations, over $109 million of revenue owed by importers and was able to collect almost $60 million that year. The audits and reviews also provide informed and enforced compliance to the trade community and act as a deterrent by discouraging potential violators. In addition to activities carried out by Regulatory Audit, the Centers also conduct validation and compliance checks by reviewing post-entry importer records. All Centers have a division that conducts validation and compliance checks to ensure importer compliance. The checks are mainly carried out by teams of import specialists that specialize in different commodity types within their industry section. For example, by reviewing an importer’s post-entry summary records, the Center may validate that the entry complied with all conditions to be treated as a specific commodity under free trade agreements in which the United States is a party. When prompted by mandatory targeting rules, import specialists at the Centers are also responsible for reviewing the importers’ post-entry documentation and recording in the Automated Targeting System whether any potential violations were found. Some officials from targeting groups that we met with told us that import specialists are inconsistent about recording the results of the reviews they conduct, which impedes the targeting groups’ ability to assess the effectiveness of their targeting rules. According to Center procedures, import specialists are responsible for working with importers to ensure future compliance if violations have occurred and goods are seized or penalties are issued. CBP can take actions against noncompliant importers when applicable. For example, CBP can seize imported goods if it believes there is a violation of a trade law. The types of seized shipments range across the different Priority Trade Issue areas such as intellectual property rights, textiles, wearing apparel, and import safety (see fig. 9). For instance, according to CBP, 28,865 shipments were seized based on intellectual property rights violations in fiscal year 2015. The top five categories for intellectual property rights seizures include consumer electronics and pharmaceuticals, each of which often involve shipments that pose threats to consumer safety. According to CBP, as part of the seizure process, the Office of Field Operation’s Fines, Penalties and Forfeitures office will send the importer or another relevant party a notice of seizure. Any interested party may file a petition for relief from seizure within 30 days, according to CBP. CBP stores the seized goods until a final decision is made; if it does not return the goods to the importer, it generally destroys or sells the goods, as appropriate. CBP also has the authority to issue penalties and/or fines against importers, brokers, and other entities bringing goods into the United States that violate the law. Penalties may result, for example, if products are not properly marked with the country of origin, trademarks are violated with counterfeit goods, or illegal goods such as controlled substances are found. Penalties are monetary and are established by statute, according to CBP. In fiscal year 2015, CBP assessed over $237 million in penalties for violations related to its Priority Trade Issues and collected $3.5 million, according to CBP. CBP officials collaborate with officials from the HSI directorate within ICE on civil and criminal cases involving trade fraud, according to CBP and HSI officials. CBP and HSI coordinate at the field office level through regularly scheduled meetings, according to HSI officials. At these meetings, according to HSI and CBP officials, HSI special agents meet with CBP officials, such as import specialists, customs auditors, and international trade specialists, to discuss potential and active cases and upcoming operations. While HSI officials have traditionally worked with local import specialists, they have had to adjust to working with import specialists located in other cities because of the virtual nature of the import specialists at the new Centers of Excellence and Expertise. For example, HSI officials in one city may be working on a case that involves a commodity assigned to a particular Center, but CBP no longer has a local import specialist that works for that Center—so the HSI officials must work with the import specialist located in another city who works for that Center, according to HSI officials. This has caused a decrease in cooperation and communication between CBP and HSI resulting in fewer investigations, according to HSI. CBP officials will share information on suspected activities or importers that are noteworthy based on their own trade enforcement efforts, which may lead to an HSI investigation. For example, while processing shipments entering the United States, import specialists at the Centers may identify unusual trade patterns or documentation discrepancies for shipments of significance, such as large volume or value, with the shipments having health and safety or national security concerns, according to CBP officials. In addition, according to CBP officials, customs auditors from Regulatory Audit may send referrals to HSI if they find potential fraud or other significant issues during their audits of importers. Officials from CBP’s Fines, Penalties and Forfeitures office might also work with HSI on cases that may include seizures of goods. According to Fines, Penalties and Forfeitures officials at one of the ports we visited, more than 50 percent of their time is spent working with HSI on cases involving seized property. According to CBP and HSI officials, other U.S. partner government agencies may also be involved in investigations involving trade violations. CBP also conducts investigations stemming from allegations brought forth by industry and pertaining to the Enforce and Protect Act of 2015. According to the Office of Trade, such investigations draw upon the expertise of resources that include the Centers, targeting groups, and Regulatory Audit to look into the allegations and share the outcomes of investigations with industry. CBP has created strategic or annual plans that contain strategic goals for its Priority Trade Issues and some performance measures but generally lack targets to measure achievements and effectiveness. Leading practices for managing for results note, among other things, that a plan should identify goals and measures covering each of its program activities and contain targets to assess progress toward performance goals. Numerical targets or other measurable values facilitate further assessments of whether overall goals and objectives were achieved because comparisons can be easily made between projected performance and actual results. The Act mandates CBP to develop by February 24, 2017, a joint strategic plan with ICE that incorporates enforcement activities and performance measures. However, the Act does not require that the strategic plan include targets. Currently this plan is in draft form, according to CBP and, because the plan is still changing, CBP declined to share a copy and declined to discuss the extent to which the plan would identify performance measures and targets that would enable CBP to gauge the effectiveness of its activities by Priority Trade Issue. We asked CBP to provide us with strategic or annual plans for its seven Priority Trade Issues to determine how the agency measures its effectiveness in carrying out its trade enforcement efforts for each Priority Trade Issue area. CBP provided us with various plans for its Priority Trade Issues. While one of these Priority Trade Issues had plans that were current, the other Priority Trade Issues either did not have a plan or were using plans that had not been updated in several years. According to officials from the Office of Trade, CBP is in the process of finalizing plans for those Priority Trade Issues with outdated plans or no plans (see app. IV for the status of strategic or annual plans by Priority Trade Issue, as of February 2017). Our analysis of all the Priority Trade Issue plans provided to us shows that they generally lacked performance targets that would enable CBP to assess the effectiveness of its enforcement activities. While we found that most plans identified strategic goals, some plans had performance measures but generally did not contain performance targets that would allow CBP to assess its actual performance against planned performance or compare to past performance. For example, the AD/CVD annual plan for fiscal year 2017 has a number of performance measures that pertain to enforcement and these include reporting the number of AD/CVD- related audits, nonaudit services, surveys conducted, and importers removed from a targeting rule. However, CBP did not set a target level for performance for these measures in the plan, such as the target number of AD/CVD-related audits and surveys to be conducted. Without targets, CBP may not be able to determine the effectiveness of its trade enforcement activities, particularly to see if its projected performance for an activity met its actual results. CBP also reports on some trade enforcement performance measures related to its Priority Trade Issues in various documents, including reports mandated by Congress and annual reports prepared by various CBP entities. For example, a textiles report to Congress describes the types and number of enforcement actions taken, such as the number and value of seizures and penalties and the number of cargo examinations conducted by fiscal year. Also, in its first annual report covering its operations and programs for fiscal year 2015, CTAC—which covers CBP’s import safety Priority Trade Issue—reported on the number of seizures by operations that were conducted with U.S. partner government agencies, ineligible products that were prevented from entering the United States, and the number of enforcement operations conducted, among other things. However, while these metrics allow yearly changes to be identified and tracked, none of the two reports we reviewed included targets that would help officials with oversight responsibilities assess performance and the effectiveness of the CBP’s enforcement activities. Over the past 5 fiscal years, CBP generally has not met the minimum staffing levels set by Congress for four of nine positions that perform customs revenue functions, and it generally has not met the optimal staffing level targets set by the agency for these positions. The Homeland Security Act set mandatory minimum staffing levels for nine mandated trade positions. CBP’s Resource Optimization Model projected optimal staffing levels for the 15 identified trade positions, 9 mandated and 6 nonmandated, for the period of fiscal years 2015 through 2022. Staffing shortfalls can lead to decreased effectiveness of trade enforcement. CBP faces several challenges to hiring and filling staffing gaps, according to CBP officials. We found that CBP has not articulated how it plans to address challenges to filling staffing gaps for trade positions. Our analysis of CBP data from fiscal years 2012 through 2016 shows that the numbers of staff in four of the nine mandated trade positions – import specialist, customs auditor, national import specialist, and drawback specialist – were generally below the minimum mandated staffing and optimal staffing levels. In addition, staffing levels for these positions generally declined during this period. Staffing levels for import specialists provide an example. The Homeland Security Act set the minimum mandated staffing level for import specialists at 984, and CBP’s Resource Optimization Model calculated an optimal staffing level range from 984 to 1,748 import specialists for fiscal years 2015 through 2022. However, the actual staffing levels were below the mandated levels for 4 of the 5 years, consistently declining in the last 3 years from 954 import specialists at the end of fiscal year 2014 to 917 import specialists at the end of fiscal year 2016. The actual staffing levels for customs auditor, national import specialist, and drawback specialist were also generally below the minimum mandated staffing levels from fiscal years 2012 through 2016 and below the optimal staffing level targets in fiscal years 2015 and 2016. In addition, the staff levels for the financial system specialist position were below the mandated levels for 2 out of the 5 fiscal years and below optimal staffing levels for both fiscal years 2015 and 2016. For the four other mandated trade positions, CBP met or exceeded the mandated staffing levels. See table 5 for a list of mandated trade positions and their mandated and optimal staffing levels compared to actual staffing levels as of the end of fiscal years 2012 through 2016. For the six nonmandated trade positions identified in CBP’s Resource Optimization Model, CBP reported that actual staffing levels for five of the positions, as of October 2014, were below the optimal staffing range. For example, the actual level of staff for the CBP officer position, as of October 4, 2014, was significantly below the optimal staffing range, with an actual staff level of 6,889, representing about 1,800-2,800 fewer CBP officers on board than the model’s optimal staffing level. See table 6 for the optimal and actual staffing levels for nonmandated trade positions as reported by CBP, but not mandated by the Homeland Security Act. The optimal and actual staffing levels for the nonmandated trade positions, according to CBP officials, are based on an estimated percentage of time that staff spend on trade functions. For example, while there were 22,000 CBP officers overall in fiscal year 2014, CBP reported that the full-time equivalent of 6,889 staff spent time on trade activities. All of the nonmandated trade positions, except the Chemist position, assigned to Operations Support, are assigned to the Office of Field Operations. Staffing shortfalls in certain key trade positions can also impact CBP’s ability to identify and address risk in trade operations. For example, according to officials from Regulatory Audit in headquarters, if CBP met the mandatory staffing levels for customs auditor, Regulatory Audit would be able to more effectively address risk in the multitude of trade areas. Specifically, they told us that Regulatory Audit would be able to increase the number of importers it audits and expand the scope of their work. In addition, according to Office of Field Operations officials, if CBP met the mandatory staffing levels for import specialists, Centers could conduct more enforcement operations and focus on specific trade issues. Staffing shortfalls in trade positions can impact CBP’s trade processing and enforcement efforts, including CBP’s ability to enforce trade effectively. For example, staffing shortfalls can lead to decreased cargo inspections, according to several CBP officers at three ports we visited. According to these CBP officers, CBP officers at ports respond to rules from targeting groups to inspect cargo for trade violations, particularly when the instructions are mandatory. CBP officers have discretion to inspect cargo that is characterized as nonmandatory, which may be helpful in gaining new information about potential trade violations according to CBP officers. However, according to CBP, with staffing shortages of CBP officers, some CBP officers told us that they focus their efforts on addressing the mandatory inspections and may not be able to conduct any additional inspections, contributing to missed opportunities for assessing risk. Shortfalls in CBP officers may also lead to reassigning CBP officers during high periods of traffic volume, as we found in a 2013 report. In 2013, at three of the six land borders visited, CBP field and port officials reported to us that CBP had insufficient staff to process cargo arriving by commercial vehicles. As a result, CBP had to reduce the number of CBP officers assigned to secondary inspection to open up additional primary inspection lanes for commercial traffic. We reported that staffing shortages were caused in part by budget constraints and time needed to train and assign new CBP officers. In addition, during our port visits, some CBP officers told us that they were pulled from trade functions, such as examining air consignment cargo, to temporarily fill shortages of CBP officers needed to screen air passenger traffic, particularly during the holidays and summer. CBP faces a number of challenges to hiring staff for trade-related positions, such as other hiring priorities and limited numbers of staff focused on hiring for trade positions, according to CBP officials we met with. Some of the hiring challenges identified by CBP officials we met with include the following: Hiring priorities focused on security positions. CBP has focused on hiring staff for security positions, such as border patrol agents and CBP officers, and hiring for trade positions is not an agency-wide priority. Furthermore, trade positions with mandated staffing levels, such as import specialists, have not been hiring priorities. Limited numbers of staff focused on hiring trade positions. CBP’s hiring centers have limited numbers of staff dedicated to hiring for trade positions. As a result, they have a backlog in hiring for trade positions. Lengthy hiring process. Filling trade positions within the Office of Trade and the Office of Field Operations is a lengthy process. Potential candidates tend to drop out because of the time it takes to process an applicant. All positions require lengthy background investigations, and some positions, such as CBP officers, require a polygraph and additional clearances, which can take a long time. Location-based issues. Some positions, such as customs auditor, are harder to fill because other government agencies or the private sector are competing for the same pool of applicants with specialized knowledge, or because the positions are in locations that are less desirable for applicants. CBP does not offer incentives to recruit potential candidates for mandated trade positions, according to CBP officials. CBP has not articulated how it plans to address gaps in staffing for most of its trade positions. While CBP has established targets, it has not articulated a plan to attain those numbers or how budgetary constraints, if any, impact its ability to meet staffing levels. Leading practices in human capital management indicate that agencies, through strategic workforce planning, should address developing long-term strategies for acquiring, developing, and retaining staff to achieve programmatic goals. Specifically, leading practices suggest that agencies have a plan to identify strategies for recruiting staff that includes customized strategies to recruit highly specialized and hard-to-fill positions. Such a plan would help CBP to ensure that it meets its staffing targets for trade positions, particularly those positions where it has not met its mandated staffing levels for a number of years. However, we found that CBP has not developed such a plan and, during the course of our audit, we found that it generally conducts hiring for trade positions on an ad hoc basis. For example, officials from the Office of Field Operations told us that CBP hired for import specialist positions, as well as most other trade positions, on an as-needed basis based on requests coming from specific port locations. Officials from the Office of Field Operations told us that they are planning to take some actions to meet its staffing targets for trade positions. In December 2016, these officials said that CBP would post general import specialist job announcements starting in December 2016 and renew the announcements as necessary throughout fiscal year 2017. CBP officials indicated in March 2017 that several announcements were posted in late December and that there were over 4,000 applicants for the external announcement pertaining to general import specialist. These officials also stated that CBP plans to track and facilitate the Office of Field Operations’ progress toward selecting a sufficient number of applicants by June 2017 to fill all import specialist vacancies, but made no mention of recruiting or retention strategies in general or in hard-to-fill locations. In addition, in February 2017, officials from the Office of Trade told us that they are planning to create a hiring plan for customs auditors and are seeking incentives, but did not provide any time frames. As an agency tasked with collecting revenue and identifying harmful and noncompliant imports, such as counterfeit products and goods that are misclassified to evade duties, CBP needs to ensure that it effectively enforces U.S. customs and trade laws while at the same time facilitating legitimate trade. In 2015, CBP officials processed more than $2.4 trillion in imports through more than 300 ports of entry and collected around $46 billion in revenue, making CBP the second-largest revenue collection agency in the United States. In 2016, Congress passed the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act, which codified the establishment of CBP and highlighted the numerous units within CBP’s Office of Trade and Office of Field Operations that play a critical role in CBP’s trade enforcement process. CBP’s strategic and annual plans for its Priority Trade Issues are intended to help focus the agency’s actions and resources on high-risk issues and direct its trade facilitation and enforcement approach. These plans identify goals and contain some performance measures. However, these plans generally lack performance targets, contrary to leading management practices. Without performance targets, CBP cannot assess its actual performance against planned performance or the effectiveness of its trade enforcement activities. Congress passed the Homeland Security Act of 2002, directing CBP to maintain, among other things, a minimum level of staff and associated support staff in certain customs revenue functions. In 2006, Congress directed CBP in the SAFE Port Act to prepare a resource model to determine the optimal staffing levels that are required to carry out commercial operations, including inspection and release of cargo and the revenue collection and trade functions described in section 412(b) of the Homeland Security Act. In its model, CBP outlined optimal staffing levels for 15 positions needed to perform trade functions and adequately staff Priority Trade Issues; 9 of the 15 are congressionally mandated trade positions. Our analysis of CBP staffing data over the past 5 fiscal years shows that CBP has generally not reached the optimal and mandated staffing levels for some of the 15 trade positions that carry out trade enforcement and protect revenue, such as import specialists, CBP officers, and customs auditors. CBP officials cited several challenges to filling staffing gaps, including that hiring for trade positions is not an agency-wide priority. Contrary to leading practices in human capital management, CBP has not articulated how it plans to reach its staffing targets for trade positions over the long term. Without adequate numbers of staff to carry out its numerous trade enforcement activities, CBP faces challenges to effectively carrying out its mandated mission to enforce U.S. trade laws. To strengthen CBP’s trade enforcement efforts, we recommend that the Commissioner of CBP direct relevant CBP units to take the following two actions: The Office of Trade should include performance targets, when applicable, in addition to performance measures in its Priority Trade Issue strategic and annual plans. The Office of Trade and the Office of Field Operations should develop a long-term hiring plan that articulates how CBP will reach its staffing targets for trade positions set in the Homeland Security Act and the agency’s resource optimization model. We provided a draft of this report for review and comment to CBP and ICE. CBP provided technical comments for the sensitive but unclassified version of the report, which we also incorporated in this report, as appropriate. ICE also provided technical comments on this report, which we incorporated, as appropriate. CBP provided formal agency comments, which are reproduced in appendix V. In its comments, CBP concurred with both of our recommendations and identified actions it intends to take in response to the recommendations. In response to our first recommendation, CBP indicated that it will work to identify applicable performance measures with performance targets to include in the fiscal year 2018 annual and strategic plans for its Priority Trade Issues. In response to our second recommendation, CBP indicated that the Office of Trade and the Office of Field Operations will partner with the Office of Human Resources Management to identify stakeholders and define challenges that have resulted in hiring gaps in trade-related positions and to develop a long-term hiring and resource plan. We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional committees, the Acting Commissioner of CBP, and the Acting Director of ICE. In addition, the report is available at no charge on the GAO website at http://www.gao.gov. If you or your staff have any questions about this report, please contact me at (202) 512-8612 or GianopoulosK@gao.gov. Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. GAO staff who made key contributions to this report are listed in appendix VI. We identified a total of 24 reports issued between fiscal years 2011 and 2016 that are related to trade enforcement and contain recommendations to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) or U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). Nine of these reports were audits conducted by GAO, while 13 were audits and 2 were inspections conducted by the DHS Office of Inspector General (OIG). This appendix provides an overview of key findings and relevant recommendations from these reports, as well as the status of actions taken to implement the recommendations. We identified nine GAO audits, issued between fiscal years 2011 and 2016 and related to trade enforcement, that have recommendations to DHS or CBP. Of the nine audits, two reviewed antidumping and countervailing (AD/CV) duties; three reviewed targeting; two reviewed other topics; and two reviewed the agricultural quarantine inspection (AQI) program, a program that guards against harmful agricultural pests and diseases by inspecting imported agricultural goods, products, passenger baggage, and vehicles at ports of entry. Table 7 lists the nine GAO audits. These nine GAO audits contain a total of 46 recommendations, 33 of which concern trade enforcement and are addressed to DHS or CBP. Topics of these 33 recommendations fall into four general categories: AD/CV duties, agriculture (specifically the AQI program), targeting and cargo examination, and other (see fig. 10 for a breakdown of recommendations by topic). Some of these 33 GAO recommendations address weaknesses concerning adequate data reliability, guidance, or performance measures as they relate to the four topics. Recommendations for addressing data reliability include, among other things: improving the reliability of AQI data on arrivals, inspections, and interceptions across ports; developing a better national estimate of compliance with maritime cargo targeting policies by calculating compliance rate differently; and developing an enhanced methodology for selecting samples to check compliance with policies on examining high-risk shipments. Recommendations for addressing guidance include, among other things: revising guidance to include how targeters are to correctly enter data in targeting systems; updating guidance on how ports are to conduct work studies to determine the correct allocation of staff time; and updating guidance with requirements to establish time frames for issuing trade alerts for exclusion orders, which are notices that the International Trade Commission (ITC) issues to not allow certain imports that infringe upon certain intellectual property rights or other unfair import practices into the United States. Recommendations for addressing performance measures include, among other things: reviewing performance against established time frames; and identifying performance measures for monitoring effectiveness in targeting, AD/CV duty collection, and protecting U.S. agriculture from introduction of foreign pests and disease. In the nine reports issued between fiscal years 2011 and 2016, GAO made 33 recommendations to DHS or CBP, of which 24 have been closed as implemented, and 9 remain open (see table 8 for the status of GAO’s open recommendations, as of October 2016). Most of the open recommendations come from two GAO reports. Three of the nine open recommendations are found in GAO’s July 2016 report on $2.3 billion in unpaid AD/CV duty bills. In addition, another three open recommendations are found in GAO’s July 2013 report on U.S.-Mexico border wait times. This report on U.S.-Mexico border wait times stated that CBP’s Office of Field Operations (OFO) could help CBP better ensure that scarce staff resources are effectively allocated to fulfill mission needs across ports by improving transparency, that is, documenting the methodology and process OFO uses to allocate staff to land ports of entry on the southwest border. We identified 15 reports, which include 13 audits and two inspections issued between fiscal years 2011 and 2016 by DHS OIG related to trade enforcement that have recommendations to DHS or CBP. Six of the DHS OIG audits were independent auditors’ reports on CBP’s financial statements. Of the remaining nine reports, three reviewed targeting and cargo examinations, and the other six each reviewed different topics: the bonding process; the Office of Regulatory Audit; the penalty process; the workload staffing model; bonded facilities; and the Automated Commercial Environment, the central trade data collection system used for, among other things, receiving users’ standard data and other relevant documentation required for the release of imported cargo. See table 9 for a list of these DHS OIG reports. The 15 DHS OIG audits and inspections contain a total of 142 recommendations, 103 of which pertain to trade enforcement and are addressed to DHS or CBP. Eighty-five of these 103 recommendations originate from the six independent auditors’ reports on CBP’s financial statements and cover recurring topics. Topics of the recommendations fall into 11 general categories. For a breakdown of DHS OIG recommendations by topic, see figure 11. Some of these 103 DHS OIG recommendations addressed weaknesses concerning guidance or strategy or procedures, as they relate to the 11 topics. Recommendations addressing guidance include, among other things, providing guidance to ports and field offices to ensure that employees resolve reports during the in-bond process, review bonded warehouses and foreign trade zones facilities, and use the correct targeting criteria for rail shipments. Recommendations addressing strategy and procedures, among other things, include establishing written procedures or conducting assessment for developing, changing, and using the Workload Staffing Model, an Excel spreadsheet-based model that CBP uses to identify staffing needs for CBP officers at ports of entry; and determining whether resources are appropriately allocated to ensure effective penalty case management at Fines, Penalties and Forfeitures field offices. Of the 103 DHS OIG recommendations pertaining to trade enforcement and addressed to DHS or CBP, 85 have been closed and 18 remain open (see table 10 for a list of DHS OIG reports with open recommendations and their status as of October 24, 2016). DHS OIG officials report that the agency concurred with these open and closed recommendations. The 18 open recommendations originate from five reports. In one particular report, the independent public accounting firm KPMG LLP (KMPG) recommended that CBP implement additional training at ports and/or additional oversight controls to ensure that risk assessments for bonded warehouses and foreign trade zones (FTZ) are consistently performed in accordance with required guidelines. KMPG had found that CBP was unable to provide evidence of completing compliance reviews to support the assessed risk level for certain bonded warehouses and FTZ reviews, and improperly recorded the risk level of an FTZ based on the compliance review that was conducted. KMPG found that the problem was that CBP personnel did not consistently adhere to bonded warehouses’ and FTZs’ policies and procedures for completing compliance reviews. These conditions increased the risk that imported goods awaiting entry into commerce may not be secure, which could result in a loss of revenue. KMPG also recommended that CBP implement additional training at port locations on tracking in-bond entries for compliance. An in-bond entry allows for the movement of cargo through the United States without payment of duty or appraisement prior to entry into either domestic commerce or exportation to a foreign country, and CBP oversees in-bond compliance using the In-Bond Compliance Module. However, KMPG found that port personnel did not have a clear understanding of how to operate the compliance module, which, according to OIG-15-76, may result in missed opportunities for CBP to assess fines and penalties and collect the associated revenues. This report examines (1) U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s (CBP) structure for carrying out trade enforcement, (2) how CBP conducts trade enforcement across its high-risk issue areas and ensures that its enforcement activities are effective, and (3) the extent to which CBP meets its staffing needs for trade enforcement. We also provide information on audits related to CBP’s trade enforcement and the implementation status of any recommendations made in such audits. To examine CBP’s structure for carrying out trade enforcement, we reviewed organizational documents for CBP, specifically for the Office of Trade and the Office of Field Operations. We also spoke with CBP officials in headquarters representing directorates and branches that have a trade enforcement component within CBP to better understand their role and organizational structure. We interviewed CBP officials in the field who carry out trade enforcement to learn about their roles and responsibilities. The trade enforcement staff we spoke to in the field include the following positions: Customs and Border Protection officer; entry specialist; import specialist; national account manager; drawback specialist; customs auditor; international trade specialist; agriculture specialist; paralegal specialist; Fines, Penalties and Forfeitures specialist; and seized property specialist. We also interviewed officials at all 10 Centers of Excellence and Expertise (Centers) and asked most Centers questions pertaining to the Center’s organizational structure and resources, the benefits of having Centers, and any challenges that they have faced since the Centers became operational. To examine how CBP conducts trade enforcement across its high-risk issue areas and ensures that its enforcement activities are effective, we reviewed CBP documents pertaining to trade enforcement and Priority Trade Issues, as well as planning documents. We interviewed CBP officials who set policy and conduct enforcement activities for Priority Trade Issues in headquarters as well as CBP officials in the field who carry out trade enforcement activities. Specifically, we met with officials representing units within the Office of Trade and the Office of Field Operations: National Targeting Center; Regulatory Audit; Fines, Penalties and Forfeitures Office; and Trade Operations Division. We also spoke with CBP officials representing every National Targeting and Analysis Group and the Commercial Targeting and Analysis Center to learn about their role in trade enforcement by Priority Trade Issue and to understand their coordination with other units within CBP. We visited CBP ports and field offices in Baltimore, Maryland; Los Angeles/Long Beach, California; and New York, New York to observe trade enforcement activities and interviewed CBP officials located at the sea and air ports. We visited an international mail facility at John F. Kennedy airport to learn about trade enforcement in the mail environment and observed cargo being inspected at a DHL facility at the Los Angeles airport. We selected the CBP ports and field offices to visit based on a number of factors, including the volume of imports coming through the ports, the number of relevant trade enforcement-related units at the port, the port environment (locations with cargo arriving by air, sea, and through international mail), and the proximity of the port to our location. We interviewed officials at all 10 Centers of Excellence and Expertise and asked questions pertaining to the Centers’ coordination within and outside of CBP, strategy, and data collection. We did not visit and observe any land ports of entry because of limited time frames. However, during our interviews, CBP officials discussed trade enforcement processing and other activities that occur at the land borders. We spoke with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) officials in Washington, D.C., and in New York to learn about ICE and HSI’s role in trade enforcement as well as to understand how HSI coordinates with various CBP components. We requested copies of CBP’s strategic or annual plans for each of the seven Priority Trade Issues. We initially received three plans, one of which was current and two that were outdated but still being used by CBP. In addition, in February 2017 we received seven Priority Trade Issue plans, of which one was final and six were still in draft form. We reviewed and compared all plans we received against leading practices for managing results, specifically those focused on performance planning. These leading practices noted that a plan should identify goals and measures covering each of its program activities and contain targets to assess progress toward performance goals. To examine the extent to which CBP meets its staffing needs for trade enforcement, we reviewed CBP documents and reports related to trade enforcement positions and staff levels, such as CBP’s Resource Optimization Model. We obtained information on trade enforcement staffing, budgeting, hiring process, and any challenges to hiring trade staff by interviewing officials from the Office of Trade’s Resource Management Division, the Office of Field Operations’ Human Capital and Budget offices, the Enterprise Services’ Finance division, and the Minneapolis Hiring Center. We also spoke to CBP officials in the field about the impact of staffing shortfalls and challenges to meeting optimal staffing levels. We requested copies of CBP staffing plans or strategies related to trade enforcement positions and discussed with CBP officials whether they had any hiring plans for trade positions. We reviewed leading practices in human capital management, which indicated that agencies, through strategic workforce planning, should address developing long-term strategies for acquiring, developing, and retaining staff to achieve programmatic goals. We requested staffing data covering fiscal years 2012-2016 for the trade positions that carry out trade functions identified in CBP’s Resource Optimization Model. Nine of the 15 trade positions were mandated in the Homeland Security Act. To identify positions with staffing shortfalls, we compared actual staffing data for the nine mandated trade positions against the minimum staffing levels set in the Homeland Security Act. In addition, we compared actual staffing data for fiscal years 2015 and 2016 to the optimal staffing levels identified in CBP’s Resource Optimization Model. Although the Homeland Security Act also required CBP to maintain minimum staffing levels for the associated support staff for the nine mandated trade positions, we did not assess CBP’s ability to meet these staffing targets because CBP officials could not provide any information on these positions or the staffing levels in response to our request for data. To identify staffing shortfalls for the model’s six nonmandated trade positions, we compared the actual staffing data CBP reported for these positions in October 2014 against optimal staffing levels identified in the Resource Optimization Model. While we asked for the percentage of time spent on trade functions performed by staff in the six nonmandated trade positions for fiscal years 2012-2016, CBP was able to report data only for the end of fiscal year 2014 because it does not track the actual staffing levels for these positions on an annual basis. We did not independently assess and validate the optimal staffing models’ ranges. To assess the reliability of the actual staffing levels reported by CBP, as of October 2014, for the six nonmandated trade positions we compared and corroborated staffing information provided in CBP reporting and spoke to CBP officials regarding the methodology used to determine the actual staffing levels for these positions. On the basis of the checks we performed, we determined these data to be sufficiently reliable for the purposes of indicating the staffing levels for the nonmandated positions. To assess the reliability of the staffing data for fiscal years 2012-2016 for the nine mandated trade positions, we compared and corroborated information provided by CBP with staffing information in the Congressional Budget Justifications for that time period and spoke to CBP officials regarding the processes they used to collect and verify the staffing data. On the basis of the checks we performed, we determined these data to be sufficiently reliable for the purposes of comparing actual to mandated staffing levels.\n\n### Summary:", "answer": "In fiscal year 2015, CBP processed more than $2.4 trillion in imports through more than 300 ports of entry, collecting around $46 billion in revenue. CBP facilitates legitimate trade coming into the United States and enforces U.S. trade laws. CBP is tasked with collecting revenue and identifying harmful and noncompliant imports, such as counterfeit goods and goods that evade duties. In February 2016, Congress passed an Act that included a provision for GAO to review the effectiveness of CBP's trade enforcement activities. In this report, GAO examines (1) CBP's structure for carrying out trade enforcement , (2) how CBP conducts trade enforcement across its high-risk issue areas and ensures that its enforcement activities are effective, and (3) the extent to which CBP meets its staffing needs for trade enforcement. GAO reviewed agency documents, interviewed agency officials, and conducted field work at ports in Baltimore, Maryland; Los Angeles/Long Beach, California; and New York, New York. GAO selected ports to visit based on factors including volume of imports and number of trade enforcement units at each port. Two offices within U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) enforce U.S. trade laws and protect revenue. The Office of Trade develops policies to guide CBP's trade enforcement efforts, while the Office of Field Operations conducts a range of trade processing and enforcement activities at U.S. ports. CBP's previously port-centric approach to trade enforcement has shifted to a national-level, industry-focused approach with the establishment of the Office of Field Operations' 10 Centers of Excellence and Expertise. These Centers represent a shift in trade operations, centralizing the processing of certain imported goods on a national scale through a single Center rather than individual ports of entry. CBP conducts trade enforcement across seven high-risk issue areas using a risk-based approach, but its plans generally lack performance targets that would enable it to assess the effectiveness of its enforcement activities. Violations in the high-risk issue areas can cause significant revenue loss, harm the U.S. economy, or threaten the health and safety of the American people. CBP's trade enforcement activities reduce risk of noncompliance and focus efforts on high-risk imports, according to CBP. For example, CBP conducts targeting of goods, conducts audits and verifications of importers, seizes prohibited goods, collects duties, and assesses penalties. However, CBP cannot assess the effectiveness of its activities without developing performance targets as suggested by leading practices for managing for results. Over the past 5 fiscal years, CBP generally has not met the minimum staffing levels set by Congress for four of nine positions that perform customs revenue functions, and it generally has not met the optimal staffing level targets identified by the agency for these positions. Staffing shortfalls can impact CBP's ability to enforce trade effectively, for example, by leading to reduced compliance audits and decreased cargo inspections, according to CBP officials. CBP cited several challenges to filling staffing gaps, including that hiring for trade positions is not an agency-wide priority. Contrary to leading practices in human capital management, CBP has not articulated how it plans to reach its staffing targets for trade positions over the long term, generally conducting its hiring on an ad hoc basis. This is a public version of a sensitive but unclassified report that GAO issued in April 2017. Information that CBP deemed sensitive has been redacted. To strengthen its trade enforcement efforts, CBP should (1) include performance targets in its plans covering high-risk issue areas, and (2) develop a long-term hiring plan specific to trade positions that articulates how it will reach its staffing targets. CBP concurred with both recommendations."}

To perform a diagnostic ultrasound exam, a sonographer applies a hand-held medical device called a transducer to the skin through which the ultrasound machine emits and receives sound waves. As the sonographer moves the transducer around the patient’s body, an image of the various organs or blood flow under study appears on a monitor. The sonographer electronically stores what he or she considers as the most diagnostically useful images. The ultrasound systems that sonographers use differ along multiple dimensions, including their types of transducers, documentation capabilities, and cost. The type and number of transducers on a given ultrasound system depend on the parts of the body to be examined and the conditions intended to be diagnosed. In addition, some ultrasound systems have additional documentation capability, which allows sonographers and other health care personnel to electronically transmit and display ultrasound images. According to the ultrasound device manufacturers with whom we spoke, an ultrasound machine can range in price from $20,000 to $200,000 or more. Prices are partially based on the system’s features, such as the number and type of different transducers it has and its capacity to store and transmit data. Sonographers can demonstrate that they have the appropriate level of training and experience by becoming credentialed by a nationally recognized organization. The American Registry for Diagnostic Medical Sonography (ARDMS) and Cardiovascular Credentialing International (CCI) are two main sonographer credentialing organizations. Each organization has multiple pathways to becoming credentialed that are designed to account for differences in sonographers’ training and experience. CCI allows sonographers without formal education, but with experience in the field, to take its credentialing exam, but ARDMS requires that all sonographers have a combination of education and experience to take its exam. Sonographers can obtain formal training through numerous education programs. For example, the Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs lists 151 programs for diagnostic medical sonographers, including associate’s degree programs from community colleges as well as bachelor’s degree programs. Individuals we spoke with from ultrasound-related professional organizations noted that, although sonographers are more likely than in the past to undergo formal training, there are still practicing sonographers who do not have it. Several organizations offer accreditation for facilities that conduct ultrasound procedures as a way to demonstrate that they meet the standards necessary to perform quality exams. To work in an accredited facility, sonographers may be required to have certain credentials or have received a minimum number of training hours. For example, sonographers working in facilities that are accredited by the Intersocietal Commission for the Accreditation of Vascular Laboratories (ICAVL) must either be credentialed or have a specified level of training and experience in sonography. Similarly, for a facility to become accredited by the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine (AIUM), the sonographers who work there must either be credentialed by ARDMS or become credentialed before re-accreditation, which occurs every 3 years. This allows new sonographers to obtain experience conducting exams, which they need to be eligible to take a credentialing exam, such as from ARDMS and CCI. In addition to requirements for sonographers, accreditation can address broader aspects of ultrasound procedures, including qualification requirements for physicians, the condition of the ultrasound equipment, patient safety, images produced, and documentation. Medicare is the federally financed health insurance program for persons age 65 and older and certain individuals with disabilities. The program serves over 42 million beneficiaries. Eligible individuals are automatically covered by Part A, which helps pay for inpatient hospital, skilled nursing facility, and hospice care, as well as some home health care. Most eligible individuals elect to pay a monthly premium to obtain Medicare Part B coverage, which covers physician services, hospital outpatient services, and certain other services, such as physical therapy. In addition to the premium, beneficiaries are required to pay an annual Part B deductible as well as coinsurance of 20 percent for most Part B services. Medicare covers items or services that are provided for by statute and that meet the applicable criteria for coverage when furnished to a particular beneficiary. Decisions on the extent to which, and under what circumstances, Medicare will cover specific services, procedures, or technologies may be made by CMS or its contractors in a number of ways. At the national level, CMS can make National Coverage Determinations (NCD) that apply across the country. More typically, most coverage issues are decided on the local level through Local Coverage Determinations (LCD) or other decisions made by the contractors that pay Medicare claims. For Part B claims for physician services, the contractors that pay claims and create LCDs are generally called carriers. If an NCD or other authority does not provide specific guidance about the conditions for covering a service, procedure, or technology, the carrier has the discretion to adopt an LCD to address the issue. LCDs only apply to a carrier’s service area or to the providers it serves. Medicare covers physicians’ interpretations of ultrasound and other imaging exams under Part B for all beneficiaries. For beneficiaries, except for those in a Part A-covered hospital or SNF stay, Medicare also provides Part B coverage of ultrasound and other imaging exams as well as medically necessary ambulance transportation. How Medicare pays for ultrasound exams and associated ambulance transportation for beneficiaries in a SNF depends on whether Medicare covers the stay under Part A. For beneficiaries in Part A-covered SNF stays, Medicare bundles payment for one part of the ultrasound procedure—the exam—as well as associated ambulance transportation into the daily Part A PPS payment. When beneficiaries remain in a SNF after exhausting their Part A SNF benefits or if the SNF stay is not covered for some other reason, they are in a “noncovered” SNF stay during which Medicare covers ultrasound exams and medically necessary ambulance transportation under Part B. Although nearly all Medicare services provided to beneficiaries in Part A- covered SNF stays are paid through the Part A PPS payment, certain services are paid for separately under Part B. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) excluded from the Part A PPS payment all physician services for beneficiaries in Part A-covered SNF stays, which include interpretations of ultrasound and other imaging exams, and provides for separate payments for these services under Part B. In addition, certain categories of services—for example, the exam for computed tomography (CT) scans, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and angiography—are excluded from the Part A PPS payment and are paid for separately under Part B when provided in a hospital outpatient setting. CMS identified these services as ones that “lie well beyond the scope of care that SNFs would ordinarily furnish.” (See table 1.) One of our previous reports noted that CMS considered the possibility of paying separately for certain ultrasound exams and associated ambulance transportation but decided not to do so because they did not meet the criteria used to identify such services. Legend: ● = bundled into SNF PPS payment; ○ = paid separately under Part B Medically necessary ambulance transportation is paid for separately from the PPS payment under Part B when associated with dialysis and with the following services if provided in a hospital outpatient department: cardiac catheterization, MRI, CT scan, certain ambulatory surgery procedures, emergency services, radiation therapy, angiography, and lymphatic and venous procedures. See CMS, Skilled Nursing Facility Consolidated Billing as it Relates to Ambulance Services, MLN Matters No. SE0433 (2005). Medicare does not make separate Part B payments to transport ultrasound equipment to a home or SNF for an exam. The transportation of the ultrasound equipment and sonographer is considered to be bundled into the ultrasound exam payment. However, Medicare does make separate Part B payments for the transportation and set-up of equipment used to conduct diagnostic X-ray exams. Policy concerning payment for the transportation of ultrasound equipment has changed over time. Prior to 1996, CMS did not have a national policy concerning the transportation of ultrasound equipment, but some of its carriers developed their own policies to cover it. In 1995, carriers for 14 states and the northern part of California had a policy to reimburse providers for additional transportation costs associated with providing mobile ultrasound exams, as they did for mobile X-ray exams, which is another type of imaging service. However, beginning January 1, 1996, CMS determined that the statutory provision that provided coverage for the transportation of portable X-ray equipment did not provide this coverage for diagnostic ultrasounds and, therefore, carriers could no longer make separate Part B payments for the transportation of ultrasound equipment. Echocardiograms and noninvasive vascular procedures accounted for about three-fourths of the approximately 41 million ultrasound procedures provided to Medicare beneficiaries in 2005 in any setting. Nearly all of the ultrasound exams paid under Part B were performed in physician offices and hospital outpatient departments. The remaining 1 percent were conducted in various sites of service, including SNFs and beneficiaries’ homes. Among the exams provided in SNFs to beneficiaries in noncovered SNF stays, noninvasive vascular studies were the most prevalent, followed by echocardiograms. Echocardiograms, used to diagnose heart conditions, and noninvasive vascular studies, often used to diagnose blood clots, were the most common diagnostic ultrasound procedures provided to Medicare beneficiaries in 2005. (See fig. 1.) Specifically, of the 41 million total procedures provided to nearly 12.4 million beneficiaries in 2005 in any site of service, the following apply. Echocardiograms were the most frequently performed type of ultrasound, accounting for about 53 percent of the total number of procedures and 49 percent of Medicare Part B payments. Echocardiograms are commonly used to diagnose medical conditions such as heart failure, problems with the innermost layer of the heart or the respiratory system, and disorders of the heart rate. Noninvasive vascular studies represented about 20 percent of ultrasound procedures provided to beneficiaries and 30 percent of Medicare Part B payments for ultrasounds. Among other conditions, noninvasive vascular ultrasounds are used to monitor the blood flow through veins and arteries and to detect blockage, or blood clots. They are frequently used to diagnose deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Ultrasounds of the abdomen and pelvis accounted for about 12 percent of the ultrasound procedures and 10 percent of Medicare Part B payments for ultrasounds. Abdominal ultrasounds are commonly used to identify disorders of the kidney and ureter, tumors, and disorders of the urinary tract. Ultrasounds of the head, neck, chest, and other ultrasound procedures, accounted for about 11 percent of the total number of Medicare ultrasound procedures and 7 percent of Part B Medicare payments. Cataracts and disorders of the breast were among the top medical conditions diagnosed with these procedures. Ultrasound guidance procedures accounted for the remaining share— about 3 percent of the number of procedures and Part B Medicare payments. Ultrasound guidance is used, for example, to direct the placement of a needle to withdraw fluid from the membrane surrounding the heart or lungs or to guide the performance of breast, liver, and prostate biopsies. Some of these ultrasound procedures require the attendance of a physician in the room during the performance of the procedure. (In appendix II, see table 4 for details on the level of physician supervision required for different types of procedures and table 5 for the top five medical conditions diagnosed by type of procedure.) Our analysis of the available site-of-service data showed that nearly all (99 percent) of the 28 million ultrasound exams provided to beneficiaries under Part B in 2005 were performed in physician offices and hospital outpatient departments—68 percent and 31 percent, respectively. The remaining 1 percent (about 387,000 exams) were conducted in various sites of service, including SNFs and beneficiaries’ homes. Of the 28 million ultrasound exams provided to Medicare beneficiaries under Part B, about 129,000 were conducted in SNFs for beneficiaries in noncovered SNF stays and about 101,000 were conducted in beneficiaries’ homes. Of the 129,000 ultrasound exams conducted in SNFs for beneficiaries in noncovered SNF stays, noninvasive vascular procedures were the most common, accounting for 53 percent of the exams and 68 percent of the Medicare Part B payments. The noninvasive vascular procedures were used to diagnose conditions such as disorders of the soft tissues, skin conditions, and deep vein thrombosis. Echocardiograms were the second most frequently performed ultrasound exam in SNFs for beneficiaries in noncovered SNF stays, representing 22 percent of the procedures and 20 percent of Part B Medicare payments. Ultrasounds of the abdomen or pelvis were also common among this population, accounting for about 17 percent of the ultrasound procedures and 10 percent of Medicare Part B payments. The remaining 8 percent of the procedures and 2 percent of Part B Medicare payments were for various other categories, including head, neck, and chest. Only 5 ultrasound guidance procedures were conducted in SNFs for this population in 2005. (See fig. 2 and table 6 in app. II, which shows the top 5 medical conditions diagnosed by type of procedure provided to beneficiaries in noncovered SNF stays.) Data limitations did not allow us to examine the site of service for approximately 262,000 ultrasound procedures provided to beneficiaries in Part A-covered SNF stays, but our analysis of the types of procedures these beneficiaries received shows similar results to those provided in SNFs during noncovered stays. Because of congressional interest in the quality of ultrasound services, and particularly those conducted in SNFs, we examined clinical considerations associated with the site where exams were performed. Our literature search produced no pertinent studies on clinical issues associated with transporting elderly patients to obtain ultrasound exams as opposed to providing mobile services in SNFs or beneficiaries’ homes. Our analysis of CMS’s 2005 data on the level of physician supervision required to perform ultrasound procedures indicates that about 90 percent of them did not require a physician to be present. Thus, having a sonographer provide these procedures could be appropriate for mobile services provided in a SNF or home even if a physician was not present. Representatives from nationally recognized professional organizations, including professionals in the fields of geriatrics and sonography, as well as ultrasound providers and long-term care provider organizations, provided their views on clinical considerations associated with transporting elderly patients to obtain an ultrasound or providing an ultrasound in a SNF. In general, they said that the risks and benefits depend on the patient’s condition—such as whether the beneficiary requires emergency care, the most appropriate setting for follow-up care, and the type of ultrasound services provided. For example, there are risks in transporting elderly patients, particularly those with certain medical conditions including dementia, who can become disoriented in new surroundings. Some geriatricians, medical directors of SNFs, and long- term care providers said that moving patients could increase their risk of falls or fractures. A gerontologist and a geriatrician further noted that pain is a major issue to consider in caring for frail, bedridden patients. Transporting patients with deep vein thrombosis and pressure sores may expose them to skin tears and pain. On the other hand, certain ultrasound exams may be best performed in hospitals or physician offices, according to organization representatives that we contacted. For example, some beneficiaries may require emergency care, and therefore require hospitalization. Others who need ultrasound exams may have conditions that involve risks of serious complications that could require surgical or other interventions more readily provided in a hospital. In addition, a hospital or physician’s office may be the best setting for certain types of procedures, such as ultrasound guidance for needle placement during biopsies, which requires the presence of a physician during the performance of the procedure. We addressed two potential changes to Medicare payment methods related to ultrasound procedures, both of which are likely to increase Medicare expenditures and beneficiary cost sharing. The first potential change we addressed, which would involve paying to transport equipment to SNFs during noncovered SNF stays for ultrasound exams, could have increased Medicare expenditures by an estimated $9.8 million and beneficiary cost sharing by an estimated $2.6 million in 2005, assuming that this policy change would not affect the number and location of exams provided. The second potential change in Medicare payment methods involves paying separately under Part B for ultrasound exams and associated equipment and ambulance transportation during Part A- covered SNF stays, as opposed to bundling payments for these services as is done now. We found that paying separately under Part B for these services could have increased Part B Medicare payments by an estimated $22.0 million and beneficiary cost sharing by an estimated $13.4 million in 2005, assuming no change in the number of services provided as a result of this policy. However, because these revised payment policies could affect the use of these services, the actual financial impacts could differ from our estimates. For instance, paying separately under Part B for ultrasound exams and associated equipment and ambulance transportation during Part A-covered SNF stays could cause the use of these services to grow because the PPS incentive to provide services efficiently would be absent, so the actual impact of this policy could exceed our estimates. Further, unless these separate Part B payments were offset by a reduction in the Part A PPS payment, they would increase overall Medicare expenditures. Paying to transport ultrasound equipment for the 129,000 exams done in SNFs during noncovered SNF stays in 2005 could have increased Medicare expenditures by an estimated $9.8 million and beneficiary cost sharing by an estimated $2.6 million, assuming the number and location of exams would not have changed in response to this policy. If this policy also applied to mobile exams conducted in other sites of service, the financial impact could be greater. For example, if Medicare made separate Part B payments to transport ultrasound equipment to beneficiaries’ homes, as is the case for the transportation of portable X-ray equipment, the financial impact could be higher by about $4.4 million for Medicare expenditures and $1.2 million higher for beneficiary cost sharing. Similarly, paying to transport ultrasound equipment to custodial care and assisted living facilities could have increased the financial impact of this policy further (see table 2). The actual financial impact of paying to transport ultrasound equipment to SNFs would differ from our estimates if this policy caused the number of mobile exams provided to increase or decrease, but this would not affect our determination that this policy would likely lead to higher Medicare expenditures and beneficiary cost sharing. The mobile providers we spoke with noted that Medicare payments to transport ultrasound equipment would allow them to expand their service area and thus could increase the number of exams they provide. For example, one provider noted that transportation payments might allow it to serve beneficiaries in rural areas where doing so would have proved cost prohibitive before. Thus, payments to transport ultrasound equipment could potentially increase the number of mobile exams and provide more beneficiaries with access to these services. Increasing access to mobile ultrasound exams could possibly lessen the need for ambulance services to transport beneficiaries from a SNF to another location for an ultrasound exam, which could in turn reduce the financial impact of this policy. Mobile providers stressed that Medicare and its beneficiaries save money when beneficiaries in SNF stays receive mobile exams in a SNF as opposed to being transported to another location, in part because payments and beneficiary cost sharing to transport ultrasound equipment are less than for an ambulance round trip. We identified about 13,900 exams that potentially could have been conducted in a SNF during a noncovered SNF stay rather than using ambulance transportation to travel to another location for the exam. If the increased availability of mobile exams allowed all of these 13,900 exams to be conducted in a SNF rather than in the locations (such as a hospital outpatient facility) where they actually took place, the financial impact of this policy would have been about $3.0 million lower for Medicare expenditures and about $1.2 million lower for beneficiary cost sharing. However, if mobile providers increased the number of ultrasound exams conducted in SNFs and other locations, it is also possible that this increase could lead to larger than estimated increases in Medicare expenditures and beneficiary cost sharing. Some of the exams conducted for beneficiaries in noncovered SNF stays likely were conducted in other sites of service (for example, physicians’ offices or hospital outpatient departments) but did not involve Medicare-covered ambulance services to transport the beneficiary there. If mobile providers furnished more ultrasound exams in SNFs by expanding their service area, some of these beneficiaries might have received exams in this site of service rather than in other locations. As a result of this change in the site of service for these exams, our estimated impacts on Medicare expenditures and beneficiary cost sharing could (1) increase because Medicare would be paying for the additional ultrasound equipment transportation cost that would otherwise not have been necessary and (2) change due to the different cost of the exams themselves in the new locations. However, data constraints do not allow us to estimate the extent to which this would occur. Based on what mobile providers told us, one might expect the number of mobile exams to increase in response to the provision of payments to transport ultrasound equipment. However, our analysis of the effect of ceasing to pay for ultrasound equipment transportation in 1996 indicates that the opposite might occur. In 1995, Medicare carriers in 14 states and Northern California paid to transport ultrasound equipment, but these payments ceased in all localities as of January of 1996. We compared the growth rate in the number of exams conducted in SNFs in the 14 states where Medicare paid to transport ultrasound equipment in 1995 and stopped doing so thereafter to the rate across all other states where this change did not occur. The number of exams conducted in SNFs grew by about 237 percent from 1995 to 1997 in states where Medicare paid to transport ultrasound equipment in 1995 and ceased doing so thereafter, which was substantially greater than the 62 percent growth rate in other states where Medicare had not paid to transport ultrasound equipment. This suggests that the elimination of Medicare payments to transport ultrasound equipment may have led to an increase in the number of mobile exams as the amount paid per exam decreased. These results raise the possibility that mobile providers might maintain or decrease the number of exams they provide if Medicare began paying to transport ultrasound equipment. A decrease in the number of exams conducted in SNFs, if it occurred, could require that more beneficiaries use ambulance services to be transported to other locations for the exams. We estimated that a reduction in the number of exams conducted in SNFs could cause the estimated increases in Medicare expenditures and beneficiary cost sharing to be greater. Paying separately under Part B for ultrasound exams and associated equipment and ambulance transportation during Part A-covered SNF stays, as opposed to bundling these services into the Part A PPS payment as is done now, could have increased Medicare Part B payments in 2005 by an estimated $22.0 million and caused beneficiary cost sharing to rise by about $13.4 million, assuming that this policy would not affect service use. (See table 3 and app. I for details on how these estimates were calculated.) The actual financial impact of paying separately under Part B for ultrasound exams and associated equipment and ambulance transportation could differ from the estimates in table 3 because this policy could cause their use to grow by undermining the incentive inherent in the PPS to efficiently provide these services. Although we did not find published studies specific to ultrasound or certain other imaging modalities predicting that this would occur, one of our previous reports found that bundling SNF services into a single PPS payment caused the use of therapy services to decrease. This suggests that paying separately under Part B for these services could possibly have the opposite effect and cause use to grow, which could also cause the actual financial impact of this policy to exceed our estimates. Similarly, MedPAC has reported that there are efficiency gains from bundling payments. In addition, both we and MedPAC have previously noted that bundling Medicare payments for certain end-stage renal disease drugs together with other items for this condition could improve efficiency by eliminating the financial incentive to overuse separately billable drugs. Furthermore, we have reported that the home health PPS, which involves paying home health agencies a single bundled payment per 60-day episode of care, provides strong financial incentives to reduce the cost of providing home health care. Paying separately under Part B for ultrasound exams and associated equipment and ambulance transportation also would increase overall Medicare payments for these services unless the additional Part B expenditures were offset by payment reductions for other services. Congress chose to do this on a previous occasion. Thus, if Congress instituted separate Part B payments for ultrasound exams and associated equipment and ambulance transportation during Part A-covered SNF stays, these payments could possibly be made budget neutral by a reduction in the Part A PPS payment. However, making this policy budget neutral would require that the Part A PPS payment reduction account for the potential of increased service use associated with unbundling services. Factors for CMS to consider in determining whether to establish credentialing or other qualification requirements for sonographers include findings about the value of credentialing from peer-reviewed studies, MedPAC, and ultrasound-related organizations, coupled with variation in federal requirements and lack of state requirements for sonographers. Options available to CMS for promoting the quality of ultrasound services include specifying sonographers’ qualifications via a National Coverage Determination (NCD), promulgating a regulation, and offering a financial incentive for quality improvements through “pay for performance” mechanisms. Sonographer qualifications play an important role in the quality and diagnostic usefulness of ultrasound procedures. Representatives from ultrasound-related professional organizations described ultrasound procedures as highly operator dependent. In addition, they noted that the accuracy and diagnostic usefulness of the images captured depends on the sonographer’s skills and abilities. When conducting diagnostic ultrasound procedures, the sonographer is responsible for obtaining quality images of internal body parts to enable the physician to make correct diagnoses of patients’ diseases and medical conditions. Two studies have shown that poor quality images can lead to misdiagnosis or unnecessarily repeated exams. Representatives of some ultrasound-related professional organizations that we interviewed noted that the increased use of ultrasound procedures in clinical practice and sophistication of the equipment have heightened the need for sonographers to undergo formal training. Currently, about 50 to 60 percent of the sonographers have the appropriate credentials, according to ARDMS estimates. While studies that demonstrate the need for credentialing and accreditation have been limited in number and scope, those that exist seem to suggest that imposing credentialing or other qualifications on sonographers can improve the accuracy of ultrasound procedures. For example, two of the four relevant peer-reviewed studies from our literature review found that the results of noninvasive vascular ultrasound exams done by accredited facilities were more accurate than those exams by nonaccredited facilities. The authors of these studies emphasized the importance of accurate ultrasound exams for clinical decisions that vascular surgeons make about patient treatment. Medicare experience with another type of imaging—mammography—also suggests that establishing federal standards that include requirements for personnel qualifications and facility accreditation could improve quality. In contrast to diagnostic ultrasound procedures, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) established and enforces national quality standards for mammography services, which appear to have improved the quality of these procedures. Among other provisions in these standards, FDA established qualifications and continuing training requirements for mammography personnel, such as radiological technologists who perform the examinations, and also required facility accreditation. We previously reported that these quality standards, in conjunction with state inspection programs, have increased mammography facilities’ adherence to accepted quality assurance standards and improved the quality of X-ray images. Furthermore, MedPAC and various ultrasound-related professional organizations with which we spoke support the implementation of a Medicare policy establishing requirements for the qualifications of sonographers. MedPAC recommended in 2005 that CMS “strongly consider” establishing standards for providers that perform and bill for imaging exams, which include diagnostic ultrasound procedures. MedPAC noted that these standards should address the qualifications of the performing technicians in addition to other aspects of imaging procedures. In addition, representatives from 11 ultrasound-related professional organizations support establishing requirements concerning sonographers’ qualifications through sonographer credentialing and facility accreditation. (See app. V for a list of these organizations.) Of these 11 organizations, 4 are ultrasound-related medical societies that do not credential sonographers or accredit facilities that conduct ultrasound procedures and the remaining 7 do. Representatives from these organizations said that to conduct diagnostic ultrasounds, sonographers need to be trained and have broad knowledge, good judgment, and discretion. Representatives from the Society for Vascular Surgery stated that, because some procedures were done by inadequately trained technical staff or by facilities with little or no quality control, there are a “disturbing number” of patients who have (1) missed or delayed treatment of major health issues or (2) undergone unnecessary treatment due to abnormal results being classified normal or normal results being classified as abnormal. An article in a peer-reviewed journal reported that 91 percent of members of the Society for Vascular Ultrasound and the Society of Diagnostic Medical Sonography agreed that adding requirements for sonographer credentialing and facility accreditation would improve the quality of vascular ultrasound procedures. Some representatives of ultrasound equipment manufacturers and mobile ultrasound providers we interviewed also generally support sonographer credentialing. However, two of the manufacturer-related organizations we contacted and one provider were concerned that requirements for credentialing or accreditation could result in significant shortages of sonographers. Representatives from these manufacturer-related organizations noted that a phase-in period for establishing new requirements for sonographers would help prevent any potential access problems. Similarly, representatives of ultrasound-related professional organizations that we interviewed emphasized the importance of a phase- in period to allow time for sonographers to become credentialed. Federal requirements relating to the qualifications of sonographers are inconsistent. This variation calls into question whether all sonographers paid by Medicare have appropriate and sufficient skills, knowledge, and experience to serve beneficiaries. Variation in federal requirements is also more of a concern because none of the states require that sonographers register or obtain a license from the state prior to providing ultrasound services, according to ultrasound-related professional organizations. At the federal level, CMS has not developed a national policy, such as an NCD, regarding the qualifications needed by sonographers as a condition for payment of ultrasound services. In the absence of an NCD for sonographers’ qualifications, carriers have established Local Coverage Determinations (LCD) for different types of diagnostic ultrasound procedures. Allowing carriers to develop their own LCDs has resulted in varying Medicare requirements in different states for sonographers who perform particular types of diagnostic ultrasound procedures. For example, as of April 2007, carriers in 24 states and the District of Columbia have established one or more LCDs that require that noninvasive vascular diagnostic ultrasound procedures be performed by a credentialed sonographer (one that has undergone a certification process) or in an accredited facility that may require sonographers to meet certain qualification requirements. Carriers’ rationale was that the quality of these ultrasound procedures depends on the knowledge, skill, and experience of the sonographer. Carriers in 17 states have LCDs that recommend that noninvasive vascular diagnostic ultrasound procedures be performed by a credentialed sonographer or in an accredited facility. However, in the remaining 9 states, Medicare carriers have not established requirements through an LCD specifying the qualifications for sonographers who conduct noninvasive vascular ultrasound procedures. (See fig. 3.) Regarding mandatory requirements, a 2003 study that discussed reasons influencing a provider’s decision to obtain facility accreditation in vascular ultrasound cited a 1998 study that found that providers are more likely to seek facility accreditation when it is required for Medicare payment. The 2003 study noted that “alternatives that consider voluntary compliance to ultrasound standards may be unsuccessful.” There is also variation in LCDs concerning diagnostic ultrasound procedures used to diagnose heart and other conditions. While carriers in 12 states had developed LCDs as of April 2007 that require that these procedures be performed by a credentialed sonographer or in an accredited laboratory and carriers in 4 states had LCDs that recommended these types of qualifications for sonographers, the remaining states and the District of Columbia have no such LCDs. Finally, as of September 2006, carriers in 4 states had LCDs that established qualification requirements for sonographers that perform certain other diagnostic ultrasound procedures, such as abdominal and pelvic ultrasound. However, there are no similar LCDs in the remaining states and the District of Columbia. Variations in Medicare requirements regarding sonographers’ qualifications also relate to the sites of service where diagnostic ultrasound procedures are performed. For example, CMS has developed standards for nonphysician personnel that could be applicable to sonographers who perform diagnostic ultrasound procedures in independent diagnostic testing facilities (IDTF), but has not done so for physicians’ offices. For IDTFs, CMS requirements specify that nonphysician personnel, including sonographers, who perform diagnostic ultrasound procedures, must demonstrate the basic qualifications to perform those procedures and have appropriate training and proficiency. To meet this requirement, in the absence of a state licensing board, sonographers must be credentialed by an appropriate national credentialing body. Furthermore, the IDTF must maintain documentation available for review that Medicare credentialing requirements are being met. Although there are no Medicare standards specifically related to the qualifications of sonographers working in hospitals, Medicare providers need to abide by the relevant Medicare Conditions of Participation (CoP), some of which appear to be applicable to the performance of ultrasound procedures. There are CoP provisions that include specific standards for medical staff and for radiology, nuclear medicine, and outpatient services. According to the Medicare CoP for medical staff, hospitals are responsible for the quality of medical care provided to patients and must examine the qualifications and credentials of applicants for medical staff positions. If the hospital provides outpatient services, the CoP also requires that services must meet the needs of the patients in “accordance with acceptable standards of practice.” Further, hospital outpatient departments are required to have appropriate professional and nonprofessional personnel available. In 2003, over 80 percent of hospitals met the applicable conditions of participation through accreditation from the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (Joint Commission)—a nonprofit organization created to provide voluntary health care accreditation for hospitals. In contrast to IDTFs and hospitals, there are no Medicare standards that apply specifically to diagnostic ultrasound procedures conducted in physicians’ offices aside from those relating to the level of physician supervision required. The absence of qualification standards for sonographers working in physicians’ offices is of particular interest given MedPAC and the Lewin Group’s findings that there has been an increasing movement of imaging services, including ultrasound, from hospitals to physicians’ offices. Several options are available to CMS for promoting the quality of diagnostic ultrasound procedures. Maintaining the status quo certainly imposes the least administrative burden and additional costs. However, this approach will not address the inconsistencies in requirements for sonographers’ qualifications. We present three options for promoting the quality of ultrasound procedures, with associated potential benefits and challenges. One option would be to develop an NCD requiring that sonographers either be credentialed or work in an accredited facility. Because NCDs apply to all Medicare beneficiaries regardless of their treatment locations, an NCD would provide a more consistent level of assurance as to the qualifications of sonographers performing diagnostic ultrasound procedures. However, under the NCD option, CMS indicated it would have to implement the sonographer qualification requirements immediately rather than gradually over a period of time, according to a CMS official. This time constraint could be problematic given that representatives of various ultrasound-related societies and organizations we interviewed generally suggested a phase-in period of 2 or more years to allow noncredentialed sonographers time to comply with the newly imposed requirements. Finally, establishing an NCD could be difficult, according to the CMS official, if it limited access to services for some beneficiaries, such as for those that lived in locations where no credentialed sonographer was readily available. A second option would be to issue a regulation that establishes a requirement that sonographers either be credentialed or work in an accredited facility as a condition for Medicare payment. Such a regulation could be phased in over 2 or more years, which as noted by representatives of ultrasound-related professional organizations we interviewed, would allow noncredentialed sonographers time to comply with this requirement. A CMS official noted that the regulatory process would allow CMS to use a phase-in period for establishing such a requirement but that developing regulations can be burdensome and time consuming for CMS. A third option would be for CMS to explore the possibility of “paying for performance” to encourage quality in the provision of diagnostic ultrasound procedures. CMS has recognized that the current Medicare reimbursement structure does not target resources to support specific efforts to provide the highest quality care. To address this shortcoming, CMS has initiated a number of demonstration and pilot projects, several required by Congress under statute, aimed at encouraging quality care and designed to lay the groundwork for pay-for-performance systems in the future. However, these pay-for-performance efforts are in the early stages of development, and none of them is focused on imaging services or diagnostic ultrasound procedures. A CMS official and representatives of various ultrasound-related professional organizations told us that it is difficult to develop clear and valid quality measures that could be applied to the performance of sonographers that conduct diagnostic ultrasound procedures. We did not find compelling clinical or financial evidence in favor of providing Part B payments for ultrasound equipment transportation in addition to those for the exams themselves, for beneficiaries in noncovered SNF stays. While testimonial evidence suggests that there may be benefits of performing ultrasound exams in SNFs for some beneficiaries as opposed to transporting them to other locations, we could not locate any studies documenting this. Furthermore, our analysis suggests that Part B payments for ultrasound equipment transportation could increase Medicare expenditures and beneficiary cost sharing. In addition, paying separately under Part B for ultrasound exams and associated equipment and ambulance transportation during Part A- covered SNF stays would undermine the financial incentive of the PPS for SNFs to deliver these services efficiently. Paying separately under Part B for these services would also increase overall Medicare expenditures unless Congress made these additional Part B payments budget-neutral by reducing the Part A PPS payment. As a national program affecting over 42 million beneficiaries, Medicare has a responsibility to ensure that the services it covers are of consistently high quality. Our findings from peer-reviewed studies and MedPAC and ultrasound-related professional organizations, coupled with our analysis of the variation in current requirements for sonographers, suggest that establishing requirements for sonographers’ qualifications could improve the quality of ultrasound procedures. Maintaining the status quo of allowing Medicare carriers to have different requirements for sonographer qualifications in different states undermines the assurance that beneficiaries are receiving consistently high-quality services. CMS has several available implementation options including developing a National Coverage Determination and promulgating regulations. We recommend that the Administrator of CMS require that sonographers paid by Medicare either be credentialed or work in an accredited facility. The Administrator should weigh the advantages and disadvantages of implementing a National Coverage Determination compared with promulgating regulations that this requirement be a condition for Medicare payment. In written comments on a draft of this report, CMS stated that while it would consider our recommendation to require that sonographers furnishing services to Medicare beneficiaries either be credentialed or work in an accredited facility, it would rather have states engage their own licensing bodies in implementing sonographer licensure programs that address competency and qualification issues. We reprinted CMS’s written comments in appendix VI. CMS characterized our recommendation as providing two options— issuing an NCD or promulgating a regulation establishing sonographer qualifications as a Condition of Participation—and stated that these options do not provide the most effective mechanism for addressing sonographer quality. We noted in our report that issuing a regulation was an option for CMS. However, we did not specify that this regulation apply only to ultrasound services furnished in or by providers that are subject to Conditions of Participation (generally, institutional providers, such as hospitals) because we believe it is important that sonographer qualification requirements apply to all sonographers, regardless of the setting in which they provide the service, including physicians’ offices. CMS agreed with our finding that sonographer qualification requirements vary but stated that a national policy would not take into account regional variation in factors such as access to care and state licensing requirements. We agree that access is an important issue when considering whether to implement an NCD or a regulation, and we pointed out that such a regulation could include a phase-in period to provide noncredentialed sonographers with time to comply with the newly imposed requirements. Furthermore, although CMS asserted that states should engage their own licensure bodies to implement sonographer licensure programs, we reported that state licensing requirements for sonographers do not exist. Consequently, we continue to believe that CMS should implement our recommendation and develop a national policy establishing sonographer qualification requirements. Such requirements, that sonographers paid by Medicare either be credentialed or work in an accredited facility, would help to promote the quality of ultrasound procedures across states and sites of service where consistent policy is currently lacking. CMS agreed with our conclusion that paying separately under Part B for ultrasound exams and associated equipment and ambulance transportation would undermine the financial incentive for SNFs to deliver these services efficiently. CMS further noted that paying separately for ultrasound exams could potentially lead to doing so for other services and lead to the “unraveling” of the SNF PPS bundle. We are sending copies of this report to the Administrator of CMS, appropriate congressional committees, and other interested parties. We will also provide copies to others on request.

Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. GAO staff members who made contributions to this report are listed in appendix VII. This appendix explains the methodology that we used to address our reporting objectives on (1) the types of ultrasound procedures commonly used to diagnose medical conditions of Medicare beneficiaries, particularly those in skilled nursing facilities (SNF); (2) the financial impact of changing how Medicare pays for ultrasound exams and associated equipment and ambulance transportation for beneficiaries receiving care in a SNF; and (3) the factors to consider in determining whether the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) should establish credentialing or other qualification requirements for sonographers that provide diagnostic ultrasound procedures. To examine the types of diagnostic ultrasound procedures provided to Medicare beneficiaries, medical conditions that were diagnosed, and sites of service where these procedures were performed, we analyzed Medicare claims for ultrasound procedures paid under Part B in 2005. These data came from the National Claims History (NCH) carrier file and the Standard Analytical File (SAF) outpatient claims files. We based our analysis of the types of procedures on claims for physicians’ interpretations of ultrasound exams, which account for procedures provided to all beneficiaries because all physicians’ interpretations of ultrasound exams are paid under Part B, regardless of whether the exam itself was paid under Part A or Part B. We based our analysis of the site of service of ultrasound procedures on claims for ultrasound exams that were paid under Part B. Therefore, our site of service analysis does not cover exams for beneficiaries in Part A-covered SNF and hospital inpatient stays because Part A payment for these exams is bundled with other services and thus not separately reported in claims data. To identify the specific diagnostic ultrasound procedures to analyze, we performed several steps. We began by developing a list of all the relevant diagnostic ultrasound procedures using information from the 2005 American Medical Association (AMA) Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) guide, and interviews with a credentialed sonographer with particular expertise in ultrasound coding and billing issues, and CMS officials, as well as documents provided during these interviews. We also reviewed the CMS Berenson-Eggers Type of Service (BETOS) codes, which categorize Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) codes into clinically relevant categories. For this report, we selected 94 HCPCS codes in the BETOS categories for echography, which is a synonym for ultrasound. We then supplemented these 94 codes with 10 additional ones that we identified based on our review of codes in the AMA CPT Guide for 2005. The 104 total HCPCS codes we selected accounted for approximately 99 percent of all Medicare Part B payments for diagnostic ultrasound procedures in 2005. To analyze sites of service where ultrasound procedures were performed, we used Medicare data from the 2005 NCH carrier and SAF outpatient claims files. In addition, we used data and reviewed regulations from CMS on the appropriate level of physician supervision for each ultrasound procedure to examine how supervision levels varied across sites of service. To examine clinical considerations associated with site of service and to supplement our data analysis on the medical conditions, we conducted a literature search and structured interviews with representatives of gerontological, radiological, and ultrasound-related professional organizations. Key search terms included transition of care, which involves moving the beneficiary from the SNF to another facility for the purpose of performing an ultrasound procedure; transfer trauma; patient transfers; and risks and morbidity associated with the movement of elderly persons to different settings. For the structured interviews, we contacted representatives from the American Geriatrics Society, the American Medical Directors Association, the American College of Radiology, the American Society of Echocardiography, the Society for Vascular Surgery, and the Society for Vascular Ultrasound. In addition, we interviewed four mobile ultrasound providers that provide services to SNFs or nursing homes and representatives from the National Association for the Support of Long-Term Care and the American Association of Homes and Services for the Aging. We also conducted structured interviews with SNF directors of nursing in states selected based on criteria including their ultrasound use level per beneficiary. We estimated the financial impact of two changes in Medicare payment methodology for ultrasound exams and associated equipment and ambulance transportation for beneficiaries receiving care in a SNF. The first change we addressed was to make payments to transport and set up ultrasound equipment for exams conducted in SNFs during noncovered SNF stays, which is not currently done. The second change involved paying separately under Part B for ultrasound exams and associated equipment and ambulance transportation during Part A-covered SNF stays. To estimate the financial impact of this potential change, we used Medicare Part B claims data for 2005 for ultrasound exams and ambulance services from the NCH carrier and SAF outpatient files. Based on these data, we (1) identified the number of exams conducted in SNFs during noncovered SNF stays, in beneficiaries’ homes, or in custodial care or assisted living facilities, (2) determined the number of beneficiary days on which these exams were conducted, and (3) multiplied the number of beneficiary days by our estimate of the average Medicare payment and beneficiary cost sharing for ultrasound equipment transportation, both including and excluding the equipment set-up fee, in the Medicare locality where the claim was processed. Through these steps, we estimated how the expenditures of Medicare and its beneficiaries would have differed if Medicare had paid to transport and set up ultrasound equipment in 2005, assuming that the number and location of exams would not have changed in response to this policy. (See app. III, table 7.) To gain insight into how Medicare payments to transport and set up ultrasound equipment would affect the number of ultrasound exams in SNFs during noncovered SNF stays, we used information from interviews and two types of analyses. First, we interviewed representatives of four mobile ultrasound providers. Second, we analyzed Part B claims data from the Part B Extract Summary System for 1995, when Medicare contractors in some states paid to transport and set up ultrasound equipment, and 1997, when these payments were no longer provided. We compared the change between 1995 and 1997 in the number of ultrasound exams conducted in SNFs in 14 states that provided these payments in 1995 to the same measure in the remaining states that did not provide such payments. (See app. III, table 8.) Third, we analyzed Part B claims data for ambulance services that appear to have been used in conjunction with ultrasound exams. If there was a decline in the number of ultrasound exams in SNFs during noncovered SNF stays in response to Medicare payments to transport and set up ultrasound equipment, it could cause the site of service of some exams to shift from these locations to other sites of service (such as a hospital outpatient facility). To determine whether this change in site of service would increase or decrease our impact estimates for paying to transport and set up ultrasound equipment, we accounted for how this change would affect Medicare expenditures and beneficiary cost sharing for (1) ambulance transportation, (2) the transportation and set up of ultrasound equipment, and (3) the ultrasound exam. Some ultrasound exams conducted during noncovered SNF stays may require ambulance services to transport the beneficiary to another location, such as a hospital outpatient facility, for the exam. To estimate how Medicare payments and beneficiary cost sharing would have differed in 2005 if these exams had instead been conducted in SNFs during noncovered SNF stays, we first identified ambulance trips used to transport these beneficiaries from SNFs to another location for an ultrasound procedure. We then calculated how Medicare payments and beneficiary cost sharing for the ultrasound exam and associated transportation would have differed if, rather than transporting the beneficiary via ambulance to another location, ultrasound equipment had been transported to the SNF for the exam. To estimate how conducting the exam in a SNF during a noncovered SNF stay rather than in another location would have affected Medicare payments and beneficiary cost sharing for transportation, we (1) calculated the number of beneficiary days on which these exams occurred, (2) determined the savings to Medicare and its beneficiaries per beneficiary day if, instead of transporting a beneficiary via ambulance to another location, ultrasound equipment were transported to the beneficiary for the exam, by subtracting our estimate of the ultrasound equipment transportation payment and cost-sharing amounts for each beneficiary day from the actual payment for ambulance services, and (3) multiplied this difference by the number of beneficiary days. To estimate the savings to Medicare and its beneficiaries for the exam itself, we subtracted the cost of conducting all of these exams in a SNF during noncovered SNF stays from the actual cost of these exams. The key limitation of our analysis of the financial impact of paying to transport and set up ultrasound equipment involves the accuracy of our assumption that this policy would not affect the number and location of ultrasound exams in SNFs during noncovered SNF stays. Therefore, to address the possibility that this policy change could affect ultrasound service use, we analyzed how such a change could affect our impact estimates. To estimate the financial impact of paying separately under Part B for ultrasound exams and associated equipment and ambulance transportation during Part A-covered SNF stays, we analyzed claims for ultrasound exams and physicians’ interpretations of them for beneficiaries in Part A-covered SNF stays from Medicare Part B claims data for 2005 from the NCH carrier file and the SAF outpatient claims files. We first counted the number of physicians’ interpretations of ultrasound exams that were conducted during Part A-covered SNF stays in 2005. We merged Part B claims for physicians’ interpretations of ultrasound exams in 2005 with SNF claims for the same year to determine which interpretations occurred during Part A-covered SNF stays. We then multiplied the number of physician interpretations of each exam by the average Medicare payment and beneficiary cost-sharing amounts for the corresponding exam. Ultrasound exams and other services are bundled into the SNF prospective payment system (PPS) rate for beneficiaries in Part A-covered SNF stays, so Medicare should not pay separately under Part B for these exams. However, we identified claims for up to 33,000 ultrasound exams conducted during Part A-covered SNF stays as having been improperly billed. Medicare paid approximately $2.6 million for these exams, and beneficiaries paid about $1.5 million. If Medicare contractors did not recoup all of these improper payments as they are required to, then our estimate of the financial impact of paying separately under Part B for ultrasound exams would be overstated because Medicare would have already been paying separately under Part B for some of these exams in the absence of this policy. However, because data for improperly paid claims do not indicate whether the payments were recouped, we were unable to accurately estimate the extent to which these improper payments affect our estimates. To estimate the financial impact of paying separately under Part B for ultrasound equipment transportation for beneficiaries in Part A-covered SNF stays, we first estimated the number of ultrasound exams conducted in SNFs, as opposed to other sites of service, for these beneficiaries in 2005. To do so, we multiplied the number of physician interpretations of exams for these beneficiaries in that year by the proportion of all ultrasound exams for the same population in 1997 that were conducted in SNFs. We converted this estimate of the number of exams done in SNFs for these beneficiaries into the number of beneficiary days to indicate how many equipment transportation and set-up fees Medicare would have paid. To calculate the financial impact on Medicare payments, we added the product of (1) the number of beneficiary days and the average estimated equipment transportation fee and (2) the number of exams and estimated average of the equipment set-up fee. To calculate the financial impact on beneficiary cost sharing, we added the product of (1) the number of beneficiary days and the average estimated cost sharing for equipment transportation and (2) the number of exams and average estimated equipment transportation fee. We used a similar process to estimate the financial impact of separate Part B payments for ambulance services used during Part A-covered SNF stays to transport beneficiaries from a SNF to another location for an ultrasound exam and back. We (1) estimated the number of ultrasound exams for beneficiaries in Part A-covered SNF stays in 2005 that involved ambulance transportation, by multiplying the number of physician interpretations of exams for these beneficiaries in that year by the proportion of exams for the same population in 1997 that involved ambulance transportation; (2) converted this estimate of the number of exams involving ambulance transportation into the number of beneficiary days to indicate how many ambulance round trips Medicare would have paid; and (3) multiplied the number of beneficiary days by the average cost to Medicare and a beneficiary of an ambulance round trip. We also did a literature search to locate studies addressing the effect of the SNF PPS on the use of ultrasound and certain other imaging services. Key search terms included Medicare, skilled nursing facility, prospective payment system, ultrasound, imaging, X-ray, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and angiography. Our analysis of the financial impact of paying separately under Part B for ultrasound exams and related transportation has two key limitations. First, because more recent information was unavailable, we used 1997 data to estimate the number of ultrasound exams conducted in SNFs or that involved ambulance transportation. Therefore, the precision of estimates of the financial impact of paying separately under Part B for these services is limited by the accuracy with which the results based on the 1997 data we used would have been similar if 2005 data had been available. In addition, the financial impact estimates we present are based on the assumption that service use would not change in response to this policy. To address the possibility that a policy of paying separately for services, as opposed to bundling payment for them, would affect the use of services, we (1) summarized studies we found that addressed how bundling payment for services can affect their use and (2) conducted a literature search to identify studies addressing how the use of certain imaging, and specifically ultrasound, services changed in response to the SNF PPS. To identify factors to consider in determining whether CMS should establish credentialing or other qualification requirements for sonographers, we reviewed applicable Medicare regulations and CMS documents on Medicare coverage policies, including Medicare National Coverage Determinations. In addition, we reviewed Medicare carriers’ Local Coverage Determinations (LCD) related to the qualification requirements for sonographers that perform echocardiograms, noninvasive vascular ultrasounds, and other diagnostic ultrasounds, such as abdominal and pelvic ultrasounds. To identify these coverage policies, we conducted searches in CMS’s Medicare Coverage Database for draft and final LCDs related to echocardiograms and noninvasive vascular ultrasounds as of April 2007 for each Medicare carrier. We also conducted a search in CMS’s Medicare Coverage Database for LCDs related to other diagnostic ultrasounds as of September 2006. In addition, we interviewed CMS and Medicare Payment Advisory Commission officials and representatives from national organizations that award credentials in sonography or accredit facilities that perform ultrasound procedures, and reviewed documents that they provided to us. These organizations included the American Registry for Diagnostic Medical Sonography, the Intersocietal Accreditation Commission, the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine, Cardiovascular Credentialing International, and the American College of Radiology. Finally, we conducted a literature search and reviewed relevant studies in peer-reviewed journals. Medicare claims data, which are used by the Medicare program as a record of payments made to health care providers, are monitored by CMS. The data are subject to various checks and edits. Although we did not review these checks and edits, we assessed the reliability of the NCH data, which include all claims data analyzed for this report. We found the data sufficiently reliable for purposes of this report. We performed our work from July 2006 through May 2007 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. This appendix contains information on the number of ultrasound procedures provided to Medicare beneficiaries in 2005 by site of service and the level of physician supervision required to administer the procedures. (See table 4.) This appendix also includes data on the five top medical conditions diagnosed by type of ultrasound procedures provided to Medicare beneficiaries overall and to those in SNF stays in 2005 that were not covered by Medicare. (See tables 5 and 6.) This appendix contains information on the financial impact of paying for ultrasound equipment transportation. (See table 7.) In addition, this appendix presents information on changes in the number of ultrasound exams conducted in skilled nursing facilities (SNF) between 1995 and 1997 (see table 8). The study compared the results of noninvasive vascular ultrasound procedures performed by an accredited facility to the results of studies that were initially performed by both accredited and nonaccredited facilities. The study reviewed a total of 437 ultrasound carotid duplex exams. The study found an 83 percent correlation rate for ultrasound procedures that were initially performed at accredited facilities. However, when the initial study was performed by a nonaccredited facility, the correlation rate for reviewed studies was 45 percent. To determine the effectiveness of the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine (AIUM) accreditation program in improving compliance with standards and guidelines for the performance of obstetric and gynecologic ultrasound examinations. The scores of case studies in 82 AIUM accreditation applications were compared with their respective scores at the time of reaccreditation 3 years later. To account for the element of time, scores of applications that recently completed first-time accreditation were also compared as a control group. The study found that practices that applied for, and were granted, ultrasound accreditation were able to improve the scores of case studies and to achieve compliance with AIUM minimum standards and guidelines for the performance of gynecologic and obstetric ultrasound examinations. The study concluded that the improvement in scores should translate into an enhancement of the quality of the ultrasound practice. To evaluate the reliability of carotid duplex ultrasound scanning procedures performed by nonaccredited vascular laboratories and to assess the clinical effect on patient management. The study compared the quality and reliability of carotid duplex ultrasound scanning procedures performed by a nonaccredited vascular laboratory with repeat examinations performed in the Beaumont laboratory, which is accredited by the Intersocietal Commission for Accreditation of Vascular Laboratories. The study found that of the 174 patients referred for surgical evaluation for carotid endarterectomy, 88 of these patients did not have the severe or critical carotid stenosis (narrowing) that had been diagnosed initially. Since these patients had all been referred for carotid endarterectomy, unnecessary and potentially dangerous operations were avoided when the accredited laboratory disproved the false positive results from the nonaccredited facilities. For an additional 19 patients, the disease severity had been significantly underestimated by the nonaccredited laboratories. Objective(s) of study To evaluate the opinions of vascular technologists and sonographers who routinely perform vascular procedures about the value of credentialing and accreditation and to assess their current practice patterns for the performance of carotid duplex ultrasound procedures. Researchers surveyed 100 members of the Society of Diagnostic Medical Sonography and the Society for Vascular Ultrasound in Kentucky and Indiana. There was a 30 percent response rate. The study found that 12 percent of (4,782) carotid duplex procedures considered in the study were repeated annually.\n\n### Summary:", "answer": "Medicare spending on imaging services, among which are ultrasound procedures that use sound waves to facilitate diagnosis, nearly doubled from 1999 to 2004. The Congress required GAO to examine Medicare's payment methods for ultrasound procedures and whether the technicians that conduct them--called sonographers--should be subject to qualification standards, such as having to undergo a certification process called credentialing. This report addresses (1) the ultrasound procedures commonly used to diagnose medical conditions of Medicare beneficiaries, particularly for beneficiaries in a skilled nursing facility (SNF), (2) the financial impact of changing how Medicare pays for ultrasound exams and associated equipment and ambulance transportation for beneficiaries in a SNF, and (3) the factors for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to consider in determining whether to establish credentialing or other requirements for sonographers. For this review, GAO analyzed Medicare claims data and conducted interviews and literature reviews. Three-fourths of the approximately 41 million ultrasound procedures provided to Medicare beneficiaries in 2005 in any setting were one of two types: (1) echocardiograms to diagnose heart conditions or (2) noninvasive vascular procedures used to monitor blood flow and detect blockage or injury in veins and arteries. Ultrasound procedures consist of the ultrasound exam itself and the physician's interpretation of the exam. Nearly all of the ultrasound exams provided under Medicare Part B, which covers physician, hospital outpatient, diagnostic testing, and certain other services, were performed in physicians' offices and hospital outpatient departments. Of these exams, less than 1 percent were conducted in SNFs or homes, generally using ultrasound equipment that was transported to these settings by a mobile provider. Among beneficiaries in SNF stays not covered by Medicare who received ultrasound exams in SNFs, noninvasive vascular exams were the most prevalent type performed. Two ultrasound procedure payment changes affecting SNF beneficiaries that GAO examined would likely increase expenditures and beneficiary cost sharing. If CMS had paid to transport ultrasound equipment to beneficiaries in SNF stays not covered by Medicare, which is not currently done, Medicare expenditures could have increased by an estimated $9.8 million and beneficiary cost sharing could have been about $2.6 million higher in 2005, assuming the number and location of services would not change in response to this policy. Moreover, paying separately for ultrasound exams and related transportation during beneficiaries' Medicare-covered SNF stays, as opposed to bundling these and other services into a single daily payment as CMS currently does, could have increased Medicare payments by about $22.0 million and beneficiary cost sharing by about $13.4 million in 2005, assuming no change in service use due to the revised policy. The actual financial impact for Medicare could differ from these estimates if, for example, providers increased their service provision due to these policy changes. Factors for CMS to consider in determining whether to establish credentialing or other qualification requirements for sonographers include the evidence of the value of setting such requirements and variation in federal requirements for sonographers. The skill of the sonographer conducting an ultrasound is critical for its use to support a physician's correct diagnosis; poorly captured images can lead to misdiagnoses or unnecessarily repeated exams. Findings from several peer-reviewed studies, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, and ultrasound-related professional organizations support requiring that sonographers either have credentials or operate in facilities that are accredited, where specific quality standards apply. In some localities and practice settings, CMS or its contractors have required that sonographers either be credentialed or work in an accredited facility. Medicare's inconsistent requirements undermine assurance that beneficiaries are receiving high-quality services across the country."}

FSA is one of three USDA service center agencies that manage benefit programs for farmers and ranchers. Currently, FSA manages 23 farm benefit programs identified by, among other legislation, the Agricultural Act of 2014 (commonly referred to as the 2014 Farm Bill).assistance for livestock, honeybees, and farm-raised fish to providing incentives for resource conservation. Appendix II provides a brief description for each of the 23 farm benefit programs. FSA benefit programs fall into four core categories: farm loan programs, which are to provide direct loans or loan guarantees to family farmers who could not otherwise obtain agricultural credit; income support and disaster assistance programs, which are to provide farmers and ranchers with an economic safety net to help them maintain their operations during difficult times; commodity operations programs, which are to expand market opportunities for farmers; and conservation programs, which are to help maintain and enhance the nation’s natural resources and environment. Over the last two decades, FSA has provided services to customers supporting the farm benefit programs at its approximately 2,100 local offices. To participate in FSA programs, customers may need to visit local service center offices multiple times throughout the year because certain transactions cannot be done electronically via e-mail or the Internet. A new customer would typically go through several steps to enroll in a benefit program: At first, a customer needs to establish a relationship with the agency by providing certain basic information about his operation that will be used in determining eligibility. Based on this information, an FSA agent is to create a master farm record for the customer. The farm record is to include specific information about the farm such as identification numbers for fields and tracts (a tract is one or more contiguous fields), location information, and a list of commodities that the farm is able to produce. Once a customer has established a relationship, customers learn about available FSA programs, receive information on eligibility and estimated benefits under a particular program, and generate a draft agreement for participation in a particular program. The next step is for the customer to submit a final agreement to FSA for their participation. Subsequently, throughout the year, the customer documents information about crops in an acreage report, which must be prepared for each applicable tract and growing season. The customer brings acreage reports and other forms to the FSA service center in person. Because different crops have different reporting deadlines, a customer may need to visit the service center multiple times to fill out reports for different crops. In addition to establishing relationships and administering benefits programs, there are two other key activities that service centers perform: handling acreage reports and printing maps. Handling acreage reports. This is one of the most critical functions for a service center. The FSA agent verifies that a customer is eligible for a benefit and compares the acreage amount in the acreage report against the acreage amount in the master farm record. The agent then computes the payment amount and authorizes the payment to be made to the customer. Printing maps. Customers also often request maps of their tracts from FSA service centers to help plan for the next growing season because the maps can only be produced in hard copy. According to FSA service center officials, this is one of the customer’s most requested services. In order to provide these services, FSA staff use a variety of computing environments and software applications, including a central “web farm,” consisting of an array of interconnected computer servers that exchange data in support of data storage and web-based applications; a central IBM mainframe that hosts non-Web applications and data; a distributed network of IBM Application System 400 computers and a common computing environment of personal and server computers at each local office. In early 2004, FSA began planning the MIDAS program to streamline and automate farm program processes and to replace obsolete hardware and software. FSA identified these goals for the program: Replace aging hardware: Replace Application System 400 computers, which date to the 1980s and are obsolete and difficult to maintain, with a hosting infrastructure to meet business needs, internal controls, and security requirements. Reengineer business processes: Streamline outmoded work processes by employing common functions across farm programs. For example, determining benefits eligibility could be redesigned (using business process reengineering) as a structured series of work steps that would remain consistent regardless of the benefits requested. Improve data management: Make data more readily available to FSA personnel and farmers and ranchers—including online self- service capabilities—and increase data accuracy and security. Improve interoperability with other USDA and FSA systems: Integrate with other USDA and FSA modernization initiatives, including the Financial Management Modernization Initiative for core financial services that meet federal accounting and systems standards, the Geospatial Information Systems to obtain farm imagery and mapping information, and the Enterprise Data Warehouse to provide enterprise reporting. From 2004 through 2010, FSA went through several changes in direction before selecting a technical solution for MIDAS: FSA drafted initial requirements for MIDAS in January 2004. FSA halted requirements development in early 2006 when program officials decided that the proposed customized solution would not meet future business needs. FSA subsequently changed its approach in the Summer of 2006 from acquiring customized software to acquiring commercial off-the-shelf enterprise resource planning software. The program estimated that it would cost $305 million to implement MIDAS, but this estimate had a high degree of uncertainty. In February 2008, FSA analyzed how its farm program functions would map to functions available in a commercial off-the-shelf enterprise resource planning software suite from vendor SAP, which had been selected for two other USDA modernization initiatives—the Financial Management Modernization Initiative and the Web Based Supply Chain Management program. This analysis concluded that MIDAS processes generally mapped to the SAP software. Based on that analysis and a software alternatives analysis conducted in mid-2008, FSA decided to proceed with SAP enterprise resource planning software as the solution for MIDAS. FSA also decided to accelerate the time frame for implementing the solution from the 10 years originally planned to 2 years. To accomplish this, FSA planned to compress the requirements analysis phase from 4 years to 5 months, and reduce the analysis and design phase from 3.5 years to 9 months. A request for quotations for the MIDAS system integrator contract was released in July 2009, and a contract based on this request was awarded to SRA International in December 2009. After a short delay due to a bid protest, the system integrator began work in May 2010 with an initial firm fixed price task order for $4.4 million through December 2010. By this point, FSA had also awarded six other contracts for services to support additional aspects of this initiative, including software licenses, project management support, and technical support. As of October 2010, FSA planned to spend $169 million—more than half of the program’s $305 million estimate—on the system integrator contract through fiscal year 2012. Figure 1 depicts a timeline of key milestones for MIDAS from its inception through the initiation of work by the system integrator. In the years after the system integrator began to work on developing MIDAS, the program ran into cost, schedule, and technical problems. These issues ultimately resulted in a July 2014 decision to halt further development on the MIDAS program. We discuss the events that led to this decision later in this report. In September 2007, FSA established a MIDAS executive program manager and a program office to oversee the program and its supporting contracts. According to FSA officials, the program office reported to a Senior Management Oversight Committee on a regular basis. The committee was chaired by the USDA Under Secretary for Farm and Foreign Agricultural Services and included the USDA Chief Information Officer, USDA Chief Financial Officer, and Administrator of the Farm Service Agency as additional board members. The committee had the following responsibilities, among others, in providing departmental oversight and support for the MIDAS program: communicating and providing strategic direction for FSA’s enterprise modernization; approving the MIDAS acquisition strategy; approving the program’s cost, schedule, and requirements baseline; ensuring MIDAS integration with departmental requirements and related initiatives and significant interdependencies; approving updates to business cases; and addressing issues escalated by a program-level review board. At the department level, USDA had an IT governance process that was overseen by the Executive Information Technology Investment Review Board, which was chaired by the department’s Chief Operating Officer and included the department’s Under Secretary for Farm and Foreign Agricultural Services, Chief Information Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and other senior executives. The board was to approve IT investments that aligned with USDA’s mission and enterprise IT goals; provide executive management oversight, approval, and commitment to selected IT investments; and recommend to the Secretary a ranked group of IT investments proposed for funding. In addition to USDA governance, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) was involved in providing routine oversight for this program. OMB requested monthly status briefings on MIDAS’s progress after USDA’s Office of the Chief Information Officer conducted a TechStat review of the program in November 2012. These monthly briefings continued until October 2014, when the program was preparing to deploy its second and final software release. In May 2008, at the request of the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations, we reported that MIDAS was in the planning phase and that FSA had begun gathering information and analyzing products to integrate its existing systems.adequately assessed the program’s cost estimate, in that the estimate had been based on an unrelated USDA IT investment. Moreover, the agency had not adequately assessed its schedule estimate because business requirements had not been considered when FSA reduced the implementation time frame from 10 years to 2 years. We determined that the agency had not As a result, we reported that it was uncertain whether the department could deliver the program within the cost and schedule time frames it had proposed and recommended that FSA establish effective and reliable cost estimates using industry leading practices and establish a realistic and reliable implementation schedule that was based on complete business requirements. USDA generally agreed with our recommendations and implemented our recommendation to improve its tracking of user problems and clarifying roles and responsibilities between FSA and USDA’s Information Technology Services. However, it did not implement our other recommendations to establish reliable cost and schedule estimates based on complete business requirements. Subsequently, in July 2011, we reported that MIDAS was in the proof-of- concept and system design phase, and noted that the scope included modernization of FSA’s systems for all of its (at that time) 37 farm programs by March 2014. We determined that the program’s cost estimate had a large degree of uncertainty. In particular, it did not yet reflect decisions that had occurred since the estimate was developed in 2007 and that the completion date of its current development phase was uncertain because of delays to key system design milestones. In addition, we found that FSA had plans in place for MIDAS that incorporated selected leading practices and had defined governance bodies to provide oversight, but it had not implemented other key management practices, including forming an integrated team with representatives from IT programs that MIDAS depended on for its success, developing a schedule that reflected dependencies with relevant IT programs, and tracking the status of risks as planned. Moreover, it had not clearly defined the roles and coordination among the program’s governance bodies. We recommended that USDA update cost and schedule estimates, address management weaknesses in plans and program execution, and clarify the roles and coordination among the governance bodies. The department agreed with our recommendations and identified plans to address them. However, the agency did not complete efforts to address these recommendations before the decision was made to halt the program. In a July 2014 memo, the Secretary of Agriculture decided to halt the MIDAS program after deploying minimal functionality due to performance challenges in the early months after the system became operational, and delays in determining the remaining scope, schedule, and cost for the program. Our analysis similarly found that the key factors that led to this decision were poor program performance—characterized by rising costs, schedule overruns, reduced functionality, and problems with the system after it was deployed—as well as uncertainty regarding future plans for MIDAS. Poor program performance: FSA experienced significant cost and schedule delays in developing MIDAS, which led it to defer or remove expected functionality and to eliminate key system tests prior to deploying the system. Once the initial MIDAS functionality was deployed, FSA employees encountered serious problems in using the system. A timeline of key events and decisions that factored into MIDAS’s poor program performance include: In December 2011, MIDAS was envisioned to deliver significant functionality in phases, with the majority of functions to be delivered in the first phase. In further designing the system in March 2012, FSA decided to remove selected functionality from the first phase, and to deliver the remaining functionality in two deployments. As of June 2012, FSA estimated that development costs would be $330 million. As FSA began to develop the system, however, it experienced cost and schedule overruns. For example, by August 2012, FSA had overrun its cost estimates by 11 percent and schedule estimates by 10 percent. These overruns were due, in part, to delays in completing customization of the commercial software, redesign work on interfaces, delays in testing individual system components as a result of including more customization than planned, and delays in data conversion and remediation efforts. In order to help meet cost and schedule demands, in September 2012, FSA decided to split the two deployments into three deployments and to focus primarily on the first deployment. After continuing to experience schedule delays as it moved into system testing, FSA decided to remove additional functionality from the first deployment (including acreage reporting and customer records functions). To try to stay on schedule, the MIDAS program also obtained approval from senior USDA and FSA management in early 2013 to defer key testing activities—including performance testing and user acceptance testing—until after the system became operational. These tests were not performed after deployment. When FSA implemented its first software release in April 2013, MIDAS experienced significant technical problems, which is not surprising given its lack of testing. For example, users experienced significant problems with the system such as the geospatial information system (GIS) functionality, accuracy of farm record data, and system response time. Also, within 3 months after the deployment, there were 62 critical, 172 major, 236 average, and 69 minor defects that needed to be addressed. As a result, the time allotted to fix problems doubled in length—from 3 to 6 months—to accommodate the fixes required by the system. Uncertainty regarding future plans: FSA was unable to establish a revised baseline for the program after experiencing cost and schedule overruns in developing the initial system release because the proposals were too costly or not aligned with the department’s budget and IT plans. A timeline of key events include: After conducting a TechStat review in November 2012, USDA’s Office of the Chief Information Officer (CIO) directed FSA to establish a new program baseline by January 2013. However, FSA did not deliver a new baseline by the deadline. According to FSA officials, the agency made three different attempts to salvage what it could from MIDAS: In May 2013, the program submitted a proposed baseline to FSA management that included delivering the full set of envisioned MIDAS functionality by late 2016 at an increased cost. At $659 million, this new cost estimate was almost twice as expensive as the earlier baseline estimate of $330 million. FSA management did not approve the proposed baseline due to the cost. In August 2013, FSA submitted a proposal to USDA for delivering less than the full set of MIDAS functionality at a reduced cost to implement and with a shorter development schedule. Specifically, the program’s scope no longer included applications for the 2014 Farm Bill programs, which FSA decided to transfer to its web farm. The cost estimate was reduced to $583 million through fiscal year 2015 and development was to be completed by mid-2015. However, USDA’s Office of the CIO rejected this rebaseline request because it required revisions in order to align with the department’s budget plans. In February 2014, FSA submitted a proposal for the same functionality as the prior proposal at roughly the same cost and with a shorter development schedule. Under this new proposal, development was to be completed in mid-2015 at a cost of $584 million. This proposal also included a life cycle cost estimate for MIDAS of $1.026 billion through fiscal year 2021. However, in June 2014, the department’s Executive Information Technology Investment Review Board placed the program’s third rebaseline request on hold. The board wanted FSA to build the remaining functionality in smaller increments and to work in partnership with other agencies to develop an enterprisewide solution for acreage reporting and customer portal tools consistent with the 2014 Farm Bill and department priorities. After the third rebaseline proposal was not approved, the department’s review board recommended to the Secretary of Agriculture that MIDAS halt development after the completion of the customer records release. In July 2014, the Secretary decided to approve the board’s recommendation. FSA deployed its customer records release in December 2014. As of March 2015, FSA had spent about $423 million on MIDAS, which was $93 million higher than the 2012 baseline estimate of $330 million. Of the $423 million, about half was spent on the system integrator contract. Moving forward, FSA estimates that it will cost roughly $50 million to $60 million to continue to operate and maintain the system each year. As a result, MIDAS could cost approximately $825 million through the end of its useful life in 2021. Figure 2 illustrates the key events and decisions affecting MIDAS that led to the decision to halt further development, and table 1 identifies changes in MIDAS cost and schedule estimates over time. FSA has delivered a fraction of what was originally planned for MIDAS. FSA first documented high-level plans for the functionality that MIDAS was to deliver when it completed a system requirements review in December 2011. At that time, MIDAS was envisioned to provide a single SAP platform to host data, applications, and business processes for administering farm program benefits, and advanced tools for customers and FSA employees.seamlessly with other USDA systems, including USDA’s financial system, In addition, it was expected to integrate geospatial information system, and enterprise data warehouse. Figure 3 provides an overview of FSA’s planned key features for MIDAS. However, as the program ran into problems, FSA continued to remove planned features. Specifically, in June 2013, the MIDAS Senior Management Oversight Committee decided to develop applications for administering farm program benefits on FSA’s web farm rather than on the SAP platform, as originally intended, because it could no longer wait to transition from legacy systems. In addition, the ability for FSA employees to use critical acreage reporting tools with the data—a function that affects 85 percent of tasks—was removed from the program’s scope. Other key features were also removed from MIDAS, such as an online portal for farmers and other customers as well as integration with USDA’s financial system and enterprise data warehouse. As a result of removing key features from MIDAS, FSA delivered a fraction of the originally envisioned functionality. MIDAS currently provides farm and customer record data on a SAP platform that is integrated with USDA’s geospatial information system. As a result of this partial implementation, FSA employees currently access, visualize, and edit data in MIDAS. They then turn to the web farm to run acreage reporting, administer benefits, and process payments. FSA did not quantify what percentage of the originally envisioned MIDAS functions were delivered, and this task is complicated by the fact that there is not a complete set of requirements. However, if one were to weigh the key features equally, MIDAS has delivered about 20 percent of what FSA planned. That figure would be lower if one were to include the comparative importance of the functionality. For example, FSA has cited acreage reporting as a key feature affecting 85 percent of what FSA employees do and this is not included in MIDAS. In addition, integration with the financial system was one of the key reasons for going with the SAP solution, and this, too, was not delivered. Figure 4 compares the functionality planned for MIDAS in 2011 to what has been delivered. FSA did not adequately implement program management disciplines on MIDAS in four key areas—requirements development and management, project planning and monitoring, system testing, and executive-level governance—and lacks the demonstrated capacity to manage successor programs. Leading government and industry organizations call for best practices such as obtaining commitment to a requirements baseline and ensuring requirements are prioritized and traceable; managing changes to project plans and conducting progress monitoring; testing the system to determine whether it is acceptable to users; and implementing executive- level governance to include comparing performance against expectations and assessing maturity at key checkpoints based on predefined criteria. USDA and FSA policies are consistent with these best practices. However, in developing MIDAS, FSA did not adequately develop and manage requirements, effectively manage project plan changes, conduct meaningful progress monitoring, execute critical tests before the system became operational, and implement effective executive-level governance to prevent MIDAS from falling short of expectations. FSA and contractor officials explained that key practices were not always implemented because, among other things, the program’s scope was not well- understood, USDA and FSA did not follow its own policies, and management allowed the program to continue despite known weaknesses. Moreover, while FSA officials have acknowledged weaknesses in each of these management disciplines, the agency has not established plans to improve its management of successor programs. Until FSA addresses shortfalls in key program management disciplines on successor programs to MIDAS, the agency will be at an increased risk of producing additional projects with cost overruns and schedule slippages while contributing little to mission-related outcomes. Further, until FSA establishes improvement plans, it will be difficult for the agency to demonstrate that it has the capacity to effectively manage IT acquisitions and it will be at a higher risk of failure for any new or ongoing IT initiatives. Requirements establish what the system is to do, how well it is to do it, and how it is to interact with other systems. Leading industry organizations such as the Software Engineering Institute have recommended practices for the effective development and management of requirements such as eliciting stakeholder needs, ensuring that requirements are complete and unambiguous, prioritizing them, obtaining formal commitment to them, assessing any gaps with the proposed solution, and ensuring that each requirement traces back to the business need and forward to its design and testing. FSA has established policies and guidance for developing and managing requirements that are consistent with these recognized practices. Of six key practices in requirements development and management, FSA implemented one practice, partially implemented two practices, and did not implement three practices. Specifically, FSA documented requirements for MIDAS based on needs gathered from stakeholders prior to a system requirements review in December 2011 and throughout the development of the system. The agency also identified its process for addressing software gaps with the SAP solution and documented workarounds for certain capabilities. However, FSA did not adequately develop and manage MIDAS requirements because the agency did not always develop complete requirements, prioritize its requirements, obtain commitment on a requirements baseline, document solutions to gaps with SAP software that had been known for years and were required for the program’s success, and ensure that requirements were traceable to development products. Table 2 identifies the extent to which FSA implemented key practices for developing and managing requirements for MIDAS. FSA officials and supporting documentation show several reasons for the lack of requirements development and management discipline on MIDAS. For example: FSA officials noted that problems with the completeness and specificity of requirements persisted because guidance on how to ensure requirements completeness and specificity was not implemented until shortly before the system requirements review and it took time for changes to be made to the requirements. Also, officials cited challenges in the complexity of writing requirements for business processes related to GIS capabilities. For selected key milestone reviews and decision points, the program’s executive governance board did not verify that key requirements artifacts and processes were mature enough to proceed because USDA and FSA did not establish a governance process that required the board to perform such reviews. In August 2012, the IV&V contractor reported that the program’s gap analysis lacked specific details to fully understand activities for identifying, reviewing, assessing, and validating gaps. In addition, GIS was not part of the system integrator’s initial scope and additional resources and expertise had to be acquired during MIDAS’s development. FSA and contractor staff had ongoing trouble getting access to one of the program’s two requirements management tools because system access rights were controlled by a different USDA agency. While FSA worked on this issue, it continued to be a problem throughout the development of release 1. The IV&V contractor reported in March 2012 that this lack of access limited their ability to perform requirements traceability. This made it more difficult to manage the baseline scope and configuration of the release. In addition, the IV&V contractor reported in February 2014 that the program office did not follow adequate document configuration management processes to control changes, thereby making it difficult to maintain traceability between requirements and design documents. FSA officials noted that the program did not obtain a requirements baseline approval or prioritize its requirements because the program lacked the necessary discipline and rigor for requirements management activities during the first software release. FSA’s lack of requirements development and management discipline on MIDAS impacted the program in several ways. For example, by not establishing a requirements baseline the agency did not have a firm commitment on the mission-related outcomes MIDAS would satisfy. In addition, not having prioritized requirements limited the agency’s ability to make decisions on which scope to defer or remove from the program when faced with cost and schedule overruns. Both FSA and IV&V contractor officials noted that the program had demonstrated improvements in practices associated with requirements management for the second software release in December 2014. For example, an official for the IV&V contractor stated that requirements traceability was significantly better and that a requirements baseline was established for the second release. Unless FSA ensures that successor programs to MIDAS are fully implementing key requirements development and management practices, the agency will not have reasonable assurance that its IT modernization efforts will meet stakeholder needs and contribute to mission-related outcomes. Leading organizations such as the Project Management Institute and Software Engineering Institute have recommended best practices for project planning and monitoring. FSA also has policies and guidance that are consistent with recognized practices. Project planning maintains plans as the basis for managing the project’s activities. Recommended best practices call for documenting and evaluating changes to established project plans to determine whether they require updates to initial planning estimates for cost, schedule, and scope. Project monitoring provides an understanding of the project’s progress by comparing actual work completed to a plan consisting of predefined expectations for cost, schedule, and deliverables. Best practices state that monitoring progress is important because it helps project managers take timely corrective actions when performance deviates significantly from plans. Of three key practices in project planning and monitoring, FSA partially implemented one practice and did not implement two practices. The agency established a project plan for MIDAS with predefined expectations for cost, schedule, and scope based on its integrated baseline review in March 2012. For several months following this review, the program executed to these plans and tracked certain technical and programmatic changes in its change control log. However, the agency did not effectively manage plan changes or monitor progress. For example, FSA did not update its baseline plans when it revised the solution architecture and when it deferred planned testing activities before the initial software release. In addition, FSA continued to develop deferred functionality for approximately 20 months without an approved rebaseline for these efforts. Also, FSA’s initial monitoring of contractor performance lacked insight into the progress of deliverables and contractor performance reporting was halted from December 2012 through October 2014. Table 3 identifies the extent to which FSA implemented key practices for project planning and monitoring for MIDAS. USDA and FSA officials provided several explanations for the agency’s shortfalls in project planning and monitoring. FSA officials acknowledged that they did not update baseline project plans to reflect changes in the solution architecture and testing phases prior to the initial software release, but noted that they briefed the Senior Management Oversight Committee on these changes. The USDA CIO noted that MIDAS halted progress monitoring of contractors in December 2012 because managers were already aware that the program was performing poorly and was in need of a rebaseline. Also, the Director of the MIDAS business management office stated that while the program’s cost baseline was not at a detailed level, the contractors’ cost estimates included additional details on work products and deliverables. However, the program was not monitoring progress based on those details. By not revising the project plan after making significant revisions to its approach, the program’s cost, schedule, and scope were no longer effective benchmarks for measuring performance. Without meaningful progress monitoring initially and as the program shifted its focus, program managers and executive stakeholders had less insight into the deliverables being produced by contractors and less control over the program’s outcomes. According to FSA and IV&V contractor officials, the program provided a baselined cost, schedule, and scope for its second software release and executed improved discipline in managing plan changes. However, until FSA ensures that successor programs to MIDAS are fully implementing key project planning and monitoring practices, the agency will be at an increased risk that future projects will experience cost and schedule overruns and achieve less than expected outcomes. According to relevant leading industry practices and government guidance, system testing should be progressive, meaning that it should consist of well-defined test plans and a series of test events that build on and complement previous events in the series. Testing should first focus on the performance of individual system components, then on the performance of integrated system components, followed by system-level tests that focus on whether the system (or major system increments) is acceptable, interoperable with related systems, and operationally suitable to users. FSA established policies and guidance for system testing on MIDAS that are consistent with recognized practices. Of four key practices in system testing, FSA implemented one practice, partially implemented two, and did not implement one. FSA defined test plans for MIDAS, but the agency did not execute critical performance and user testing before the system became operational. FSA had test plans in place that generally defined key elements, such as the roles and responsibilities of groups that were to conduct testing, hardware and software to support testing, and a schedule that defined how long and in what order test events were to occur. In addition, FSA conducted testing on individual and integrated components. However, MIDAS’s test plans were missing a key element—traceability between system test events and requirements. Also, integration testing took longer than planned and the program decided to defer testing that was to validate whether system performance met requirements and was acceptable to users until after the system went live. Table 4 identifies the extent to which FSA implemented key system testing practices for MIDAS. FSA’s shortfalls in system testing were due in part to technical problems and delays in developing GIS capabilities and a desire by department and agency management to keep the target deadline for the initial release of MIDAS. Early in the development of the GIS capabilities, FSA ran into technical problems that required additional time and resources to address. Since GIS development had been delayed, integration testing with the GIS capabilities also had to be delayed. By April 2013, integration testing was still ongoing and FSA had to make a decision whether to delay the implementation of MIDAS or allow the system to go live while accepting the risk of not conducting performance/stress, regression, and user acceptance testing. While the program warned of the risks of deploying MIDAS with outstanding defects and incomplete testing, senior department and agency officials decided to accept these risks in order to deploy the system by April 2013. Incomplete testing on MIDAS did not provide users an opportunity to identify key problems with the system and whether it met their needs before it went live. After the system went live, users experienced significant problems such as GIS functionality, accuracy of farm record data, and system response time. Within 3 months after the initial MIDAS release, there were 62 critical, 172 major, 236 average, and 69 minor defects that needed to be addressed. The program had a plan in place to address performance problems after the system went live, but, due to the number of problems, it had to extend the contract for addressing system defects from 3 months to 6 months. FSA officials and the program’s IV&V contractor have acknowledged the shortfalls in system testing practices and stated that the program has taken steps to improve system testing on the second and final MIDAS release. For example, FSA and IV&V contractor officials noted that the program conducted user acceptance testing prior to deploying functionality for managing customer records (also called business partner functionality). While the agency recognized the need to improve its testing on the second MIDAS release, it has not demonstrated that it has institutionalized sound system testing practices. Until it does so, the agency will be at higher risk of delivering systems that have performance issues and do not fully meet users’ expectations. We assessed best practices used in industry, academia, and government to develop the IT Investment Management Framework to provide a method for evaluating and assessing how well an agency is selecting and managing its IT resources. Efforts to build a foundation for IT governance involve establishing specific critical processes, such as instituting investment boards, selecting investments, controlling investments as they are developed and deployed, and reviewing investments after they are deployed. Instituting investment boards. Successful organizations establish an IT investment board comprised of senior executives who are responsible for operating according to documented guidance, policies, and procedures that align with existing IT governance processes, identify decision gates to be reviewed and approved by the board, and establish entry/exit criteria to be reviewed at each decision gate. The board is also responsible for ensuring that investment decisions address stakeholder needs and are made in the best interest of the organization. Selecting IT investments. Successful organizations identify, use, and store comprehensive data—including a business case that defines the life cycle cost estimate and benefits to be realized—in order to support investment decision making. Reselecting ongoing projects is an important part of this critical process; if a project is not meeting established goals and objectives, the organization must make a decision on whether or not to continue to fund it. Controlling IT investments. Organizations should have a documented, well-defined process for overseeing ongoing investments once they have been selected. Effective investment oversight and evaluation involves, among other things, (1) comparing actual performance against cost and schedule estimates; and (2) assessing whether projects are meeting expectations against developmental milestones using predefined criteria and decision gates, and taking corrective actions when expectations are not being met. Reviewing IT investments after deployment. Once the project has transitioned from the development phase to the operations and maintenance phase, organizations should conduct a post- implementation review to compare actual investment results with decision makers’ expectations for cost, schedule, performance, and mission improvement outcomes. The lessons learned from these reviews can be used to modify future investment management decision making. In 2013, USDA issued updated policies and guidance that are generally consistent with these practices. Of five key practices in executive-level IT governance, FSA partially implemented two practices and did not implement three practices. Specifically, FSA partially implemented steps to institute a governance board. It established a governance structure and process for MIDAS; however, its governance process was ineffective in preventing MIDAS from falling short of expectations. Specifically, FSA did not implement key steps for selecting and controlling investments, including establishing a comprehensive business case or life cycle cost estimate and comparing actual performance against estimates. Also, FSA partially implemented post-implementation review practices. The agency tasked a contractor with assessing the results and lessons learned from portions of MIDAS that were implemented; however, it did not conduct a comprehensive review of the lessons learned on the program as a whole. Table 5 identifies the extent to which USDA and FSA implemented key executive governance practices for MIDAS. The governance of MIDAS was ineffective, in part, because USDA’s Office of the CIO did not ensure that MIDAS followed its policies and guidance for IT governance. In 2011, we reported that governance boards had not been reviewing MIDAS at key decision points using criteria defined in department guidance and recommended that the department and agency collaborate to document how the department is meeting its policy for IT investment management for MIDAS, to include investment reviews.not address it while MIDAS was in development. According to FSA officials, USDA did not have guidance for IT governance providing defined decision gates with standard criteria and documentation While the department agreed with our recommendation, it did requirements. FSA officials noted that from 2011 until 2013, the agency used a governance process involving a program-specific gate review plan for MIDAS based on SAP’s system development methodology. USDA’s Under Secretary for Farm and Foreign Agriculture Services and the Chief Financial Officer stated that there was a breakdown in the governance process for MIDAS, particularly on its initial development. The Under Secretary noted that the Senior Management Oversight Committee made the best decisions it could based on the information it had, but the information that FSA had reported to the committee did not adequately portray the extent of the cost, schedule, and technical problems or decisions that had been made on scope changes. For example, the Under Secretary and the Chief Financial Officer stated that they were not informed that FSA had been developing key functions in both MIDAS and on the agency’s web farm—a key change in the original scope—until early 2013. In addition, the Under Secretary and the Chief Financial Officer noted that they were not informed until early 2013 that FSA had made decisions to remove or defer additional scope—including acreage reporting—from the first software release. Subsequently, in 2013, MIDAS began piloting USDA’s new IT governance process, called the Integrated IT Governance Framework. This framework required MIDAS to report its performance to and obtain approval from a department-level investment review board. In following this new governance framework, the investment review board approved the final decision to implement the second MIDAS software release and recommended to the Secretary of Agriculture to halt further development on MIDAS. While the recently updated governance framework established by USDA has potential for improving FSA’s IT modernization efforts, unless USDA and FSA take additional steps or develop a mechanism to help ensure that successor programs to MIDAS programs are fully implementing key executive IT governance practices—including practices for selecting, controlling, and reviewing investments—department and agency management will not have reasonable assurance that oversight is effective in preventing future IT investments from falling short of expectations. Required by law to automate, integrate, and modernize its farm program services, FSA has begun planning how it will do so. In an explanatory statement accompanying the 2015 appropriations act, Congress directed USDA to, among other things, deliver a modernized functional system that builds existing farm program applications into an integrated system, delivers increased efficiency and security, retires redundant legacy systems, eliminates the path of siloed legacy applications, capitalizes on the investment that USDA has already made in the enterprise platform, addresses the new requirements of the 2014 Farm Bill, and improves on the capabilities originally proposed to Congress and the nation’s farmers and ranchers. The appropriations act also mandated that FSA develop a plan for IT related to MIDAS and other farm program delivery systems prior to obligating more than 50 percent of the $132 million made available in fiscal year 2015. This plan is to identify each investment’s capabilities and mission benefits, estimated life cycle cost, key milestones, and alignment with FSA’s IT Roadmap. In addition, the 2014 Farm Bill includes provisions for streamlining acreage reporting to reduce the administrative burden on farmers and producers. This is to be done by, among other things, requiring the Secretary of Agriculture to ensure that producers may report information electronically (including geospatial data) and that improvements are made in the areas of coordination, information sharing, and administrative work with FSA, the Risk Management Agency, and the Natural Resources Conservation Service. FSA has begun planning how it will move forward in its modernization efforts to fulfill the functionality that was envisioned—but not delivered— by MIDAS. According to FSA officials, the agency plans to document its decisions for addressing acreage reporting tools, online customer tools, and other functionality that was removed from MIDAS in its IT Roadmap by the end of Spring 2015. Those plans may include decisions to partner with other USDA agencies, acquire new commercial off-the-shelf software, and/or develop and enhance functionality on the agency’s web farm. In its fiscal year 2016 budget request, FSA noted that, while the mix of investments may fluctuate based on its prioritization process and business requirements, the agency intends to pursue incremental, modular investments such as the following. Customer self-service tools: Expanding on existing online services and partnering with other USDA agencies (including the Acreage Crop Reporting Streamlining Initiative) to provide farmers and ranchers online access to relevant information, including remote and/or mobile access to their data and programs. Expanded customer service: Piloting a program to find new ways to deliver programs and service support through the agency’s repository of geospatial and farm information. Increased IT investments to support FSA process improvements: Delivering incremental improvements to address pain points and inefficiencies identified by field office staff as impacting their effectiveness in servicing customers. Improvements in the pipeline could range from simple items such as simplifying the printing of farm maps or customized reports to continuing the incremental integration of stove-piped systems through establishing or enhancing common eligibility, payment, and obligation frameworks. In addition, FSA officials stated that the agency is incorporating lessons learned into future plans, including building smaller, incremental releases with a defined scope, cost, and schedule and defined benefits for the customer; extending an organizational change agency network to provide input on pain points and process improvements; driving the prioritization of investments through business needs instead of technology; and integrating technology capabilities, including SAP, into decision- making processes and alternatives analyses, so the technologies for each project will be determined based on what best matches the business requirements. However, FSA has not established plans to improve its ability to successfully manage major IT investments. Specifically, FSA officials have not committed to improving agency practices in the four areas we reviewed because they believe that they have already addressed the problems. While agency officials acknowledge that mistakes were made on the first MIDAS release, they stated that they did a better job delivering the second release. For example, the MIDAS Program Executive reported that the agency established requirements for the second release, established a schedule for developing and deploying the release, performed adequate testing prior to deploying the release, and that oversight bodies were kept informed. While the second release was more successful than the first, it was much less complex. The second release involved a limited amount of functionality that had been in development for several years before it was deferred from the first release. Further, the relatively discrete amount of work involved and the establishment of baseline plans 3 months prior to the release allowed the project to deliver near cost and schedule estimates. These efforts, however, are not sufficient to demonstrate that FSA will adhere to departmental policy or that it has practices in place to successfully plan, develop, and oversee future complex IT investments. USDA’s Under Secretary for Farm and Foreign Agriculture Services and Chief Financial Officer agreed that plans are needed to improve FSA’s ability to successfully manage IT investments. Until FSA establishes and implements improvement plans, it will be difficult to demonstrate that it has the capacity to manage IT acquisitions and the agency will have a higher risk of failure in future IT initiatives. After spending about $423 million through March 2015, the MIDAS program was halted about 10 years after it was initiated. Key factors that led to the decision to halt the program included cost overruns totaling $93 million more than planned, schedule delays, performance issues, and management’s inability to decide on how to restructure the program for success. In deploying the two MIDAS releases, FSA delivered about one-fifth of the functionality it had planned to deliver. MIDAS was envisioned to provide a seamless, integrated system that would allow farmers and ranchers to submit information electronically and allow FSA employees to process farm program benefits with built-in tools and access to GIS and other enterprise systems. However, due to the limited functionality that MIDAS provided, farmers and ranchers continue to submit information to FSA service centers in person while employees continue to use separate systems for processing acreage reports, farm program applications, and payments. Even though USDA and FSA have system acquisition policies that are consistent with best practices in the areas of requirements development and management, project planning and monitoring, system testing, and executive-level governance, FSA did not implement the majority of these policies and practices in developing MIDAS and has not established plans to improve its approach. Until FSA establishes and implements a plan to adhere to agency policies and best practices, it will be difficult to demonstrate that it has the capacity to effectively manage IT acquisitions. Further, until the agency adheres to system acquisition policies and sound IT practices, it will have a higher risk of failure in future IT initiatives. In order to institutionalize sound IT management practices and build FSA’s IT management capacity while improving service to the Nation’s farmers and ranchers, we are making five recommendations to the Secretary of Agriculture to: Direct the FSA Administrator to establish and implement an improvement plan to guide the agency in adopting recognized best practices and following agency policy. Direct the FSA Administrator to adhere to recognized best practices and agency policy in developing and managing system requirements before proceeding with any further system development to deliver previously envisioned MIDAS functionality. Specifically, the Administrator should ensure that requirements are complete, unambiguous, and prioritized; commitment to requirements is obtained through a formal requirements baseline; differences (or gaps) between the requirements and capabilities of the intended solution (including commercial off-the-shelf solutions) are analyzed; strategies to address any gaps are developed; and requirements are traced forward and backward among development products. Direct the FSA Administrator to adhere to recognized best practices and agency policy in planning and monitoring projects. Specifically, the Administrator should ensure that project plans include predefined expectations for cost, schedule, and deliverables before proceeding with any further system development; updates to the project plan are made through change control processes; and progress against the project plan, including work performed by contractors, is monitored. Direct the FSA Administrator to adhere to recognized best practices and agency policy in system testing. Specifically, the Administrator should establish well-defined test plans before proceeding with any further system development, and ensure that testing of (a) individual system components, (b) the integration of system components, and (c) the end-to-end system are conducted. Direct the FSA Administrator to adhere to recognized best practices and agency policy in executive-level IT governance before proceeding with any further system development. Specifically, an executive-level governance board should review and approve a comprehensive business case that includes a life cycle cost estimate, a cost-benefit analysis, and an analysis of alternatives for proposed solutions that are to provide former MIDAS requirements prior to their implementation; ensure that any programs that are to accommodate former MIDAS requirements are fully implementing the IT program management disciplines and practices identified in this report; conduct a post-implementation review and document lessons learned for the MIDAS investment; and reassess the viability of the MIDAS technical solution before investing in further modernization technologies. We sought comments on a draft of this report from USDA. We subsequently received written comments from the FSA Administrator. While the agency did not explicitly agree or disagree with the recommendations, it cited steps it had taken and plans to take to implement best practices in the areas of requirements management, project planning and monitoring, system testing, and executive IT governance. However, the agency did not cite steps it would take to establish and implement an improvement plan to guide the agency in adopting recognized best practices and following agency policy. Because the agency is moving to implement best practices, we continue to believe that a plan—with steps, milestones, and performance measures—is warranted. Without such a plan, it will be difficult for the agency to demonstrate its progress and ensure that it has the capacity to manage IT acquisitions. In its overall comments, FSA noted the following: FSA stated that it has taken active steps to address the issues raised in the draft report by selecting a new CIO and initiating steps to acquire a third party assessor to holistically evaluate the technology solution for MIDAS and to make recommendations to inform a coherent IT strategy. We agree that selecting a CIO and obtaining recommendations on how to improve FSA’s IT strategy are sound steps. However, these steps are not enough to address the issues raised in this report. FSA must take additional steps to establish an improvement plan, and to implement practices and follow agency policy. FSA stated that the recommendation by the USDA Executive IT Governance Board and the July 2014 decision by the Secretary of Agriculture to halt MIDAS development beyond release 2 (which FSA established to deliver the residual portion of the customer records functionality) allowed the agency to (1) focus attention and resources on applying lessons learned from release 1 and (2) apply program management best practices across key disciplines such as planning, requirements management, cost and schedule management, and system testing. We agree that the decision to halt MIDAS was a sound one, and that it allowed the agency to focus on the residual deliverables provided by release 2. However, we identified several management shortfalls that continued to persist after release 1 was deployed in April 2013. For example, FSA did not update its baseline cost, schedule, and scope plans from March 2012 to October 2014, even though it made significant decisions affecting scope and schedule. Also, from November 2012 through October 2014, the program did not have a project plan for monitoring progress due to numerous scope and schedule changes and relied on status reporting from draft schedules. In addition, while the USDA CIO gave the investment a “red” (high-risk) rating on the Federal IT Dashboard in December 2012, the MIDAS Senior Management Oversight Committee allowed MIDAS to continue until July 2014 without any improvement to the CIO’s rating. These findings are discussed in this report. FSA stated that the organizational alignment around comprehensive improvement and quality of the MIDAS program (associated with release 2) is a clear demonstration of the agency’s capability to properly manage and deliver IT systems. However, until FSA establishes and implements a plan to adhere to agency policies and best practices, we believe the agency has not yet demonstrated that it has the capacity to effectively manage IT acquisitions. FSA noted that the MIDAS program demonstrated an improvement in testing practices on release 2. Specifically, FSA stated that the period of time for transitioning from deployment to steady state concluded with zero critical defects and five major defects. We agree and acknowledged the agency’s improvements on system testing associated with the development of customer records in the report. Specifically, we noted that the program conducted user acceptance testing prior to deploying functionality for managing customer records. However, it has been our experience that it takes time to change an organization’s culture to adopt best practices. The agency will need to build upon this experience to ensure it consistently implements sound practices and follows agency policies in all future IT initiatives. We continue to believe that establishing and implementing an improvement plan, as we recommended, will aid the agency in doing so. FSA stated that, since the first deployment of MIDAS functionality in April 2013, the agency implemented top-down organizational transformation to bolster FSA's ability to consistently deliver IT investments that provide their intended business value, within the targeted schedule and budget. The agency also stated that the MIDAS initiative identified a number of best practices that are being emulated to improve IT management agencywide. However, FSA did not provide supporting evidence for these efforts and our previously stated findings show that FSA did not sufficiently monitor project progress well beyond the first MIDAS release. FSA stated that while our report acknowledges some of its improvements, our assessment of the extent to which USDA and FSA had implemented each management discipline reflects findings based on MIDAS release 1 activities, and therefore is not truly representative of FSA’s capacity to more broadly manage IT initiatives. We believe our report accurately evaluates the implementation of key program management disciplines on the MIDAS acquisition. Our review assessed processes and practices over roughly 3 years (from December 2011 to October 2014), which included a significant amount of work on the customer records functionality. Specifically, the customer records functionality represented 1 of the 24 unique features FSA had originally planned for MIDAS as of December 2011. FSA had begun working on customer records in December 2011, and delivered about 30 percent of the customer records functionality with the initial MIDAS software release in April 2013. When faced with the firm commitment to deploy release 1 in April 2013, the agency decided to defer the remaining customer records functionality to release 2. Further demonstrating the limited scope of release 2, FSA established baseline project plans for release 2 in October 2014, just 3 months before deploying it in December 2014. While our report acknowledges that FSA improved selected practices in developing and deploying release 2, we do not believe that the scope or timeframe associated with this initiative provides sufficient evidence that FSA has established the capacity to manage large, complex acquisitions. In addition, FSA provided the following comments regarding our recommendations: With respect to our recommendation to establish and implement an improvement plan to guide the agency in adopting recognized best practices and following agency policy, FSA stated that the agency has undergone leadership transformation efforts over the last 12 months, including appointing a new Administrator, CIO, MIDAS Program Executive, and MIDAS Program Director. FSA noted that it gave additional reporting authority to the MIDAS Program Executive and moved the FSA CIO position from Kanas City, Missouri to Washington, D.C. to improve communication with the Administrator on agencywide initiatives. FSA stated that over the past year, FSA leadership placed additional emphasis, funding, and staff resources on ensuring that IT investments, decisions, dependencies, and operational plans are driven by business needs across the agency. The agency also stated that with its Business Strategy and IT Strategy, it is maturing IT planning and management capabilities needed for integrated IT solutions for Farm Programs and all of FSA’s lines of business. Finally, FSA noted that it is using a Strategic IT Roadmap to ensure IT programs are supporting the Business Strategy. We agree that FSA has taken steps over the past year to improve its IT management capabilities as we discuss in the report. However, these actions do not establish and implement an improvement plan to guide the agency in adopting recognized best practices and following agency policy. Until FSA does so, it will be difficult to demonstrate that it has the capacity to manage IT acquisitions. Thus, as previously discussed, we believe the agency should continue to establish and implement such an improvement plan. Regarding our recommendation to adhere to recognized best practices and agency policy in developing and managing system requirements before proceeding with any further system development to deliver previously envisioned MIDAS functionality, FSA stated that the MIDAS program implemented all of the key practices for release 2. As previously stated, our report acknowledges that FSA improved selected practices in developing and deploying release 2. However, we do not believe that the scope or timeframe associated with this initiative provide sufficient evidence that FSA has improved its capacity to manage large, complex acquisitions. Further, we identified selected shortfalls in requirements management for release 2, including weaknesses in requirements traceability and prioritization. Moving forward, FSA stated that it will improve the rigor and adherence to key requirements management processes for all IT projects. We will continue to monitor the agency’s efforts to implement our recommendation. Regarding adhering to recognized best practices and agency policy in planning and monitoring projects, FSA stated that the MIDAS program implemented all of the key practices for release 2. As previously stated, our report acknowledges that FSA improved selected practices in developing and deploying release 2. However, we do not believe that the scope or timeframe associated with this initiative provide sufficient evidence that FSA has improved its capacity to manage large, complex acquisitions. Further, our report identified shortfalls in program monitoring in the run up to deploying release 2, including weaknesses in updating project baselines to reflect program changes and in monitoring progress against a defined project plan. Moving forward, FSA stated that it would continue to mature and strengthen its project planning and monitoring practices through a partnership with a third-party capital planning center of excellence and through corrective action plans to address identified weaknesses. It also stated that it is implementing earned value management practices on MIDAS going forward. We will continue to monitor the agency’s efforts to implement our recommendation. With respect to our recommendation to adhere to recognized best practices and agency policy in system testing, FSA stated that it established renewed commitment to MIDAS testing efforts and implemented all of the key practices for release 2. As previously stated, our report acknowledges that FSA improved selected practices in developing and deploying release 2. However, we do not believe that the scope or timeframe associated with this initiative provide sufficient evidence that FSA has improved its capacity to manage large, complex acquisitions. Moving forward, FSA noted that it plans to adhere to recognized best practices and agency policy in pursuing consistent or increased rigor around system testing to demonstrate the agency’s testing capabilities are consistent and repeatable across all IT projects. We will continue to monitor the agency’s efforts to implement our recommendation. Regarding our recommendation to adhere to best practices and agency policy in executive-level IT governance before proceeding with any further system development, FSA stated that it is evaluating its governance structure to potentially include establishing work groups that would evaluate IT initiatives at a more granular level of detail. FSA also stated that it is working with USDA’s Office of the CIO to determine how MIDAS will align with the department’s governance framework and to identify the appropriate gate reviews, artifacts, and level of oversight. We will continue to monitor the agency’s efforts to implement our recommendation. Overall, FSA’s poor performance and lack of results for more than 2 years contributed to its inability to deliver most of the intended functionality and led the Secretary of Agriculture to direct the agency to halt further development after release 2. The efforts that continued after USDA decided to halt further development on MIDAS in July 2014 and through the delivery of release 2 in December 2014 were to salvage a feature (customer records) that was almost fully developed by the time the department made this decision. Our assessments of project planning and monitoring and executive IT governance practices already include FSA’s efforts to manage the overall program and to continue developing customer records through October 2014. Nonetheless, if we were to consider FSA’s efforts on release 2 beginning in October 2014, we would have altered just 1 of the 18 key practices (conducting user testing) due to weaknesses that persisted beyond the deployment of release 1 in April 2013. To its credit, FSA has (1) acknowledged that management improvements are needed and identified steps the agency plans to take; (2) made changes in key leadership positions; and (3) committed to delivering smaller, iterative IT projects going forward. However, our experience in reviewing federal IT acquisitions has shown that it takes time to build repeatable, robust processes. Implementing improvements during the last few months of a 3-year effort is not enough to demonstrate repeatable IT management capacity. As we recommended, FSA needs an improvement plan to guide the agency in adopting recognized best practices and following agency policy as well as a long-term institutional commitment to comprehensively build these processes going forward. Given the complexity and challenges in reengineering and improving FSA services, the agency also needs to demonstrate on an ongoing basis that it can follow policy, manage acquisitions, and deliver needed functionality. FSA’s comments are reprinted in appendix III. The agency also provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate. We are sending copies of this report to interested congressional committees, the Secretary of Agriculture, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, and other interested parties. In addition, this report will be available on the GAO Web site at http://www.gao.gov. If you or your staffs have any questions on the matters discussed in this report, please contact me at (202) 512-9286 or at pownerd@gao.gov. Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. GAO staff who made major contributions to this report are listed in appendix IV. Our objectives were to (1) describe what led to the recent decision to halt further development on MIDAS, (2) compare the functionality that MIDAS has implemented to its original plans, and (3) evaluate the adequacy of key program management disciplines in place for MIDAS and successor programs. To describe what led to the decision to halt further MIDAS development, we reviewed documentation such as program planning artifacts, status reports, key milestone reviews, and departmental or external reviews of MIDAS. We identified key events and decisions from the program’s December 2011 requirements review through the July 2014 decision to halt further development on MIDAS. We analyzed the impact of these events and decisions on MIDAS’s cost, schedule, scope, and performance. Based on our analysis of key events and decisions, we summarized the data in a timeline and identified key factors that led to the decision to halt further development. We compared our assessments with rationale provided by USDA for its decision to determine whether it was similar to the factors we identified. We also interviewed relevant agency and contractor officials to obtain their perspectives on what led to the decision to halt further development of MIDAS. We compared the functionality that MIDAS has implemented to its original plans by reviewing the program’s December 2011 requirements and identifying 24 unique features planned for MIDAS across 6 categories: architecture, data, employee tools, customer tools, system integration, and applications. We confirmed the delivered functionality by reviewing program artifacts—including system test reports; program design documentation; requirements traceability matrices; change request logs; system architecture illustrations; status reports to the program’s Senior Management Oversight Committee, the Office of Management and Budget, and Congress; Exhibit 300 updates; budget requests; assessments by the program’s independent verification and validation contractor; and proposals to rebaseline program scope—for evidence that the features had been implemented, deferred, or removed from scope. We also obtained a live demonstration of the MIDAS system in a FSA service center. We then compared the delivered functionality with what was originally planned and developed graphics to illustrate what was planned, delivered, and removed from the program. We also interviewed relevant agency officials to discuss the original plans for MIDAS and obtain clarification on functionality that FSA implemented. To evaluate the extent to which USDA and FSA implemented key IT program management disciplines, we assessed the implementation of key practices and standards identified by the Project Management Institute, the Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, and GAO in the areas of (a) requirements development and management, (b) project planning and monitoring, (c) system testing, and (d) executive governance. Specifically, we assessed the extent to which USDA and FSA had implemented each of the following 18 practices on the program from December 2011 through October 2014. Requirements development and management: elicit stakeholder needs and expectations, ensure requirements are complete and unambiguous, ensure requirements are prioritized, obtain commitment to requirements through a formal requirements analyze differences between the requirements and capabilities of the intended solution (including commercial off-the-shelf solutions) and address gaps, and ensure that requirements trace forward and backward among development products. Project planning and monitoring: establish a project plan with predefined expectations for cost, schedule, and deliverables; update the project plan through change control procedures; and monitor progress against the project plan, including work performed by contractors. establish well-defined test plans to include key elements such as roles and responsibilities, test environment and infrastructure, tested items and approach, a requirements traceability matrix linked to test cases, risk and mitigation strategies, a testing schedule, and quality assurance procedures; test individual system components; test the integration of system components; and perform end-to-end system testing to determine whether the system is acceptable, interoperable with related systems, and operationally suitable to users. establish a board and document a well-defined structure and process for investment oversight; ensure that investments have a comprehensive business case and use it to compare and select among alternative investments; compare actual performance against estimates; assess whether projects are meeting expectations using predefined criteria and checkpoints and take corrective action when expectations are not being met; and conduct post-implementation reviews to validate actual investment results as compared to decision makers’ expectations for cost, schedule, performance, and mission improvement outcomes and to identify lessons learned that can be applied to future investments.\n\n### Summary:", "answer": "Since 2004, FSA has spent about $423 million to modernize IT systems through a program known as MIDAS. FSA planned for this program to replace aging hardware and software applications and to provide a single platform to manage all of the agency's farm programs. However, the agency experienced significant challenges in managing this program. In July 2014, the Secretary of Agriculture decided to halt MIDAS after the completion of a second software release. GAO was asked to review the MIDAS program. This report (1) describes what led to the decision to halt further MIDAS development, (2) compares the functionality that MIDAS has implemented to its original plans, and (3) evaluates the adequacy of key program management disciplines in place for MIDAS and successor programs. To do so, GAO analyzed agency policies and guidance; evaluated program management plans and related artifacts, program and contractor status reports, program milestone artifacts, and lessons learned; obtained a live demonstration of MIDAS; and interviewed agency and contractor officials. The key factors that led to the decision to halt the Modernize and Innovate the Delivery of Agricultural Systems (MIDAS) program were poor program performance and uncertainty regarding future plans. The Farm Service Agency (FSA) experienced significant cost overruns and schedule delays, deferred the majority of the envisioned features, skipped key tests, and deployed software in April 2013 that was slow and inaccurate. In addition, FSA struggled to establish a new program baseline as estimates grew from $330 million to $659 million and time frames were delayed from early 2014 to late 2016. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and FSA did not approve three different baseline proposals by the time the program was halted. By March 2015, MIDAS had overrun its baseline cost estimate by $93 million. FSA has delivered about 20 percent of the functionality that was originally planned for MIDAS. FSA envisioned MIDAS as a single platform to host data, tools, and applications for administering farm program benefits that would be integrated with USDA financial, geospatial, and data warehouse systems. However, FSA delivered a platform that hosts data for administering farm program benefits and is integrated with USDA's geospatial system; it does not host tools and applications for administering benefits, and is not integrated with USDA's financial system or data warehouse. FSA did not have key program management disciplines in place for MIDAS, and lacks the capacity to effectively manage successor programs. Of 18 key practices associated with sound IT acquisition and investment management and required by USDA or FSA policy, FSA implemented 2, partially implemented 7 practices, and did not implement 9 others. For example, USDA and FSA did not establish a complete set of requirements, perform key tests before deploying the system, or provide effective oversight as the program floundered for 2 years. Moving forward, FSA has begun planning how it will continue to automate, integrate, and modernize its farm program services through additional system development initiatives. However, the agency has not yet established plans to improve its management capabilities. Until FSA establishes and implements such a plan, the agency will continue to lack the fundamental capacity to manage IT acquisitions. Further, until FSA addresses shortfalls in key program management disciplines on successor programs to MIDAS, the agency will be at an increased risk of having additional projects that overrun cost and schedule estimates and contribute little to mission-related outcomes. GAO is making five recommendations to FSA, including establishing and implementing a plan for adopting recognized best practices. GAO received written comments from the FSA administrator. While the agency did not explicitly agree or disagree with the recommendations, it cited steps it has taken or plans to take to implement best practices."}

According to NHTSA, the rate of 1.10 fatalities per 100 million vehicle miles traveled in 2011 represented an all-time low and was 28 percent lower than the rate of 1.52 in 2001. DOT has attributed reductions in fatality rates to several factors, including increased use of in-vehicle safety features such as safety belts and a reduction in fatalities related to alcohol-impaired driving. In recent years, automobile manufacturers have begun to equip some newly manufactured vehicles with sensor-based crash avoidance technologies intended to prevent accidents and further reduce the number of fatalities. These technologies employ sensors such as cameras, radio detection and ranging, and light detection and ranging to observe a vehicle’s surroundings. A vehicle equipped with such technologies is capable of detecting potential collisions with other vehicles or obstacles within a range of about 150 meters (about 500 feet) and alerting drivers through applications such as forward collision warnings and lane departure warnings; however, such warnings are limited to the threats within the field of view of the vehicle’s sensors. DOT has worked with the automobile industry and others to lead and fund research on connected vehicle technologies, which include V2V technologies as well as vehicle-to-infrastructure technologies. From fiscal years 2003 through 2012, the funding DOT has made available for efforts on connected vehicle technologies, part of its Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) research program, totaled about $445 million and ranged from a low of $17 million in 2008 to a high of $84 million in 2011. In a connected vehicle environment, data is shared wirelessly among vehicles (V2V communications) or between vehicles and infrastructure (vehicle-to- infrastructure communications) using dedicated short-range communications (DSRC), a technology similar to Wi-Fi that offers a link through which vehicles and infrastructure can transmit messages over a range of about 300 to 500 meters (about 1,000 to 1,600 feet). Based on analysis of internal data and data received from other vehicles, a vehicle equipped with V2V technologies is able to issue a warning to its driver when a collision with another similarly equipped vehicle could occur. The range of V2V communications is not only greater than that of existing sensor-based technologies, but due to the sharing of data between vehicles, V2V technologies are capable of alerting drivers to potential collisions that are not visible to existing sensor-based technologies, such as a stopped vehicle blocked from view or a moving vehicle at a blind intersection (see fig. 1). While V2V technologies send and receive data among vehicles, vehicle- to-infrastructure technologies send and receive data between vehicles and infrastructure, such as traffic signals. Vehicle-to-infrastructure technologies could offer additional safety features that V2V technologies cannot, such as providing drivers with additional warnings when traffic signals are about to change, warnings that could help reduce collisions at intersections. In addition, these technologies can offer potential mobility and environmental benefits; for example, they can collect, analyze, and provide drivers with data on upcoming roadway and traffic conditions and suggest alternate routes when roadways are congested. In addition to federal efforts, automobile manufacturers have formed a number of consortia to research and develop V2V communication-based technologies and have collaborated with DOT on these efforts. Since 2002, DOT has awarded $77 million in funding, under cost-sharing agreements to support projects related to V2V technologies, to a number of consortia established by the Crash Avoidance Metrics Partnership (CAMP). This partnership between Ford Motor Company and General Motors, L.L.C. is currently working with 6 other automobile manufacturers through the Vehicle Safety Communications (VSC) 3 Consortium to collaboratively address safety issues through advancements in vehicle communications. Additionally, the Vehicle Infrastructure Integration Consortium (VIIC) was created in 2005 and is currently comprised of 10 automobile manufacturers with the goal of identifying and promoting policy solutions needed to support the development and deployment of V2V and vehicle-to-infrastructure technologies. The automobile industry (as well as some technology companies such as Google) is also working to develop autonomous vehicle technologies, which would control steering, acceleration, and braking without a driver’s input. Some automobile manufacturers have started to introduce semi- autonomous sensor-based technologies capable of reducing a vehicle’s speed through adaptive cruise control or even stopping a vehicle through automatic braking when a collision is imminent. Autonomous vehicles are being designed with the intent that a driver is needed to provide destination or navigation information, but not needed to control the vehicle. Because V2V communications depend upon DSRC technology to transmit data among vehicles, the deployment of V2V technologies will require use of the radio-frequency spectrum. FCC has allocated spectrum for use by DSRC technologies that are part of DOT’s ITS research program. Specifically, in 1999, FCC allocated 75 megahertz (MHz) of spectrum—the 5.850 to 5.925 gigahertz (GHz) band (5.9 GHz band)— for the primary purpose of improving transportation safety and adopted basic technical rules for DSRC operations. In 2003, FCC established licensing and service rules for the 5.9 GHz band to provide a short-range, wireless link for transferring information between vehicles and roadside systems. However, the President and Congress have responded to growing demand for wireless broadband services by making changes in the law to promote efficient use of spectrum, including the band previously set aside for use by DSRC-based technologies. For example, the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 required the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) to conduct a study evaluating spectrum-sharing technologies and the potential risk to federal users if unlicensed devices were allowed to operate in the 5.9 GHz band. Given the potential benefits of V2V technologies, NHTSA has said it will decide by the end of 2013 how it will proceed with respect to these technologies for passenger vehicles. According to NHTSA officials, they are considering several possible actions, including announcing NHTSA’s intent to pursue future regulatory action, such as a proposed rulemaking to mandate the installation of these technologies in newly manufactured passenger vehicles and continuing to research and develop these technologies for passenger vehicles. Efforts by DOT and the automobile industry to develop V2V technologies have reached the point at which they have been tested in a 12-month, real world pilot that will conclude in February 2014. These efforts have focused on developing and testing needed components including hardware to send and receive data among vehicles, software applications to analyze data and identify potential collisions, vehicle features that issue warnings to drivers of these potential collisions, and a security system to ensure trust in the data that are being communicated among vehicles. According to DOT, once deployed, V2V technologies have the potential to address—by providing warnings to drivers—76 percent of all potential multi-vehicle crashes involving at least one light-duty vehicle. However, the potential benefits of V2V technologies are dependent upon a number of factors including their deployment levels, how drivers respond to warning messages, and the deployment of other safety technologies that can provide similar benefits. Recent and ongoing V2V technology development efforts have been working toward the expected late 2013 NHTSA decision as the next major milestone. DOT, for example, has focused on research and analysis that can provide input for and facilitate its upcoming decision. Most of the 21 experts and 9 automobile manufacturers we spoke with told us that they expect NHTSA’s decision to help determine the progress of continued development and eventual deployment of V2V technologies. Development of these technologies has progressed to the point of real world testing. DOT has sponsored and provided approximately 80 percent of the funding for a pilot test called the Safety Pilot Model Deployment (Safety Pilot). This project—in which DOT has partnered with the CAMP VSC 3 Consortium—has been conducted by the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute and is taking place in Ann Arbor, Michigan, from August 2012 to February 2014. The primary goals of this pilot are to test the effectiveness of V2V technologies in real world situations and to measure their potential benefits. In total, about 2,700 passenger vehicles were equipped with these technologies in order to participate in the Safety Pilot. NHTSA plans to release findings from the Safety Pilot in the fall of 2014. DOT is considering the data from the first 6 months of the pilot, along with other information, in working toward a decision by late 2013 on how to proceed with V2V technologies. Efforts by DOT and the automobile industry to develop V2V technologies have focused on both in-vehicle components as well as a security system that manages V2V communications and ensures trust in the data being transmitted among vehicles (see fig. 2). Examples of in-vehicle components include: V2V hardware, including DSRC radios, cables, and antennae to send and receive data and GPS chips used to determine vehicle location. Software applications that analyze data such as location, speed, and brake status and, based on that analysis, predict when collisions are imminent. DOT has worked with automobile manufacturers to determine the most relevant applications based on common crash scenarios and to define, develop, and test these to inform and support NHTSA’s V2V technology decision later this year. A driver-vehicle interface that—based on the data analysis conducted by the V2V software applications—provides a warning to the driver through vehicle features such as sounds, lights, or seat vibrations when a collision may be imminent. Existing sensor-based crash avoidance technologies also provide warnings to drivers through similar mechanisms. DOT has been developing guidelines for automobile manufacturers in implementing driver-vehicle interfaces. In addition to in-vehicle V2V components, an external communication security system is needed to ensure that data being transmitted among vehicles are secure and trusted and have not been altered in the transmission process. Initial research and proposals by DOT and the automobile industry on the design of a communication security system have focused on a public key infrastructure system. Such a system provides security certificates to vehicles which indicate to other vehicles that the data being transmitted are to be trusted because they are valid and have not been altered. Public key infrastructure is used to provide security for many other types of data transmissions and transactions, including online banking and Internet commerce. According to CAMP VSC 3 officials, in-vehicle V2V equipment must be able to detect and automatically report potentially misbehaving devices—such as devices that are malfunctioning, used maliciously, or hacked—to a communication security system. The communication security system must also detect and automatically revoke certificates from vehicles with such devices. Vehicles would receive certificates from a security certificate management authority. However, the technical specifications of how certificates will be provided, how often they will be validated, and who will manage this system have not yet been fully defined. According to DOT officials, a prototype V2V communication security system was developed and tested as part of the Safety Pilot, but that system’s design would need additional enhancements to be used for a full deployment. In-vehicle V2V components could be factory built into new vehicles and fully integrated with existing internal electronics and networks. DOT and the automobile industry have also worked on developing retrofit and aftermarket V2V devices. Such devices would be installed in a vehicle post-manufacture and might not be fully integrated with the vehicle and its existing internal electronics and network. Such aftermarket devices might not have access to all of a vehicle’s data, such as brake status or steering wheel angle. As a result, they could provide a less robust set of data to other vehicles and could generate fewer or less precise warning messages to drivers. One specific type of aftermarket device that the automobile industry has worked to develop would only transmit a basic data set about a vehicle’s speed and location to other vehicles equipped with V2V technologies; this device would neither receive data from other vehicles nor provide a driver with a warning message, but would interact with the V2V communication security system. DOT is now working with the automobile industry to determine additional standards for such devices to ensure that they work on all types of vehicles and adhere to communication standards to ensure the integrity and security of their data transmission. Because V2V communications involve the sharing of data among different devices and vehicles of various makes and models, they require technical standards to ensure interoperability. DOT and the automobile industry have worked through international standards organizations such as SAE International and the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers to develop and set standards to facilitate V2V communications. These efforts have focused on standardizing the data elements that vehicles transmit and the means through which data are transmitted. Although V2V technologies have undergone real-world testing and most experts we interviewed believed that no major technical challenges remain in the development of in-vehicle V2V components, some experts voiced concerns about two technical issues—GPS accuracy and potential channel congestion—issues that DOT and the automobile industry continue to study. Three experts we interviewed expressed concern that GPS used by V2V technologies may not provide sufficiently accurate vehicle position for some V2V applications. Two experts also suggested that the means through which V2V technologies use GPS to determine vehicle position (called “relative positioning”) may not be accurate enough, given the need for precise vehicle location data to support V2V software applications. According to DOT officials, however, the department has collected data on the performance of GPS and V2V communications over 20,000 miles in diverse geographic and environmental conditions and is confident that the automotive-grade GPS being used for V2V safety applications is sufficiently accurate. Nevertheless, DOT continues to work to address this issue through research to identify the best means to determine vehicle location through relative positioning. DOT also collected additional data during the Safety Pilot to help ensure that GPS positioning limitations do not negatively affect the performance of V2V technologies. Two experts noted that, given the volume of V2V data that would be transmitted in high-traffic areas such as busy highways, channel congestion on the frequency used by V2V communications could result in delayed transmissions of V2V data. DOT and automobile manufacturers continue to engage in collaborative efforts and sponsor relevant studies to determine the point at which channel congestion might occur and determine potential solutions, such as limiting the frequency of V2V data transmissions in high-traffic situations without compromising safety. In the longer term, V2V technology development efforts are likely to complement efforts to continue to develop and deploy other sensor-based crash avoidance technologies and autonomous vehicle technologies. NHTSA’s Administrator stated in May 2013 that DOT sees these three types of technologies as being part of an evolution from vehicles with limited automatic controls to vehicles with fully autonomous self-driving capabilities. NHTSA’s preliminary statement of policy on vehicle automation, issued in May 2013, recognizes the potential benefits of automation and its relationship to V2V technologies. According to DOT officials, DOT’s 2015 to 2019 ITS strategic plan, expected to be issued in early 2014, will describe DOT’s planned activities in this area. Furthermore, a recent report by an automotive industry consulting firm stated that the convergence of sensor-based crash avoidance technologies and connected vehicle technologies will be needed to enable truly autonomous vehicles, given the benefits and downsides of each type of technology. Five experts and one automobile manufacturer we interviewed said that V2V technologies are a key part of the industry’s road map to vehicle automation. V2V technologies are expected to offer significant safety benefits by helping drivers avoid collisions in a number of collision scenarios. The automobile industry has worked with DOT to develop safety applications for rear-end, intersection, and lane-change crash scenarios. (See fig. 3 for examples of V2V safety applications and a go to http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-14-13 for a video that demonstrates selected applications warning drivers of potential collisions.) According to NHTSA, these prevalent crash scenarios represent the majority of all vehicle crashes. Because automobiles cannot currently take autonomous actions—such as braking—based on data gathered by V2V technologies, drivers must act on V2V warnings to prevent collisions from happening. These crash scenario applications are being tested in the Safety Pilot, and DOT and the automobile industry have collected data to determine how to improve the accuracy of the applications. DOT is currently conducting a benefits assessment based in part on the first 6 months of data from the Safety Pilot to inform the decision NHTSA plans to make in late 2013. DOT’s Volpe Center is conducting this benefits assessment, which, according to DOT, uses a methodology to determine how many vehicle collisions would be prevented through the use of V2V technologies in a number of different types of collision scenarios. The result will be an estimate of the effectiveness of V2V safety applications. In May 2013, DOT reported that V2V technologies have the potential to address—by providing warnings to drivers—76 percent of all potential multi-vehicle crashes involving at least one light vehicle. While the majority of experts we interviewed agreed that 76 percent is plausible as a maximum level, this estimate is an upper limit of the potential safety benefits of V2V technologies which assumes their full deployment across the U.S. vehicle fleet. This estimate also assumes that V2V technologies provide warnings in all potential crash scenarios involving at least two vehicles equipped with these technologies. The actual number of crashes prevented by V2V technologies will depend on a number of factors, including the following: Deployment Levels: According to DOT, the safety benefits of V2V technologies will be maximized with near full deployment across the U.S. vehicle fleet. However, even if NHTSA pursues a rulemaking requiring installation of these technologies in new vehicles, it could take a number of years until benefits are fully realized due to the rate of turnover of the fleet. According to one automobile manufacturer we interviewed, given the rate of new vehicle sales, it can take up to 20 years for the entire U.S. vehicle fleet to turn over. It may be possible to see some benefits at lower levels of deployment, as was seen in the number of interactions among participating vehicles in the Safety Pilot, according to DOT. Also, aftermarket devices that allow existing vehicles to be equipped with V2V devices could help speed deployment. However, three experts we interviewed expressed concern that drivers may not see value in purchasing aftermarket devices, which could limit their adoption. Driver response: The benefits of V2V technologies will also depend on how well drivers respond to warning messages. If drivers do not take appropriate action in response to warnings, then the benefits of V2V technologies could be reduced. For example, if drivers do not respond to warnings quickly enough—due to distraction, impairment, or other reasons—they may not be able to avoid a collision. Furthermore, if safety applications offer too many false warnings when no imminent threat exists, drivers could begin to ignore valid warnings or not respond to them quickly enough. For example, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety reported that as many as 41 percent of drivers of certain makes of vehicles with sensor-based lane departure warning systems found the systems “annoying” due to false alarms and unnecessary warnings. Deployment of other safety technologies: The potential benefits solely attributable to V2V technologies will also depend on the market penetration and effectiveness of sensor-based crash avoidance technologies. These existing technologies are able to address some of the same crash scenarios as V2V safety applications and their market penetration is likely to increase in the future. While there are cases where V2V technologies can provide safety benefits where sensor-based crash avoidance technologies cannot—such as around a curve or when detecting an unseen stopped car—there are some V2V technology collision scenarios that sensor-based crash avoidance technologies can also address. For example, cameras and radar can be used to provide drivers with forward collision warnings or lane change warnings when another vehicle is in a blind spot. In addition, vehicles in the future may use V2V technologies and sensor- based crash avoidance technologies to complement one another. For example, future vehicles may be able to use V2V data to validate sensor data and provide drivers with more accurate and certain warnings as well as to help execute more reliable automated control actions such as braking. The benefits attributable to V2V technologies will depend on how these technologies work together and the market penetration of these technologies. According to DOT officials, the department’s methodology for estimating the safety benefits of V2V technologies will account for the benefits of sensor-based crash avoidance technologies by estimating their penetration and effectiveness in avoiding collisions. While V2V technologies have been tested in real world settings, a number of challenges exist to their wide-scale deployment and the realization of their potential benefits. DOT has been collaborating with automobile manufacturers and others to identify potential solutions to these challenges and is planning continued efforts to support the eventual deployment of V2V technologies. As part of these efforts, the department has been considering various policy options, such as options for managing the V2V communication security system. However, future DOT actions to address some of these issues will not be finalized until after NHTSA decides how the agency will proceed with V2V technologies later this year. According to experts we interviewed, DOT officials, automobile manufacturers, and other stakeholders, the deployment of V2V technologies faces a number of challenges, including: (1) finalizing the technical framework and management structure of a V2V communication security system to ensure trust among vehicles, (2) ensuring that the possible sharing of the band of radio-frequency spectrum used by V2V communications will not adversely affect their performance, (3) considering human factors to ensure that drivers respond appropriately to V2V warnings, (4) addressing the uncertainty related to potential liability issues posed by V2V technologies, and (5) addressing any concerns the public may have about V2V technologies, including those related to privacy. As discussed earlier, a security system capable of detecting, reporting, and revoking the credentials of vehicles found to be sharing inaccurate information will be needed to ensure trust in the V2V data transmitted among vehicles. Final plans and policies for the V2V communication security system—including its technical framework and management structure—have not yet been developed and will need to be finalized prior to V2V technology deployment. Technical framework: Of the 21 experts we interviewed, 12 cited the technical development of a V2V communication security system as a great or very great challenge to the deployment of V2V technologies. One expert told us that it is challenging to establish technical specifications for a system that attempts to maintain users’ privacy while providing security for over-the-air transmission of data. Another expert noted that a public key infrastructure system the size of the one needed to support the nationwide deployment of V2V technologies has never been developed before; the sheer magnitude of the system will pose challenges to its development. Both the manner through which V2V communication security certificates will be provided to vehicles and how often they will be provided need to be determined. Some proposals call for using DSRC-equipped roadside infrastructure to provide security certificates, while other proposals call for using non-DSRC communications technologies such as cellular. Management structure: How a V2V communication security system will be managed has not yet been determined and the delineation of relevant roles and responsibilities could be difficult. Twelve of the experts we interviewed cited the establishment of a management framework for a security system as a great or very great challenge to V2V technology deployment. Because no similar institutions exist, many questions remain about how such a system should be structured and who should manage it. One expert suggested that deciding which approach is most appropriate involves weighing competing philosophies. The expert added that developing the management structure could prove more difficult than developing the technical aspects of the security system. DOT has researched options to address the technical framework of a V2V communication security system and officials noted that additional technical and policy analyses are under way that will determine the specifics by early 2014. DOT officials stated that a framework that meets the technical requirements of CAMP will be finalized and subsequently prototyped and tested. As mentioned earlier, a prototype technical framework for issuing and managing security certificates has been tested as part of the Safety Pilot. DOT officials told us that there were no significant technical challenges identified during the development of this framework but noted that additional analysis related to the detection and revocation of credentials from vehicles found to be sharing inaccurate information is needed. In preparation for the testing of the Safety Pilot’s prototype technical framework, DOT conducted research on the risks associated with such a system and identified potential approaches to address those risks. In addition, the department held public workshops in April 2012 to bring together various stakeholders to discuss issues related to a V2V communication security system. DOT officials explained that NHTSA is currently engaging a firm with expertise in information security systems to perform a review that will help inform the eventual technical specifications of a V2V communication security system. Although various technical frameworks are being considered, limits to DOT’s authority could limit the viability of some options. For example, according to DOT officials, the department does not have the legal authority to require the installation of roadside infrastructure to support a V2V communication security system because, aside from roads on federal lands, the federal government does not own or operate U.S. roadways. In addition, DOT has worked with automobile manufacturers through the VIIC to examine potential management structures for a V2V communication security system. However, officials told us that it would be premature to comment on what the management structure will look like without knowing whether the agency will pursue a rulemaking related to V2V technologies. As part of its research on the technical framework of a V2V communication security system, DOT also sought stakeholder input on the potential management structure and identified three potential options: Federal model: DOT officials explained that, if the federal government were to provide the security management services required to support V2V technologies, it most likely would do so through a service contract that would include specific provisions to ensure adequate market access, privacy and security controls, and reporting and continuity of services. According to DOT, the department has appropriate legal authority to pursue this model but does not have sufficient resources to introduce such a structure at this time. Public-Private model: Under a public-private partnership, the security system would be jointly owned and managed by the federal government and private entities. DOT officials stated that statutory authority would be needed to create a public-private management structure that is vested with the authority that Congress deems necessary and appropriate to finance and operate a V2V communication security system. DOT officials added that the required legal authority would likely need to include authorization to establish and collect fees on behalf of the entity and possibly provisions addressing liability, privacy, data ownership, and security requirements applicable to such a system. Private model: DOT officials stated that its current legal authority and resources have led NHTSA to focus primarily on working with stakeholders to develop a viable private model. DOT officials suggested that, through an agreement with a privately owned and operated security management provider, a private model could be used to support a V2V communication security system. Aside from any aspects specifically detailed in the agreement, DOT suggested that the governance and financing of a private management structure would depend on what entity constitutes and owns the entity. In response to requirements in the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012, FCC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in February 2013 that requested comments on allowing unlicensed devices to share the 5.9 GHz band of the radio-frequency spectrum that had been previously set aside for the use of DSRC-based ITS applications such as V2V technologies. The proposed modifications would provide access to additional spectrum with consistent technical requirements, resulting in faster data speeds by allowing unlicensed devices to use wider bandwidth channels. Existing FCC regulations are designed to ensure that unlicensed devices do not cause interference with licensed users and require operators of unlicensed devices to immediately correct the problem or cease operation if interference occurs. NTIA completed an evaluation in January 2013 in response to requirements in the act that it study spectrum-sharing technologies and the risks to federal users associated with allowing unlicensed devices to share the 5.9 GHz band. NTIA concluded that further work was needed to determine whether and how the risks identified can be mitigated and is currently collaborating with federal and industry stakeholders, as well as FCC, to conduct a quantitative analysis of potential mitigation strategies. FCC officials told us that they are unlikely to act further on a rulemaking in this area until NTIA’s analysis is complete. Although existing FCC regulations are designed to ensure that unlicensed devices do not cause interference, four automobile manufacturers and 16 experts we interviewed expressed concern or uncertainty about the potential effects of allowing unlicensed devices to share the 5.9 GHz band. One automobile industry group said that its members are not opposed to opening the 5.9 GHz band for sharing but emphasized the importance of understanding the implications of doing so to ensure that it will not hinder critical V2V safety applications. As part of the federal rulemaking process, FCC sought public comments on potential approaches to help minimize any potential harmful interference. In response, one automobile manufacturer wrote that it is very concerned that V2V technologies and unlicensed devices will not be able to coexist on the 5.9 GHz band. This automobile manufacturer recommended that FCC proceed with extreme caution when allowing sharing of the 5.9 GHz band, stating that V2V technologies cannot tolerate harmful interference and suggesting that every potential signal loss could render V2V communications ineffective at a moment in which they could protect drivers’ lives. Members of the VIIC also noted that the development and testing of V2V technologies has always assumed use of the 5.9 GHz band. Because of this, one expert we interviewed suggested that opening the 5.9 GHz band for sharing would create an added burden for both automobile manufacturers and suppliers, which would have to consider technical steps to make coexistence with unlicensed devices feasible and conduct additional testing to maintain confidence that V2V technologies will work as envisioned. In addition, DOT coordinated with NTIA to submit its concern through comments to FCC that sharing the allocation could degrade the performance of V2V safety applications. As NTIA continues its analysis of potential risk mitigation strategies, DOT officials told us that the department is working cooperatively with the agency to examine spectrum-sharing arrangements that have been proposed for the 5 GHz band and expects results of this analysis to be available in spring 2014. According to DOT officials, the automobile and Wi-Fi industries are discussing other possible spectrum sharing techniques but specific approaches have not yet been defined. Because V2V technologies require drivers to take actions based on warning messages, the ultimate effectiveness and safety benefits of V2V technologies depend upon how well drivers respond to the warnings. Addressing the human factors that affect how drivers will respond includes minimizing the risk that drivers could become too familiar with or overly reliant upon warnings over time and fail to exercise due diligence in responding to them, assessing the risk that V2V warnings could distract drivers and present new safety issues, and determining what types of V2V warnings will maximize driver response. The challenges posed by human factors are in many ways similar to those posed by sensor-based crash avoidance technologies and some other vehicle technologies. However, human factors issues may present even greater challenges to V2V technologies. One automobile manufacturer explained that, since not all vehicles in the United States will be equipped with V2V technologies in the early years of their deployment, it is unknown how drivers will adjust their behavior to account for the fact that not all of the vehicles on the road are capable of providing data. By contrast, with sensor-based technologies, drivers know that their vehicle’s warning system is not dependent on the presence of similar technologies in nearby vehicles. Further, the potential introduction of aftermarket V2V devices with a lower level of integration with a vehicle’s existing internal network could create additional human factors challenges if aftermarket device warning messages and data are less robust than fully integrated systems. For these reasons, one automobile manufacturer said that it is unrealistic to expect aftermarket devices to perform in all situations. Automobile manufacturers have already developed different approaches to issuing warnings to drivers for existing sensor-based crash avoidance technologies. Three experts we interviewed suggested that the manner in which V2V warnings are issued to drivers should be allowed to vary among automobile manufacturers once basic standards are put in place. However, two experts suggested that the manner in which V2V warnings are issued to drivers should be similar across vehicles to avoid the confusion that might arise from receiving different types of warnings in similar situations when driving a different vehicle (e.g., a rental car). NHTSA has a research program in place to develop human factors principles that may be used by automobile manufacturers and suppliers as they design and deploy V2V technology and other safety technology driver-vehicle interfaces that provide warnings to drivers. This program is evaluating alternative approaches to issuing warnings relative to effectiveness and potential driver distraction. In addition, DOT has surveyed drivers participating in the Safety Pilot about driver distraction, in addition to other topics, and collected data on driver responses to various V2V warnings. NHTSA has also sponsored other research on driver warnings—including initial research on the potential standardization of warnings across automobile manufacturers—and is planning to complete a compendium of research findings in late 2013. Based on research in this area, NHTSA has worked with stakeholders to develop design principles for V2V driver-vehicle interfaces, which NHTSA plans to publish in April 2014. DOT continues to determine next steps in this area. Six automobile manufacturers and 17 experts we interviewed expressed concern about the challenge posed by uncertainties related to potential liability in the event of a collision involving vehicles equipped with V2V technologies. This challenge is manifested in a number of potential liability issues and questions that are unanswered at this time: One automobile manufacturer said that because V2V technologies offer warnings that are based in part on data transmitted by other vehicles—as opposed to sensor-based systems that collect data solely from a vehicle’s surroundings—it could be harder to determine whether fault for a collision between vehicles equipped with V2V technologies lies with one of the drivers, an automobile manufacturer, the manufacturer of a V2V device, or another party. One expert suggested that, because V2V data may be needed to determine fault in the event of a collision, there could be challenges in determining who owns the data transmitted between vehicles. This expert suggested that establishing rules regarding V2V data ownership would, in the event of a collision, help to answer questions about which parties have access to the data. There may be challenges in determining liability if V2V technologies do not work appropriately—for example, if data transmission is delayed due to channel congestion, hacking into the system, or inaccurate GPS readings. Four automobile manufacturers shared their concern that the introduction of aftermarket V2V devices into vehicles already on the road would create additional liability issues. One automobile manufacturer explained that this is because it is difficult to integrate aftermarket devices into a vehicle’s existing internal network, potentially making it more difficult to gather and transmit the same degree of information as a fully integrated device and, therefore, making it more difficult to determine the cause of a collision. Automobile manufacturers may be reluctant to move forward with plans to install V2V technologies in their newly manufactured vehicles because of the uncertainty that accompanies these liability issues. Citing some automobile manufacturers’ concerns about the liability risks posed by V2V technologies, members of the VIIC have suggested that additional work needs to be done to estimate the potential liability and risks associated with the deployment of V2V technologies and determine ways to mitigate that risk. One automobile manufacturer and two experts suggested that congressional action could be needed to limit the liability levels of automobile manufacturers in the event of a V2V device malfunction. One of these experts suggested that legislation setting forth liability limits for V2V devices that are shown to meet certification tests and function according to regulations and standards may be appropriate. However, one expert suggested that all vehicle technologies involve liability issues and that if the automobile industry ensures that V2V technologies work properly before deployment, V2V technologies should not pose any greater liability risks than existing sensor-based crash avoidance technologies. DOT officials told us that they do not believe that V2V technologies pose any greater liability issues for automobile manufacturers than existing sensor-based crash avoidance technologies and therefore do not believe that related legislation is necessary. One expert we interviewed suggested that DOT should help guide the process of determining who or what entity owns the data transmitted between vehicles by V2V technologies as that knowledge would make it easier to determine liability in the event of a crash. Another expert suggested that DOT will have a role to play in helping to address liability issues once the specifics of the future deployment of these technologies become clearer. DOT and the CAMP VSC 3 Consortium conducted Driver Acceptance Clinics in 2011 and 2012 to obtain volunteer drivers’ feedback on V2V technologies, among other purposes, and participants rated the desirability and usefulness of these technologies highly. However, according to stakeholders and experts we interviewed, obtaining broad public acceptance could present a challenge to deployment, as concerns related to driver privacy and the limited potential benefits of V2V technologies in the early years of their deployment could impede overall public acceptance of these technologies. Privacy concerns: Public interest groups we interviewed said that overcoming concerns about privacy under a system that involves the sharing of data among vehicles will pose a challenge. One group suggested that the possibility that V2V data could be obtained by third parties such as law enforcement agencies could harm the deployment of these technologies. Similarly, one expert suggested that public acceptance of V2V technologies might be limited without rules prohibiting the use of vehicles’ speed and location data to issue tickets or track drivers’ movements. Three experts we interviewed suggested that legislation may be needed to limit the potential use of V2V data. Representatives of automobile manufacturers that are members of the VIIC stated that, although the security system under development is being designed to ensure data privacy through a structure that prevents the association of a vehicle’s V2V communication security certificates with any unique identifier of drivers of their vehicles, the potential perception of a lack of privacy is a challenge. Further, one automobile manufacturer that is part of the VIIC said that it could be difficult to explain how V2V technologies work to the public without raising concerns related to privacy. Perception of functionality: Public acceptance of V2V technologies could also be negatively affected by drivers’ perception of the technologies’ limited functionality, especially when few vehicles are equipped with V2V devices in early years. As mentioned earlier, when there are few equipped vehicles on the roads, drivers may see limited benefits of V2V technologies as they may not frequently encounter similarly equipped vehicles and infrequently receive warning messages in potential collision scenarios. Some experts said that limited benefits in the early years of deployment might pose challenges to consumer acceptance of V2V technologies. For this reason, six experts we interviewed suggested that the simultaneous introduction of applications with mobility applications would help provide benefits to drivers when deployment is low. For example, one expert suggested that mobility applications capable of helping drivers avoid congested roads or notifying them of a broken-down car ahead in the roadway would provide more apparent benefits to drivers, even with a low rate of deployment of V2V technologies. In addition, seven experts we interviewed suggested that it would be helpful for either DOT or automobile manufacturers to reach out to customers to communicate the potential safety benefits of V2V technologies in advance of deployment in order to increase public acceptance of these technologies. DOT officials told us that the department recognizes that public acceptance needs to be considered for the deployment of V2V technologies and noted that they have worked closely with automobile manufacturers and other stakeholders to develop a technical approach that limits risks to individual privacy. DOT officials have emphasized the need to distinguish between the ability to identify bad actors through a V2V communication security system and the ability to monitor the movements of individual vehicles. DOT stated that as currently conceived, a V2V communication security system would contain multiple technical, physical, and organizational controls to minimize privacy risks—including the risk of vehicle tracking by individuals and government or commercial entities. According to DOT officials, after NHTSA decides whether to proceed with a rulemaking and it is known what entity will provide the security for V2V technologies, the department will perform a comprehensive Privacy Impact Assessment, as required by law, to determine how to balance individual privacy, data security, and safety. DOT officials have emphasized that, to ensure transparency, it will be important to communicate what V2V data is generated by a vehicle, the extent to which it can be linked to drivers, and who or what entities—both legally and technologically—will be able to collect, use, and share the data. DOT officials told us that the department will continue to assess any risks to privacy posed by the introduction of V2V technologies and identify mitigation measures to minimize those risks as more aspects of a system of V2V communications are defined. DOT officials also said that, since its current authority to regulate the interception and use of V2V data is limited, the department might express a strong policy preference or make recommendations to Congress for limitations on the use of V2V data by entities over which the department lacks regulatory authority. DOT officials told us that the department does not currently have a specific plan about how to proceed with public outreach efforts because NHTSA has not yet decided whether a rulemaking is appropriate at this time. Additional DOT efforts to address other challenges facing the deployment of V2V technologies could help increase their public acceptance. For example, DOT is collecting data from the Safety Pilot regarding the acceptance of V2V technologies by participating drivers. Furthermore, DOT’s ongoing development of guidelines for the implementation of driver-vehicle interfaces to address human factors challenges could help increase overall acceptance of these technologies. In addition, DOT has plans for further research on vehicle-to- infrastructure technologies, which could provide additional safety benefits and enable the types of mobility applications that some experts suggested could help increase public acceptance of V2V technologies. Further, DOT is working with industry stakeholders to develop clear certification standards for aftermarket devices, along with all other V2V devices, and is considering incentives to encourage drivers to purchase these devices. DOT has indicated that its 2015 to 2019 ITS strategic plan—currently under development and expected to be issued in early 2014—will focus on the challenges facing the deployment of V2V technologies. As noted earlier, DOT officials told us that they do not want to take certain actions, such as determining the structure of a V2V communication security system, until after NHTSA’s late 2013 decision on how to proceed regarding V2V technologies. DOT has stated that the department’s forthcoming plan will include details of near term efforts to further develop the technical framework and management structure of a V2V communication security system and consideration of incentives needed to support the eventual deployment of V2V technologies to the U.S. vehicle fleet. In addition, DOT plans to develop an understanding of how the public views connected vehicle technologies and their benefits in order to develop effective methods for describing the value of V2V technologies to users in the context of partial deployment. According to DOT, the strategic vision for the 2015 to 2019 ITS strategic plan is to improve safety, mobility, and environmental mitigation through connected vehicles and to enable a transportation system that builds upon the capabilities of V2V technologies and vehicle-to-infrastructure technologies. In line with this goal, as noted earlier, DOT is planning for additional research, including research conducted with the automobile industry, into vehicle-to-infrastructure technologies. In addition, by defining how an automated vehicle fleet can be introduced with limited impact to current infrastructure and researching how increases in the degree of automation of the U.S. vehicle fleet could have liability implications for stakeholders, DOT has stated that it plans to prepare for the introduction of autonomous vehicles to a connected vehicle environment featuring both V2V and vehicle-to-infrastructure technologies. DOT and the automobile industry, through the CAMP VSC 3 Consortium, are currently analyzing the total costs of deploying V2V technologies, which include the costs of in-vehicle components and the costs associated with a V2V communication security system. DOT is currently obtaining estimates of the costs of in-vehicle V2V components from automobile manufacturers and industry suppliers and has engaged a contractor to study the potential costs of providing V2V communications security through a number of possible technical and management options. NHTSA will use these cost estimates to inform its decision on how to proceed with V2V technologies later this year. In addition, the CAMP VSC 3 Consortium is now conducting an independent analysis of potential security system costs. According to an official with that organization, this study should be completed in late 2013 and the consortium will provide input and comments on the key assumptions of DOT’s cost study as well. Despite these efforts, all of the automobile manufacturers we interviewed told us that they had not yet completed any formal studies estimating V2V technology costs. We also conducted a literature search for published studies discussing potential V2V technology costs and were unable to identify any such studies. Finally, we asked the experts we interviewed to identify studies on the potential costs of deploying V2V technologies; none of the 21 experts were able to identify any studies beyond those now being conducted by DOT or the CAMP VSC 3 Consortium. All of the automobile manufacturers we interviewed said that it is difficult to estimate the costs of in-vehicle V2V components at this time because too many factors remain unknown. According to both automobile manufacturers and experts we interviewed, a number of factors will influence the costs of in-vehicle V2V components: Volume: Five experts and two automobile manufacturers we interviewed pointed out that as the volume of V2V components produced increases, the per-unit costs are likely to decrease due to the economies of scale in manufacturing. Thus, a federal requirement that automobile manufacturers install V2V technologies in newly manufactured vehicles would likely result in lower per-vehicle costs of in-vehicle V2V components than would otherwise be the case. Time frames: The costs of in-vehicle components of V2V technologies may decline over time due to technological advances. Two automobile manufacturers we interviewed said that both the automobile and consumer electronics industries have been successful at driving down the costs of other technologies over time and suggested that this also may occur with the cost of in-vehicle V2V components. Degree of integration with existing vehicle technologies: Automobile manufacturers already install sensor-based crash avoidance technologies in some vehicle models. The extent to which V2V technologies are integrated with the existing components of these and other technologies that use similar components will influence the costs of V2V technologies. For example, vehicles that already have GPS chips installed for navigation purposes may not need an additional GPS chip specifically for V2V technologies purposes. One expert and one automobile manufacturer we interviewed explained that automobile companies have been successful in integrating different technologies in their vehicles in recent years, resulting in reduced costs. Federal requirements: The specifics of any federal regulation regarding V2V technologies, including any possible regulation mandating their installation in new vehicles, would likely influence costs. For example, the introduction of requirements related to V2V technological specifications and standards, the use of hardware for V2V components, and the use of V2V safety applications would influence the ultimate costs of V2V technologies. Although the costs of in-vehicle V2V components are difficult to estimate at this time, they may be modest compared to the price of a new vehicle. According to CAMP VSC 3 Consortium representatives, in-vehicle V2V components—including the DSRC components and GPS receiver—are already commercially available at a relatively low cost. A CAMP VSC 3 representative noted that although members of the partnership are unable to discuss potential V2V technology costs with one another due to antitrust concerns, they have agreed to focus their V2V technology development efforts on limiting their costs as much as possible. As a result, compared to the average sale price of a new vehicle—about $31,000 in 2012, according to the National Automobile Dealers Association—the potential costs of these physical components may not add significantly to a vehicle’s price. One expert we interviewed estimated that the costs of V2V components would add less than one percent to the price of a new vehicle. These costs may be less than the costs of sensor- based crash avoidance technologies, according to one industry association we interviewed, because sensors are more expensive. At this time, the potential costs associated with a V2V communication security system are unknown as specifics of a security system remain undetermined. One expert we interviewed explained that since it is not yet known how the security system will look or how it will be organized or managed, no one has a good handle on those costs. According to DOT officials, how often vehicles must communicate with the security system and requirements of how security certificates will be provided will influence the ultimate cost of a V2V communication security system. Furthermore, it is currently not only difficult to estimate the potential costs, but unclear who or what entity—consumers, automobile manufacturers, DOT, state and local governments, or others—would pay the costs. Determining who or what entity will fund the system will likely prove challenging. Although the potential costs of a V2V communication security system are unknown at this time, eight experts we interviewed noted that either these costs, or the costs of roadside equipment that may be needed, could be significant. One expert said that, given the need for continuous operation of a security system, the costs are likely to be much greater than the costs of in-vehicle V2V components. Potential sources of funding may also face challenges in providing it. For example, if roadside equipment is needed to support a security system, it could be costly in a nationwide deployment. Participants in a 2012 DOT-hosted workshop focused on connected vehicle security noted that the costs of roadside equipment could range between $25,000 and $30,000 per installation, a cost that many state and local governments would find prohibitive if they were responsible for its financing. In addition, three experts whom we interviewed said that the costs of ongoing maintenance and operation of such installations could also prove prohibitive. According to DOT officials, however, the potential costs of roadside equipment could be much lower if its installation were to be integrated into already planned construction work at selected sites. They also noted that these costs should decline over time due to declining costs of technologies and increased volumes of production. We provided a draft of this report to the Secretary of Transportation and the Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission for review and comment. DOT and FCC both provided comments via email that were technical in nature. We incorporated these comments as appropriate. We are sending copies of this report to interested congressional committees, the Secretary of Transportation, and the Chairman of the FCC. In addition, the report will be available at no charge on the GAO website at http://www.gao.gov. If you or your staff have any questions about this report, please contact me at (202) 512-2834 or wised@gao.gov. Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. GAO staff that made significant contributions to this report are listed in appendix IV. To address all of our objectives, we reviewed documentation of the efforts of the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) and automobile manufacturers related to vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) technologies, such as the department’s ITS Strategic Research Plan, 2010 - 2014 Progress Update 2012 and documentation on completed and ongoing research. We also interviewed officials from DOT’s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and the Research and Innovative Technology Administration (RITA) about these efforts. We also interviewed officials with the Crash Avoidance Metrics Partnership (CAMP) Vehicle Safety Communications (VSC) 3 Consortium as well as, both collectively and individually, representatives from all of the following automobile manufacturers that currently comprise the Vehicle Infrastructure Integration Consortium: BMW, Chrysler, Ford, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai-Kia, Mercedes-Benz, Nissan, Toyota, and Volkswagen. We also interviewed a V2V device supplier and representatives of industry and public interest groups knowledgeable on the topic of V2V technologies, such as the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers and the American Automobile Association. In addition, we collaborated with the National Academies of Sciences (NAS) to identify and recruit experts in vehicle-to-vehicle technologies. We provided NAS with criteria for selecting experts, which included: (1) type and depth of experience, including recognition in the professional community and relevance of any published work; (2) employment history and professional affiliations, including any potential conflicts of interest; and (3) other relevant experts’ recommendations. NAS initially identified 35 experts knowledgeable in the areas of V2V technology development and interoperability, technology deployment, production of light-duty passenger vehicles, data privacy and security, legal and policy issues, and human factors issues related to V2V technologies. From that list, we selected and conducted structured interviews with 21 experts who represented domestic and international automobile manufacturers, suppliers of V2V devices, a telecommunications company, and state governments, as well as automotive industry experts and academic researchers (see table 1 for list of experts interviewed). In conducting our structured interviews, we used a standardized interview guide (see appendix II) to obtain consistent answers. During these interviews we asked, among other things, for expert views on the state of development of V2V technologies, the potential benefits of V2V technologies, their potential costs, and DOT’s role in developing V2V technologies. We also asked for each expert’s views on a number of already defined potential challenges facing the deployment of V2V technologies. We determined this initial list of potential challenges after initial interviews with DOT, industry associations, select automobile manufacturers, and other interest groups knowledgeable about V2V technologies. Prior to conducting the interviews, we pretested the structured interview guide with two of the selected experts to ensure our questions were worded appropriately and could be administered consistently. After conducting these interviews, we conducted a content analysis of expert responses relevant to each objective and counted the rating of each potential challenge discussed. See appendix III for a count of the ratings provided by experts on potential challenges facing deployment of V2V technologies. We completed a literature search to obtain documentation, studies, and articles related to our objectives. Although this report focuses upon V2V technologies, our literature search was broadened to include any relevant work published in the past 10 years that was related to terms including “vehicle-to-vehicle communications,” “vehicle-to-infrastructure communications,” “vehicle-to-roadside communications,” or “intelligent vehicle highway systems.” To specifically address the state of development of V2V technologies and their anticipated benefits, we conducted a site visit to Ann Arbor, Michigan, where we interviewed researchers from the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute who are managing the Safety Pilot Model Deployment and toured areas of the city in which related infrastructure was installed. We also interviewed automobile manufacturers’ CAMP VSC 3 Consortium representatives in Farmington Hills, Michigan, and received a demonstration of V2V safety warnings in multiple potential crash scenarios. We also reviewed DOT’s May 2013 Description of Light-Vehicle Pre-Crash Scenarios for Safety Applications Based on Vehicle-to-Vehicle Communications report that estimates potential benefits of V2V technologies. In addition, to specifically address the challenges facing the deployment of V2V technologies, we interviewed officials from the Federal Communications Commission and a privacy group to obtain their views on the potential challenges of spectrum allocation and data privacy, respectively, related to deployment of V2V technologies. To specifically address the potential costs associated with V2V technologies, we discussed efforts to estimate costs with DOT and representatives of the CAMP VSC 3 Consortium and reviewed relevant documentation, such as the April 2012 public workshop entitled Enabling a Secure Environment for Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to- Infrastructure (V2I) Transactions, which DOT organized to facilitate discussion of communications security structures under development among public and private stakeholders. In addition, we asked all automobile manufacturers we interviewed about the potential costs of V2V technologies. We conducted this performance audit from October 2012 through November 2013 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. (Experts identified by the Transportation Research Board of the National Academies) Overview of GAO Review of Connected Vehicle Technologies The United States Government Accountability Office (GAO) is undertaking work looking at the use of connected vehicle technologies (CVT) involving vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications. These technologies allow vehicles to wirelessly communicate with one another through Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC); share data, such as data on vehicle location and speed; and provide drivers with warnings of potential collisions. GAO is examining these technologies at the request of the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology and Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, Subcommittee on Highways and Transit. Specifically, we are examining: (1) the progress of development of connected vehicle technologies that involve vehicle-to-vehicle communications and their anticipated benefits; (2) the challenges that affect the development and deployment of these technologies and their potential costs; and (3) how the U.S. Department of Transportation is leading efforts to address these challenges. Our work is limited to CVTs involving V2V communications and we are not including vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications beyond the extent to which infrastructure may be needed to support V2V communications. We are reviewing efforts in the United States and not in other countries. In addition, our work is limited to passenger vehicles and we are not including commercial and transit uses. Please keep the following in mind as you consider your responses to the questions:  We use the term “stakeholders” to indicate organizations that have been or are expected to be involved in the development or deployment of CVTs involving V2V communications including, but not limited to, automobile manufacturers, parts suppliers, government agencies, and telecommunications companies.  We use the term “CVTs involving V2V communications” to include devices that send and receive data, safety applications (such as Forward Collision Warning and Emergency Electronic Brake Lights Warning) that analyze data and provide warnings through driver-vehicle interfaces, and any security system(s) that may be needed to help establish trust between vehicles sharing data.  We use the term “V2V devices” to represent the devices now being tested in the Safety Pilot Model Deployment in Ann Arbor, Michigan: (1) Fully-integrated devices: these devices would be installed during vehicle production and send, receive and analyze vehicle data to generate driver warnings of potential collisions. Because they are fully integrated into vehicles, they can analyze additional vehicle data—such as steering wheel angle, acceleration rate, brake status and turn signal status—to provide more robust warnings to drivers and provide more complete data to other vehicles. (2) Aftermarket safety devices: these devices, installed after vehicle production, send, receive, and analyze vehicle data to generate warnings of potential collisions. However, because they are not integrated with vehicles’ electronics architecture and are thus unable to consider additional data, these devices may be limited in their warnings and driver-vehicle interface. (3) Vehicle awareness devices: these devices are installed after vehicle production and are not connected to any vehicle systems. They send data on a vehicle’s location and speed which may be received by other vehicles, but these devices do not generate driver warnings. States, including progress made and successes to date. 2) In your opinion, what are some of the greatest potential benefits of CVTs that involve V2V communications? a. Which potential V2V applications are likely to offer the greatest benefits and why? 3) What work, in your opinion, needs to be completed before such technologies are commercially feasible and available in the U.S.? a. In your opinion, what is a realistic timeframe in which automobile manufacturers might begin to install these technologies in new vehicles being manufactured for the U.S. vehicle fleet? 4) According to a 2007 report by the U.S. DOT, CVTs involving V2V communications have the potential to address up to 76 percent of unimpaired roadway crashes, which could have the potential to greatly reduce the number of roadway fatalities that occur each year. a. What views, if any, do you have on DOT’s projection of these technologies’ potential benefits? b.

While improvements in automobile safety have reduced the number of fatalities in recent decades, DOT has worked with the automobile industry to develop V2V technologies, through which vehicles are capable of warning drivers of imminent collisions by sharing data, including information on speed and location, with nearby vehicles. GAO was asked to review the status of V2V technologies. GAO examined (1) the state of development of V2V technologies and their anticipated benefits; (2) the challenges, if any, that will affect the deployment of these technologies and what actions, if any, DOT is taking to address them; and (3) what is known about the potential costs associated with these technologies. GAO reviewed documentation on V2V technology-related efforts by DOT and automobile manufacturers, visited a pilot study of V2V technologies in Michigan, and interviewed DOT officials, automobile manufacturers, and 21 experts identified by the National Academies of Sciences. Experts were selected based on their level of knowledge and to represent a variety of subject areas related to V2V technology development. DOT and the Federal Communications Commission reviewed a draft of this report and provided technical comments which were incorporated as appropriate. The development of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) technologies has progressed to the point of real world testing, and if broadly deployed, they are anticipated to offer significant safety benefits. Efforts by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) and the automobile industry have focused on developing: 1) in-vehicle components such as hardware to facilitate communications among vehicles, 2) safety software applications to analyze data and identify potential collisions, 3) vehicle features that warn drivers, and 4) a national communication security system to ensure trust in the data transmitted among vehicles. According to DOT, if widely deployed, V2V technologies could provide warnings to drivers in as much as 76 percent of potential multi-vehicle collisions involving at least one light vehicle, such as a passenger car. Ultimately, however, the level of benefits realized will depend on the extent of the deployment of these technologies and the effectiveness of V2V warnings in eliciting appropriate driver responses. The continued progress of V2V technology development hinges on a decision that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) plans to make in late 2013 on how to proceed regarding these technologies. One option would be to pursue a rulemaking requiring their inclusion in new vehicles. The deployment of V2V technologies faces a number of challenges, which DOT is working with the automobile industry to address. According to experts, DOT officials, automobile manufacturers, and other stakeholders GAO interviewed, these challenges include: 1) finalizing the technical framework and management framework of a V2V communication security system, which will be unique in its size and structure; 2) ensuring that the possible sharing with other wireless users of the radio-frequency spectrum used by V2V communications will not adversely affect V2V technology's performance; 3) ensuring that drivers respond appropriately to warnings of potential collisions; 4) addressing the uncertainty related to potential liability issues posed by V2V technologies; and 5) addressing any concerns the public may have, including those related to privacy. DOT is collaborating with automobile manufacturers and others to find potential technical and policy solutions to these challenges and plans to continue these efforts. Although V2V technologies are being tested in a real-world pilot that will end in February 2014, DOT officials stated that they cannot fully plan for deployment until NHTSA decides how to proceed later this year. DOT and the automobile industry are currently analyzing the total costs associated with V2V technologies, which include the costs of both in-vehicle components and a communication security system. All of the automobile manufacturers GAO interviewed said that it is difficult to estimate in-vehicle V2V component costs at this time because too many factors--such as future production volumes and the time frame of deployment--remain unknown. The costs associated with a V2V communication security system also remain unknown as the specifics of the system's technical framework and management structure are not yet finalized. While the costs of in-vehicle V2V components may be modest relative to the price of a new vehicle, some experts noted that the potential costs associated with the operation of a V2V communication security system could be significant. Further, it is currently unclear who--consumers, automobile manufacturers, DOT, state and local governments, or others--would pay the costs associated with a V2V communication security system."}
{"original_length": 16573, "trunc_length": 16384, "text": "\n\nSummarize the following text into a summary of less than 800 words.\n### Text:\n\nAccording to DOJ officials, the JAG program provides states and localities with federal funds to support all components of the criminal justice system while providing a great deal of flexibility in how they do so. Recovery Act JAG-funded projects may provide services directly to communities or improve the effectiveness and efficiency of criminal justice systems, processes, or procedures. Like non-Recovery Act JAG funds, Recovery Act JAG awards are to be used within the context of seven statutorily established areas. The seven statutorily established areas and examples of how JAG funds may be used within these areas are outlined in table 1 below. Financial Requirements and Internal Controls DOJ requires that all Recovery Act JAG award recipients establish and maintain adequate accounting systems, financial records, and internal controls to accurately account for funds awarded to them and their subrecipients. Award recipients must also ensure that Recovery Act JAG funds are accounted for separately and not commingled with funds from other sources or federal agencies. If a recipient or subrecipient’s accounting system cannot comply with the requirement to account for the funds separately, then the recipient/subrecipient is to establish a system to provide adequate fund accountability for each project that has been awarded. Recipient Reporting and Performance Measurement Requirements All state and local Recovery Act JAG recipients are required to meet both Recovery Act and BJA quarterly reporting requirements. The Recovery Act requires that nonfederal recipients of Recovery Act funds (including recipients of grants, contracts, and loans) submit quarterly reports, which include a description of each project or activity for which Recovery Act funds were expended or obligated, and an estimate of the number of jobs created and the number of jobs retained by these projects and activities. In particular, the Recovery Act requires recipients to report on quarterly activities within 10 days of the end of each quarter. For Recovery Act JAG grants, BJA has added language in the grant awards that requires that grantees meet the federal reporting requirements and provides sanctions if they do not. Because the Recovery Act JAG program includes a pass- through element, SAAs must gather the required data elements for all pass- through recipients during the same 10-day time frame in order to meet their own reporting requirements. Separately, BJA requires that states and those localities receiving their funds directly through DOJ report on their progress in meeting established performance measures related to funded activities. BJA also requires all Recovery Act JAG recipients to submit an annual programmatic report with narrative information on accomplishments, barriers, and planned activities, as well as a quarterly financial status report as required by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). In early 2010, after a year-long development and initial refinement period, BJA officially launched a new, online Performance Measurement Tool (PMT) to improve upon its previous grants management system and allow online performance measurement data submission. BJA plans to use the PMT to help evaluate performance outcomes in at least 13 grant programs, including Recovery Act JAG. According to the Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government, activities need to be established to monitor performance measures and indicators. Such controls should be aimed at validating the integrity of performance measures and indicators—in other words, ensuring they are reliably designed to collect consistent information from respondents. BJA is also planning on using the PMT to assess performance measurement data and direct improvement efforts in 5 additional programs by the end of 2010. However, given that grantees were not required to submit their PMT reports until the second quarter of fiscal year 2010, some grantees did not begin submitting their first completed PMT reports until March 2010. BJA requires Recovery Act JAG recipients to use the PMT for quarterly reporting on their status in meeting the Recovery Act JAG program’s 86 individual performance measures, such as percent of staff who reported an increase in skills and percent of Recovery Act JAG-funded programs that have implemented recommendations based on program evaluation. Recipients of Recovery Act JAG funding receive their money in one of two ways—either as a direct payment from BJA or as a pass-through from an SAA—and they reported using their funds primarily for law enforcement and corrections. According to state officials from our sample states, more than half of the funding that localities received as pass-through awards from their SAAs was obligated specifically for law enforcement and corrections support, while about a quarter of the funds that recipients of direct awards received was dedicated exclusively to law enforcement. Regardless of the source, officials in states and localities reported using Recovery Act JAG funds to preserve jobs and activities that without Recovery Act JAG funds would have been cut or eliminated; however, expenditure rates across states in our sample showed considerable variation. BJA allocates Recovery Act JAG funds the same way it allocated non- Recovery Act JAG funds by combining a statutory formula determined by states’ populations and violent crime statistics with a statutory minimum allocation to ensure that each state and eligible territory receives some funding. Under this statutory JAG formula, the total award allocated to a state is derived from two sources, each given equal value: half of the allocation is based on a state’s respective share of the U.S. population, and the other half is based on the state’s respective share of violent crimes, as reported in the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) Uniform Crime Report (UCR) Part I for the 3 most recent years for which data are available. Of such amounts awarded to states, 60 percent of a state’s allocation is awarded directly to a SAA in each of the states, and each SAA must in turn allocate a formula-based share of these funds to local entities, which is known as the “pass-through portion.” BJA awards the remaining 40 percent of the state’s allocation directly to eligible units of local government within the state. The eligible units of local governments that receive direct awards from DOJ either get them individually or as part of awards to “disparate” jurisdictions which jointly use correctional facilities or prosecutorial services. In the cases of the disparate jurisdiction awards, to qualify for funds, the units of local government involved must submit a joint application to DOJ and sign a memorandum of understanding (MOU) outlining how they will share funds. They also are to determine amongst themselves which local government will serve as the fiscal agent, and thereby be responsible for reporting to DOJ on behalf of the others and ensuring that all members of the disparate jurisdiction follow applicable federal financial guidance and meet reporting requirements. The following figure illustrates the participation of localities in a disparate jurisdiction award. In the example, High Point city is the fiscal agent and Greensboro city and Guilford County are both subrecipients. The total awards that DOJ allocates directly to units of local government— the 40 percent share—are to be based solely on the local jurisdiction’s proportion of the state’s total violent crime 3-year average based on reports from the FBI’s UCR Part I. Units of local government that could receive $10,000 or more after the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) analyzes the UCR data are eligible for a direct award from DOJ. Funds that could have been distributed to localities through awards of less than $10,000 are grouped together and then provided to the SAA. Under the JAG program, SAAs and direct grant recipient agencies may draw down funds from the Treasury immediately rather than requiring up-front expenditure and documentation for reimbursement. Such funds are required to be deposited into an interest-bearing trust fund and, in general, any interest income that states and localities earn from the funds drawn down is to be accounted for and used for program purposes. Table 2 shows the total allocation of Recovery Act JAG funding across our sample states, including the grant amounts BJA made directly to the SAAs (the 60 percent share); the number of pass-through grants the SAAs made in turn; and the grant amounts and number of grants BJA made directly to localities (the 40 percent share). The 14 states in our sample received $1,033,271,865 in JAG Recovery Act funds, which was more than half of the funds awarded nationwide for the program. Of the total of 1,338 direct awards that DOJ made to localities in the 14 states in our sample, approximately one-third of these direct awards, or 436, went to disparate jurisdictions and are split by agreement among the designated jurisdictions. Under these arrangements, one jurisdiction functions as the prime recipient and fiscal agent who is supposed to be responsible for submitting all programmatic or financial reports on behalf of the disparate group as well as monitoring other neighboring localities’ use of funds on activities covered by the grants. In our sample states, while one-third of the total number of direct grant awards were made to disparate jurisdictions, these arrangements accounted for 72 percent of the funds DOJ awarded directly to local recipients. For example, in Illinois, 100 percent of direct awards were provided to disparate jurisdictions, and in 8 of the other 13 states DOJ awarded more than 70 percent of funds in this manner. Officials we met with in localities that received funds under this type of arrangement reported that they provided varying amounts of oversight in there role as fiscal agent. The DOJ Inspector General has raised the oversight of subgrantee awards as an issue for DOJ’s attention and has recommended that DOJ develop further training for recipients; DOJ concurred with the recommendation. Table 3 summarizes the distribution of direct award funds to disparate jurisdictions in our sample states. The 14 SAAs in our sample received more than $630 million collectively as their share of the Recovery Act JAG funds. JAG statutory provisions require that each state pass-through no less than a specific designated minimum percentage of the funds that they receive as subgrants to localities, municipal governments, and nonprofit organizations. Among our sample states, this mandatory pass-through percentage varied from a high of 67.3 percent in California to a low of 35.5 percent in Massachusetts. SAAs are also allowed to retain up to 10 percent of the funds that they receive for administrative purposes. The completion of these pass-through award processes occurred at different rates across the 14 states that we sampled and resulted in some states expending their Recovery Act JAG funds faster than others. As of June 30, 2010, the SAAs we reviewed had made nearly all of their pass-through awards, with the exception of Mississippi and Pennsylvania. In addition, many local pass-through recipients reported that there was a time lag in being reimbursed by their SAAs for funds that they had spent. Additional information on amounts drawn down and expended is included in appendix IV. According to Recovery.gov, the SAAs and localities that received grant funds directly from DOJ in our sample of 14 states were awarded approximately $1.028 billion in Recovery Act JAG funds. This amount represents about 52 percent of the nearly $2 billion awarded to SAAs and directly funded localities across the nation. As of June 30, 2010, the SAAs and the directly funded localities in our sample expended over $270.7 million or about 26.4 percent of the total amount awarded. Recovery Act JAG fund recipients may spend their respective awards over a 4-year period. As depicted in figure 2 below, in the 14 states in our sample, the expenditure of Recovery Act JAG funds generally lags behind the amount of funds awarded by the SAAs and drawn down. For example, as of June 30, 2010, California—whose SAA received the largest direct award in our sample—had expended only about $6.6 million of the $135 million, or nearly 5 percent, of JAG grant funds the state received. Texas reported expending the most—more than $37 million—after combining expenditures the SAA made independently with the expenditures made by the more than 400 pass-through recipients. California SAA officials stated they delayed in awarding JAG funds because of the design of two new programs focused on probation and drug offender treatment services that accounted for $90 million of the $135 million in grant funds the SAA received. As of June 30, 2010, 100 percent of California’s subrecipients were finalized through grant award agreements, but many projects have recently become fully operational resulting in the slow expenditure of funds which are handled on a reimbursement basis. In Pennsylvania, SAA officials said the state faced two challenges in expending Recovery Act JAG funds quickly: (1) a state budget impasse, which delayed the allocation of Recovery Act JAG awards; and (2) Recovery Act JAG funding for state projects focused on technology costs, which require lengthy procurement times. Further, they noted that state pass-through funding to localities is recorded on a quarterly basis after expenses are incurred, so the pace of expenditure could be somewhat misleading. Other SAA officials we contacted cited additional reasons for more slowly expending Recovery Act JAG funds. For example, all of the SAAs we contacted have procedures in place that require subrecipients to make their purchases up-front with local funds and request reimbursement from the SAA after documentation is received. Two states we contacted have policies that restricted Recovery Act JAG funding to shorter time limits with an option for renewal rather than providing localities authority to use grants during the 4-year grant period applicable to the initial recipient of the grant. In addition, 1 of the 14 SAAs had a preference to retain Recovery Act JAG funds and expend funds gradually in longer-term projects, such as technology improvements, as allowed during the 4-year grant period. Using funds received through direct and pass-through awards, all states reported using Recovery Act JAG funds to prevent staff, programs, or essential services from being cut. In addition, local officials reported that without Recovery Act JAG funding law enforcement personnel, equipment purchases, and key local law enforcement programs would have been eliminated or cut. SAAs reported that they passed through about 50 percent of their funds and collectively they planned to use the largest share—about 30 percent, or almost $168 million—for law enforcement purposes. Direct recipients reported that funds were most often to be used for multiple purposes. Officials from all states in our sample reported using Recovery Act JAG funds to prevent staff, programs, or essential services from being cut. Also, 19 percent of localities in GAO’s sample, or officials in 12 of 62 localities, provided specific examples of ongoing local law enforcement programs or activities, such as juvenile recidivism reduction programs, prisoner re- entry initiatives, and local foot or bicycle patrols in high-crime neighborhoods that would not have continued without the addition of these funds. Table 4 provides some examples that state and local recipients reported regarding how they used Recovery Act JAG funds to help them preserve jobs and essential services. SAAs reported that they awarded the largest share—about 30 percent, or almost $168 million—for law enforcement purposes, such as hiring or retaining staff who might otherwise have been laid off, or purchasing equipment in direct support of law enforcement activities, as shown in figure 3. In addition, SAAs reported awarding approximately 24 percent, or more than $137 million, to support corrections programs or activities. SAAs reported allocating the smallest share for crime victim and witness programs, 2.1 percent or approximately $11.8 million. Within the category of law enforcement, equipment expenditures spanned a wide range of law enforcement gear, but vehicles and weapons purchases were often reported. Frequent types of purchases included: police cruisers; weapons, such as TASERs, and ammunition; communications devices, such as hand-held two-way radios, and mobile laptops in police cruisers; and safety equipment, such as protective vests and shields. See appendix V for examples of selected equipment purchased with JAG funds. Overall, localities in 13 out of the 14 states we contacted reported using Recovery Act JAG funds to maintain positions or pay officer overtime for activities related to law enforcement. Individual SAAs, however, reported obligating their Recovery Act JAG funds in a variety of ways as shown in table 5. The percentages do not include the funds that the SAAs retained for administrative purposes or funds not yet awarded. Nearly all SAAs in our sample states, except for Iowa, which reported using most of its funds to support drug enforcement activities, reported using Recovery Act JAG funds to support law enforcement activities. With the exception of Iowa, at the state level the share of Recovery Act JAG funds used to support direct equipment purchases and personnel expenses ranges from a high of 65.8 percent in Texas to a low of 1.7 percent in New York. Localities in more than a third of the states in our sample (5 of 14) reported that uncertainties about the availability of future JAG funding steered them toward one-time equipment purchases, such as the procurement of license plate readers and in-car laptop computers, rather than investments, such as hiring new personnel, that would require an ongoing commitment of funds and whose sustainability could be threatened when Recovery Act JAG funds expire. In addition, officials in about a quarter of the localities in our sample (15) discussed how they coordinate the use of their Recovery Act JAG funds with resources that they received from other federal funding streams. For example, the cities of Austin, Texas and Greensboro, North Carolina were each waiting to receive a separate federal grant specifically for the purpose of hiring police officers so that they could determine whether to spend Recovery Act JAG funds to equip the officers once hired. See figure 4 for an interactive map with additional information on Recovery Act JAG funds purchases and activities in our sample states. As shown in figure 5, data reported by direct recipient localities in the 14 states that we sampled indicate that they obligated the largest share— more than 63 percent, or over $256 million—for multiple purposes and 21.5 percent, or about $86.8 million, to directly support law enforcement programs or activities. Program planning, evaluation, and technology improvement funds, which accounted for approximately 8 percent of spending, were primarily used to enhance communications equipment or purchase computer hardware and software for all types of criminal justice agencies and programs. Based on the information grantees reported to Recovery.gov, the number of the projects reported has dropped slightly over the last three reporting periods since projects that are completed discontinue reporting. This was the case most often when funds were used for discrete equipment purchases, such as law enforcement vehicles, laptop computers in police cars, or weapons. A majority of the SAA officials we interviewed said that workload demand and personnel shortages made meeting Recovery Act mandated deadlines within the prescribed reporting period difficult. Section 1512(c) of the Recovery Act requires that each Recovery Act award recipient submit a report no later than 10 days after the end of each quarter to the federal awarding agency. In the case of Recovery Act JAG, the federal awarding agency is DOJ. The Section 1512(c) report that Recovery Act recipients, such as Recovery Act JAG recipients, are required to submit must contain the following data: (1) the total amount of recovery funds received from the federal awarding agency; (2) the amount of recovery funds received that were expended or obligated to projects or activities; and (3) a detailed list of all projects or activities for which recovery funds were expended or obligated. All 14 SAAs we contacted said that they had the necessary systems in place to account for Recovery Act JAG funds received and that subrecipients were generally in compliance with their financial reporting requirements. Officials in 10 out of 14 SAAs in our sample specifically cited the Recovery Act’s window of reporting no later than 10 days after the end of each quarter as challenging. Officials in 8 out of 14 SAAs in our sample said that meeting federal Recovery Act reporting requirements increased staff workload and about one-third of the SAAs told us that personnel shortages have created challenges in their abilities to specifically meet Recovery Act reporting deadlines. For example, officials for one county in Colorado noted that increased reporting responsibilities associated with Recovery Act JAG grants resulted in one full-time staff member spending nearly 2 full work weeks on federal oversight and reporting requirements over a 5 ½-month time frame. Officials noted that the same individual spent 16 hours on reporting requirements for a non-Recovery Act JAG award and a state pass-through award during the same time period. Furthermore, officials in Texas, New York, and Mississippi said they required additional personnel to manage Recovery Act awards and meet reporting requirements. In addition, an official in one SAA also told us that because of short data collection time frames they initially submitted incomplete quarterly data and likely underreported the impact of the Recovery Act JAG program in the first two quarterly 1512(c) reports. While state and local officials we interviewed said that meeting the 1512(c) report’s 10-day time frame remains challenging, none of the states in our sample said that they were unable to meet the 1512(c) reporting deadline. In addition, the number of direct award recipients that completed the report has generally remained constant (around 800) over the three reporting quarters from October 1, 2009, to June 30, 2010. DOJ awarded over 70 percent, or more than $289 million of direct award funds, to 436 disparate jurisdictions. DOJ guidance states that the recipient (i.e., fiscal agent) in each disparate jurisdiction is responsible for monitoring “subawards” and for “oversight of subrecipient spending and monitoring of specific outcomes and benefits attributable to the use of Recovery Act funds by its subrecipients.” DOJ guidance provides detailed information on financial and accounting requirements for direct recipients and subrecipients of DOJ grant programs. The guidance also states that fiscal agents must implement and communicate a policy for reviewing subrecipient data. DOJ guidance, however, does not provide instruction on what a subrecipient monitoring or data policy should include; nor does it state how outcomes and benefits tied to the Recovery Act should be monitored. The DOJ Office of the Inspector General issued a report in August 2010 which included the results of grant audits it performed across 12 state and local recipients of both Recovery Act and non-Recovery Act JAG program funds. The Inspector General found that 7 of the 12 grant recipients had deficiencies in the area of monitoring of subrecipients and contractors. The Inspector General recommended that DOJ’s Office of Justice Programs provide additional training and oversight of JAG recipients to ensure that they establish policies and procedures for monitoring subrecipients’ activities to provide reasonable assurance that subrecipients administer JAG funds in accordance with program guidelines. DOJ concurred with the recommendation that it provide additional training and oversight over the monitoring of subrecipient activities, and plans to review financial training course content to ensure that proper internal control guidance on subrecipient monitoring is included. DOJ anticipates developing a training module specific to subrecipient monitoring by March 31, 2011. All of the SAAs we contacted (14 of 14) reported that they generally shared Recovery Act JAG information, promising practices, or lessons learned with other states and localities using a variety of techniques. Furthermore, DOJ had developed a number of programs that encourage the sharing of information and promising practices. State SAA officials told us that efforts to share information with one another or amongst the localities in their jurisdictions include in-person meetings, telephone calls, e-mail, Web postings, and/or hosting conferences. In addition, the SAA officials told us they find value in sharing information by attending DOJ training sessions and conferences and participating in programs and events sponsored by associations, such as the National Governors Association (NGA), the National Criminal Justice Association (NCJA), and the Council of State Governments (CSG). For example: Texas officials developed an electronic state government grant management and tracking system that they stated is helpful and efficient in managing Recovery Act JAG funds. Texas officials told us they shared the design of this online system with several states. In addition, during BJA conferences and other national training conferences, Texas officials noted that they took the opportunity to discuss with other states the promising practices and lessons learned related to grant management and the administration of JAG funds using their system. Colorado officials said that SAA staff made presentations at national and regional conferences regarding the following: (1) grant management and monitoring of state uses for effective grant administration, (2) various programs the state has funded, and (3) outcomes the state has achieved. SAA officials said that the state encourages subgrantees that have demonstrated successful programs to respond to requests for presenters at state and national conferences. Officials told us that staff from three Colorado Recovery Act JAG subgrantee projects made presentations at the NCJA Western Regional Conference in April 2010. For example, Colorado officials told us that one presentation involved the retraining of probation and parole officers to reduce recidivism by working with other agencies in taking an overall supportive approach to working with ex-offenders that included assistance in such areas as housing, health, and finding work. Ohio officials told us they take the initiative to contact other SAAs to discuss and share experiences, lessons learned, and promising practices regarding problems encountered in administering Recovery Act JAG grants. They also said that NCJA provides SAAs with a forum to share information and challenges associated with administering recovery funds, which Ohio has leveraged. For example, they stated that at the 2010 NCJA Mid-Western Regional Conference that Ohio officials attended, there were sessions where SAAs shared experiences about the administration of Recovery Act funds, as well as were workshops on model projects funded through the Recovery Act. According to Ohio officials, the information was helpful both in terms of planning their own initiatives and in reaffirming decisions they had made regarding Recovery Act and Recovery Act JAG programs. Illinois officials told us that they hosted a 2-day criminal justice planning summit in September 2010 for all state actors in the criminal justice system including Recovery Act JAG practitioners, policymakers, academics, and legislators. According to SAA officials, the focus of the summit was on how to fight crime more effectively in a time of diminishing resources by using the promising evidence-based practices. State summit planners told us that both presentations by state and national experts and workshops focused on implementing promising practices, while the emphasis in follow-up work groups was on producing a long-range criminal justice plan for the state of Illinois. In addition, SAA officials told us that they share promising practices and lessons learned by participating in regional training conferences, Web- based seminars, and/or informational conferences provided by OMB, DOJ, as well as Illinois state agencies. DOJ encourages information sharing through regional training conferences, Web-sites, and Web-based clearinghouses. For example, training meetings and Webinars provide a forum which states find valuable for sharing information and promising practices, according to a majority of (9 of the 14) states we interviewed. In addition, BJA has developed a Web site that illustrates examples of successful and/or innovative Recovery Act JAG programs. The Web site highlights JAG subgrantees and/or statewide projects that BJA believes show promise in meeting the objectives and goals of Recovery Act JAG. In particular, the site describes the planned Illinois criminal justice information strategic planning initiative and summit discussed above. Further, DOJ’s Office of Justice Programs is in the process of developing an informational Web-based clearinghouse of promising practice information for the criminal justice community through a public Web site where researchers, grant applicants, and others may find a list of model programs proven to be effective. According to DOJ officials, it will also be a site that SAAs can use to help find best practices and model programs, thereby funding discretionary programs that show promise based upon evidence. While the focus of the DOJ information- sharing programs is broader than Recovery Act JAG, they offer methods and mechanisms to share information related to program priorities, such as law enforcement, corrections, and technology improvement. SAA officials, in a majority of the states we interviewed, indicated that they were supportive of these efforts. In addition, national associations such as NGA, CSG, and NCJA encourage states to share information and promising practices. The focus of these programs is generally broader than Recovery Act JAG, but some exclusively focus on Recovery Act JAG priorities such as law enforcement, corrections, and technology improvement. For example, BJA has funded NCJA to provide on-site training and technical assistance, Webinars, and regional conferences, and creates and disseminates publications to assist SAAs in developing their statewide criminal justice plans and ensure effective use of Recovery Act JAG funds. NCJA also serves as an information clearinghouse on innovative programming from across the nation, and coordinates information sharing for the justice assistance community. DOJ developed and implemented 86 new performance measures for the Recovery Act JAG program in 2009 and continues to make efforts to improve them, but the current set of performance measures varies in the degree to which it includes key characteristics of successful performance measurement systems. According to DOJ officials, these performance measures are currently being refined in consultation with stakeholders, such as SAAs and the external contractor hired to maintain the PMT. We acknowledge that creating such measures is difficult, given that the performance measurement system is under development, but until these measures are refined, they could hinder the department’s ability to assess and communicate whether the goals of the Recovery Act JAG program are being achieved. In addition, states conveyed mixed perspectives about the utility of DOJ’s performance measurement tool which enables recipients to self-identify activities associated with their grant and then self-report on the relevant set of performance measures under each activity. DOJ has not yet completed development of a mechanism to verify the accuracy of this recipient-reported information in the PMT. From the more than 80 Recovery Act JAG performance measures, we analyzed a nonprobability sample of 19 (see app. II) and found several areas where the measures could better reflect the characteristics that our prior work has shown to support successful assessment systems (see app. III) For example, the 19 Recovery Act JAG performance measures we reviewed generally lacked, in varying degrees, several key attributes of successful performance measurement systems, such as clarity, reliability, linkages with strategic or programmatic goals, objectivity, and the measurability of targets. DOJ officials acknowledge the limitations of the current system and are undertaking efforts to refine Recovery Act JAG performance measures. As we have previously reported, performance measures that evaluate program results can help decision makers make more informed policy decisions regarding program achievements and performance. By including key attributes of successful performance measurement systems into its performance measure revisions, DOJ could facilitate accountability, be better positioned to monitor and assess results, and subsequently improve its grants management. Table 6 describes 5 of 9 key characteristics of successful assessment systems and the potentially adverse consequences agencies face when omitting these attributes from their measurement design. These 5 characteristics—clarity, reliability, linkage to strategic goals, objectivity, and measurable targets—are attributes that may be most effectively used when reviewing performance measures individually. There are 4 others— governmentwide priorities, core program activities, limited overlap, or balance—that are best used when reviewing a complete set of measures. Since we selected a nonprobability sample of 19 measures that were most closely associated with the majority of expenditures, we focused our analysis on the 5 that could be applied to individual measures and did not assess the sample for the other 4 attributes that are associated with an evaluation of a full set of measures. Nevertheless, these 4 attributes also can provide useful guidance when establishing or revising a set of performance measures as a whole. In conducting our analysis, we applied the 5 characteristics most applicable to assessment of individual performance to the 19 measures in our nonprobability sample. Our analysis found that 5 of the 19 measures were clearly defined but the remaining 14 were not, which is inconsistent with DOJ’s guidance to grant recipients for assessing program performance. In particular, DOJ advises that states’ grant programs should have performance measures with “clearly specified goals and objectives.” In addition, 14 of the 19 measures were not linked to DOJ’s strategic or programmatic goals. We also found that while 9 out of the 19 measures were objective, 13 out of 19 were not reliable, and 17 out of the 19 measures did not have measurable targets. In addition to our analysis, we provided a standard set of questions to officials across our sample states seeking their perspectives on how effectively the Recovery Act JAG performance measures evaluate program results. These officials provided their comments about the PMT and raised concerns about how the performance measures lack clarity, reliability, and linkage to strategic goals. From our analysis we determined that 14 out of the 19 measures we analyzed lacked sufficient descriptive detail to facilitate precise measurement. For example, our analysis found that 1 of DOJ’s measures associated with evaluating personnel activities is the “percent of departments that report desired efficiency.” However, for this measure, DOJ’s guidance based on the definition provided in the performance measure lacks key data elements that would make the measure more clear—namely, which departments should be included in the measure or how states and localities should interpret “desired efficiency.” In addition, officials we interviewed from 9 of the 14 SAAs in our sample stated that DOJ’s Recovery Act JAG performance measures were unclear. Some examples of states’ perspectives follow: In particular, an official from the Texas SAA told us that Texas refined its state data collection tool to clarify performance measure guidance and eliminate instances where DOJ rejected data entries because the measure was not clear. As another example, according to Texas officials, one of the DOJ performance measures related to training is “Other forms of training conducted during the reporting period.” However, Texas state officials noted that BJA did not clarify whether this measure would include non-Recovery Act training. As a result, the Texas state data collection tool revised the performance measure for better context and asked for the “the number of other forms of training conducted during the reporting period and paid with ARRA JAG funds.” Other state officials from Michigan and Georgia cited challenges in understanding what is being asked by the 13 measures listed under the activity type, “state and local initiatives.” In particular, one of these states noted confusion and lack of clarity related to the measure, “number of defined groups receiving services,” since in many instances their initiatives were associated with equipment purchases, and it would be difficult to determine who and how many benefited from a new computer system or the acquisition of new ammunition, for example. Ohio and Pennsylvania state officials noted that DOJ uses terminology such as “efficiency” and “quality” that is not clearly defined. Officials we interviewed from another five states stated that they could not understand whether the term “personnel” should include the entire agency or department that was awarded the Recovery Act JAG grant or if it should include only the portion of staff within a department that is directly affected by the funding. When we discussed with DOJ officials our concerns that the performance measure definitions at times lacked clarity, they stated that each was defined, but that further work was being done to solicit feedback from grantees on the measures and their definitions. However, as we discussed above, our analysis determined that 14 out of the 19 measures do not have clear definitions. DOJ officials noted that the department hosts several training opportunities designed to provide grantees opportunities for clarification, including two Webinars every quarter and ongoing field training. DOJ officials also explained that they hired an external contractor to operate the PMT Help Desk to provide grantees guidance from 8:30-5:00 EST. However, officials from three states we contacted noted that while the PMT Help Desk provided useful technical assistance, the Help Desk provided limited guidance to clarify the definition of performance measures. Therefore, officials from these states reported being confused about what to report. In July 2010, we reported that a measure not clearly stated can confuse users and cause managers or other stakeholders to think that performance was better or worse than it actually was. Our analysis showed that 13 out of 19 measures could lead to unreliable findings because respondents could interpret and report on the measures inconsistently. A performance measure is considered reliable when it is designed to collect data or calculate results such that each time the measure is applied—in the same situation—a similar result is likely to be reported. Respondents’ inconsistent interpretation of the measures could preclude using many of the measures as indicators of performance. For example, we found that one measure: “the percent of departments that report desired efficiency,” was measured and reported on differently by different recipients. According to SAA officials in one state, different police department units in a single large metropolitan area counted themselves as separate departments, while according to SAA officials in another state, all police department units were counted collectively as one. In another state, SAA staff stated that BJA’s guidance document for the Recovery Act JAG performance measures did not provide enough instruction to ensure that agencies reported the correct data. For example, the staff said they could not determine whether the PMT measure for “the number of personnel retained with Recovery Act JAG funds during the reporting period” was to include any personnel position paid for with Recovery Act JAG funds during the reporting period, or to represent an unduplicated number of personnel positions retained with Recovery Act JAG funds during the reporting period. Given the confusion, the officials sought and received guidance from the Help Desk on how to interpret and report the measure. Further, officials from 4 of the 14 SAAs in our sample expressed concern about possible inconsistent data entry among the subrecipients of their pass-through grants. For example, officials from Ohio noted that since subrecipients had their own interpretation of how to report on the measures, they believed that there would be a lack of consistency and reliability within the state as well as across all states once BJA attempted to aggregate the responses. In addition, a related issue is how DOJ validates the information states and localities submit in order to ensure that the results the department reports are accurate and reliable. We have previously reported that weaknesses in monitoring processes for verifying performance data can raise concerns about the accuracy of the self-reported data received from grantees. We also reported that if errors occur in the collection of data or the calculation of their results, it may affect conclusions about the extent to which performance goals have been achieved. For example, self-reported performance information that is not reported accurately could provide data that are less reliable for decision making. DOJ officials acknowledged that they have not verified the accuracy of states’ and localities’ self-reported performance data. However, they told us they have been meeting with their contractor to review a draft verification and validation plan, but have not yet implemented a system to verify and validate grantees’ performance data or implement data reliability checks on the performance measures in the PMT. DOJ officials also attributed their challenges to ensuring data integrity to limited resources, stating that they lack adequate full-time staff to improve, develop, and implement performance measures at this time. Specifically, DOJ officials told us that they rely on a contractor because they have only one staff person overseeing states’ and locals’ completion of the measures, and improving and developing the tool. Until a data verification process is in place, DOJ could experience difficulty in ensuring performance results are reported reliably across state and local grantee recipients. DOJ communicated specific Recovery Act goals, such as jobs created or retained, to recipients; but did not provide information on how its Recovery Act JAG performance measures aligned with programmatic or strategic goals. Our analysis showed that 5 of the 19 measures were linked to Recovery Act goals. For example, DOJ recently included a performance measure for Recovery Act jobs reporting, which is the “number of personnel retained with Recovery Act JAG funds.” The remaining 14 measures lacked a clear linkage to any of DOJ’s goals. For example, 1 of the measures related to the activity type “information systems” is the “percent of departments that completed improvements in information systems for criminal justice.” However, DOJ does not explain how the performance measure for “improvements to information systems for criminal justice” relates or links to agencywide goals. When we asked DOJ officials to describe how the Recovery Act JAG performance measures align with broader departmental goals, they explained that the JAG authorizing legislation guides the states’ use of the funds within the seven general purpose areas for JAG and that they do not link these purpose areas to current year DOJ goals. However, DOJ officials explained that Recovery Act JAG performance measures are linked to the department’s strategic goal 2, “Prevent Crime, Enforce Federal Laws, and Represent the Rights and Interests of the American People,” and strategic goal 3, “Ensure the Fair and Efficient Administration of Justice.” DOJ officials did not provide written documentation or guidance to Recovery Act JAG recipients that explained this linkage to facilitate understanding of how performance measures were being used consistently with DOJ’s strategic and programmatic goals. Further, with the exception of Recovery Act goals, officials from all 14 of the SAAs noted that they did not see a direct linkage between the Recovery Act JAG performance measures and DOJ’s overall agencywide goals. As we have previously reported, successful organizations try to link specific performance goals and measures to the organization’s overall strategic goals and, to the extent possible, have performance goals that will show annual progress toward achieving their long-term strategic goals. In addition, we have previously reported that, without performance measures linked to goals on the results that an organization expects the program to achieve, several consequences can occur: (1) managers may be held accountable for performance that is not mission critical or at odds with the mission, and (2) staff will not have a road map to understand how the measures support overall strategic and operating goals. In our assessment, we determined that 9 out of the 19 measures were objective. We previously reported that to be objective, performance measures should (1) be reasonably free of significant bias; and (2) indicate specifically what is to be observed, in which population or conditions, an d in what time frame. An example of a BJA performance measure that w determined is objective is the measure “amount of Recovery Act JAG funds used to purchase equipment and/or supplies during the re period.” This measure provides a specific time frame in which expenditures for equipment and/or supplies must have occurred and clearly explains that the amount of funds used for purchasing equi and/or supplies is what should be reported. An example of a BJA performance measure that we determined lacks objectivity is the measure the “percent of staff that directly benefit from equipment or supplies purchased by Recovery Act JAG funds, who report a desired change in their job performance.” We determined that this measure lacks objectivity because it does not indicate specifically what is to be observed, in wh d population, and in what time frame, and is not free from opinion an judgment. For example, it requires those reporting to subjectively determine which staff members directly benefit from an equipment or supplies purchase and which staff members do not. It also requires a subjective determination of how the purchase of equipment or suppli affected a desired change in the performance of staff members who directly benefited from the purchase. When we discussed the issue of es objectivity with DOJ they stated that BJA instructs grantees to only rep on BJA funded activities which occurred during the reporting period. However, they conceded that the measures were open to interpretation and that was a weakness, but suggested that that was the best option give the need to have universal measures that apply to a broad range of uses. We do not agree that all the measures we reviewed were defined sufficiently to prevent subjective interpretation. In addition Texas officials expressed concern that DOJ will not be able to obtain useful data from the PMT because of the subjective interpretation involved in responding to certain of the Recovery Act JAG performance measures. For example, Texas officials identified responses to questions, such as the “percent of departments that report desired program quality” or “percent of staff who reported an increase in skills” as illustrative of the kinds of questions that are open to wide interpretation based on the siz e of the law enforcement organization and the classification of individuals within the organization. In our assessment, we determined that 17 out of the 19 measures lacke measurable targets. Among the 17, the absence of measurable targets meant that outside of their original application the award recipients did not have the opportunity to establish in advance what their target level o performance would be to allow for comparisons to actual performance achieved for the reporting period covered. For example, in the measure “Number of overtime hours paid with Recovery Act JAG funds,” BJA did not design the measure to allow award recipients to specify their target number of hours paid prior to receiving funding. DOJ did recognize that the “project objectives,” i.e. the funded activities, should be linked to meaningful and measurable outcomes associated the Recovery Act and the likelihood of achieving such outcomes be assessed. For example, language in the Recovery Act JAG application instructions requires that, where possible and appropriate, an estimate o the number of jobs created and retained be developed. In addition, the Recovery Act JAG application for funds also requires that the narrative include performance measures established by the organization to assess whether grant objectives are being met and a timeline or plan to iden tify when the goals and objectives are completed. However, measurable targets against which to benchm the narrative. ark results are not explicitly required in As noted, two measures did include measurable targets, and as such will facilitate future assessments of whether overall goals and objectives ar e achieved because comparisons can be easily made between projected performance and actual results. For example in these two measures—”the change in the number of individuals arrested in a targeted group by crime type” and “the change in reported crime rates in a community by crime type”—DOJ provides a list of expectations, such as “we expected number of individuals arrested to increase as a result of our efforts” or “we expected number of individuals arrested to decrease as a result of our efforts,” from which the department expects respondents to choose, to facilitate comparison between the actual and expected number of arrests and reported crimes during a particular quarter. State officials had mixed perspectives on the PMT and Recovery Act performance measures, with some critiquing it even as they acknowledged its utility in principle. For example, five SAAs noted that DOJ’s measures were in development and acknowledged the difficulty for DOJ in developing a tool that could be used nationwide for assessing outputs and outcomes across multiple programs. They also were hopeful that the tool would increase uniform program data collection and allow for meaningful comparisons of data and outcomes across states and different jurisdictions. State officials also had positive comments about DOJ’s Help Desk and the staff who provided technical support for the use of the tool. In addition, while eight states were silent on the issue, state officials from our remaining seven states stressed that reporting on the JAG Recovery Act performance measures is time-consuming and duplicative of other existing state performance measurement reporting systems. For examp officials from Colorado, Pennsylvania, and Illinois had concerns about limited staff availability to monitor the workload associated with meeting both Recovery Act and the PMT reporting requirements. Specifically, officials stated that they have to monitor subrecipient activities and provide monthly and quarterly information—as well as validate jobs le, reporting through payroll, expenses, and timesheets—to ensure job cou are calculated accurately and consistently. In other examples, officials from Colorado and Iowa expressed concern that the PMT duplicates their existing state performance measurement systems with similar measures and results in duplication of effort. In addition, the burden of complying with both BJA and state requirement led some states, such as Michigan, Ohio, and Texas, to eliminate some of their state performance systems even though officials told us that they believed that these systems measured performance outcomes better than the PMT performance measures. For example, Michigan state officials explained that their preexisting state quarterly performance reports provided specific data on grant outcomes that were of interest to state legislators and policymakers, and which are not included in the PMT performance measures. In particular, Michigan’s state performance system included measures related to drug courts, such as the number of drug-free babies that are born to participants. Under the Recovery Act, the JAG program made available nearly $2 billion in additional funds for states and local governments, which states and localities reported using primarily for law enforcement activities while also maintaining some programs that would have been eliminated or cut. Although reporting challenges remain with regard to the Recovery Act itself, states and localities took steps to share information about promising practices funded through JAG, and DOJ has measures in place to facilitate such information sharing. In addition, the new performance measures that DOJ has developed capture information on the use of Recovery Act JAG funds. However, while DOJ’s performance measures include attributes of successful measures, further improvements are possible. Because the Recovery Act JAG program supports a wide array of activities, as well as the personnel to implement them, having clear performance measures that allow grant recipients to demonstrate results would provide useful information to DOJ regarding how Recovery Act JAG funds are being used. Our previous work has identified key attributes of successful performance measurement systems that would help assess progress and make performance information useful for key management decisions. According to the sample we reviewed, DOJ’s performance measures do not consistently exhibit key attributes of successful performance measurement systems, such as clarity, reliability, linkage, objectivity, and measurable targets. Measures that are not clearly stated can confuse users and cause managers or other stakeholders to think that performance was better or worse than it actually was. The lack of data reliability can create challenges in ensuring accurate information is recorded for performance purposes. Further, the lack of measurable targets also limits the ability to assess program performance and provides limited information to Congress about the success of the program. Moreover, successful organizations try to link performance goals and measures to the organization’s strategic goals and should have performance goals that will show annual progress toward achieving long-term strategic goals. In addition, by establishing a mechanism to verify accuracy of self-reported data, DOJ can better ensure reliability of information that is reported. By addressing attributes consistent with promising performance measurement practices as it works to revise its performance measures, DOJ could be better positioned to determine whether Recovery Act JAG recipients’ programs are used to support all seven JAG program purposes and are meeting DOJ and Recovery Act program goals. Recognizing that DOJ is already engaged in efforts to refine its Recovery Act JAG performance measures in the PMT, we recommend that the Acting Director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance take the following two actions to better monitor Recovery Act JAG program performance and demonstrate results through use of this instrument: in revising the department’s Recovery Act JAG performance measures consider, as appropriate, key attributes of successful performance measurement systems, such as clarity, reliability, linkage, objectivity, and measurable targets; and develop a mechanism to validate the integrity of Recovery Act JAG recipients’ self-reported performance data. We provided a draft of this report to DOJ for review and comments. DOJ provided written comments on the draft report, which are reproduced in full in Appendix VII. DOJ concurred with the recommendations in the report and stated that BJA plans to take actions that will address both of our recommendations by October 1, 2011. Specifically, in response to our first recommendation that DOJ revise the Recovery Act JAG performance measures to consider, as appropriate, key attributes of successful performance measurement systems, DOJ stated that BJA is taking steps to revise the Recovery Act JAG performance measures—in conjunction with State Administering Agencies—and that it specifically will consider clarity, reliability, linkage, objectivity, and measurable targets in redesigning its performance measures. In response to our second recommendation relating to data quality, DOJ stated that BJA will develop and implement a mechanism to validate the integrity of Recovery Act JAG recipients’ self- reported performance data. DOJ also provided technical comments on a draft of this report, which we incorporated as appropriate. We are sending copies of this report to the Attorney General, selected congressional committees, and other interested parties. In addition, the report will be available at no charge on the GAO Web site at http://www.gao.gov. Please contact David Maurer at (202) 512-9627 if you or your staff has any questions concerning this report. Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. Key contributors to this report are listed in appendix VIII. This report addresses the following four questions: (1) How are Recovery Act Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) funds awarded and how have recipients in selected states and localities used their awards? (2) What challenges, if any, have Recovery Act JAG recipients reported in complying with Recovery Act reporting requirements? (3) To what extent do states share promising practices related to the use and management of Recovery Act JAG funds, and how, if at all, does the Department of Justice (DOJ) encourage information sharing? (4) To what extent are DOJ’s Recovery Act JAG performance measures consistent with promising practices? As agreed with your office, we focused our review on Recovery Act JAG grants in a nonprobability sample of 14 states. The grants made to these states included both direct awards that DOJ made to State Administering Agencies (SAAs) and localities, as well as pass-through awards SAAs made to localities. A portion of this work was done in conjunction with our other Recovery Act reviews that focused on those 16 states, as well as the District of Columbia that represent the majority of Recovery Act spending. The 16 states included Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Texas. We selected these states and the District of Columbia on the basis of federal outlay projections, percentage of the U.S. population represented, unemployment rates and changes, and a mix of states’ poverty levels, geographic coverage, and representation of both urban and rural areas. Collectively, these states contain about 65 percent of the U.S. population and are estimated to receive about two-thirds of the intergovernmental assistance available through the Recovery Act. However, for the purposes of this report, we limited our scope to a subset of 14 of these states so as not to duplicate ongoing work in the other 3 (Florida, New Jersey, and the District of Columbia) that the DOJ Office of Inspector General was conducting. The awards to these 14 states accounted for approximately 50 percent of all Recovery Act JAG funds provided. To identify how recipients of direct and pass-through funds received and used their Recovery Act JAG awards in selected states and localities, we conducted in-person and telephone interviews with officials from SAAs in all 14 states as well as officials from a nonprobability sample of 62 localities in these states. Where statements are attributed to state and local officials, we did not analyze state and locality data sources but relied on state and local officials and other state sources for relevant state data and materials. We selected these localities based on the amount of their grant awards, the activities that they were undertaking with grant funds, whether they reported that they had completed 50 percent or more of their grant activities according to their responses provided in Recovery Act reporting, and how they received their funds (either as passed-through funding from their SAA or received awards directly from DOJ—and in some cases as part of disparate jurisdictions.) Our interviews addressed the use and perceived impact of Recovery Act JAG funds, program performance measurement and reporting challenges, and sharing of promising practices. Also, we reviewed DOJ direct award data and SAA pass-through awards in 14 SAAs. We also reviewed Recovery Act quarterly reports from Recovery.gov (4th quarter 2009, 1st quarter 2010, and 2nd quarter 2010) to identify additional information on the use of JAG funds. Based on this information, we assigned the grants to one of the seven JAG general purpose areas. For those where multiple purposes were indicated, they were so identified. In cases where a purpose could not be identified we placed it in the category of “not enough information.” We collected and used these funding data because they are the official source of Recovery Act spending. Based on our limited examination of the data thus far we consider them to be sufficiently reliable for our purposes. Findings from our nonprobability samples cannot be generalized to all states and localities that were recipients of Recovery Act JAG funds; however, our samples provided us with illustrative examples of uses of funds, oversight processes, and reporting issues. To determine the extent to which Recovery Act JAG recipients faced challenges in complying with Recovery Act requirements, we interviewed representatives from the 14 SAAs and 62 localities and asked them about their experience with 1512(c) reporting requirements and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance. In addition, we reviewed our previous reports that discuss Recovery Act recipient reporting issues. To identify how states share promising practice information, and the extent to which DOJ encourages information sharing, we conducted in- person and telephone interviews with representatives from all 14 of the SAAs. We also reviewed DOJ information, interviewed DOJ officials, and consulted reports from the National Criminal Justice Association, the National Governors’ Association, and others that describe their information-sharing activities. To identify the extent to which DOJ’s performance measurement approach is consistent with promising practices to assess progress, we interviewed representatives from the 14 SAAs and 62 localities and asked them about their experience with the Performance Measurement Tool (PMT). We also discussed the PMT’s design and Recovery Act JAG performance measure improvement efforts with DOJ staff. Further, we conducted a review of the performance measures that were required for use under the Recovery Act JAG activities commonly reported to have been undertaken by the grant recipients in our sample. From the 86 Recovery Act JAG performance measures under 10 activity types, we analyzed a nonprobability sample of the 19 performance measures required under 4 of the activity areas (Personnel, Equipment and Supplies, Information Systems for Criminal Justice, and the category Outcomes for all Activity Types). We selected these activity types and measures because they were the ones associated with the largest share of reported Recovery Act JAG expenditures and therefore most often encountered by the grant recipients. We then assessed these measures against a set of key characteristics that we have previously reported as being associated with promising practices and successful performance measures we have identified in our previous work. Some of the 9 key characteristics of successful performance measures are attributes that may be most effectively used when reviewing performance measures individually and some are best used when reviewing a complete set of measures. Since we selected a nonprobability sample of measures that was most closely associated with the majority of expenditures, we focused our analysis most heavily on those attributes that could be applied to individual measures—clarity, reliability, linkage to strategic goals, objectivity, and measurable targets. We did not assess the subset of 19 performance measures for the attributes of governmentwide priorities, core program activities, limited overlap, or balance that are associated with an evaluation of a full set of measures. To evaluate the sample, four analysts independently assessed each of the performance measures against attributes of successful performance measures previously identified by GAO. Those analysts then met to discuss and resolve any differences in the results of their analysis. In conducting this analysis, we analyzed program performance measure information contained in DOJ’s Performance Measurement Tool for American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (Recovery Act - ARRA) and fiscal year 2009 Justice Assistance Grant Programs. We did not do a detailed assessment of DOJ’s methodology for developing the measures, but looked at the issues necessary to assess whether a particular measure met the overall characteristics of a successful performance measure. We also reviewed our previous reports that discuss the importance of performance measurement system attributes and obtained information on the extent to which such systems may impact agencies’ planning. The activity types and number of measures selected are listed in table 7. We conducted this performance audit from January 2010 through October 2010 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. The following table contains the 19 Performance Measurement Tool (PMT) performance measures that were required for use under the Recovery Act JAG activity types commonly undertaken by the grant recipients in our sample. Department of Justice (DOJ) records indicate that all 14 of the states in our sample have drawn down the vast majority of their Recovery Act Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) awards as of May 2010. Specifically, the amounts drawn down range from less than 53 percent to almost 98 percent. Table 10 shows the amount and percentage of these funds that have been drawn down and expended by State Administering Agencies (SAAs), their subrecipients, and localities. The following table illustrates the types of equipment purchases recipients within our 14 sample states have made using Recovery Act Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) funds. This appendix provides the full printed text of the interactive content in figure 4 on page 22 in the body of the report. Specifically, the following figures describe planned uses of Recovery Act Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) funds by each State Administering Agency (SAA) across our 14 sample states, which are listed in alphabetical order by state name. According to state officials, without Recovery Act funds, the state faced budget cuts and would have had to severely cut or discontinue at least half of the projects previously funded with JAG money. In particular, about $20.8 million in Recovery Act JAG funds supported drug task forces and these drug task forces helped account for seizures of 847,665 grams of cocaine; 49,586 grams of heroin; 206,713 grams of methamphetamine; and 305,082 pounds of marijuana in 2008. Prosecution and courts $11,074,062 Program planning, evaluation and technology improvement Crime victim and witness programs $1,265,348 According to state and local officials, Recovery Act JAG supported local gang and drug reduction efforts, helped prevent human trafficking, facilitated a regional approach to reducing methamphetamine production and distribution, and helped develop communications infrastructure. Prosecution and courts $11,981,362 Crime prevention and education $835,678 Drug treatment and enforcement $44,254,215 Program planning, evaluation, and technology improvement $131,213 Crime victim and witness programs $1,858,242 State officials noted that Recovery Act JAG helped maintain services in corrections, such as support for problem youth and adult offenders and prison treatment programs, that faced cuts given the state’s revenue shortfalls and budget reductions. In addition, local officials stated that Recovery Act JAG helped support jobs and purchase equipment that otherwise would have been eliminated or gone unfunded. Prosecution and courts $1,972,990 Crime prevention and education $1,557,764 Drug treatment and enforcement $2,252,813 Program planning, evaluation, and technology improvement $2,173,632 Crime victim and witness programs $381,322 According to state and local officials, Recovery Act JAG funds helped support jobs, including retaining public safety personnel, and continue delivery of services, such as drug court services, drug prevention, and victims’ assistance. In addition, Savannah Police Department officials noted that Recovery Act JAG funds were used to purchase a fully “patrol-certified” Belgian Malinois breed canine to assist with recovery of stolen items, searching for suspects and missing persons, and tracking narcotics. Prosecution and courts $8,570,732 Crime prevention and education $185,797 Drug treatment and enforcement $233,962 Program planning, evaluation, and technology improvement $1,468,394 Crime victim and witness programs $2,138,127 According to state and local officials, Recovery Act JAG funds helped purchase law enforcement equipment, such as in-car video systems, that would have gone unfunded. Support for other programs and services include, for example, support for overtime wages of law enforcement agents, mentoring programs and drug treatment programs, domestic violence programs, and specialty courts for nonviolent, repeat offenders. Prosecution and courts $8,142,570 Crime prevention and education $5,671,274 Drug treatment and enforcement $452,965 Program planning, evaluation, and technology improvement $4,122,386 Crime victim and witness programs Officials in Boone City, Iowa have used a portion of their Recovery Act JAG award to institute cross-training of some employees in the city’s police and fire department. Under the city’s public safety umbrella philosophy, some employees in the city’s police and fire departments receive training in firefighting, emergency response, and law enforcement. Those who receive this “cross-training” are known as public safety employees and can respond to any type of incident where a police officer or firefighter is needed. Officials said that this type of cross-training has allowed the city to be able to do more with limited resources.\n\n### Summary:", "answer": "Under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act), the U.S. Department of Justice's (DOJ) Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA) awarded nearly $2 billion in 4-year Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) funds to state and local governments for criminal justice activities. As requested, GAO examined: (1) how Recovery Act JAG funds are awarded and how recipients in selected states and localities used their awards; (2) challenges, if any, selected recipients reported in complying with Recovery Act reporting requirements; (3) the extent to which states shared promising practices related to use and management of funds, and how, if at all, DOJ encouraged information sharing; and (4) the extent to which DOJ's JAG Recovery Act performance measures were consistent with promising practices. GAO analyzed recipient spending and performance data submitted as of June 30, 2010; interviewed officials in a nonprobability sample of 14 states and 62 localities selected based on the amount of their awards, planned activities, and their reported project status; assessed 19 JAG performance measures against a set of key attributes; and interviewed agency officials. Recipients of Recovery Act JAG funding in the 14 states GAO reviewed received more than $1 billion either through direct allocations from DOJ or through an indirect \"pass-through\" of funds that states originally received from the department. These recipients reported using their funds for a variety of purposes, though predominantly for law enforcement and corrections, which included equipment purchases or the hiring or retaining of personnel. More than half of the funding that state administering agencies (SAA) passed-through to localities was reported to be specifically for law enforcement and corrections activities, while localities receiving direct awards more often reported planning to use their funds for multiple types of criminal justice activities. Officials in all 14 states and 19 percent of localities in GAO's sample (12 of 62) said that without Recovery Act JAG funding, support for certain ongoing local law enforcement programs or activities would have been eliminated or cut. Overall, about $270 million or 26 percent of Recovery Act JAG funds had been reported as expended as of June 30, 2010, but the expenditure rates of funds awarded through SAAs showed considerable variation, ranging from 5 to 41 percent of SAA's total awards. State officials cited challenges in meeting quarterly Recovery Act reporting time frames. Officials from the majority of states in GAO's sample said that workload demands and personnel shortages made meeting Recovery Act deadlines within the prescribed reporting period difficult; however, all states reported that they were able to do so. States reported sharing information and promising practices related to JAG activities in a variety of ways and DOJ encouraged this sharing through a number of programs. More than half of state agencies in GAO's sample generally reported sharing promising practices or lessons learned on topics, such as grant management and administration, with other states and localities through participating in law enforcement and government association conferences, DOJ training, and Web postings, among other methods. DOJ established new performance measures to assess the Recovery Act JAG program and is working to refine them; however, these measures lack key attributes of successful performance assessment systems that GAO has previously identified, such as clarity, reliability, a linkage to strategic or programmatic goals, and objectivity and measurability of targets. Including such attributes could facilitate accountability and management's ability to meaningfully assess and monitor Recovery Act JAG's results. DOJ officials acknowledge that weaknesses exist and they plan to improve their performance measures. For example, the department already took initial steps to incorporate feedback from some states with regard to clarifying the definitions of some performance measures; however, its assessment tool lacks a process to verify the accuracy of the data that recipients self-report to gauge their progress. By including attributes consistent with promising practices in its performance measures, DOJ could be better positioned to determine whether Recovery Act JAG recipients' programs are meeting DOJ and Recovery Act goals. In addition, by establishing a mechanism to verify the accuracy of recipient reports, DOJ can better ensure the reliability of the information that recipients provide. GAO recommends that DOJ (1) continue to revise Recovery Act JAG performance measures and consider, as appropriate, including key attributes of successful performance measurement systems, and (2) develop a mechanism to validate the integrity of self-reported performance data. DOJ concurred with these recommendations."}

The goal of bankruptcy is to give individuals and businesses a “fresh start” by eliminating or restructuring debts they cannot repay and help creditors receive some payment in an equitable manner. The filing of a bankruptcy petition operates as an “automatic stay” that stops most lawsuits, foreclosures, and most other collection activities against the debtor. Under the Code, secured creditors—those with liens or other secured claims against the debtor’s property—are more likely to get some debt repaid than unsecured creditors. Creditors typically receive payment of their debts before shareholders receive any return of their equity in the failed company. Business debtors that are eligible for protection under the Code may qualify for liquidation, governed primarily by Chapter 7 of the Code, or reorganization, governed by Chapter 11. Proceedings under both Chapters 7 and 11 can be voluntary (initiated by the debtor) or involuntary (generally initiated by at least three creditors). A liquidation proceeding—under Chapter 7—is a court-supervised procedure by which a trustee takes over the assets of the debtor’s estate, reduces them to cash, and makes distributions to creditors in accordance with the Code’s priority scheme. A reorganization proceeding—under Chapter 11—allows debtors that are commercial enterprises to continue to operate some or all of the debtor’s operations as a way to satisfy creditor claims. The debtor typically remains in control of its assets under a Chapter 11 proceeding, and is called a debtor-in-possession (DIP). However, if the court determines that there is cause or it is in the best interest of creditors, the court can direct the U.S. Trustee to appoint a Chapter 11 trustee to take over the affairs of the debtor. A debtor (or other interested party) may file a reorganization plan, which ultimately may be confirmed by the court. The plan includes details on the operations of the reorganization, including disposition or retention of property, mergers, and issuance of securities. The plan also divides creditors into classes and directs how the creditor classes will be paid. The debtor can terminate burdensome contracts and leases, recover assets, and rescale its operations to return to profitability. To continue operations, a debtor may obtain additional financing, which could be paid before other debts.under Chapter 11 or transfer to a Chapter 7 liquidation, which may provide a greater return to creditors. A debtor also may file a plan of liquidation The U.S. bankruptcy system involves multiple federal entities. While bankruptcy courts are located in 90 federal judicial districts, the Southern District of New York (which includes Manhattan) and the District of Delaware adjudicate a majority of larger corporate or business bankruptcy cases, many of which constitute “megacases.” The Judicial Conference of the United States recommends national policies and legislation for all aspects of federal judicial administration. AOUSC serves as the central administrative support entity for the Judicial Conference and the federal courts, including bankruptcy courts. For example, AOUSC provides administrative, legal, financial, management, and information technology support functions for the federal courts. The Federal Judicial Center, an education and research agency for the federal courts, assists bankruptcy courts with education relating to case administration and management, while the majority of Federal Judicial Center research helps inform policy decisions of the Judicial Conference of the United States. In addition, the Trustee Program at Justice and the Bankruptcy Administrator Program oversee bankruptcy trustees and the administration of bankruptcy estates, respectively. It is important to note that certain financial institutions may not file as debtors under the Code and other entities face special restrictions in using the Code: Insured depository institutions: Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, FDIC serves as the conservator or receiver for the insured depository institutions placed into conservatorship or receivership under applicable law. Insurance companies: Insurers generally are subject to oversight by state insurance commissioners, who have the authority to place them into conservatorship, rehabilitation, or receivership. Broker-dealers: Broker-dealers can be liquidated under the Securities Investor Protection Act (SIPA) or under a special provision of Chapter 7 of the Code. However, broker-dealers may not file for reorganization under Chapter 11. Commodity brokers: Commodity brokers, also known as futures commission merchants, are restricted to using only a special provision of Chapter 7 for bankruptcy relief. Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, 12 U.S.C. § 1841 et seq. nonbank financial companies supervised by the Federal Reserve; any company that is predominantly engaged in activities that the Federal Reserve has determined to be financial in nature or incidental thereto for purposes of section 4(k) of the Bank Holding Company Act (including broker-dealers that are registered with SEC and are members of SIPC); or any subsidiary of a company described in the bullets above that is predominantly engaged in activities that the Federal Reserve has determined to be financial in nature or incidental thereto for purposes of section 4(k) of the Bank Holding Company Act (except for insured depository institutions and insurance companies). In addition to the evaluation of whether the financial company fits within one of the categories described above, federal regulators recommending whether the Secretary of the Treasury should appoint FDIC as receiver must include: an evaluation of whether the financial company is in default or in danger of default; a description of the effect that the default of the financial company would have on the financial stability in the United States; a description of the effect that the default of the financial company would have on economic conditions or financial stability for low- income, minority, or underserved communities; a recommendation on the nature and extent of actions to be taken under Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act regarding the financial company; an evaluation of the likelihood of a private-sector alternative to prevent the default of the financial company; an evaluation of why a case under the Code is not appropriate for the an evaluation of the effects on creditors, counterparties, and shareholders of the financial company and other market participants. Upon recommendation, the Secretary of the Treasury, must invoke OLA if the Secretary, in consultation with the President, determines that: the financial company is in default or in danger of default; the failure of the financial company and its resolution under otherwise applicable federal or state law would have serious adverse effects on the financial stability of the United States; no viable private-sector alternative is available to prevent the default; the effect on the claims or interests of creditors, counterparties, and shareholders of the financial company and other market participants of proceedings under Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act is appropriate, given the impact that any action under Title II would have on the financial stability of the United States; an orderly liquidation would avoid or mitigate such adverse effects; and the company meets the definition of financial company as described above. By a two-thirds vote, the Federal Reserve and FDIC (or relevant regulator) must agree to make the recommendation to the Secretary of the Treasury to place the financial company into receivership. The Secretary consults with the President and then makes a determination to place the company in receivership, and notifies the company’s board of directors (or equivalent). If the company consents or acquiesces to the recommendation, FDIC becomes receiver. If the company does not consent, the Secretary through Justice must petition the D.C. District Court for an order authorizing the appointment of FDIC as receiver. The D.C. District Court has 24 hours to determine whether the Secretary’s determination was arbitrary and capricious, in which case FDIC would not become receiver. If the D.C. District Court failed to act within 24 hours, then FDIC would become receiver. The financial company can appeal the D.C. District Court’s determination, but the receivership would not be stayed (or postponed) if it did so. If the D.C. District Court did not uphold the Secretary’s determination, the Secretary could amend and refile or appeal within 30 days. Upon appointment as receiver, FDIC becomes successor to and legal custodian of the financial company, including assets and operations. Under authority provided by Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act, when FDIC is appointed receiver of the financial company it may take over and manage the assets of the company. FDIC must liquidate and wind up the affairs of the financial company, and may sell or transfer the assets to a bridge financial company, which is a temporary company used to maintain the failed company’s operations. A bridge financial company may purchase assets, assume liabilities, and undertake other functions of the financial company. FDIC also has authority to determine the validity of creditor claims against the company and pay creditor claims. The Dodd-Frank Act generally requires that all creditors of a financial company with similar priority be treated similarly; however, in certain circumstances FDIC may treat similarly situated creditors differently. In some cases, FDIC may repudiate contracts to which a financial company is a party or may enforce certain contracts that otherwise could have been terminated because of the financial company’s insolvency. Among its provisions, Title I of the Dodd-Frank Act requires certain financial companies to provide regulators with periodic reports on their plans for rapid and orderly resolution in the event of “material financial distress or failure” under the Code. The resolution plan must include the following: information on the manner and extent to which any insured depository institution affiliated with the company is adequately protected from risks arising from the activities of any nonbank subsidiaries of the company; full descriptions of the ownership structure, assets, liabilities, and contractual obligations of the company; identification of the cross-guarantees tied to different securities, identification of major counterparties, and a process for determining to whom the collateral of the company is pledged; and any other information that the Federal Reserve and FDIC jointly require by rule or order. The Federal Reserve and FDIC must review the information in these resolution plans. If they jointly determine and notify a company that its plan is not credible or would not facilitate an orderly resolution under the Code, the financial company would have to submit a revised plan. A revised plan must discuss in detail revisions that address the deficiencies jointly identified by the Federal Reserve and FDIC. The revised plan must also address changes, if any, in its business operations or corporate structure that the company proposes to make to facilitate implementation of the plan. If the company fails to submit a satisfactory revised plan, the Federal Reserve and FDIC could impose stricter requirements such as If the company higher capital or liquidity requirements on the company. fails to submit a satisfactory revised plan within 2 years of the imposition of stricter requirements, the Federal Reserve and FDIC, in consultation with the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), may jointly direct a company to divest certain assets or operations jointly identified by the Federal Reserve and FDIC as necessary to facilitate an orderly resolution under the Code in the event of failure of the company. The Dodd-Frank Act requires certain regulators to develop and issue rules to implement OLA and resolution plan requirements. For some rules, the regulators must consult with FSOC, a new entity established by the Dodd-Frank Act. FDIC—in consultation with FSOC—has primary responsibility for developing and issuing rules and regulations related to its authority as receiver of a failed financial company. Other sections of Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act also contain specific requirements for FDIC to coordinate with the Federal Reserve, SEC, and other banking regulators on key aspects of OLA. Under Title I, the Federal Reserve and FDIC must issue joint rules on resolution plans. FSOC has the authority to designate nonbank financial companies (including foreign nonbank financial companies) for Federal Reserve supervision if FSOC determines that such companies could pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States. These nonbank financial companies would have to file resolution plans. Appendix II lists the primary rules related to OLA and resolution plans and their status as of May 15, 2012. As we previously reported, the D.C. District Court issued Local Civil Rule 85 on January 19, 2011, to implement its judicial review requirements under OLA. Generally, the rule reiterated the procedural requirements in the Dodd-Frank Act. It provided for a 24-hour review, and the financial company has the right to oppose the Secretary’s petition to invoke an FDIC receivership under OLA. If the court did not rule on the petition within 24 hours, or ruled in favor of the Secretary, the receivership would proceed immediately. As the rule was originally written, the Secretary of the Treasury would have had to notify the D.C. District Court under seal at least 48 hours before the filing of a petition, which would give the court time to prepare for the review. In addition, the original rule did not specifically address Rule 6 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure regarding the 24-hour period. Rule 6 states that if a time period ends on a weekend or holiday, the period would be extended to the next business day. Court officials told us that they included the original 48-hour notice because they were concerned about receiving advance notice before an OLA filing. Court officials also told us that the D.C. District Court was a smaller court that did not hear many business cases and few large bankruptcies and therefore they needed the advance notice. In letters dated March 2011, FDIC and Treasury objected to notification requirements in the rule that required Treasury to provide an additional 48-hour notification to the court before filing a petition to invoke OLA. In addition, they were concerned about the possible use of Rule 6 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to extend the 24-hour period for the court to rule and the 48-hour notification period. The agencies said that Treasury may not always be able to provide the 48-hour notice because of the speed with which a financial company could become insolvent. FDIC and Treasury were concerned that the use of Rule 6 to calculate the timing of filings and decisions effectively would expand the court’s 24- hour time frame to rule on the petition and the 48-hour notice period. For example, if the Secretary’s 48-hour notice period or the court’s 24-hour review period ended on a weekend or holiday, Rule 6 calculations would move the ends of those periods to the next business day. According to agency officials, this delay could have serious adverse effects on U.S financial stability. As a result, the agencies thought the court should be prepared to make rulings over the weekend. On July 6, 2011, the court issued a revised final rule, which added “to the extent feasible” to the requirement that the Secretary of the Treasury notify the court 48 hours before filing a petition. In addition the revised rule added a section stating that the 48-hour notice period and the 24- hour decision period were not subject to Rule 6, meaning that the time limit would apply without regard to whether the time periods ended on a weekend or holiday. FDIC and Treasury officials told us that the revisions to the court’s rule addressed their concerns. The court has not yet tested the effectiveness of the rule because, as of May 1, 2012, the Secretary had not sought the appointment of FDIC as receiver in an OLA proceeding. Federal regulators have issued separate final rules for OLA and resolution plans, as required by the Dodd-Frank Act. FDIC plans to issue additional rules to clarify its use of OLA, such as a joint rule with SEC for the resolution of broker-dealers. Because the first financial companies will not begin filing resolution plans until July 2012, it is too soon to determine the effectiveness of the plans. Despite the issuance of rules, academics and other experts have questioned FDIC’s ability to resolve large, systemically important financial institutions under OLA because of the complexity of the firms involved and challenges relating to international coordination. Regulators have reported progress on developing a universal identifier for financial companies that would help them identify and manage companies’ counterparty exposures. Final Rules for OLA. On July 15, 2011, FDIC published a final rule (referred to as the Orderly Liquidation Authority Final Rule) under rulemaking authority provided by Section 209 of the Dodd-Frank Act. In its discussion of the final rule, FDIC noted that the rule represented the results of its initial phase of rulemaking for its OLA authority. FDIC staff also told us that this final rule included topics addressed in an earlier interim final rule and two notices of proposed rulemakings. More specifically, the final rule covers topics under three broad categories: (1) the definition of terms in a receivership under OLA and other general provisions of an FDIC receivership; (2) the priority of payments, including those for administrative expenses and to unsecured creditors; and (3) the process for administering claims against the failed financial company. The rule also covers other aspects of the receivership. For example, the final rule addresses FDIC’s ability to recover compensation from a current or former senior executive who is found substantially responsible for the failure of the financial company. In addition, the rule addresses the payment for services performed under personal service agreements after FDIC is appointed receiver or for the acceptance of services by a bridge financial company. FDIC’s final rule also discusses the distribution of assets in the liquidation of a noninsurance company subsidiary of an insurance company. FDIC has indicated that it believes it now has in place the regulations necessary to accomplish a resolution under OLA, even though it intends to adopt several additional regulations over the next year. In addition, FDIC published a final rule (the Mutual Insurance Holding Company Treated as Insurance Company Rule) concerning the treatment of mutual insurance holding companies on April 30, 2012. Mutual insurance holding companies are owned by policyholders, not stockholders, and generally have been subject to state insurance insolvency regimes. In its final rule, FDIC sought to make the resolution of mutual insurance companies conform to state insurance statutes for the resolution of such companies. Proposed Rules Related to OLA. FDIC, in consultation with FSOC, also has issued two proposed rules related to OLA to clarify certain technical issues. First, FDIC and Treasury jointly issued a notice of proposed rulemaking on November 25, 2011, governing the calculation of the maximum obligation FDIC could incur as receiver under OLA, as required by the Dodd-Frank Act. The proposed rule (the Maximum Obligation Limitation Rule) outlines a calculation that limits the total outstanding obligations that FDIC can incur in connection with the liquidation of a financial company under OLA and defines terms such as “obligations.” FDIC issued a second proposed rule on March 20, 2012, which relates to its enforcement of subsidiary and affiliate contracts as the receiver of a covered financial company. The proposed rule (Enforcement of Subsidiary and Affiliate Contracts by the FDIC as Receiver of a Covered Financial Company Proposed Rule) clarifies FDIC’s authority to preserve the value of a failed financial company’s assets and business lines by enforcing certain contracts of subsidiaries and affiliates of the financial company. FDIC as receiver has authority to enforce contracts guaranteed by the financial company even though the counterparty has the contractual right to terminate or accelerate the contract based on the insolvency of the financial company. FDIC must transfer the guarantee and all related assets to a bridge financial company or third party or provide adequate protection for the obligations. According to FDIC, this authority will help enable it to place a financial company at the holding company level into receivership without placing solvent subsidiaries into receivership, while also helping to mitigate systemic risk and maintain financial stability. Final Rule on Resolution Plans. On November 1, 2011, FDIC and the Federal Reserve published a final rule (the Resolution Plans Final Rule) implementing the Dodd-Frank Act requirement under section 165(d). Under this requirement, bank holding companies with at least $50 billion in total consolidated assets (including foreign banking organizations that are treated as bank holding companies) and nonbank financial companies supervised by the Federal Reserve must periodically submit resolution plans. Although this rule requires these types of financial institutions to submit plans describing how they would be resolved through the bankruptcy process, regulators reported that having companies file resolution plans would help FDIC in planning for the exercise of the possible use of its resolution authorities, including OLA. Regulators anticipate the plans also would provide additional insights on these companies’ structure and complexity, including funding sources and counterparties. In addition, the Federal Reserve noted that the plans will assist in its supervisory efforts to ensure that companies operate in a manner that is both safe and sound and do not pose risks to financial stability generally. The final rule addresses information required in the plans, steps for submitting the plans, requirements for updating plans, and steps regulators may take for addressing inadequate plans. Under the rule, a company’s resolution plan must take into account different economic scenarios provided to the company by the Federal Reserve; the scenarios will be developed in the Federal Reserve’s rules on stress testing. As shown in table 1, the deadlines for resolution plans are staggered by company size. Plans for the largest bank holding companies are due in July 2012. FDIC and other regulators noted in our discussions that although they completed a final rule for OLA and drafted several other rules, regulators are working on, but have not yet issued, certain mandated rules. In addition, the final rule does not address a number of important issues. Most of the outstanding rules related to OLA are required under the Dodd-Frank Act. Three of these are rules FDIC must issue jointly with other regulators: Orderly liquidation of broker-dealers (no statutory deadline); Recordkeeping for qualified financial contracts (due July 21, 2012); Source of strength (due July 21, 2012). FDIC officials reported that each of these three rules was in a different stage of development, with the recordkeeping rule for qualified financial contracts closest to being issued, potentially as an interim rule before the statutory deadline in July. Besides addressing the complexity of OLA, regulators told us that coordination and reaching consensus with different regulators represented a challenge in drafting and issuing OLA-related rules, particularly given the number of rulemakings required of some regulators and resource constraints. As part of the OLA rule development process, FDIC must consult with different members of FSOC and in some cases is statutorily mandated to work with specific regulators or agencies. Regulators also have had to address how certain rules would avoid conflicts with other rules and help ensure consistency with other requirements mandated under the Dodd-Frank Act. Dodd-Frank Act § 616(d); 12 U.S.C. § 1831o-1. dealers that are subject to OLA. Under OLA, FDIC, as receiver of a failed broker-dealer, or in a case in which the largest U.S. subsidiary of a financial company is a broker-dealer, would appoint SIPC as trustee for the liquidation. However, in our earlier discussions with FDIC, SEC, and SIPC officials, they noted that the Dodd-Frank Act did not clearly delineate SIPC’s role in a broker-dealer resolution under OLA, which may pose challenges in such a case. For instance, if FDIC as the receiver of a broker-dealer put the broker-dealer into a bridge institution, the agencies would need to determine what SIPC’s role would be and how creditor and customer claims would be handled.would govern the relationship between FDIC and SIPC. Although there is no statutory deadline for this rule, SIPC officials emphasized the importance of the rule to clarify SIPC’s participation so as to avoid confusion in any future resolution under OLA. FDIC and SIPC officials told us that they met together with SEC for the first time on May 3, 2012, to discuss developing this rule. FDIC officials reported that they anticipate issuing a final rule by the end of 2012. FDIC officials told us that this rule SEC officials told us that other Dodd-Frank requirements were a complicating factor in the development of the required rule on recordkeeping for qualified financial contracts. Under FDIC’s proposal, financial companies would have to provide FDIC with information on swaps and other contracts similar to the information that they would provide regulators under other Dodd-Frank requirements. FDIC officials told us that they are actively working with other regulators on the rule, which is due in July 2012. In another example, Federal Reserve staff told us that rulemaking related to the source of strength rule involved significant policy decisions, including to which bank holding companies the rule would apply, and how this requirement relates to other requirements for bank holding companies.they have reached out to the Federal Reserve and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to start developing this rule (also due in July 2012) but do not have an estimated issuance date. FDIC officials told us that other OLA-related rules—either mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act or recommended by others—detailing key aspects of FDIC’s authority as receiver, as well as the treatment of creditors, were still in the design phase or had not been drafted. First, the final rule on FDIC’s general authority under OLA does not fully define the universe of financial companies for which FDIC could be receiver. proposed rule, FDIC included a definition of financial companies (under its authority under Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act) but in the final rule, the agency deferred finalizing this definition until the Federal Reserve issued its final rule on the definition of nonbank financial companies (under its authority for enhanced supervision under Title I of the Dodd-Frank Act). The Federal Reserve has issued two proposed rules on the definition of financial companies and officials from FDIC and the Federal Reserve told us that they have been coordinating to make their definitions consistent.FDIC officials told us that they anticipated issuing a final rule defining financial companies by the end of 2012. As discussed earlier, FDIC’s authority under OLA would extend to those companies “predominantly engaged in activities that the Federal Reserve has determined are financial in nature or incidental thereto for purposes of section 4(k) of the Bank Holding Company Act.” The final OLA rule did not define how FDIC would make this determination. the proposed rule, industry groups and a federal regulator called for greater clarification about how FDIC would do its assessment. FDIC officials told us that they have started to develop a “minimum recovery” rule to respond to these concerns and clarify how creditors would receive no less than they would under a Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceeding. Martin J Gruenberg. “Remarks to the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago Bank Structure Conference” (Chicago, Ill.: May 10, 2012). Dodd-Frank Act allows for a bridge financial company to be established for 2 years, with the ability to extend it for 1 year (up to three times). The Dodd-Frank Act specifically states OLA is not a bailout to individual firms. Section 214 provides that all financial companies put into OLA must be liquidated and all funds expended in the liquidation shall be recovered through disposition of assets or assessments on the financial sector. 12 U.S.C. § 5394, Section 1101 amended the section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act to prohibit the Federal Reserve Board from authorizing direct loans for the purpose of assisting a single and specific company to avoid bankruptcy, as it did in the 2008 financial crisis. 12 U.S.C. § 343. under OLA. FDIC faces no statutory deadline for completing these rules, and FDIC officials told us that they considered them to be of lower priority. Lastly, FDIC may issue additional rulemakings through its general authority under Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act, in consultation with FSOC. FDIC plans to issue a rule about the orderly liquidation of a commodity broker, but officials told us that they would coordinate any rulemaking with changes CFTC might make to its rule related to commodity broker bankruptcies. Although FDIC and other regulatory officials noted that resolution plans could help prepare for the possible failure of a large financial company, not enough time has passed to determine the effectiveness of the living will requirement in assisting financial companies to prepare for bankruptcy (as discussed earlier) as well as aiding FDIC in the use of its Title II authority. As mentioned previously, the largest bank holding companies are required to submit resolution plans by July 1, 2012. As of May 2012, FSOC had not yet designated the systemically important nonbank financial companies, and the resolution plan final rule states that these companies do not have to file earlier than 270 days from their date of designation. Federal Reserve and FDIC staff told us that they anticipated that 9 or 10 bank holding companies would file in the first wave of submissions. Federal Reserve officials told us that they have been in discussions with the largest bank holding companies since the Although entities commenting on the draft rule for rule was finalized.resolution plan requirements brought up concerns about the definition of government support to financial companies and the confidentiality of proprietary data, regulatory officials believe that they have largely addressed these issues in the final rule. As of May 2012, details on the credit exposure reporting requirements had not been specified. Federal Reserve officials told us that the requirement for credit exposure reports will be included in a separate rulemaking related to single-party credit exposure limitation. In the bankruptcy process, the resolution or liquidation of large, complex, internationally active financial firms involves multiple challenges. As we discussed in our 2011 report, these challenges include identifying funding sources and counterparties and dealing with complex corporate Financial and legal experts structures across international jurisdictions. have noted that resolution plans might not be as helpful as hoped during times of financial distress because of the need for current information— much of a company’s contracts, assets, and liabilities could change dramatically from day to day. The final rule for resolution plans under Title I requires financial companies to stress test their portfolios under multiple scenarios to identify the financial firm’s risks. However, the scenarios may not anticipate the type of financial crisis that could eventually lead to a firm’s insolvency. Because of these challenges and the reported burden associated with developing the plans, some industry and academic experts have questioned the merits of the plans. FDIC noted their expectation that the plans, when complete, would provide important information for its advance planning to facilitate any necessary liquidation of a firm, irrespective of the cause of the firm’s failure. Furthermore, although FDIC has been working to further clarify its authority under OLA, several academic and other experts have raised concerns about FDIC’s overall ability to effectively initiate the resolution of large and complex firms without causing broader market disruption. As we discussed in our 2011 report, FDIC has issued an analysis of how it would have handled the failure of Lehman under OLA; some criticized the analysis for its assumptions about Barclays Capital Inc.(Barclays)’s ability to obtain regulatory approval to purchase Lehman’s distressed assets at a time of widespread weakness in the financial markets. According to Lehman’s bankruptcy examiner, Barclays was interested in acquiring Lehman prior to Lehman’s bankruptcy and did purchase certain assets of Lehman’s following bankruptcy. According to FDIC, its willingness to absorb the first $40 billion in Lehman’s losses would have addressed concerns of Barclays’ U.K. regulators. FDIC officials told us that they have been given sufficient powers to resolve such firms in order to limit further market disruption. FDIC officials reported that having access to funding would allow the receiver to make payments to creditors shortly after the time of failure and would help to maintain financial stability. In addition, they noted that the receiver would be able to establish a bridge financial company, as discussed earlier, to maintain the operations of the company without engaging in a bailout of stockholders of the failed firm. FDIC reported it received strong support for its proposals under OLA during a public forum with academic experts in January 2012. Others have noted FDIC’s lack of experience in resolving financial companies as complex as Lehman with multiple international subsidiaries. As one SIPC official told us, Lehman collapsed within 24 hours—a much shorter planning period than that to which FDIC is accustomed when resolving failed banks. In response, FDIC officials noted that they likely would have reviewed a firm’s resolution plan and been kept abreast of actions taken by the firm’s supervisor. As FDIC notes in its paper on the hypothetical liquidation of Lehman under OLA, FDIC would have been engaged for months prior to the failure of the firm. In addition, we noted in our 2011 report, there have been few large scale bankruptcies of complex, internationally active financial firms. However, others have noted that today’s largest financial companies have structures and asset sizes that dwarf those of Lehman, which remains the largest Chapter 11 debtor in U.S. history. FDIC also could be limited in its ability to manage the failure of an internationally active financial institution because it would be responsible for resolving the domestic subsidiaries of a failed company. Certain subsidiaries, assets, and creditors would be subject to separate insolvency regimes in various countries. As discussed in our 2011 report, cross-border resolutions of internationally active financial institutions such as Lehman Brothers remain a challenge, due to the manner in which different countries’ insolvency proceedings interact. In comments on the proposed resolution plan rules, several entities called for international coordination on the submission and approval of resolution plan requirements, as many internationally active financial institutions will be subject to resolution regimes in multiple countries. U.S. and international regulators have recognized this challenge and in July 2011 the Financial Stability Board issued a consultative document that proposed a requirement to mandate that all designated global systemically important financial institutions (SIFI) have recovery and resolution plans.called for cross-border cooperation agreements to enable countries’ resolution authorities to act collectively to resolve internationally active financial institutions in an orderly and less-costly way. In addition, the document After receiving comments on its proposal, the Financial Stability Board released an updated list of key attributes of effective regimes for resolving failed SIFIs in October 2011. These attributes addressed issues such as the scope and independence of the country’s resolution authority, the essential powers and authorities of the resolution authority, and how jurisdictions can facilitate cross-border cooperation in resolutions of SIFIs. Members of the G20 endorsed the attributes in November 2011. FDIC and Federal Reserve officials report that the Dodd-Frank Act’s Title II authority for FDIC to resolve systemically important financial institutions and its Title I requirement for these institutions to file periodic resolution plans follow the key attributes designated by the Financial Stability Board. Federal Reserve staff told us that the United States was ahead of some jurisdictions in adopting these provisions. In a November 2011 update (the latest available), the Financial Stability Board wrote that many jurisdictions had not implemented adequate legal frameworks for resolving global SIFIs and substantial further work on recovery and resolution plans as well as cross-border cooperation was needed. FDIC, the Federal Reserve, and other international regulators that are members of the Financial Stability Board have formed “crisis management groups” to review the recovery and resolution plans for global SIFIs. Officials from both U.S. agencies told us that the crisis- management groups for five of the U.S. global SIFIs have met with their international regulatory counterparts during the past year. In particular, they discussed progress for the planning efforts of these institutions. FDIC also has reported starting bilateral discussions with the foreign regulators of U.S.-based global SIFIs to identify any impediments to orderly resolution and implement any changes to address those challenges. FDIC noted that these discussions have led to the drafting of several memorandums of understanding with international regulators. FDIC further reported in January 2012 that their analysis has shown that in a crisis the U.S.-based global SIFIs would have a limited number of international regulators with which to work. For these financial institutions, more than 90 percent of the “total reported foreign activity” was located in from one to three foreign jurisdictions and more than 80 percent of this activity came from legal entities in the United Kingdom. However, Federal Reserve staff told us developing plans for cross-border resolution under the Bankruptcy Code remains a challenge. While the United States is requiring companies to file resolution plans that must detail how companies would resolve themselves under the Code, in some countries, regulators complete a resolution plan that discusses resolving the company without further market disruptions. In contrast, financial companies in those countries only have to complete a recovery plan that discusses ways to restore strength to a company under financial stress. Therefore, foreign banking organizations, which must file resolution plans in the United States, could face a different set of requirements in their home countries. U.S. and international regulators have cited the development of the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) as a code for financial institutions and regulators to better identify and manage institutions’ relationships with other institutions—allowing them to more effectively measure and monitor systemic risk. In addition, FDIC officials told us that the use of an LEI should help regulators in resolving a financial company during the OLA process because its adoption would allow large, systemically important financial companies to identify their many component entities, which generally are organized along business rather than legal lines. As we discussed in our 2011 report, the resolution of these companies involves unwinding the complex interrelationships among the entities in order to address creditor claims. Currently, a single financial institution may be identified or coded in different ways by a firm doing business with that institution. For example, JP Morgan Chase, Inc. may be referred to as JPMC, Chase, and JPMorgan. Regulators have cited a universal identifier for financial institutions as particularly helpful in the identification of parties in transactions involving over-the-counter derivatives. collapsed in 2008, other financial institutions struggled to determine their counterparty exposure to the firm, causing further market disruptions. Over-the-counter derivatives refer to derivatives not traded on a formal exchange. The financial industry has been exploring a universal identifier for decades, but recently regulators have pushed for a global mandate. The Dodd-Frank-created Office of Financial Research issued a policy statement in 2010 seeking comment on the development of an LEI. Since then, the Office of Financial Research and the Financial Stability Board have held roundtables and the financial industry has convened panels on the development of an LEI. In January 2012, the Financial Stability Board convened an expert group of regulators (supported by an industry advisory panel of experts) to provide recommendations on the governance framework for the LEI with a goal of endorsement by the G20 summit in June 2012. On May 30, the Financial Stability Board endorsed the expert group’s recommendations for a governance and operational framework for an LEI. In addition, the Financial Stability Board’s specification for an LEI standard is derived from the technical standard for a 20-digit alphanumeric code published in May 2012 by the International Organization for Standardization. Global acceptance of an LEI requires determining its governance and regulatory oversight. An Office of Financial Research official told us that the Financial Stability Board’s LEI Expert Group has broken into committees to discuss issues including governance, operating model, reference data and confidentiality, funding, and implementation. The official said that the governance committee also has been considering a model in which a nonprofit entity would administer the process. According to Treasury, the Financial Stability Board published a report in mid-June 2012 including recommendations for the appropriate governance framework for a global LEI. U.S. regulators reported that the first iteration of LEI structure will be limited to the code itself and a minimal set of reference data, not information about ownership hierarchies, because of confidentiality concerns. In its commodity swap reporting rule (which goes into effect July 16, 2012), CFTC became the first U.S. regulator to require financial companies to use LEIs.securities swap reporting rule that requires the use of an LEI provided by SEC also has published a proposed an international organization when available.Board has recommended a target for global implementation of the LEI standard by March 2013. In the 2011 report, we found that comprehensive data on the number of financial companies in bankruptcy are not readily available. Bankruptcy data are collected for provisions relevant to the Code and for management of cases. While federal agencies currently do not collect information to identify certain bankrupt entities, the Federal Judicial Center is starting to assemble a specialized database of financial company bankruptcies from the past 10 years. Two large cases we began tracking in our 2011 report, Lehman Brothers and Washington Mutual, are moving forward, but these cases along with the more recent bankruptcy of MF Global illustrate the challenges in resolving large, complex financial institutions. As we reported last year, tracking financial company bankruptcies is difficult because data are limited. Specifically, data on the number of financial company bankruptcies and their outcomes have been difficult to obtain. Neither AOUSC, the Trustees’ Office in Justice, nor FDIC collect information on the number of financial companies in bankruptcy. We previously reported that AOUSC collects some data on bankruptcy outcomes, such as the closing date for large cases. However, AOUSC does not specifically include information on bankruptcy cases involving financial institutions, or track outcomes such as the value of creditor returns or the value of firms emerging from bankruptcy. The bankruptcy courts only collect data on the type of business in which an institution is engaged if the data are pertinent to provisions of the Code (for example if the business was a broker-dealer subject to a SIPA proceeding) and these data are used for case processing rather than overall study. AOUSC officials told us they have been considering having the bankruptcy courts include the North American Industry Classification System code when a company files for bankruptcy. However, AOUSC and Federal Judicial Center officials told us that this new requirement would require a modification to the Official Bankruptcy Forms. These officials told us that this process generally takes 2 years and follows the process for amending the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, except the process does not require approval by the Supreme Court or an opportunity for review by Congress. AOUSC provides the Trustee Program’s bankruptcy filing data. Officials told us these data include whether the debtor is a person or a corporation, whether it is a small business, the case number, the name and address of the debtor, and the status of the case (that is, whether a plan has been filed or if the case has been dismissed), and other types of information. However, officials told us they do not flag financial companies and cannot track them separately. FDIC officials told us that although they track individual cases of bank holding companies in bankruptcy, such as Washington Mutual, Inc. and Colonial Bank, they do not have a database that aggregates these case records. Although AOUSC officials told us that they currently were not routinely collecting any data that would allow the identification and tracking of financial company bankruptcies, AOUSC and the Federal Judicial Center have undertaken a collaborative effort to create a specialized database of financial companies that have filed for bankruptcy protection from 2000 to 2010, but they have concerns about the reliability of these data as they are untested for this purpose. According to a Federal Judicial Center official, the purpose of the database is to compile information useful in understanding the effectiveness of Chapter 7 and Chapter 11 of the Code in facilitating the orderly liquidation or reorganization of financial companies. Officials told us developing such a database has been A challenging, due to the resources needed and coding concerns.Federal Judicial Center official told us they had developed an online coding form to document more information about each case and held a training session for the student coders. One of the items researchers must code is the type of financial company, which is not information the courts currently collect. Some outcomes included in the database, such as details about the sale of all assets, are more difficult to find in court dockets. In addition, the official told us determining the level of detail on each case to include in the database has been a challenge. For example, the official told us they attempted to limit the complexity of information for staff to code, while still documenting the necessary data for further study. To address this issue, the official told us that the Federal Judicial Center is undertaking various data verification processes, including a process by which two independent coders will code the same information and a third, more experienced researcher will reconcile any differences between them. Despite these efforts, AOUSC officials told us that they currently are not able to determine how effective this database will be in allowing them to track large financial company bankruptcies, partly because of concerns over using data reported by the companies filing for bankruptcy. As in our 2011 report, to examine the number of large financial companies filing for bankruptcy protection, we matched AOUSC data on Chapter 11 megacases with data from a private firm on financial company bankruptcies to determine the number of financial companies in bankruptcy during the past decade. Table 2 describes both the total megacase filings and those megacases that are financial companies. We continued to monitor two financial megacases, Washington Mutual, Inc. (Washington Mutual) and Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc. (Lehman) and began monitoring a third, MF Global Holdings Ltd. (MF Global). Washington Mutual and Lehman are making progress in their bankruptcy proceedings, with several issues outstanding. Both financial institutions filed for Chapter 11 protection in September 2008. A new case involves MF Global, a holding company with a broker-dealer and commodity broker, which filed for Chapter 11 protection in October 2011. Each case illustrates the complexities of liquidating large financial institutions. Washington Mutual. As we discussed in our 2011 report, the parties to the bankruptcy had agreed to a revised settlement report in late 2010, but confirmation of that plan was delayed due to various claims by shareholders and some creditors. These delays continued throughout 2011 because of additional hearings to discuss allegations of insider trading by hedge funds. Shareholders alleged that several hedge funds had access to discussions about the settlement plan through their attorneys and later bid on creditor claims. The parties entered mediation in October 2011 and reached a settlement and submitted a plan on December 12, 2011. A Delaware bankruptcy court judge confirmed the plan on February 17, 2012. As discussed in the 2011 report, the plan set forth the allocation of the tax refund among all of the parties: up to $2.2 billion to Washington Mutual’s holding company; up to $2.2 billion to J.P. Morgan Chase, Inc. (the new owner of the depository bank); up to $850 million to FDIC; and $335 million to the bank’s bondholders. As of May 2012, the judge told us that she had been advised that the majority of the claims had been resolved. Further payouts will be distributed through a liquidating trust. Washington Mutual, Inc. is being reorganized as a reinsurance company that will be funded by capital contributions from new bondholders, not by the creditors from the original debtor. Lehman Brothers. On June 29, 2011, Lehman filed a disclosure statement that set out the plan for distribution of assets to the creditors of 23 Lehman debtor entities. This plan was made after extensive negotiations with representatives of major creditor groups, including those that supported substantive consolidation and those that did not. This plan represents a compromise between the parties by providing for adjustments in payments to creditors. In November 2011, creditors approved Lehman’s reorganization plan. The bankruptcy court confirmed the plan in December 2011. The plan included numerous settlements between the holding company and other counterparties, including a series of bilateral settlements with foreign affiliates and creditors. As a result, creditors reduced the amount of claims asserted against Lehman by more than $295 billion. According to Lehman, distributions to creditors totaling $22.5 billion began on April 17, 2012. A second distribution is planned for September 2012. The resolution of Lehman’s broker-dealer, Lehman Brothers Inc., continues through the SIPC process. According to SIPC officials, almost all of the 100,000 claims had been satisfied as of May 2012. However, some of the remaining claims are among the largest and involve complex litigation over who meets the definition of “customer” under SIPA. According to the SIPA Trustee, there are over 2,100 claims with a total value of nearly $42 billion that are still unresolved. One of the largest of these claims involves Lehman’s overseas affiliate—Lehman Brothers International, Europe (LBIE)—which is pursuing two types of claims against Lehman Brothers Inc. The first is an “omnibus customer claim” on behalf of approximately 1,100 LBIE clients against Lehman Brothers Inc., of which $6 billion in claims for securities and $2 billion in claims for cash have been allowed by the SIPA Trustee. A remaining $6.7 billion remains under dispute. The second is a “house claim” on its own behalf against Lehman Brothers Inc., of which $8.9 billion remains under dispute. The trustee said he does not recognize LBIE as a “customer” of Lehman Brothers Inc. because it does not meet the definition of “customer” under SIPA. According to SIPC officials, Lehman Brothers Inc. never held reserves on behalf of LBIE. These issues remain in litigation and may go to trial in 2013. The SIPA Trustee for Lehman Brothers Inc. has initiated litigation against other counterparties over payment distribution, which also remains ongoing. In the first case, the SIPA Trustee is in litigation with Barclays involving issues surrounding its purchase of assets of Lehman Brothers Inc., immediately after Lehman filed for bankruptcy. According to the SIPA Trustee’s report, the dispute centers on competing interpretations of the Asset Purchase Agreement (defining the terms of the sale of certain Lehman Brothers Inc. assets to Barclays) between Lehman, Barclays, and Lehman Brothers, Inc. and involves contested claims to approximately $7 billion of “disputed assets.” This case is currently on appeal. In a second case, SIPC officials told us the SIPA Trustee has filed an adversary proceeding against Citibank seeking the return of a $1 billion deposit Lehman Brothers Inc. made with Citibank during Lehman Brothers Inc.’s last week in operation. The case involves Citibank’s setoff of Lehman Brothers Inc.’s obligations against Lehman Brothers Inc.’s deposits at Citibank and affiliated entities. Citibank claims it set off the deposit shortly before Lehman Brothers Inc.’s SIPA liquidation process began in September 2008. The SIPA Trustee also has been seeking the turnover of approximately $300 million deposited in Lehman Brothers Inc. accounts at various Citibank locations around the world. According to the SIPA Trustee, Citibank has been attempting to set off these deposits against a component of the Lehman Brothers Inc. obligations (approximately $1.26 billion) that are related to a settlement service provided by Citibank. In addition, the SIPA Trustee has been pursuing claims against LBIE on behalf of the broker-dealer’s customers. The SIPA Trustee alleges that LBIE has assets that belong to Lehman Brothers Inc. customers. According to the SIPA Trustee, due to the hundreds of thousands of transactions between Lehman Brothers Inc. and LBIE, the final outcome and amounts available for SIPC’s customer distribution are heavily dependent on LBIE’s own resolution in the United Kingdom. The SIPA Trustee has filed claims against LBIE totaling almost $16 billion. According to the SIPA Trustee, he and his advisers have been engaged in discussions with LBIE about the extent to which LBIE will allow the SIPA Trustee’s claim. The SIPA Trustee said the result of this process will have a major impact on the resolution of the U.S.-based Lehman Brothers Inc. estate and the SIPA Trustee’s ability to satisfy claims of customers and other creditors of the broker-dealer. MF Global. MF Global has been in the bankruptcy process since October 31, 2011, and has faced challenges due to missing customer funds and property. MF Global was a large, globally active company with a commodity and securities broker-dealer. The firm was based in the United States, with operations in multiple countries, including Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Singapore, and the United Kingdom. As of mid- 2011, the holding company had total assets of almost $46 billion. MF Global’s stock price declined during 2011, falling from about $8 a share at the start of the year to below $4 in early October and below $2 by late October. According to the SIPA Trustee, MF Global’s exposure to European debt and poor earnings reports led to credit downgrades and increased demands for collateral from MF Global’s counterparties. This in turn led to an increased loss of confidence in MF Global as customers began to close their accounts and withdraw funds. According to CFTC, the failure of the MF Global commodity broker (MF Global Inc.) is unprecedented in the size and scope of missing customer funds. Ordinarily, the designated self-regulatory organization, in coordination with CFTC, would have arranged for the sale of a failed commodity broker to another commodity broker, but in the case of MF Global Inc., the missing customer funds and possible fraud prevented this from occurring, according to CFTC officials. These officials said they increased their involvement in the MF Global case after the company was downgraded by credit rating agencies on October 27, 2011. Despite repeated inquiries, MF Global Inc. was not able to provide supporting records for its calculations of segregated customer accounts. Because CFTC lacks authority to put the commodity broker into bankruptcy, when customer money was found missing, SEC and CFTC determined that a SIPC-led bankruptcy was the appropriate course of action to protect customer accounts and assets. The MF Global bankruptcy has highlighted issues related to resolving an international broker-dealer and commodity broker and the effect on customer payments. According to SIPC officials, for the securities estate, the SIPA Trustee is using SIPA, and for the commodities estate, the Trustee is applying subchapter IV of Chapter 7 of the Code to the extent consistent with SIPA, as well as applicable commodities law. While a SIPA proceeding and the bankruptcy process for a commodity broker are similar, there are important differences. Under the bankruptcy process for a commodity broker, to the extent that the debtor’s general estate is insufficient to pay for the estate’s administrative expenses, these expenses are paid from customer property ahead of the claims of customers. However, under the SIPA process, customer property is used to pay customers, and is available to pay estate expenses only if all customers have been satisfied in full. These differences could have a distinct effect on the funds available to customers, depending on the amount of the administrative expenses being paid compared to the amount of the general estate and the amount of the customer claims. In addition, SIPC may advance up to $500,000 for each customer holding securities (and a maximum of $250,000 for customers holding cash) while the liquidation is ongoing, which enables the trustee to provide some relief to securities customers relatively quickly. SIPC has no authority to make advances to satisfy commodities claims and the liquidation process for a commodity broker has no such provision. In MF Global, more than 30,000 commodity customer claims were filed compared with approximately 300 securities customer claims. Because different customer estates are available to securities and commodity customers, each type of customer is receiving a different recovery percentage. CFTC officials told us they have been working to identify customer property for these estates, and SIPC officials told us the CFTC has closely cooperated with the SIPA Trustee. However, SIPC officials said the CFTC’s regulations that implement bankruptcies for commodity brokers have been cumbersome to follow. In addition, according to SIPC officials, the SIPA Trustee’s authority to conduct bulk transfers from the insolvent commodity broker-dealer to other broker- dealers is vague. According to the SIPA Trustee, a large volume of transactions occurred in the final week of MF Global’s operations. The SIPA Trustee’s report stated that the company’s information technology system could not handle this increased volume, leading to transactions that were not recorded or recorded incorrectly. The report estimated that “fail transactions” (in which a counterparty fails to deliver cash or securities) were five times the normal volume in the final week. Following the bankruptcy filing, the SIPA Trustee conducted an investigation examining 840 cash transactions in excess of $10 million that totaled $327 billion and 20,000 cash transfers below $10 million that totaled $9 billion. In addition the SIPA Trustee has been examining securities transactions valued at more than $100 billion. The SIPA Trustee has sought to connect cash transfers from counterparties to the transfers of securities from MF Global to locate more customer funds. The resolution of MF Global Inc. also has been hampered by differences in laws of various jurisdictions and the location of foreign assets. According to the SIPA Trustee, differences in insolvency laws and a lack of legal precedent have contributed to significant gaps in commodity customer protection between the United States and foreign jurisdictions. SIPC officials and the SIPA Trustee said customers who had accounts for trading on domestic exchanges and customers who had accounts to take physical delivery of commodities received an 80 percent return on their account from the first interim distribution; however, the customers with accounts for trading on foreign exchanges will receive only a 10 percent return from this distribution. The officials explained that most of the property for customers on foreign exchanges is in the United Kingdom and according to the SIPA Trustee, these assets are now under the control of foreign bankruptcy trustees, similar to other international bankruptcies. The SIPA Trustee said that recovery of foreign assets was uncertain and would take time, adding that these issues were usually the last to be resolved and only after litigation. At a June 1, 2012, hearing, a target date of April 9, 2013, was set by the U.K. court. The recent bankruptcy cases involving large complex financial institutions illustrate the potential challenges FDIC will have in an OLA proceeding, including resolving a securities and commodity broker, a company with significant international presence, and cases involving complex litigation. As described previously, MF Global customer property may be located in other countries, complicating the trustee’s efforts to obtain it. The trustee for Lehman’s broker-dealer has been involved in litigation with one of Lehman’s foreign affiliates for several years. Because OLA will only apply to domestic entities, international coordination and voluntary cooperation with foreign regulators will be essential for the resolution of a global company. As discussed earlier, FDIC and other regulators have been taking steps to improve international coordination of the resolution of large, systemically important financial institutions but challenges remain. Regulators have yet to clarify the roles and responsibilities of FDIC and SIPC during the liquidation of a broker-dealer under OLA, including the treatment of securities customers, commodity customers, and general creditors. On May 3, 2012, FDIC conducted an exercise with SEC and CFTC simulating a hypothetical failure of a systemically important financial institution with both a securities broker and commodity broker to better understand gaps in the OLA process and assist in their rulemaking process. We provided a draft of this report to AOUSC, CFTC, Departments of Justice and the Treasury, FDIC, Federal Judicial Center, Federal Reserve, National Association of Insurance Commissioners, SEC, and SIPC for review and comment. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners did not provide comments. We received technical comments from the remaining agencies, which we incorporated as appropriate. We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional committees, the Director of the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, the Chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Assistant Attorney General for Administration at the Department of Justice, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Director of the Federal Judicial Center, the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Chief Executive Officer of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Chairman of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation, and other interested parties. The report also is available at no charge on the GAO website at http://www.gao.gov. If you or your staff members have any questions about this report, please contact Alicia Puente Cackley at (202) 512-8678 or cackleya@gao.gov. Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. Major contributors to this report are listed in appendix III. As required under section 202 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), this report examines: (1) actions the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia (D.C. District Court) has taken in response to the judicial review provision of Orderly Liquidation Authority (OLA), including any revisions to Local Civil Rule 85; (2) federal rules or regulations relating to OLA and efforts to improve international coordination, including living wills, in resolving financial companies; and (3) data collection efforts and the outcomes of financial institutions that were in the bankruptcy process. Generally to address our objectives, we reviewed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) of 2010 and its rulemaking requirements. We also conducted interviews with officials at the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts (AOUSC); Commodity Futures Trading Commission; Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC); Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve); Federal Judicial Center; Securities and Exchange Commission; Securities Investor Protection Corporation; Department of the Treasury (Treasury); and the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia (D.C. District Court). We reviewed relevant literature and reports issued since our last report, including those written by AOUSC and the Federal Reserve in response to mandates in the Dodd-Frank Act. Specifically to address the first objective on actions the D.C. District Court took in response to the judicial review provision of the OLA, we monitored the website for the D.C. District Court for changes in Local Civil Rule 85. We interviewed the Chief Judge and other officials from the court to discuss how the rule would be implemented in case of a petition under OLA and the changes made to the rule in response to comments from FDIC and Treasury. We also discussed these changes with officials from FDIC and Treasury to obtain their views on the amended rule and how they expected the rule to be implemented. To address the second objective on federal regulations relating to OLA and the resolution of financial institutions, we searched the Federal Register and monitored the websites of FDIC and the Federal Reserve to determine if relevant rules related to FDIC’s authority under Title II and resolution planning had been issued.\n\n### Summary:", "answer": "The Dodd-Frank Act created OLA for resolving failed, systemically important financial companies. Since the act was passed in 2010, regulators have been developing regulations to implement this authority and avoid disorderly resolutions that create substantial losses for the financial system. In July 2011, GAO issued the first of its statutorily mandated reports on the effectiveness of the Bankruptcy Code for resolving or liquidating complex, internationally active financial companies. Among the topics examined in this second report, GAO reviewed: (1) federal rules or regulations relating to OLA and the resolution of financial institutions, including living wills; and (2) status of efforts to improve coordination on international resolutions, data collection efforts, and the outcomes of financial institutions that were in the bankruptcy process. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed agencies draft and final rules related to OLA and comment letters submitted. GAO continued to monitor developments related to the Lehman Brothers and Washington Mutual bankruptcies, and began monitoring a recent bankruptcy filing by MF Global. GAO also studied available data on the number of financial company bankruptcies and met with relevant agency and court officials. GAO makes no new recommendations in this report. GAO provided a draft for comment to AOUSC, the Department of the Treasury, and federal financial regulators. None provided written comments and technical comments have been incorporated, as appropriate. The federal financial regulators have issued certain final rules for resolving large, complex financial companies under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Acts (Dodd-Frank Act) established Orderly Liquidation Authority (OLA). Under OLA, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) could serve as receiver of a failing financial company instead of the company entering the bankruptcy process. Regulators continue to address a number of issues related to FDICs new authority, including how creditors will ensure that they receive no less than they would under a Chapter 7 bankruptcy liquidation; how certain assets and liabilities would be treated in a new company created by FDIC under OLA; and what role the Securities Investor Protection Corporation would play in the resolution of a broker-dealer under OLA. Regulatory officials reported that they were continuing to draft rules to clarify how OLA would be used. FDIC and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve (Federal Reserve) also have issued final rules requiring certain financial companies to file resolution plans or living wills that must detail how companies would resolve their operations through an orderly bankruptcy. Regulators told GAO that the plans also would help FDIC plan for the exercise of its resolution authority, including OLA. The filing dates for these plans are phased in over the next year and a half, with the first group of financial companies filing their first plans on July 1, 2012. However, nonbank financial companies that also will need to provide plans have yet to be designated. International coordination remains a critical component in resolving the failure of a large, complex financial company and regulators have been taking steps to address this and are testing new data collection efforts. Specifically, efforts are under way to develop a universal legal entity identifier that allows companies to identify and manage risks from companies with which they are engaged in financial transactions. This additional information could help regulators in resolving internationally active financial companies. Data to identify financial institutions filing for bankruptcy protection as well as their outcomes are limited. Since neither FDIC nor federal judicial agencies have a database that tracks financial companies in bankruptcy, the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts (AOUSC) and the Federal Judicial Center have begun a new effort to track financial company bankruptcies, but reported court data are untested for this purpose. Several large financial institution bankruptcies are still in progress. Two of the largest financial company bankruptcies, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (Lehman Brothers) and Washington Mutual, Inc.both of which filed in September 2008recently had their reorganization plans confirmed by creditors and approved by the courts. However, these cases are not yet fully resolved. In the Lehman Brothers case, international litigation could take several years to resolve. The October 2011 bankruptcy of MF Global Holdings Ltd., a holding company with a securities and commodities broker, has raised concerns about how commodity customers are treated under a liquidation regime and also involves international litigation over customer property. These financial company bankruptcies highlight the challenges FDIC and other regulators would face in resolving large, complex financial companies under the OLA process."}
{"original_length": 16577, "trunc_length": 16384, "text": "\n\nSummarize the following text into a summary of less than 800 words.\n### Text:\n\nChina is a major global producer of many raw materials, and, in some cases, a dominant producer. Particular concern has been raised in the United States and elsewhere over China's near-monopoly in the production of \"rare earths\"—a group of 17 elements whose unique properties make them critical in a variety of advanced technologies. Due to their special properties of magnetism, luminescence, and strength, rare earths are widely used in high-technology and clean energy products, as well as in military weapon systems. According to one analyst, rare earth elements \"are critical to hundreds of high tech applications, many of which define our modern way of life. Without rare earth elements, much of the world's modern technology would be vastly different, and many applications would not be possible.\" The Chinese government has made the development of its rare earth resources a top priority since the 1980s. In 1992, Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping reportedly said, \"China's rare earth resources can be likened in importance to the Middle East's oil. They have immense strategic significance and we must certainly deal with rare earths issues with care, unleashing the advantages they bring.\" In 1999, Chinese President Jiang Zemin reportedly wrote: \"Improve the development and applications of rare earth, and change the resource advantage into economic superiority.\" Government support for the rare earth industry, low labor costs, and lax environmental standards enabled China to become the world's dominant producer of rare earths, estimated to be the source of over 97% of the global supply. In recent years, China has been restructuring its domestic rare earth industry while putting more restrictions on rare earth exports, which has greatly affected the price and quantity of rare earths available in the global market. This has caused concern among businesses and foreign governments about potential business risks and geopolitical implications. Such concerns became more acute when China reportedly suspended shipments of rare earths to Japan, due to a months-long diplomatic crisis with Japan in September of 2010. China's rare earth policies have raised concerns among many in Congress because rare earths are important to a number of U.S. industries, including high technology (such as advanced electronics and medical equipment) and green technology (such as hybrid cars and wind turbines). In addition, U.S. defense industries rely on rare earths for a variety of weapon systems. China's export restrictions over the past two years have disrupted supplies and sharply raised prices for rare earths outside China. Some Members contend that China's export restrictions on rare earths are intended to give domestic Chinese downstream users a competitive advantage (because of the secured access to rare earth supply and the significant disparity between domestic and external rare earth prices) over foreign competitors, and/or to induce foreign users of rare earths to move their production facilities to China. Members have also expressed concerns that China's virtual monopoly of rare earths may impact U.S. economic and security interests because it makes many U.S. commercial and defense industries vulnerable to supply shortages and higher prices as a result of future Chinese restrictions that could occur for economic, as well as political, reasons. Several bills have been introduced in Congress to address these concerns, including H.R. 618, H.R. 952, H.R. 1314, H.R. 1388, H.R. 1540, H.R. 2011, H.R. 2184, H.R. 2284, S. 1113, and S. 1270. In the House, a congressional caucus on rare earths was established in late 2011 to push for reestablishing a domestic rare earth supply chain in order to reduce U.S. dependence on China. This report provides an overview of the U.S. dispute with China over its restrictions of rare earth exports. It examines the level of U.S. rare earth trade with China, how Chinese policies have affected rare earth prices for U.S. firms, possible motivations behind China's restrictions of rare earth exports, and how the United States and other major users of rare earths have responded, including a WTO dispute settlement case brought by the United States, Japan, and the EU in March 2012 against China over its rare earths restrictions. In addition, the report also examines China's rare earth industry and government policies—their evolution, recent developments, and effectiveness in meeting the government's goals (such as consolidating production, addressing pollution, and halting illegal mining). This report does not provide extensive discussion of rare earths from a resource supply chain perspective, nor from a national defense angle. For additional information on these topics, see CRS Report R41347, Rare Earth Elements: The Global Supply Chain, by [author name scrubbed]; and CRS Report R41744, Rare Earth Elements in National Defense: Background, Oversight Issues, and Options for Congress, by [author name scrubbed]. Contrary to the name, rare earths are not \"rare.\" Rather, they are relatively abundant in the earth's crust. At the same time, however, they are highly scattered and are usually found mixed together in other deposits, which makes it difficult to find rare earths in a concentration high enough to be mined and separated economically. When rare earths are extracted from the mine, the ore containing the rare earths must go through complex separation processes to produce each individual element. It is the separation process that largely drives the cost of rare earth production. The 17 rare earth elements are often divided into two groups: light and heavy rare earth elements. Two of the largest rare earth mines outside China, namely, Mountain Pass in the United States and Mount Weld in Australia, contain mainly light rare earths. Many electronic products require heavy rare earths to perform more efficiently. Currently, China is the only country that can supply a significant amount of both light and heavy rare earths, and is likely to remain the major supplier of heavy rare earths in the near future. Rare earth deposits often contain radioactive elements, which means separating the metals requires costly and strenuous processes that produce a number of toxic pollutants and hazardous waste material. When the Mountain Pass mine in the United States was operating at full capacity in the 1990s, it produced as much as 850 gallons of salty wastewater per minute, which also contained radioactive thorium and uranium. The hazardous materials built up as scale inside the pipe that delivered the wastewater to evaporation ponds 11 miles away. Several times in the 1990s, cleaning operations caused the pipeline to burst, spilling hazardous waste into the desert. Molycorp, then a unit of the oil company Unocal, was ordered by the state of California to clean up the waste. In 2002, the already struggling Molycorp ran out of space to store its waste and failed to secure a permit to build a new storage facility. As a result, the mine shut down. Chevron's acquisition of Unocal in 2005 and other developments will be discussed later in this report. The list of rare earth applications is extensive and these applications can be found in many industries. Rare earths are used in petroleum refining and as diesel additives in the oil industry; they are important to the automotive industry because of their wide application in catalytic converters, hybrid vehicle batteries, motors, and generators; they are used by the electronics industry to make hard disk drives and cell phones; and they are used in powerful magnets in wind turbines (see Figure 1 ). While rare earth applications in high-tech have existed for decades, it is their application in clean energy technologies and defense systems that has brought global attention to rare earths. Rare earth metals' super magnetic strength allows for extraordinary miniaturization of components, which have important military applications. For example, the fins that steer precision bombs have samarium-cobalt permanent magnet motors; the solid-state lasers used to designate targets use neodymium. China has become the world's dominant producer, user, and exporter of rare earth elements. China's trade data indicate that the value of its rare earth exports in 2011 was $3.4 billion. According to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), China currently accounts for an estimated 97.3% of global mine production of rare earth elements (compared to 27% in 1990). The United States, like many other countries, has become dependent on China for rare earth materials, from oxides, metals, and alloys to permanent magnets and finished products, as illustrated by the following data and figures: As indicated in Figure 2, Japan was by far China's largest export market for rare earth exports in 2011 (according to Chinese trade data), based on value (at 66% of total), followed by the United States (7%), France (6%), Germany (5%), Hong Kong (4%), and South Korea (3%). According to the U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC), the value of U.S. rare earth imports from the world totaled $860 million in 2011, up from $94 million in 2002, an 815% increase (see Figure 3 ). The value of U.S. rare earth imports from China in 2011 was $523 million, which was 0.13% of total U.S. imports from China. From 2002 to 2011, the value of U.S. rare earth imports from China rose by 1,376%. From 2010 to 2011, the value of U.S. rare earth imports from China increased by 305%. The U.S. dependence on China for its rare earth imports is significant when measured by quantity (i.e., kilograms or metric tons). From 2002 to 2011, the quantity of U.S. rare earth imports from China as a percent of total U.S. rare earth imports averaged 78.3%. The share of U.S. rare earth imports from China fell from 79.1% in 2010 to 53.5% in 2011. This was largely the result of a 50.8% drop in the level of U.S. rare earth imports from China and a 107.6% increase in the quantity of U.S. rare earth imports from Japan. The quantity of U.S. rare earth imports from China has fallen sharply in recent years, from a high of 24,513 metric tons in 2006 to 6,884 metric tons in 2011—a 71.9% drop (see Figure 4 ). From 2010 to 2011, total U.S. imports of rare earths dropped from 17,707 metric tons to 12,911 metric tons (a 27.1% drop), while imports of rare earths from China fell from 14,005 metric tons to 6,884 metric tons (a 50.8% drop). Rising prices of imported Chinese rare earths and the lingering effects of the global economic slowdown, including in the United States, were likely the main causes of the drop in U.S. rare earth imports. Prices for imported Chinese rare earths have risen significantly over the past few years. As seen in Figure 5, the average U.S. customs value per metric ton of rare earth imports from China rose from $3,111 in 2002 to $76,239 in 2011, a 2,432% increase. The increased prices for rare earth imports from China were particularly acute in 2011, when average prices jumped 723% in one year. The United States was the leading producer of rare earths from the 1940s to the mid-1980s, when it provided the majority of rare earth minerals to the rest the world from the Mountain Pass mine in California. During the 1990s, Chinese rare earths production increased drastically and, according to Jeffery A. Green flooded the market by more than tripling the previous world supply of the materials. During this time, Chinese rare earth-producing firms were largely unprofitable but were allowed to survive through direct and indirect support by the Chinese government. This backing enabled China's rare earth industry to continue to mine and export these materials at prices far below the actual costs of production. With the additional industrial advantage of a low labor cost, questionable environmental standards, and export taxes, the impact of these efforts were swift and dramatic: within 20 years China went from producing roughly one-third to nearly all of the world's supply of rare earths. Mines in the United Sates and elsewhere, unable to remain profitable against cheap Chinese exports, went out of business. There are three known and verified locations where high concentrations of rare earths exist: Baiyun Obo of Inner Mongolia, China; Mountain Pass, California, where Molycorp's mine is located and production has restarted; and Mt. Weld, Australia, which has a rich ore deposit but needs necessary infrastructure to begin mining, separation, and transportation to market. China is rich in rare earth resources and, according to some estimates, has half of the world's total rare earth reserves. Known in China as \"industrial vitamins,\" or in early years as \"industrial MSG,\" a variety of rare earth deposits have been discovered in more than 20 provinces and \"autonomous\" regions in China. The largest rare earth reserve is Baiyun Obo (also known as Bayan Obo) in the Chinese autonomous region of Inner Mongolia, accounting for more than 83% of China's rare earth reserves and about half of all rare earths output in China. The other regions with significant rare earths resources are Shandong (7.7%), Sichuan (3%), and a number of provinces in southern China (3%), as illustrated in Figure 7. It is worth noting that the rare earth deposits in Inner Mongolia in northern China are mainly light rare earths. The more scarce and sought-after heavy rare earths are concentrated in southern China, especially in Jiangxi, Guangdong, Fujian, Guangxi, and Hunan provinces. Currently, China is the only country that can provide significant supplies of both light and heavy rare earths. Rare earths from the Mountain Pass mine in California and the Mount Weld mine in western Australia contain, predominantly, light rare earths. China's rare earth production started in the late 1950s, in the Chinese region of Inner Mongolia, where the Baiyun Obo iron ore deposit was discovered in 1927. It is by far the world's largest rare earth mine, where rare earth minerals are recovered as byproducts during iron ore mining. Spread over a minerals-rich area of 48 km 2, the total reserve of Baiyun Obo is estimated to be about 36 million tons (measured by rare earths oxides (REO) equivalent). The iron ore deposit in Baiyun Obo has been mined primarily for steel making by Baotou Iron and Steel (also known as Baotou Steel or Bao Gang), a major state-owned steel producer in northern China. Baotou Research Institute of Rare Earths (formerly Baotou Metallurgical Research Institute), now the biggest and most prominent rare earth research facility in China, was established in 1963. Baotou Steel's Rare Earth Hi-Tech (Group) Company, the largest (and state-controlled) rare earth producer in China, produces 55,000 metric tons of processed rare earths a year. This accounts for nearly half of China's production, or about 44% of global rare earth production. In the late 1970s, annual rare earth production in China was just slightly over 1,000 tons (REO equivalent), which were mainly a byproduct from the iron ore tailings (waste materials from the iron extraction process). At that time, rare earth production in southern China was still at the initial stage, with an annual yield of 60 tons. Chinese rare earth production remained insignificant for several decades until the 1980s. During that era, China's rare earths industry was represented by three state-owned factories. In the 1980s, rare earth production in China started to take off due to improved techniques, strong demand, and more market-oriented economic policies. In 1985, China introduced export rebates for rare earth products, which were abolished 20 years later to curb exports. In 1986, China surpassed the United States to be the world's top producer and a major supplier of rare earths, a title held by China ever since. In the 1990s, high profit margin in the rare earth business started to attract many start-up enterprises in China. The competition became so fierce that rare earth prices were pushed downward due to production overcapacity, even as exports increased. Between 2002 and 2005, reportedly, average rare earth prices in China dropped to about US$5.50 per kilogram, a historic low. Largely because rare earths from China became so abundant and at such low prices that other suppliers were unable to compete with Chinese prices and supply, most of the world's mines outside China were closed by the early 2000s, including the mine in Mountain Pass, CA. At the same time, China invested heavily in rare earth refining and production technologies. It developed cheaper processes that used hydrochloric instead of nitric acid and managed to refine extractions to higher purity, and reportedly better quality, than in the United States. Data on China's export of rare earths are shown in Figure 6, based on China's 2011 tariff schedule classification of rare earths, which has changed over time. These data indicate that China's rare earth exports rose sharply from 1995 to 2003, but have sharply declined since then (especially after 2008). Overheated rare earth production in China during the 1990s and the early 2000s generated a fragmented industry with thousands of mines, many engaging in reckless mining and illicit production. In order to maximize profits, these small companies often ignored safety and environmental regulations and fiercely competed with each other for export deals. In addition to environmental degradation in China, this overcrowded rare earth sector and often intense competition sharply drove down rare earths prices and, therefore, further pressed producers to cut corners in order to secure their already thinning profit margins. Local governments, which often had vested interests, often tolerated these practices. In addition to illicit rare earth production, smuggling also became widespread, which exacerbated resource depletion and kept prices low. According to China Business News, about 20,000 tons of rare earths were smuggled from China in 2008, which was estimated to have accounted for one-third of the total volume of rare earths leaving China that year. This smuggling is often the main reason behind the discrepancies between the official statistics and the actual data of rare earth production and exports in China. Chinese policymakers and industry experts have voiced concerns over the perceived rapid depletion of their exhaustible rare earth resources. They contend that the rare earth deposits in China account for less than half of total global reserves; however, the country mines and provides over 95% of the global supply. Rare earth production in China has far outpaced the sustainable level, which makes Chinese officials concerned that such a disproportionately high level of output could soon deplete their resources. The Chinese government is also concerned that overproduction and illegal mining often came at the cost of environmental degradation—safety or environmental protection is often ignored in pursuit of revenue potential. The Chinese media have repeatedly exposed incidents of water system and farmland contamination in rare earth mining areas, from Inner Mongolia to southern provinces such as Guangdong and Jiangxi. In the southern provinces, rare earths can be found in high concentration in clays and soil a few feet underground. As a result, the 1990s saw an explosion of the number of poorly constructed and maintained local mines that were both polluting and wasteful, leaving behind contaminated soil and water. In November of 2011, during a product quality inspection, China's General Administration of Quality Supervision found that 19 of 85 tea products contained excessive levels of toxic rare earths, including a batch of Lipton tea produced and sold in China by Unilever. Unilever later stated that the rare earth metals had come from the soil where the tea was grown and had nothing to do with its production process. China currently argues that it is now moving to consolidate production and put supplies of a critical and exhaustible resource on a more sustainable footing. China maintains that rare earth export prices have been too low to reflect its virtual monopoly position. Moreover, such dominance, in view of the Chinese industry experts and policymakers, should assist China to move up the supply chain and engage in rare earth application and end products, not just being the world's supplier of raw materials. In recent years, China has put in place a series of industry and trade policies, aiming to capitalize on its dominance of rare earth supply. The Chinese government has introduced and implemented a series of policies to regulate rare earth production, stabilize prices, and control exports—some policy measures seem to be aimed at more internal control; some have more to do with influencing global supply and prices; while other policies seem to have long-term goals which are in line with China's overall industrial policy goal. Chinese export quotas, duties, and license requirements have caused considerable concerns worldwide because these restrictions not only distort global trade of raw materials but also grant Chinese companies easier and cheaper access to rare earths, among other raw materials. In 2006, China began decreasing rare earth exports, citing internal demand and environmental concerns. This generated supply uncertainties among key industries worldwide, such as automotive and electronics, and caused significant price increases throughout 2009, 2010, and during the first three quarters of 2011. As a result, industries have been forced to raise prices; some have chosen to relocate to China for a cheaper and more reliable supply of rare earths (see \"Technology for Resources\" ). Since the early 1990s, the Chinese central government has been developing production plans for strategic commodities, including rare earths. China's Ministry of Land and Resources (MLR) issues production quotas to provincial governments, who then assign quotas to individual mining companies under their jurisdictions. Despite the published production quotas, the actual rare earth output (illegal and unlicensed production not included) has been significantly higher than the target. In 2008 and 2009, the Chinese government started to implement regulations to assert greater control over the rare earth industry. For example, in 2008, the MLR issued Guidelines for Development of National Mineral Resources 2008-2015, a government directive with the stated goal of protecting and rationally utilizing China's valuable natural resources for the period 2008 to 2015. This development plan designated rare earths as protected mineral commodities, such as tungsten and antimony. Exploration and production of these protected commodities was to be strictly controlled by the government. The MLR also suspended new applications nationwide for survey or mining licenses for rare earths for an extended period of time. In November 2011, the Chinese government started to levy a higher resource tax on rare earths—increasing the previous rate of RMB 0.4 to 30 yuan per ton to RMB 0.4 to 60 yuan per ton (approximately up to US$9.50), depending on the type of rare earths. The central government reportedly has been building strategic reserves of rare earth metals, among other commodities deemed strategic. Such efforts could give China more power to regulate supply-demand relationships and influence global rare earth prices and supplies. According to a Wall Street Journal report, the recent Chinese rare earths stockpiling, under the direction of the MLR, began with a pilot project in 2010 at Baotou Steel Rare Earth Hi-Tech Co. in Inner Mongolia. At least 10 storage facilities are being constructed, where stockpiles may eventually reach 100,000 metric tons. In February 2011, the MLR announced plans to establish national rare earth regions. The first one will be in Ganzhou, Jiangxi Province, an area with significant medium-heavy rare earth deposits. The central or provincial government will plan and direct the exploration and mining activities. The Chinese central government has long envisioned a highly consolidated domestic rare earth industry controlled by a few large state-owned firms, which would enable the government to take control of the sector, specifically, to rein in \"oversupply\" in the global market and stop price wars among the smaller suppliers in China. Over the years the government has been directing industry consolidation by shutting down smaller, illegal operations and merging bigger producers. The general goal, as stated in \"Plans for Developing the Rare Earth Industry 2009-2015,\" is to establish three large rare earth production districts and two production systems nationwide. The plan will divide the industry into three districts: North (Inner Mongolia and Shandong), South (mainly Jiangxi, Guangdong, Fujian, Hunan, and Guangxi), and West (Sichuan). The two rare earth systems involve light rare earths in northern China and medium-to-heavy rare earths in southern China, as illustrated in Figure 7. As early as 2002, the State Council approved a proposal to establish two major rare earths groups nationwide: one in the north and one in the south. The ultimate goal, reportedly, is to create a unified front for the entire Chinese rare earth industry—unified production, purchasing, pricing, and sales. However, since it has been difficult to balance or negotiate the interests among business enterprises and stakeholders, this vision has yet to come to fruition. In northern China, where the industry tends to be more concentrated than the southern part of the country, Baotou Steel Rare Earth High-Tech Co. (Baotou Rare Earth) has been chosen as the forerunner in industry consolidation. The Inner Mongolia government issued a directive in May 2011, and announced Baotou Steel Rare Earth High-Tech Co. to be the single government-controlled monopoly to mine and process ore in northern China. The government also listed the names of 35 other companies, ordering 31 mostly private rare earth companies to close and 4 other companies to merge into Baotou Rare Earth. The more fragmented southern market, however, has several big companies competing for dominance. With anticipation that rare earth prices will go up, local governments and stakeholders may resist consolidation and seek to protect local mineral deposits. For example, state-owned companies such as China Minmetals Corp. and Aluminum Corporation of China (Chinalco) have been pushing to enter the market of Jiangxi Province (rich in heavy rare earth deposits, especially in Ganzhou), only to find out that the local Ganzhou Rare Earth Minerals Industry Co. Ltd. has a monopoly over the resources. The government plans to consolidate rare earth industry in southern China and let three companies control 80% of the production there within the next several years. All three, reportedly, are former government ministries that were spun out as corporations, with the central government still holding major stakes. It remains to be seen how fast and to what extent these policy measures will bring results as planned. In 2012, a year of transition in China's top leadership, how to balance central and local interests may take priority. In addition, economic growth, employment, and social stability concerns also weigh heavily in the minds of policymakers. However, if these proposed four state-owned companies—Baotou in the north and the three companies in the southern region—were to control China's rare earths industry, they may limit sales or impose other restrictions to foreign buyers, a \"business\" tactic that some maintain may not be easy to challenge. In May 2011, the Chinese State Council issued \"Guidelines to Promote Sustainable and Sound Development of the Rare Earth Industry.\" The government reiterated its commitment to keep rare earth mining under control by keeping the existing export quota system, suspending issuance of new production licenses, and cracking down on illegal mining and rare earths smuggling. The government's focus seems to be on consolidating the industry and optimizing its structure, by drastically reducing the number of rare earth miners and smelters, phasing out outdated and polluting mining practices, and encouraging companies to upgrade their technologies. In the 1990s, the government encouraged companies to export rare earth products by granting rebates on export taxes paid by domestic producers. In 2000, in order to meet increasing domestic demand, the Chinese government reduced export rebates for a number of commodities deemed \"strategic,\" including rare earths. In 2005, rare earth export rebates were abolished to curb rare earth exports, and trade of rare earth concentrate was banned. Foreign companies are prohibited from mining rare earths in China. They are also restricted from participating in rare earth smelting and separation projects, unless they form joint ventures with Chinese partners. Like their Chinese counterparts, Sino-foreign joint ventures are permitted to export their products under a licensing system managed by the Ministry of Commerce (MOC). The Chinese government has gradually reduced the number of licensed companies in recent years through tightening licensing rules and environmental regulations. In 2006, 47 Chinese domestic and 12 joint-venture rare earth companies received export licenses. In 2009, there were 23 domestic and 11 joint-venture licensees. These numbers were further reduced to 22 domestic and 10 joint-venture license holders in 2010, and to 22 domestic and 9 joint ventures companies in 2011. For 2012, the central government has allocated first-round export quotas to 9 companies, with 17 other companies awaiting inspection results. If these 17 companies meet environmental standards, the total count of companies with export permits would be 26, which would be lower than in 2011. No specific information is available about the breakdown of domestic and joint-venture companies for 2012. In 2007, the Chinese government started to levy export duties to manage and control the variety and quantity of rare earth products to be shipped out of China. Initially, the duty rates were set at 10% and applied to fewer items than today. The duty rates have increased over the years and now range from 15% to 25%. They are applied to more rare earth products. For example, China added a separate category in its 2011 export duty schedule for ferroalloys containing more than 10% of rare earth elements, and subjected them to a 25% export duty. In addition to export duties and licenses, China also applies quotas to limit the quantity of rare earths that can be exported. These annual quotas are allocated to domestic firms and joint-ventures with foreign investors. Between 2005 and 2010, the total quotas have been reduced almost every year as the domestic demand for rare earths has considerably increased. Joint ventures with foreign investment have seen their allocated quotas cut more sharply than their domestic Chinese counterparts, especially in 2010 (see Table 1 ). The official 2011 rare earths export quota was established comparable to the 2010 level. However, in 2011, only half of the 2011 export quota was filled due to sluggish global demand and the decreasing rare earths prices during the second half of 2011. Another contributing factor is that, amid complaints over China's control of rare earth supply, many manufacturers sought to reduce rare earth usage and/or seek alternative materials, in order to contain costs and reduce dependence on Chinese supply. For example, Toyota Motor Corp. reportedly is working to develop a new electric motor for hybrid cars that eliminates the use of rare earth magnets used in the motors. The new motor Toyota is developing would exploit the common and inexpensive induction motor, which uses electromagnets—magnets that only have their magnetic attraction when power is applied to them. In August 2011, General Electric (GE) announced the development of wind turbine generators that would reduce dependence on rare earths, seeking to change the current situation in which offshore wind turbines may contain as much as half a ton of rare earth metals. W.R. Grace & Co., reportedly, began selling an oil-refining catalyst with reduced usage of rare earths. China announced that it would keep its 2012 rare earth export quotas virtually unchanged, leaving them higher than expected. However, considering the fact that only half of the quotas were utilized in the previous year, this does not necessarily suggest that the government is loosening its control over rare earths exports. Several significant changes to the 2012 quota system suggest the government has become more specific and stricter in its effort to conserve resources and protect the environment. The Chinese government allocated 10,546 tons of the first round of export quotas to 9 companies that have met the government's environmental protection standards. Another 14,358 tons were reserved and would be granted to 17 other companies if they meet the standards by the end of July 2012. For the first time, quotas assigned to qualified companies, specifically, were further split into two groups—light and medium-heavy rare earths. Separate export quotas were set for each group. According to the first-round quota announced, light rare earths account for over 87% of the total volume. Not permitted by the Chinese government to have mining operations, foreign companies may not participate in rare earth smelting and separation without a domestic partner. However, they are encouraged to invest in downstream rare earth processing in China and development of new applications and products. In 2002, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) issued a directive, \"(Temporary) Regulations of Foreign Investments in the Rare Earth Sector,\" which provides the following: Foreign companies are prohibited from any rare earth mining business. Foreign companies are not permitted to participate in rare earth smelting and separation projects by themselves. Exceptions will be made when they form joint ventures with Chinese partners. Foreign companies are encouraged to invest in downstream rare earth processing in China and development of new rare earth applications and products. Many analysts contend that China's policies on rare earth exports reflect an attempt by Beijing to induce foreign companies that use rare earths to move production facilities to China and to transfer technology to Chinese partners, in exchange for a stable, reliable, and relatively low-cost supply of rare earths. For example, according to a Japanese publication, the Daily Yomiuri, Japanese business representatives have been told by Chinese government officials that, in exchange for a stable supply of rare earths, Japanese manufacturers using rare earths should move their plants to China. A high-level delegation of Japanese business leaders visiting China in September 2011 was reportedly told by Chinese Vice Premier Li Keqiang that China expected technical cooperation with Japan relating to rare earth industries, noting \"Japan possesses excellent technology related to the exploration and use of rare earths.\" Media reports have presented some evidence that some Japanese firms may be responding to some of these pressures. For example: Hitachi Metals, a major producer of high-powered magnets, reportedly indicated in August 2011 that it was contemplating moving production of some of its neodymium-based magnets to China. In September 2011, Toyota announced that it was planning to manufacture components (such as electric motors and batteries) for its hybrid cars in China, a move that some analysts speculated was motivated, in part, by Toyota's desire to gain access to rare earths. This \"technology for resources\" strategy fits well with the government's goal of expanding its rare earth industry to the more sophisticated processing sectors. Many of these measures appear to be part of a broader set of industrial policies China has put forth in an effort to become a global leader in innovation and high technology (see Text Box ). Some local governments offer incentives to persuade foreign companies to move factories to China because they believe foreign involvement would bring resource-rich regions a chance to become high-tech centers. In 2010, about 50 foreign companies were already operating in the Baotou Rare Earth Hi-Tech Zone in Inner Mongolia, including France's Rhodia SA. It was reported that the Korea Development Bank had signed a cooperative agreement with Baotou Rare Earth High-Tech Zone to encourage Korean automobile and electronics companies to establish processing factories alone or with Chinese partners. China's \"technology for resources\" strategy, backed by a restrictive export regime, has caused concerns around the globe. To foreign companies, it seems the Chinese government is using rare earth resources to attract foreign investment that could bring in sophisticated technologies that Chinese companies need to advance to the more value-added rare earth processing and application sectors, eventually becoming direct competitors. In addition, non-Chinese manufacturers are widely concerned about the risk of unintended technology transfer and intellectual property infringement. For example, Intematix, a Fremont, CA-based company, takes elaborate precautions in this regard. Intematix makes rare earth-based phosphors used in liquid-crystal displays and LED lighting. Reportedly, when Intematix hired Chinese scientists to perfect the production processes in its new factory in China, only three of the scientists had knowledge of the complete chemical formulas. With the central government's encouragement and approval, China's major state-owned companies have been actively seeking to secure supplies of raw materials domestically and overseas. The world has seen an increase in these activities since the global recession took place in late 2008, which has weakened demand and kept the investment prices more reasonable. Another important factor is that many mining companies and resources-rich regions are looking for financial investments in a tightened credit market. This wave of \"going global\" from China includes energy projects and mining assets, including rare earth resources outside China. Two key examples are the acquisition bids by Chinese companies for Molycorp of the United States and Lynas of Australia, the two rare earths mines now positioned to provide significant amounts of rare earths outside of China. In 2005, China National Offshore Oil Corp. (CNOOC), a state-owned enterprise, put forward an $18.5 billion acquisition bid to acquire the American oil and gas company, Unocal Corporation (UCL). Molycorp, whose Mountain Pass rare earth mine had been shut down in 2002, was then a unit of Unocal. Facing strong opposition from U.S. political leaders who voiced deep concerns over transfer of U.S. oil reserves to a company controlled by the Chinese government, CNOOC eventually dropped the bid. Business analysts seemed to agree that CNOOC was interested in Unocal's assets in Southeast Asia. It is not clear whether the rare earth resource at Mountain Pass was one of the congressional concerns at that time. According to the testimony by Jeffery A. Green at a hearing before the U.S.-China Economic And Security Review Commission, \"little attention was paid on Capitol Hill or within the Executive Branch to the inclusion or implications of the sale of the rare earth resource.\" Chevron subsequently bought Unocal in 2005, acquiring Molycorp and the Mountain Pass mine as part of the acquisition. In 2008, privately held Molycorp Minerals LLC acquired the Mountain Pass facility from Chevron, which has been developing rare earth processing technologies and products. In 2009, Molycorp began processing stockpiled bastnasite concentrate. In 2011, Molycorp, which had become a publicly traded company, started the mining of fresh bastnasite ore at Mountain Pass. In March 2012, Molycorp announced that it planned to acquire Neo Material Technologies, a major rare earths processing company listed in Toronto. Neo has plants in China and Thailand and, reportedly, earned 64% of its 2011 revenues serving markets in China and Japan. Molycorp plans to begin exports of rare earths to China to be processed into magnetic materials (see Text Box ). However, some industry officials and policymakers have expressed concerns that the deal could reinforce China's dominance in rare earth production and processing and may do little to help the United States develop its crucial rare earth processing capability. Some are also concerned that rare earths shipped from the United States to China would be subject to Chinese export restrictions once they are processed and ready to leave China. In May 2009, a less publicized event occurred when China Non-Ferrous Metal Mining (Group) Co. (CNMC) attempted to acquire a major stake in Lynas Corporation of Australia. In return, CNMC would secure full funding for development of Lynas' Mt. Weld mine in Western Australia, the world's largest single-deposit rare earths mine. However, after extended review of the deal by the Australian government, its Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) requested a number of changes. In particular, FIRB requested that the proposed ownership to be held by CNMC be less than 50% and that the number of Board Director positions held by CNMC be less than half of the Board. CNMC rescinded its offer. China has increasingly used a number of export restrictions (including export taxes, quotas, licenses, and prohibitions) on a wide range of products, particularly raw materials. According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), China is a major global producer and, in some cases, a dominant producer of many raw and processed materials. For example, in 2010, China accounted for more than 80% of global production of antimony, magnesium metal, rare earths, and tungsten. It also accounted for between 50% and 80% of global production of over a dozen other materials. China was the largest global producer of 37 out of the 80 mineral commodities tracked by the USGS. A 2010 WTO review of China's trade policies states, \"export restrictions, explicit or implicit, are a major feature of China's trade regime.\" For example, in 2009, China's trade regime applied export quotas to 173 tariff lines, export licensing requirements to 231 lines, and export taxes to 353 tariff lines (258 of which were interim taxes). The WTO review stated: Whether intended or not, export restraints for whatever reason tend to reduce export volumes of the targeted products and divert supplies to the domestic market, leading to a downward pressure on the domestic prices of these products. The resulting gap between domestic prices and world prices constitutes implicit assistance to domestic downstream processors of the targeted products and thus provides them a competitive advantage. Insofar as China is a major supplier of such a product, export restraints may also shift the terms of trade in China's favour. As noted earlier in Figure 6, the quantity of China's rare earth exports has been declining since 2003. From 2003 to about 2009, that decline did not appear to have much of an effect on the price of China's rare earth exports. However, efforts by the Chinese government in 2010 to further tighten its control over the production and export of rare earths appear to have created global shortages of many types of rare earths and sharply raised prices. For example, in July 2010, China announced that it would reduce its export quota of rare earth elements by 70% during the second half of 2010 over the previous year's level (or a 40% drop for the full year over 2009 levels). In addition, the Chinese government in 2011 reportedly imposed minimum price levels for rare earth exports. Such factors sharply reduced foreign demand for Chinese rare earths so that China's 2011 export quota level was not reached. According to Lynas Corporation, 2011 saw an \"extraordinary explosion in rare earths prices,\" and such price rises \"reached unsustainable levels for industry.\" As indicated in Figure 8, the average price of U.S. rare earth imports from China (based on the U.S. customs value per metric ton) rose from $5,589 in January 2010 to $53,024 in January 2011 (nearly a 10-fold increase), and by September 2011, rare earth prices surged to $158,389. From January 2010 to September 2011, the average price of imported rare earths from China surged by 2,734%. Average prices for imported Chinese rare earths have dropped sharply since September 2011, falling to $46,694 per metric ton in February 2012, a 70.5% decline. However, prices on U.S. imported rare earths from China in February 2012 were nearly 11 times higher than they were in February 2010. Some analysts contend that the drop in Chinese rare earth prices after September 2011 resulted from a sharp drop in foreign demand. This was likely caused by several factors, including the movement of some foreign manufacturing that uses rare earths to China, the drawing down of rare earth inventories, switching to alternative materials, and possibly curtailing production to avoid paying the extremely high prices. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the estimated distribution of rare earths by end use in the United States as a percent of total usage in 2011 was as follows: catalysts, which are largely used in oil refining and autos (47%); metallurgical applications and alloys (13%); alloys (11%); glass polishing and ceramics (10%); permanent magnets (9%); ceramics (5%); and rare-earth phosphors for computer monitors, lighting, radar, televisions, and x-ray-intensifying film (5%). Media reports have cited a number of U.S. firms that have raised concerns over how high-priced rare earth imports from China are affecting their production costs and business decisions: In July 2011, General Electric issued a statement on rare earths, saying that, \"rare earths are undergoing extreme cost increases due to unprecedented market forces. In less than 12 months, costs of some rare earth oxide materials used in lighting products have experienced increases ranging from 500% to more than 2,000%, and they continue to climb. For perspective, if the rate of inflation on the rare earth element europium oxide were applied to a $2.00 cup of coffee, the new cost would be $24.55.\" In August 2011, Intematix, a U.S. company that produces phosphor, stated that, in response to rare earth shortages, it was moving some of its manufacturing to China while developing alternative phosphors in the United States. An article in the New York Times stated that the company would have preferred to build its new factory near its headquarters in Fremont, CA. In September 2011, Michael N. Silver, chairman and chief executive of American Elements, a U.S. chemical company, was quoted as saying that the \"high cost of rare earths is having a significant chilling effect on wind turbine and electric motor production in spite of offsetting government subsidies for green tech products.\" In September 2011, John Galyen, president of Danfoss North America (a manufacturer of energy-efficient pumps and valves that depend on rare earth magnets), testified before a congressional committee that, \"my over-arching point is this. China's rare earth elements strategy is an issue affecting the U.S. and friendly country industries broadly. It is threatening our leadership in such innovative technologies and our ability for our country to meet energy-saving goals. And it appears that their strategy will also attract high technology manufacturing, investment, and jobs to China while offering local supply and price advantage.\" In October 2011, Peter Dent, vice president of business development, Electron Energy Corporation, in testimony before the United States Trade Representative (USTR), stated, \"practically, the aftermath of the quota reductions last year resulted in skyrocketing prices, long and uncertain deliveries, very fast payment terms with advance payments and fundamental questions about whether or not materials would be available at all at any price.... Customers of products containing rare earths have been working to redesign systems using less rare earths, opting for lesser performing substitutes. This money would have better been deployed on capital equipment, adding employees, workforce training and facilities expansion to enhance international competitiveness, but instead it sits in drums full of rare earth inventories and lost time and effort.\" In addition, Dent stated that the huge price gap between Chinese rare earths consumed domestically and Chinese rare earth exports \"puts Chinese industrial users of rare earths at a substantial structural competitive advantage over their competitors in the rest of the world.\" Dent went on to warn that the transfer of production by foreign technology companies to China in order to gain access to rare earths involved \"serious risk of unintended technology transfer to China, which would constitute an irreversible loss of intellectual property.\" A study by Bloomberg Government attempted to evaluate the effects the rising costs of rare earths had on two major producers of hard disk drives: Seagate Technologies Plc and Western Digital Corp. The report estimated that the rising costs of rare earth from July 2011 to September 2011 reduced the net income of Seagate and Western Digital by 37% and 21%, respectively. Some analysts contend that China's recent efforts to tighten its rare earth export restrictions may be, in part, intended to ensure that its own domestic firms that use rare earths have adequate access to such resources because global demand for rare earths may have already overtaken global supply (see Figure 9 ). Some analysts predict that China's production of rare earths may soon be unable to meet its growing domestic demand, which may prompt the Chinese government to further limit rare earth exports and/or to seek to obtain rare earths from abroad. According to the USGS, China's consumption of its estimated rare earth production has risen from 26.2% in 2000 to 64.2% in 2010. China's export quotas, minimum export prices, and export duties appear to have caused prices of Chinese rare earth exports to become significantly higher than for domestic users in China. For example, according to Lynas Corporation LTD, an Australian rare earth mining company, average prices for eight types of rare earth oxides in the fourth quarter of 2011 were between 70.5% and 557% higher than those for domestic users (see Table 2 ). China's increased use of export restraints and other discriminatory measures on rare earths has led stakeholders (especially in the United States, Japan, and the EU) to call for trade action against China. One of the first efforts in the United States to address China's rare earth policies occurred in September 2010. Chinese restrictions on rare earths were included in a Section 301 petition (dealing with unfair trade practices) that was filed in September 2010 with the USTR by the United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers International Union, AFL-CIO CLC (USW). The petition sought to address a number of China's policies and practices affecting trade and investment in green technologies. The main export restrictions on rare earths identified by the USW petition included export duties, quotas, and licensing procedures. The USW stated that \"China's reliance on WTO-inconsistent export restraints to dominate the world market in rare earth and other minerals not only nullifies and impairs benefits accruing to the United States under the WTO Agreement, it fundamentally distorts trade and competition in the green technology sector, among others.\" The USTR decided to narrow its investigation to include only Chinese grants (subsidies) given to domestic wind turbine manufacturers that agreed to use key parts and components made in China rather than purchasing imports, and in December 2010, it brought a WTO dispute resolution case against China. In February 2011, China agreed to remove the discriminatory subsidies. On March 13, 2012, President Obama announced that the United States, Japan, and the EU were jointly initiating a WTO case against China's restrictive policies on rare earths, as well as on tungsten and molybdenum, stating: Being able to manufacture advanced batteries and hybrid cars in America is too important for us to stand by and do nothing. We've got to take control of our energy future, and we can't let that energy industry take root in some other country because they were allowed to break the rules. A USTR factsheet on the dispute listed hybrid and conventional vehicles, advanced electronics, wind turbines, energy efficient lighting, steel, oil and gas, chemicals, and medical equipment as U.S. industries affected by China's export restrictions. USTR Ron Kirk stated that China's export restraints are becoming more restrictive, resulting \"in massive distortions and harmful disruptions in supply chains for these materials throughout the global marketplace.\" According to EU Trade Commissioner Karel De Gucht: \"China's restrictions on rare earths and other products violate international trade rules and must be removed. These measures hurt our producers and consumers in the EU and across the world, including manufacturers of pioneering hi-tech and 'green' business applications.\" According to the request for consultations with China filed by the United States, Japan, and the EU in the WTO, the following issues have been raised in regards to China's restrictions on rare earths, tungsten, and molybdenum: export duties; quantitative restrictions, such as quotas; additional requirements and procedures imposed on quantitative restrictions, such as fees and formalities, restrictions on the right to export (such as prior export experience and minimum capital requirements), and other conditions that appear to treat foreign-invested firms different from domestic entities; and the maintenance of a minimum export price system and requirements for the examination and approval of export contracts and export prices by Chinese government entities in a manner that is not uniform, impartial, reasonable, and transparent. The WTO dispute case jointly brought by the United States, Japan, and the EU is very similar to a WTO case brought by the United States (as well as EU and Mexico) against China in 2009 over its export restrictions on raw materials. The restrictions in question included export quotas, export duties, minimum export price requirements, export licensing, and export quota administration requirements on certain raw materials (including bauxite, coke, fluorspar, magnesium, manganese, silicon metal, silicon carbide, yellow phosphorus, and zinc). The United States charged that such policies were intended to lower prices for Chinese firms (especially in the steel, aluminum, and chemical sectors) in order to help them obtain an unfair competitive advantage. According to the USTR, such export restraints can artificially increase world prices for these raw material inputs while artificially lowering prices for Chinese producers. This enables China's domestic downstream producers to produce lower-priced products from the raw materials and thereby creates significant advantages for China's producers when competing against U.S. and other producers both in China's market and other countries' markets. The export restraints can also create substantial pressure on foreign downstream producers to move their operations and, as a result, their technologies to China. In July 2011, a WTO panel ruled that China's export quotas and duties on certain raw materials violated its WTO commitments. The panel ruled that the wording of China's Protocol of Accession to the WTO did not allow China to use certain general exceptions provided in the WTO agreement to justify its WTO-inconsistent export duties (see Text Box ). The panel further ruled that even if China could rely on such provisions, it still failed to demonstrate how export restrictions were justified by reasons of conservation of exhaustible natural resources, the prevention of critical shortages, or the reduction of pollution. For example, on the issue of exhaustible resources, China failed to show that it had imposed similar restrictions on domestic production or consumption of raw materials. The panel also found that certain aspects of China's export licensing regime were also inconsistent with WTO rules. China appealed the WTO panel's ruling. However, on January 30, 2012, a WTO Appellate Body affirmed that China's export quotas and export taxes on certain raw materials violated its WTO commitments. U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk called the decision a \"tremendous victory for the United States,\" and said it would ensure that \"core manufacturing industries in this country can get the materials they need to produce and compete on a level playing field.\" Many analysts speculate that the United States and other major users of rare earths (such as the EU and Japan) were waiting to see how the WTO would rule on the raw materials case before proceeding, noting that many of the export restrictions raised by the United States in the raw materials WTO case (such as export duties and quotas) are similar to those that are imposed by China on raw earths, as well as in regards to the arguments China has made to justify such restrictions (e.g., concerns over pollution and conservation of exhaustible natural resources). Many analysts have raised concerns that China sees its control over rare earths as a potential bargaining chip that can be used to gain political and economic advantages over other countries. For example, on September 8, 2010, a collision occurred between a Chinese fishing boat and two Japanese Coast Guard vessels in disputed waters claimed by both countries. The arrest of the Chinese captain by Japanese authorities resulted in a major diplomatic dispute between the two countries. China cut off high-level exchanges with Japan and reportedly threatened to take \"strong countermeasures.\" On September 22, 2010, the New York Times reported that China had begun halting exports of rare earths to Japan. On September 24, Japan agreed to release the Chinese captain. However, on October 19, 2010, the New York Times reported that China's embargo of rare earth exports to Japan appeared to be still in effect and was possibly extended to some rare earth shipments to the United States and the European Union, although China denied such reports. On November 19, 2010, the New York Times reported that China's rare earth exports to Japan had resumed, although with some delays. Chinese trade data show that its rare earth exports to Japan in October and November 2010 were down sharply from previous months in 2010, but rose sharply in December 2010 (see Figure 10 ). China's alleged efforts to use its control of rare earths as a bargaining chip have prompted concern in the West. In an October 17, 2010, editorial, Paul Krugman stated that the temporary Chinese embargo of rare earth exports to Japan: shows a Chinese government that is dangerously trigger-happy, willing to wage economic warfare on the slightest provocation.... Couple the rare earth story with China's behavior on other fronts — the state subsidies that help firms gain key contracts, the pressure on foreign companies to move production to China and, above all, that exchange-rate policy — and what you have is a portrait of a rogue economic superpower, unwilling to play by the rules. In an October 7, 2010, speech, Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao stated: We haven't imposed, and will not, impose an embargo on the industry. We are pursuing a sustainable development of the rare earth industry, not only to meet the demand of our own country, but also to cater to the needs of the whole world. We not only need to accommodate the current demand, but also, more significantly, need to take a long-term perspective. It is necessary to exercise management and control over the rare earth industry, but there won't be any embargo. China is not using rare earth as a bargaining chip. We aim for the world's sustainable development. At least 14 bills have been introduced in Congress that would attempt to address the availability of rare earths (and other materials and elements) for U.S. industries (including defense-related industries) and lessening U.S. dependence on China, through such measures as promoting the research and development (R&D) of rare earth resources and related industries in the United States. In November 2011, Representatives Hank Johnson and Mike Coffman announced the formation of a congressional Rare Earth Caucus. According to Representative Coffman, \"with the establishment of this caucus, I am confident we will be able to build awareness on Capitol Hill about the critical threat China's trade policies of restricting rare earth exports pose to both the economic and national security of the United States.\" A March 2011 letter written by Senators Casey, Schumer, Stabenow, and Whitehouse urged the Obama Administration to instruct the U.S. executive director at each multilateral bank, including the World Bank, to oppose the approval of any new financing to the Chinese government for rare earth projects in China, including rare earth mining, smelting or separation, or production of rare earth products. The letter also urged the Administration to impose the same types of restrictions on Chinese investment in mineral exploration and purchases in the United States as China imposes on foreign investment in rare earths in China. During his State of the Union Address on January 24, 2012, President Obama announced plans to create a Trade Enforcement Unit that will be \"charged with investigating unfair trade practices in countries like China.\" In February 2012, Representative Mike Coffman and nine other Members sent a letter to President Obama noting the WTO Panel's and Appellate Body's rulings on China's restrictions on raw materials, and stating that: The similarity between Chinese raw material exports and rare earth exports suggests that rectifying the rare earth situation should be among the first efforts undertaken in any new focus on trade equality. We urge you to point the new Trade Enforcement Unit at various restrictions, quotas, and de facto embargos used by China in the rare earth market. Many of us have also urged a WTO case against China due to their rare earth practices, and we renew that request with you as well. In 2010 and 2011, the Department of Energy issued a Critical Materials Strategy report, which examines the role that rare earth metals and other key materials play in clean energy technologies. The 2011 report found that several clean energy technologies, including wind turbines, electric vehicles (EVs), photovoltaic (PV) thin films, and fluorescent lighting, use materials at risk of supply disruptions in the short term (present-2015), although those risks are expected to decrease in the medium and long terms; and that supply challenges for five rare earth metals (dysprosium, neodymium, terbium, europium, and yttrium) may affect clean energy technology deployment in the years ahead. Other elements, including cerium, indium, lanthanum, and tellurium, were estimated to be near-critical between the short and the medium term (2015-2025). The report further states that DOE's strategy for addressing critical materials challenges is based on three pillars, including (1) the development of diversified global rare earth supply chains (including mining, extraction, processing, and manufacturing in the United States and abroad) in order to reduce supply risks that occur from China's position as the dominant producer of rare earth supplies; (2) the development of substitutes, including through government-sponsored research; and (3) recycling, reuse, and more efficient use of rare earths. In addition, DOE has indicated that it has organized a number of workshops with the European Union, Japan, Australia, and Canada to identify possible R&D collaboration efforts. An April 2012 report by the Department of Defense (DOD) provided a relatively optimistic assessment of the ability of U.S. defense industries that use rare earths to meet their supply needs. Of the seven rare earth materials identified as the most prevalent among defense consumption for the purposes of procurement (dysprosium, erbium, europium, gadolinium, neodymium, praseodymium, and yttrium), DOD determined that by 2013, U.S. production of rare earth materials could satisfy U.S. consumption required to meet defense procurement needs, with the exception of yttrium. The report stated that market forces in the United States and globally have led to falling prices, increased investments and domestic supply of rare earth materials, corporate restructuring within the supply chain, and technical advances, which, as a result, are \"trending positive for a market capable of meeting future U.S.\n\n### Summary:", "answer": "Over the past few years, the Chinese government has implemented a number of policies to tighten its control over the production and export of \"rare earths\"—a unique group of 17 metal elements on the periodic table that exhibit a range of special properties, such as magnetism, luminescence, and strength. Rare earths are important to a number of high technology industries, including renewable energy and various defense systems. China's position as the world's dominant producer and supplier of rare earths (97% of total output) and its policies to limit exports have raised concerns among many in Congress, especially given the importance of rare earths to a variety of U.S. commercial industries (e.g., hybrid and conventional autos, oil and gas, energy-efficient lighting, advanced electronics, chemicals, and medical equipment), as well as to U.S. defense industries that produce various weapon systems. Many are concerned that rising rare earth prices could undermine the global competitiveness of many U.S. firms (lowering their production and employment), impede technological innovation, and raise prices for U.S. consumers. Others are concerned that China's virtual monopoly over rare earths could be used as leverage against major rare earth importers, such as the United States, Japan, and the European Union (EU). To many observers, China's rare earth policies are part of a complex web of Chinese government industrial policies that seek to promote the development of domestic industries deemed essential to economic modernization. In the late 1980s, the United States was the global leader in rare earth production. However, preferential policies by the Chinese government and lax environmental standards there quickly enabled China to become a dominant, low-cost producer of rare earths by the late 1990s. Many analysts contend that China's recent actions to consolidate its rare earth production and restrict exports are intended to promote the development of domestic downstream industries, especially those engaged in high technology and green technology industries, by ensuring their access to adequate and low-cost supplies of rare earths. It is further argued that China's rare earth export policies are intended to induce foreign rare earth users to move their operations to China, and subsequently, to transfer technology to Chinese firms. China denies that its rare earth policies are political, discriminatory, or protectionist, but rather, are intended to address environmental concerns in China and to better manage and conserve limited resources. On March 13, 2012, the United States, Japan, and the EU jointly initiated a World Trade Organization (WTO) dispute settlement case against China's restrictive policies on rare earths and two other minerals. This case was brought shortly after the United States largely prevailed in a similar WTO case brought against China over its export restrictions on nine raw materials. The Obama Administration has also sought to devise strategies to deal with rare earth shortages, including the development of a diversified global rare earth supply chain, the development of alternative materials, and more efficient use of rare earth, including recycling. A number of bills have been introduced in Congress that seek to address U.S. rare earths shortages. A major issue for Congress raised by the rare earths dispute is whether U.S. trade policy can effectively respond to China's industrial policies that may negatively impact U.S. economic interests, either through the WTO or other means. This report examines the economic and trade implications of China's rare earth policies for the United States."}

It was established in 1965 under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act to provide health insurance to individuals 65 and older, and has been expanded over the years to include permanently disabled individuals under 65. Medicare consists of four distinct parts: Part A (Hospital Insurance, or HI) covers inpatient hospital services, skilled nursing care, and home health and hospice care. Part B (Supplementary Medical Insurance, or SMI) covers physician services, outpatient services, and some home health and preventive services. Part C (Medicare Advantage, or MA) is a private plan option for beneficiaries that covers all Parts A and B services, except hospice. Part D covers outpatient prescription drug benefits. Medicare fee-for-service (FFS)—Medicare Parts A or B—provides coverage in a beneficiary's home for certain services and treatments of an illness or injury. Beneficiaries entitled to benefits under Part A do not need to enroll in Part B to receive full coverage for home health visits; however, beneficiaries must meet Medicare's home health eligibility requirements. Beneficiaries who meet the home health eligibility requirements are entitled to a 60-day episode of home health coverage and then to an unlimited number of 60-day episodes, so long as they continue to meet the eligibility requirements. This report describes home health eligibility criteria, home health services, characteristics of Medicare beneficiaries who use home health services, and home health providers. Further, this report describes in detail the Medicare home health prospective payment system (HH PPS), provides an overview of Medicare home health payments, and discusses issues for Congress related to the Medicare home health benefit. For information on major legislative changes to the home health benefit, see the Appendix. To be eligible for Medicare-covered home health services, a beneficiary must meet three requirements: he/she must be homebound, he/she must need part-time or intermittent skilled nursing care and/or skilled rehabilitation, or, after establishing prior eligibility, a continuing need for occupational therapy, and he/she must be under the care of a physician and need reasonable and necessary home health services that have been certified by a physician and established in a 60-day plan of care. The following sections describe each of these requirements in greater detail. To be eligible for covered home health services, beneficiaries must be homebound; however, homebound eligibility criteria have caused confusion and have been misinterpreted by providers and Medicare claims contractors. Congress and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) have clarified the definition of homebound over time to better assist beneficiaries, providers, and Medicare claims contractors in the eligibility process. Currently, the regulatory definition of homebound states that a beneficiary must be confined to the home or in an institution that is not a hospital, Medicare-participating skilled nursing facility (SNF), or Medicaid-participating nursing facility. While a beneficiary must be confined to the home, the beneficiary does not have to be bedridden. Beneficiaries are considered homebound if leaving their residence requires a considerable and taxing effort. Absences from the home must be infrequent, or for periods of relatively short duration, or to receive medical treatment. In a March 2012 report, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office of Inspector General (OIG) concluded from a medical record review sample of 495 Medicare home health claims that in 98% of Medicare home health claims the homebound requirement was met. The HHS-OIG was unable to determine from a medical record review if the remaining 2% of claims met the requirement of homebound. For beneficiaries who meet the requirement of homebound, Medicare will provide coverage for reasonable and necessary part-time or intermittent skilled nursing care and skilled rehabilitation services in the home. For purposes of determining eligibility, intermittent skilled nursing care is defined as care that is needed fewer than seven days each week, or less than eight hours of each day for periods of 21 days or less. Prior to 1989, the definition of \"intermittent\" was interpreted by the Health Care Financing Administration (forerunner to CMS) to mean skilled nursing care provided four days or fewer per week. As part of an agreement reached in a class action lawsuit, Duggan v Bowen, the definition of \"intermittent,\" published in 1989 by the Health Care Financing Administration redefined intermittent as fewer than seven days a week. Intermittent skilled nursing care is covered under Medicare if the skills of a registered nurse (RN), or a licensed nurse under the supervision of an RN, are reasonable and necessary to treat a medically predictable recurring need. Beneficiaries who are diabetics may receive an exception to the intermittent requirement if there is no caregiver (or an unwilling caregiver) to administer insulin. Beneficiaries requiring skilled rehabilitation services (e.g., physical therapy, speech-language pathology services, occupational therapy) may be eligible if the services are reasonable and necessary to treat or maintain function affected by their illness or injury and, for the most part, such rehabilitation services cannot be carried out by non-skilled personnel. For beneficiaries who are homebound, the skills or supervision of a registered nurse are reasonable and necessary (and therefore covered by Medicare) based upon the inherent complexity of the service, the condition of the beneficiary, and accepted standards of medical practice. Observation and assessments may also be considered reasonable and necessary if there is a reasonable potential for change in the beneficiary's condition that requires the skills of a registered nurse to identify and evaluate, as well as to ensure that essential non-skilled care is achieving its purpose. Skilled rehabilitation services are reasonable and necessary if the inherent complexity of the service is such that it can be performed safely and/or effectively only by or under the general supervision of a skilled therapist. In addition to rehabilitation services to improve a beneficiary's function, maintenance therapy may be considered reasonable and necessary to prevent a decline in a beneficiary's functional ability. Medicare beneficiaries who meet the home health eligibility criteria are entitled to a 60-day episode of home visits by skilled health care professionals. Beneficiaries can be recertified for an unlimited number of episodes so long as they continue to meet the home health benefit's eligibility criteria. There are no beneficiary cost-sharing requirements associated with the home health episode; however, a 20% coinsurance is required for all covered durable medical equipment and covered Part B drugs and biologics. Roughly 9.5% (or 3.4 million) of Medicare FFS beneficiaries used home health services in 2011. For beneficiaries who meet the eligibility criteria, covered services include skilled nursing care (e.g., administering IV injections, wound care); physical therapy (e.g., range of motion exercises); occupational therapy (e.g., wood working activities to restore range of motion loss); speech and language pathology services (e.g., tasks to restore speech/voice production); medical social work services (e.g., assessment of the beneficiary's social and emotional factors related to the illness); and home health aide services (e.g., bathing, dressing). The home health benefit also provides coverage for items such as medical supplies, osteoporosis drugs, durable medical equipment, and items provided on an outpatient basis which cannot be made readily available in the beneficiary's residence. Since 2000, the proportion of visits has shifted towards more skilled nursing and therapy services. In 2000, roughly 49% of home health visits were for skilled nursing services, 19% for therapy services, 31% for home health aide services, and 1% for medical social services. In 2011, roughly 51% of home health visits were for skilled nursing services, 33% for therapy services, 15% from home health aides, and 1% for medical social services. While the distribution of visits has shifted towards greater therapy, the number of visits home health users receive has been relatively constant, with an average 36.2 visits per home health user in 2011 compared to an average of 36.8 visits per user in 2000. However, prior to payment reductions in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA 97, P.L. 105-33 ), the average number of visits per home health user was much higher—72.6 visits per user. This decrease in home health visits per user has important implications since the current Medicare home health payment system uses a base payment rate that was constructed from 1997-1998 Medicare HHA cost reports and home health claims data, as discussed subsequently in this report. Similar to other Medicare post-acute care services, there is wide variation across the United States in the percentage of beneficiaries who receive Medicare-covered home health services. Geographic variation in home health admissions may in part be explained by demand factors, such as health and illness of residents in a state or treatment preferences, or supply factors, such as the number of home health agencies in the area, local practice preference, reduced nonmonetary costs (e.g., shorter distances for patient travel, shorter wait times). As shown in Figure 1, in 2011, Medicare-covered home health admission rates were relatively higher in the West South Central region (i.e., Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas). In 2011, the rate of beneficiaries who received covered home health services per 1,000 Part A enrollees was highest in Louisiana (144) and Texas (144), followed by Florida (143). The three states with the lowest rates of home health admissions were Hawaii (23), Alaska (36), and South Dakota (36). Medicare has covered home health benefits since enactment, and it has been traditionally categorized as a \"post-acute care\" benefit—providing limited skilled coverage following a beneficiary's hospitalization. However, while more beneficiaries who have been discharged from hospitals or SNFs are certified to receive their first episode of home health coverage (1.9 million episodes in 2010) than beneficiaries admitted from the community (1.3 million episodes in 2010), most home health episodes in a year are provided to beneficiaries who did not have a prior hospitalization. In 2010, for home health users who had a prior hospital or SNF stay, Medicare covered roughly 500,000 subsequent (second or greater) home health episodes following the beneficiaries' initial episode and roughly 3.2 million subsequent home health episodes for home health users admitted from the community. Overall, in 2010, the share of home health episodes for beneficiaries who had a prior hospitalization before beginning home health coverage was 34%. The remaining 66% of home health episodes were for beneficiaries already living in the community who were certified as requiring home health services. Overall, home health services provide coverage for beneficiaries across a wide variety of conditions and/or diseases. Table 1 shows the percentage of home health users, as well as average Medicare payment per episode(s) and the average number of visits per episode(s) received by the most common primary diagnoses. As shown in Table 1, for beneficiaries receiving covered home health services who did not have a prior institutional stay, diabetes was the most common primary diagnosis, at 9.8% of all FFS home health users in 2011. Other common diagnoses were essential hypertension (i.e., high blood pressure) at 8.7%, heart failure at 7.5%, and chronic skin ulcer at 4.4% of all FFS home health users. A home health agency (HHA) is an organization that primarily provides skilled nursing and rehabilitation services to beneficiaries in their homes. To be certified by Medicare, HHAs must be licensed and approved by state and local law (if necessary) and meet federal requirements and conditions of participation (e.g., informing a patient of his/her rights). Most Medicare-certified HHAs (85%) are freestanding—not a part of a larger institution (such as a hospital or nursing home). As noted by MedPAC in their March 2009 Report to the Congress, payment reductions from BBA 97 had an effect on the supply of HHAs—decreasing the number of agencies by 34% between 1997 and 2000. Since the implementation of the home health prospective payment system (HH PPS) in 2000, the number of HHAs has grown steadily with a large majority of the increase in freestanding for-profit HHAs. Between 2000 and 2011, the number of Medicare-certified HHAs increased by 62%, from 7,528 to 12,199. HHAs have also come under scrutiny due to allegations of fraud within the home health industry. According to the GAO, in 2010, HHAs were under investigation by the HHS-OIG, Department of Justice, or U.S. Attorney's Office in roughly 13% of criminal cases involving health care fraud among entities—a business or organization (as opposed to an individual). Investigations for health care fraud included fraud in Medicare, Medicaid, and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). In general, a PPS reimburses providers using a predetermined payment formula that adjusts payments based upon a beneficiary's expected care needs and area wage differences, among other factors. The Medicare HH PPS was implemented for home health services beginning on or after October 1, 2000. Under the HH PPS, Medicare provides a payment to HHAs for covered home health services on a 60-day per episode basis. This method is in contrast to the prior Medicare payment method that reimbursed HHAs for each home health visit performed on the basis of \"reasonable costs.\" The HH PPS requires HHAs to bill Medicare Part A or Part B for covered home health services provided during the course of the beneficiary's home health episode. For beneficiaries with only Part A coverage, Part A will provide payment for all covered home health services. For beneficiaries with only Medicare Part B coverage (because they have exhausted their Part A benefit and they are enrolled in Part B), Part B will provide payment for all covered home health services. If a beneficiary is entitled to Medicare Part A and is enrolled in Part B, had a three-day inpatient hospital stay, and received his/her first Medicare-covered home health visit within 14 days after discharge from a hospital or SNF, Part A will provide payment for the first 100 home visits in a series of adjacent episodes and Part B will provide payment for any subsequent home visits. Part B would also provide payment for covered home health services in all other instances for beneficiaries who are entitled to Part A and enrolled in Part B. In 2011, Part A home health expenditures totaled $6.9 billion while Part B home health expenditures totaled $11.6 billion. For HHAs that do not provide some of the home health services directly, but instead contract certain services to be furnished by an outside provider (e.g., physical therapist contractor), the HHA is still responsible for submitting a bill to Medicare (not the outside provider). Any agreement on the reimbursement amount the HHA provides to the outside provider is negotiated between the HHA and the outside provider. This practice is referred to as \"consolidated billing\" and avoids multiple providers billing for the same service. The following sections explain in greater detail the components of an HHA's Medicare reimbursement under the HH PPS, recent changes to some of the components, and how the payment is calculated. Components within the HH PPS are: the episode base rate and its annual update and other adjustments; a case-mix adjustment by assigning beneficiaries into one of 153 Home Health Resource Groups (HHRGs), which adjusts payments based upon a beneficiary's expected care needs; an area wage adjustment, which adjusts payments based upon area wage differences; the final episode rate and any applicable adjustments; and a low utilization payment amount (LUPA) for episodes with f our or fewer home health visits. The episode base rate (sometimes referred to as the \"national standardized rate\") is the base reimbursement amount for a 60-day episode of care before adjusting for a beneficiary's expected care needs (case-mix adjustment) or area wage differences, as shown under the Episode Base Rate Adjustments heading in Figure 2. Prior to CY2014, the HH PPS episode base rate was developed from a sample of 1997-1998 HHA cost reports and home health claims data. and updated annually for changes in the costs of home health services measured by a market basket index. Beginning in CY2014, the episode base rate ($2,869.27 in CY2014) will gradually change to reflect, in part, 2011 cost reports and 2012 home health claims data, inflated by the CY2013 and CY2014 home health market basket updates. This change is a result of section 3131(a) of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA, P.L. 111-148 ), which required the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \"rebase\" the home health payment rate with more recent data conducted in equal increments over four years but such increment is not to exceed a 3.5% change in the CY2010 home health payment rate ($80.95 for a 60-day episode). The CY2013 estimated average episode cost, calculated from 2011 cost report and 2012 claims data, was 13% ($386.52) less than the CY2013 60-day episode payment. To reconcile this difference between payment per episode and cost per episode, the base rate would have required an annual reduction that exceeded 3.5% of the CY2010 home health payment rate; therefore, for CY2014 through 2017, the home health episode base rate will be reduced by $80.95 each year to reflect the updated costs of home health services. In addition to the annual market basket update, and any applicable update adjustments, the episode base rate may also be reduced for trends in case-mix classification and increased for providing home health services to beneficiaries in rural areas. Figure 3 and Figure 4 provide examples of how the episode-base rate is adjusted to construct Medicare's 60-day home health reimbursement amount. Changes in an average HHA's costs are calculated with a market basket index—a composition of weighted price levels that is estimated to capture the changes in costs for an average HHA. The annual percentage change in the HHA market basket index from the prior year is referred to as the market basket update. Starting in CY2015, the ACA requires the market basket update to be reduced by a percentage determined by the Secretary to account for increases in productivity. The market basket update may be a negative adjustment. For information on recent changes to the episode base rate and other home health changes by ACA, see Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA, P.L. 111-148 ) in the Appendix. Additionally, the home health market basket update may be further reduced for HHAs that fail to submit data for measuring health care quality to Medicare claims contractors. These data are provided from the Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS), an assessment tool that measures patient outcomes and quality improvement for adult home care patients, and the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems Home Health Care Survey (HHCAHPS). The OASIS and HHCAHPS information is aggregated by agency and publically reported on the Home Health Compare website ( http://www.medicare.gov/homehealthcompare/ ). For HHAs that do not submit quality data, the market basket update will be reduced by 2%. In 2010, less than 1% of HHAs received a 2% reduction to the market basket update. HHAs can receive a full market basket update the following calendar year should they choose to submit their quality data to their Medicare claims contractor. In addition to the annual update and applicable adjustments, the episode base rate may be reduced for all HHAs to address trends in case-mix classification. Since CY2008, CMS has reduced the home health market basket update for trends, referred to as \"nominal case-mix growth,\" that have occurred since the HH PPS was implemented in 2000. Nominal case-mix growth refers to the practice of continually classifying beneficiaries into more resource-intensive, and thus higher paying, case-mix groups (HHRGs), despite evidence of little or no change in the overall patients' health characteristics. Similar changes within other Medicare payment systems have been referred to as \"upcoding\" or \"case-mix creep.\" In the CY2008 HH PPS final rule, CMS stated that the national average HHRG case-mix index (the national average of the HHRG case-mix weight shown under the Case-Mix Adjustment heading in Figure 2 ) had increased by 12.78% from September 2000 to December 2005. The increase in the national average case-mix weight suggests that more resource-intensive, and thus higher-reimbursed services were billed to Medicare by HHAs. While CMS noted that patient characteristics within the home health population had changed, CMS stated that 11.75 percentage points of the increase in the national average HHRG case-mix index was not related to treating more resource-intensive patients. To offset the nominal case-mix growth, CMS stated they would reduce the episode base rate by 2.75% for each of CYs 2008, 2009, and 2010, with an additional 2.71% reduction in 2011. More recently, due to the availability of more recent data, CMS reduced the episode base rate by 1.32% in CY2013 to offset the nominal case-mix growth that had increased to 19.03% between September 2000 and the end of December 2009. There was no nominal case-mix adjustment for CY2014. The rural add-on is a 3% increase to the episode base rate for home health services provided to beneficiaries in rural areas. A provision in the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA, P.L. 109-171 ) that increased the episode base rate by 5% for home health services for beneficiaries in rural areas expired on December 31, 2006. ACA reestablished the rural add-on at a 3% increase to the episode base rate for home health services furnished in a rural area beginning on or after April 1, 2010, and before January 1, 2016. Medicare requires HHAs to assess beneficiaries who receive covered home health services to measure patient outcomes and quality improvement. Additionally, the information from beneficiary assessments also determines a beneficiary's expected care needs (HHRG assignment) for purposes of the HH PPS. A beneficiary's assessment data are gathered using the OASIS tool—an assessment tool that measures patient outcomes and quality improvement for adult home care patients. Starting in 2000 and prior to CY2008, the HH PPS used an HHRG-80 classification system, which assigned a beneficiary into one of 80 unique HHRGs by scoring data elements from the beneficiary's OASIS assessment. The sum of the data elements score helped determine a beneficiary's severity level, and thus, expected care needs. Scores were organized by three dimensions with various levels within each dimension: clinical severity (four levels), functional severity (five levels), and services utilization severity (four levels). Clinical severity was based on the beneficiary's diagnoses, functional severity was based on how well the beneficiary performed activities of daily living (e.g., bathing, dressing, walking), and service utilization was based on whether the beneficiary received 10 or more therapy visits and/or whether the beneficiary was recently discharged from a hospital, inpatient rehabilitation facility, or SNF. Scores across these three dimensions (clinical severity, functional severity, service utilization) determined a beneficiary's assignment into one of 80 HHRGs. Beginning CY2008, CMS implemented refinements to the case-mix adjustment. The new HHRG-153 case-mix classification system continued to use clinical and functional severity dimensions (reducing the number of levels for each dimension to three), added a separate group for beneficiaries in their third or greater episode in a series of adjacent episodes, and established multiple therapy visit thresholds (instead of the previous threshold of 10 or greater therapy visits). CMS stated that including these modifications would significantly improve the case-mix adjustment system. Similar to the HHRG-80 classification system, under the HHRG-153 classification system, the data elements provided by the OASIS tool determine the beneficiary's HHRG assignment. Each HHRG has its own unique case-mix weight. The HHRG case-mix weight adjusts the episode base rate to reimburse HHAs for the beneficiary's expected care needs, as shown under the Case-Mix Adjustment heading in Figure 2. After determining the case mix adjusted rate, a share of this rate is further adjusted for area wage differences. The case-mix adjusted rate is split into a labor-related share and a non-labor-related share, with the labor-related share representing the average amount of labor-related costs relative to total costs for home health services to beneficiaries. This labor-related share has historically been roughly 77% of the case-mix adjusted rate, with the remaining 23% allocated as the non-labor-related share. As shown under the Area Wage Adjustment heading of Figure 2, the labor-related share of the case-mix adjusted rate is multiplied by an area wage index specific to the beneficiary's residence to account for differences in wages across the country. This method is in contrast to other Medicare payment systems, which usually assign area wage indexes based on the provider's geographic area. The home health wage index is calculated and updated annually from a survey of wages and wage-related costs from acute care hospitals (because specific home health wage data do not exist). For areas with no hospitals and no wage-related data available, adjacent areas are used as a proxy measure for the missing cost information. As shown under the Final Episode Rate Adjustments heading of Figure 2, the final episode rate is the sum of the (1) labor-adjusted portion, (2) non-labor portion, and (3) payment for non-routine medical supplies (NRS). Episodes with at least five home health visits receive an NRS payment to reimburse HHAs for items such as IV supplies, syringes, and blood glucose monitoring strips. Durable medical equipment (DME), DME supplies, prosthetics, and orthotics are not considered NRS and are reimbursed outside of the HH PPS. NRS payment can be one of six different levels based on the patient's clinical conditions. The NRS payment is adjusted annually by the market basket update and may receive a rural add-on adjustment, a nominal case-mix growth adjustment, and a quality data submission adjustment. For CY2014, at a minimum, an HHA that submitted quality data would receive an NRS payment of $14.47 and a maximum of $581.63. The final episode rate is a bundled Medicare (Part A or B) payment of covered home health services for a 60-day episode of care. However, in addition to the previously discussed adjustments, the final episode rate also may be adjusted for extraordinarily costly cases (i.e., outlier payments) and for intervening events within the 60-day episode of care. In addition to the final episode rate, outlier payment adjustments may be made in cases when an HHA has provided an extraordinarily costly episode of care to a beneficiary, as shown under the Final Episode Rate Adjustments heading of Figure 2. The amount of the outlier payment adjustment is jointly determined by a formula and the additional visits incurred by the HHA. Unlike the final episode rate, the amount of the outlier payment is not predetermined but rather is based on the cost of care already provided. The outlier payment formula includes a fixed dollar loss (FDL) amount, which is the amount of additional costs in excess of the final episode rate that must be spent before receiving any outlier payments. The fixed dollar amount is equal to 45% of the final episode rate. If the amount of additional costs is greater than the sum of the final episode rate and the FDL amount, determined retroactively, Medicare may provide an outlier payment adjustment for 80% (the loss-sharing ratio) of the costs that exceed this threshold. The outlier payment policy only reimburses the cost of visits to the beneficiary (e.g., not NRS). Two capitations exist for Medicare home health outlier payments beginning January 1, 2010: agency-level and industry-level caps. The agency-level outlier cap limits outlier payments to HHAs at no more than 10% of their total Medicare home health payments. Additionally, total Medicare home health outlier payments are capped at 2.5% of total Medicare home health payments. These capitations exist to limit potential fraud and abuse that may occur for home health payments. According to an analysis conducted by CMS, 44% of episodes that qualified for outlier payments were for patients with a primary diagnosis of diabetes of any type or complication, even though patients with a primary diagnosis of diabetes represented roughly 10% of all home health users in 2011 (see Table 1 ). Across episodes that resulted in an outlier payment over $10,000, 95% of such episodes were for patients with a primary diagnosis of diabetes or long-term use of insulin, and, on average, such outlier episodes had 160 skilled nursing visits over the 60-day episode—or, on average, more than two skilled nursing visits per day. A partial episode payment (PEP) adjustment may be made if there is an intervening event during the beneficiary's 60-day episode, which would necessitate a reduction in the final episode rate that would otherwise apply. Some examples of events that would trigger a PEP adjustment could be: a beneficiary is discharged because he/she has reached his/her treatment goals, a beneficiary has enrolled in a Medicare Part C plan during his/her 60-day episode, or a beneficiary elects to be transferred to a different HHA. A PEP adjustment will not be made if the transfer is between organizations of the same owner, or if the beneficiary returns to the same HHA after having been hospitalized during his/her 60-day episode. The PEP adjustment is calculated by the remaining days of the beneficiary's care since the last billable visit as a proportion of 60. For instance, if the beneficiary's last billable visit was on the 20 th day after the first billable visit, the PEP adjustment would reduce the final episode rate by 66% [(60-20) ÷ 60]. For 60-day episodes that consisted of four or fewer visits, the HH PPS provides a low utilization payment amount (LUPA) to reimburse the HHA for each visit performed. The LUPA is increased annually by the market basket update and any applicable adjustments (i.e., failure to submit quality data, rural add-on). The LUPA is not reduced for nominal case-mix growth or an NRS payment. In CY2007, roughly 11% of home health episodes were reimbursed using the LUPA. Rather than providing a 60-day payment that is assigned an HHRG, LUPA reimbursement for an HHA is based upon six different visits and disciplines that could have been performed: home health aide, medical social services, occupational therapy, physical therapy, skilled nursing, and speech language pathology therapy. For CY2014, the per visit reimbursement amounts for the six different disciplines are: home health aide is $54.84, medical social worker is $194.12, occupational therapist is $133.30, physical therapist is $132.40, skilled nurse is $121.10, and speech language pathologist is $143.88. Similar to the 60-day episode base rate rebasing, beginning CY2014, section 3131(a) of the ACA requires the Secretary to \"rebase\" the LUPA episodes with more recent data conducted in equal increments over four years but such increment is not to exceed a 3.5% change in the CY2010 home health payment rate. To reflect more recent data, the CY2013 LUPAs across the six disciplines were reconciled against the 2013 average cost per visit amounts for each discipline. CY2013 cost per visit amounts were estimated using 2011 cost report information inflated by the CY2012 and CY2013 market basket updates. The estimated average 2013 cost per visits was between 19.5% and 33.1% (depending on the discipline) greater than the LUPAs in CY2013. To reconcile this underpayment between payment per visit and cost per visit, the LUPA for the six disciplines would have required an annual increase that exceeded 3.5% of the LUPAs in CY2010; therefore, for CY2014 through 2017, the LUPA for each discipline will be increased at 3.5% of each discipline's 2010 reimbursement level. The annual increase for each discipline's LUPA varies in dollar terms—from a low of $1.79 increase each year for home health aides to a high of $6.34 increase each year for medical social workers. LUPA episodes that occur as the only episode or occur as the initial episode in a series of adjacent episodes receive an add-on payment to reimburse the additional upfront costs associated with a beneficiary's first home health visit. For CY2014, the LUPA add-on payment is $99.89 and can be increased if the initial visit of a LUPA episode is provided by a skilled nurse, physical therapist, or speech language pathologist. LUPA is also adjusted by the wage index to account for area wage differences. To better understand the HH PPS, the following are a few hypothetical reimbursement calculations. Figure 3 provides an example of an episode reimbursement for home health services provided in an urban area and Figure 4 provides an example of an episode reimbursement for home health services provided in a rural area. Figure 3 provides an example of how much an HHA would be reimbursed by Medicare for a first or second episode of care to a beneficiary living in Los Angeles who was classified with high clinical severity and moderate functional severity, and who received no therapy visits. As shown in Figure 3, the prior year's episode base rate receives a reduction of $80.95 as part of the episode rebasing and a market basket update of 2.3% to create the CY2014 episode base rate of $2,869.27. There are no further adjustments to the episode base rate since the services are provided in an urban area, there is no adjustment for nominal case-mix growth in CY2014, and the HHA submitted the quality data elements to the Medicare claims contractor. The CY2014 episode base rate is multiplied by the applicable HHRG case-mix weight to create the case-mix adjusted rate. The case-mix adjusted rate is then split between the labor-related share, which is multiplied by the wage index for Los Angeles, and the non-labor-related share. The final episode rate is calculated by summing the adjusted labor-related share, non-labor-related share, and an NRS payment at the minimum severity level. There are no outlier payments or PEP adjustments for this calculation. For comparison, Figure 4 provides an additional example of how much an HHA would be reimbursed by Medicare for the third episode of care provided to a beneficiary living in a rural California area, who was classified with moderate clinical severity and moderate functional severity, and who received 10 therapy visits. As shown in Figure 4, the prior year's episode base rate receives a reduction of $80.95 as part of the episode rebasing and a market basket update of 2.3% and a rural add-on increase of 3% to create the CY2014 episode base rate of $2,955.35. There are no further adjustments to the episode base rate for nominal case-mix growth or for failing to submit quality data. The CY2014 episode base rate is multiplied by the applicable HHRG case-mix weight to create the case-mix adjusted rate. The case-mix adjusted rate is then split between the labor-related share, which is multiplied by the wage index for rural California, and the non-labor-related share. The final episode rate is calculated by summing the adjusted labor-related share, non-labor-related share, and an NRS payment at the minimum severity level (which has also received the rural add-on increase). There are no outlier payments or PEP adjustments for this calculation. Total Medicare FFS home health payments increased from $8.5 billion in 2001 to roughly $18.4 billion in 2011—an average annual rate of growth of 8.0%. Between 2001 and 2011, the rate of FFS enrollees who used the Medicare home health benefit increased by 33.8%, from a rate of 71 per 1,000 FFS enrollees to 95 per 1,000 FFS enrollees. While the episode base rate increased by a total of 3.7% from FY2001 to CY2011 ($2,115.30 to $2,192.07), the Medicare home health payments per user increased from $3,545 in 2001 to $5,357 in 2011, a 51% increase at an average rate of growth of roughly 4.2% per year. The change in home health payments per user may reflect the increase in case-mix classification and the increase in the number of episodes per home health user (from 1.6 episodes per home health user in 2002 to 2.0 in 2011). Under the HH PPS, freestanding HHAs have had consistently high Medicare margins—the percentage difference in Medicare home health payments relative to the HHA's costs in providing home health services to beneficiaries (a positive margin is a profit, a negative margin a loss). In 2003, the aggregate Medicare margin for freestanding HHAs was 13.6%, as shown in Table 2. Prior to 2011, the aggregate Medicare margin for freestanding HHAs had increased to 19.1% in 2010 before declining to 14.8%. The drop in Medicare margins in 2011 is most likely attributed to the reduction in Medicare's home health reimbursement from nominal case-mix adjustments and required ACA reductions. Among freestanding HHAs, 75% of freestanding HHAs had a Medicare margin at or greater than -0.3%, and 25% of freestanding HHAs had a Medicare margin at or greater than 22.8%. Due to higher overhead costs (e.g., rent, insurance), hospital-based HHAs had a lower aggregate Medicare margin of -10.9% in 2011. MedPAC has suggested that HHAs with high margins have relatively lower costs, which may be attributed to economies of scale from higher patient volume. Additionally, in the March 2009 Report to the Congress, MedPAC cautioned that \"(t)o the extent that these high margins reflect profits that stem from high payments, these margins suggest that neither beneficiaries nor taxpayers are receiving appropriate value for the funds Medicare spends on home health.\" In addition to Medicare margin trends, Medicare Part B home health expenditures have seen a noticeable increase relative to Part A home health expenditures. As noted earlier, Medicare Part A provides payment for the first 100 visits within 14 days of a beneficiary's discharge from a three-day inpatient hospital stay or SNF stay, or for all home health episodes if the beneficiary has not enrolled in Medicare Part B. For beneficiaries who have enrolled in Medicare Part B (roughly 93% of Medicare beneficiaries in recent years), Part B would provide payment in all other instances. Between 1981 and 1998, nearly all of Medicare-covered home health services were reimbursed under Medicare Part A. BBA 97 included a provision that gradually transferred some home health expenditures from Part A to Part B. For beneficiaries enrolled in Part B who received home health services that were not associated with a prior hospital or SNF stay, Part B provided payment. As shown in Figure 5, since the HH PPS was implemented on October 1, 2000, Medicare Part B home health expenditures have increased at a faster rate than Part A home health expenditures. Between 2001 and 2011, total Medicare home health expenditures (Parts A and B) increased at an average annual rate of 8.0%. Over the same time period, Part A home health expenditures increased at an average annual rate of 5% while Part B home health expenditures have increased at an average annual rate of 10.5%. In 2001, Medicare paid approximately $8.5 billion in home health services, with $4.2 billion under Part A and $4.3 billion under Part B. In 2011, Medicare expenditures on home health were $18.4 billion, with approximately $6.8 billion under Part A and approximately $11.6 billion under Part B. While home health expenditures have increased at an average rate of 8.0% per year since 2001, in 2011, home health expenditures under Parts A and B declined from their 2010 levels. This decline in home health expenditures could be the result of payment reductions from nominal case-mix growth and ACA-required reductions or new documentation requirements also included in the ACA (see \"Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA, P.L. 111-148 )\" in the Appendix for more information.) The rapid increase in Part B home health expenditures may be a result of a changing home health population. In 2001, beneficiaries with a prior hospitalization (and were most likely reimbursed under Part A) represented 48% of all home health episodes, while community-admitted home health episodes (and generally reimbursed under Part B) represented 52%. By 2010, only 34% of home health episodes were for beneficiaries who had a prior hospitalization. Additionally, subsequent community-admitted home health episodes (a second or additional 60-day episode[s]) increased from a 32% share of all home health episodes in 2001 to a 46% share of all home health episodes in 2010. In summary, the distribution of home health services has shifted toward beneficiaries that are generally admitted from the community rather than an institution and receiving home health services for longer periods of time. Another notable difference between Part A payments for home health and Part B payments for home health is the geographic variation in per user expenditures at the county level. Part A home health payments per user have less variation at the county level when compared to Part B home health payments and the high expenditure outliers are less concentrated in a particular region. To illustrate this difference, Figure 6 and Figure 7 categorize counties in terms of Medicare standardized home health payments per user by the number of standard deviations from the national average. Standardized home health payments are Medicare payments for home health services that have removed geographic wage adjustments that are included in the PPS. Such payments are then divided by the number of beneficiaries who used Medicare-covered home health services to calculate standardized home health payments per user. For each county, standardized home health payments per user reflects both the differences in the home health user population and the volume of home health episodes per user. Figure 6 illustrates Part A standardized payments per home health users enrolled in Medicare Parts A and B by county in 2011. For Part A, the national average home health payment per user is $2,125 and three standard deviations more than the average is at least $3,007. In 2011, 78 counties in 22 different states contained the counties with at least three standard deviations more than the national average. West Virginia, Kentucky, and Georgia were the states with the largest concentration and comprised 34 of the 78 (44%) counties within this category. Figure 7 illustrates standardized Part B home health payments by home health users enrolled in Medicare Parts A and B by county in 2011. For Part B, the national average home health payment per user is $3,070 and three standard deviations more than the national average is at least $6,843. In 2011, eight different states contained the 197 counties in which payments were at least three standard deviations from the national average; however, all but 6 of the 197 counties (97%) were concentrated in five of the eight states: Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Texas. A similar type of concentration of total home health episodes (both Parts A and B) has been noted by MedPAC. In MedPAC's March 2013 Report to Congress, the top five states in terms of home health utilization (Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Texas) accounted for 35% of home health episodes despite accounting for only 17% of beneficiaries. Additionally, at the county level, a number of counties within high utilization states had average home health episodes per user at or greater than 4.0—at least twice the national average of 2.0 episodes per user. Recent efforts to increase payment efficiency and improve quality for the Medicare home health benefit have been recommended to Congress for consideration. Various deficit reduction proposals have recommended cost-sharing for beneficiaries receiving covered home health episodes in an effort to encourage appropriate utilization. Additionally, as required by ACA, CMS recently issued a plan to implement a value-based purchasing (VBP) program for HHAs in addition to the existing Medicare VBP programs currently being implemented for acute-care hospitals and physicians. The home health VBP program is an effort to base Medicare payments on quality of care delivered to beneficiaries and has been recommended by MedPAC. Further, additional issues for congressional consideration stems from a proposed settlement agreement, which requires CMS to revise its existing Medicare benefit guidelines as a result of a recent class-action lawsuit between HHS and the Center for Medicare Advocacy, and the temporary moratoria on new HHAs in targeted geographic areas. These issues are explained in more detail below. Currently, the home health benefit does not require beneficiary cost-sharing for home health services. Originally, home health services covered under Part B were subject to a 20% coinsurance of the Medicare-approved amount and the Part B deductible. The Social Security Amendments of 1972 (P.L. 92-603) eliminated the 20% coinsurance, and the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1980 (OBRA 80, P.L. 96-499 ) eliminated the Part B deductible for home health services. Reintroducing cost-sharing for home health services has been recommended and/or analyzed as a deficit reduction policy. Below are different home health cost-sharing proposals and/or analyses: In the March 2013 Report to the Congress, MedPAC recommended introducing an episode copayment for non LUPA episodes not preceded by a hospitalization or other post-acute care use. MedPAC estimated that introducing a copayment in 2014 of $150 per 60-day episode would reduce Medicare spending between $1 billion and $5 billion over five years. To assist the Joint Select Deficit Reduction Committee, the Bipartisan Policy Center released a set of recommendations that included policies related to Medicare savings. One recommendation suggested introducing copayments for home health services. The Bipartisan Policy Center's proposal included an estimated savings of $40 billion over 10 years. The proposal did not specify the amount of the copayment or if the copayment would apply to a LUPA episode or an episode following a hospitalization. The President's FY2014 budget included a proposal to introduce $100 copayment per home health episode for newly enrolled beneficiaries beginning in 2017. Similar to MedPAC, the copayment would apply to non LUPA episodes that were not preceded by a hospitalization. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated this proposal would reduce Medicare spending by $700 million between 2014 and 2023. While CBO does not recommend proposals, it does provide options for congressional consideration. In its March 2011 publication on deficit reduction options, CBO included an option to require coinsurance for Medicare home health. According to CBO, a coinsurance amount equal to 10% per home health episode, which CBO estimated would cost on average $600 per beneficiary, implemented in 2013, would reduce the deficit by $40 billion over 10 years (between 2012 and 2022). The proposal did not specify if copayments would apply to LUPA episodes or episodes following a hospitalization. As noted by MedPAC, increased cost-sharing for home health episodes may decrease Part B home health expenditures which in turn could lead to lower Part B premiums (since Part B premiums are determined, in part, by expected Part B expenditures). Additionally, state and federal Medicaid expenditures may increase from covering the copayments of Medicare home health users who are also entitled to Medicaid coverage. Further, home health copayments may increase Medicare supplemental policies' expenditures, thereby increasing Medicare supplemental policy premiums. Beneficiary advocates contend that some beneficiaries who would have to pay for the copayments themselves will forgo needed home health services, which may lead to more expensive hospitalizations. It is unclear whether or not including home health cost-sharing requirements will raise current hospitalization rates. According to MedPAC, roughly 30% of home health users are hospitalized during their home health stay or within 30 days following their discharge from the HHA. The prominent diagnoses among home health beneficiaries who are hospitalized are respiratory infection, urinary tract infection, and heart failure. ACA required the Secretary of HHS to establish plans for implementing a value-based purchasing (VBP) program for the Medicare home health benefit. A VBP program can reward providers based upon established quality measures. CMS considers VBP programs to be an important step towards rewarding providers based on quality and efficiency. VBP programs are currently being implemented or will be implemented in other Medicare payment systems (e.g., acute-care hospitals, physicians). In 2012, CMS released the Report to the Congress: Plan to Implement a Medicare Home Health Agency Value-Based Purchasing Program, which highlighted several elements as important to designing and implementing a VBP program for the Medicare home health benefit. One consideration will be the performance measures used to score HHA quality. The National Quality Forum (NQF), a public-private nonprofit organization, has already endorsed several measures currently used on the Home Health Compare website. Such measures include a clinical domain (e.g., improvement in walking/bathing), a process domain (e.g., whether or not the beneficiary received an influenza immunization), a utilization domain (e.g., whether or not the beneficiary was hospitalized), and beneficiaries' rating of the HHA's care. An additional consideration will be how the financial incentives of a VBP program (e.g., penalties and/or rewards) are implemented and how the quality targets or benchmarks are determined (e.g., exceeding a certain score/rank, improvement in score/rank over time). In a 2007 Report to the Congress, MedPAC provided some recommendations for the financial aspect of a VBP program for the home health benefit. MedPAC recommended that the VBP program be budget-neutral—redistributing 1% to 2% of total home health payments from poor performers to high performers. The commission also recommended that high performers be based on attaining or exceeding certain benchmarks and a benchmark for improvement. In January 2011, the Center for Medicare Advocacy filed a class-action lawsuit, Jimmo v. Sebelius, against HHS claiming that the Medicare program had improperly denied thousands of beneficiaries coverage for a range of skilled care services because they could not show that their health would improve. This so-called \"improvement standard\" was a sub-regulatory rule-of-thumb used by some Medicare claims contractors over the past several decades, which required that persons with chronic conditions and disabilities show a likelihood of medical or functional improvement before Medicare would pay for skilled care and therapy services in the home or institutional setting. This \"improvement standard\" effectively denied coverage for home health care, SNF care, and outpatient therapy services on the basis that an individual was not improving. Neither the Medicare statute nor its implementing regulations require beneficiaries to show a likelihood of improvement, and, in the lawsuit, Medicare officials denied that such a policy exists. However, some provisions of the Medicare Benefit Policy Manual suggest coverage should be denied or terminated if a patient reaches a plateau or is not improving or is stable. In addition, coverage denials by contractors processing claims allegedly included such language as \"maintenance services only,\" \"chronic,\" or \"medically stable.\" This standard affected many Medicare beneficiaries with disabilities and chronic conditions such as stroke, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injury, and Parkinson's disease. Many of these patients were denied coverage for skilled services needed to manage their chronic condition, maintain their existing function, and/or prevent or limit deterioration of function, because of the \"improvement standard.\" On January 24, 2013, a federal district court in Vermont granted final approval of a proposed settlement agreement in Jimmo v Sebelius. The agreement requires CMS to revise its existing guidelines in the Medicare Benefit Policy Manual for the home health benefit, as well as for the SNF, outpatient therapy, and inpatient rehabilitation facility benefits. Specifically, the manual's revisions for the home health benefit would be clarified to provide that home health coverage is based on an individualized assessment of the beneficiary's medical condition and need for skilled care, and not on whether the beneficiary's condition has the potential to improve, even if the therapy would simply maintain the beneficiary's current condition or slow further deterioration. While a showing that a patient's condition is expected to improve would no longer be required for home health care, a physician would still be required to certify that the patient is, in fact, homebound, and could prescribe treatment that only a skilled practitioner can provide. Further, CMS would be required to implement a nationwide educational campaign to communicate the revised standards to providers, contractors, and adjudicators. It is unclear how the settlement would affect home health eligibility, utilization, and subsequent Medicare expenditures. There is currently no adequate estimate of the number of home health claims that are denied due to the misinterpretation of Medicare provisions or the amount of home health coverage that was forgone by providers in anticipation of a claims rejection. However, regarding the proposed settlement agreement, Robert Resichauer, a trustee of the Medicare program, was quoted in The New York Times regarding the \"improvement standard\" settlement saying \"(u)nquestionably that would increase costs.\" Others argue that the change could save money for Medicare by increasing access to covered home health services, thereby reducing beneficiaries' need for more expensive care in hospitals and skilled nursing facilities. As a fraud and abuse prevention measure, Section 6401 of the ACA provided the Secretary the authority to impose temporary moratoria on the enrollment of new Medicare, Medicaid, or State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) providers and suppliers, including categories of providers and suppliers. The Secretary may impose such a temporary moratorium on newly enrolling Medicare providers or suppliers if they determine that there is a significant potential for fraud, waste, or abuse with respect to a particular provider/supplier type, a particular geographic area, or both. The moratorium would last six months in duration and may be extended in six-month increments. A moratorium may be lifted if the Secretary believes the moratorium is no longer needed (e.g., the potential for fraud has been abated) or an emergency situation arises. Effective July 30, 2013, CMS issued temporary moratoria on HHAs applying to participate in the Medicare, Medicaid, or CHIP programs from the Chicago and Miami areas. These moratoria were implemented due to the large increase in the number of HHAs in the Miami and Chicago areas compared to the national average, the high ratio of HHAs to Medicare FFS beneficiaries when compared to similar areas, and the high average Medicare home health per user payment when compared to similar areas. Additionally, CMS announced it would continue the moratoria in the Chicago and Miami areas for an additional six months, and, effective January 30, 2014, expand the moratoria to new HHAs applying to participate in Medicare, Medicaid or CHIP in four additional areas: Broward County, FL, and the Dallas, Detroit, and Houston metropolitan areas. CMS analyses showed target areas: Broward County, FL; Wayne County, MI (which contains the City of Detroit); Dallas County, TX (which contains the City of Dallas); and Harris County, TX (which contains the City of Houston), consistently ranked near the top of potential fraud risk metrics. CMS expanded the target areas to include bordering counties to prevent the relocation of potential fraudulent providers to new geographic areas. In addition to the moratoria, CMS continues to implement other fraud prevention measures, such as payment suspensions and revocation of provider/supplier numbers in target areas. With the establishment of Medicare, the home health benefit has been traditionally categorized as a \"post-acute care\" benefit. However, home health coverage is provided to beneficiaries whether or not they have had a recent hospitalization. Prior regulatory and legislative changes have expanded Medicare's home health services and eligibility requirements, as well as eliminated cost-sharing requirements. Many of the changes to the home health benefit were in response to efforts of deinstitutionalization, moving individuals out of nursing facilities and back into the community, as well as avoiding hospitalizations. In 2001, beneficiaries with a prior hospitalization represented 48% of all home health episodes. By 2010, only 34% of home health episodes were for beneficiaries who had a prior hospitalization. While more initial home health episodes are certified to beneficiaries who were recently hospitalized (1.9 million episodes in 2010) than for beneficiaries admitted from the community (1.3 million episodes in 2010), most home health episodes over an entire year are provided to beneficiaries who did not have a prior hospitalization. In 2010, for home health users who had a prior hospitalization, Medicare covered roughly 500,000 subsequent (second or greater) home health episodes following the beneficiaries' initial episode, an increase from 300,000 in 2001. For home health users admitted from the community, Medicare covered roughly 3.2 million subsequent home health episodes, an increase from 1.3 million subsequent episodes in 2001. These figures may suggest that Medicare is providing a greater amount of home health coverage to beneficiaries suffering from chronic illnesses, who may require longer treatment plans than beneficiaries recovering from acute illnesses. Additionally, since the implementation of the HH PPS in October 2000, Medicare FFS home health payments have grown rapidly at an average annual rate of 8.0% between 2001 and 2011. Additionally, the aggregate Medicare margin for freestanding HHAs has remained consistently high: 13.6% in 2003 and 14.8% in 2011. The high rate of Medicare margins may suggest that estimating the costs of home health services through the HH PPS proves to be difficult. This difficulty may arise from large variation in agency costs of home health care, even after controlling for a beneficiary's clinical and functional factors. Further, the decline in the share of home health services that are related to prior hospital and SNF stays and the resulting rise in Medicare Part B expenditures and the notable difference in geographic variation of Part B per user payments, as shown in Figure 7, may illustrate the changing care needs and geographic differences in health status among Medicare beneficiaries. However, it may also point to potential overutilization, as noted by MedPAC, and the potential complexity in administering home health eligibility criteria where some may look to changes in the Medicare home health benefit and home health payment policy that address greater payment efficiencies. The appendix summarizes selected key changes to the home health benefit that have been included in the following pieces of legislation. Social Security Amendments of 1965 (P.L. 89-97) Title XVIII of the Social Security Amendments of 1965 established the Medicare program. The legislation provided eligible Medicare beneficiaries with up to 100 \"post-hospital\" home health visits each year under Part A and up to 100 home health visits each year under Part B. Medicare provided payment for each covered home health visit based on reasonable costs the HHA incurred, up to certain limits. To be eligible for home health visits under Part A or Part B, beneficiaries must have been in need of part-time or intermittent skilled nursing care or physical, occupational, or speech therapy, with a plan of care established 14 days after discharge. At that time, to be eligible for home health visits under Part A, beneficiaries must have had a three-day inpatient hospital stay. No hospitalization requirement was necessary for Part B home health coverage; however, beneficiaries were required to enroll in Part B to receive home health coverage under Part B. Home health services covered under Part B were subject to the Part B deductible and a 20% coinsurance of the Medicare-approved cost of care. Social Security Amendments of 1972 (P.L. 92-603) A provision in the Social Security Amendments of 1972 eliminated the 20% coinsurance requirement for Part B covered home health services beginning on or after January 1, 1973. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1980 (OBRA 80, P.L.\n\n### Summary:", "answer": "The Medicare home health benefit provides coverage for home visits by skilled health care professionals. Medicare Parts A and B provide coverage for home health services. To be eligible for the home health benefit, a beneficiary must meet three different criteria. The beneficiary must (1) be homebound, (2) require intermittent skilled nursing care and/or skilled rehabilitation services, and (3) be under the care of a physician who has established that the home health visits are medically necessary in a 60-day plan of care. A beneficiary who meets these requirements is entitled to a 60-day episode of Medicare coverage for home health visits, and is then entitled to an unlimited number of subsequent 60-day episodes so long as he or she continues to meet the eligibility requirements. There is no cost-sharing requirement for home health services. Roughly 9.5% of Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) beneficiaries (or 3.4 million individuals) used home health services in 2011. Home health services are provided through home health agencies (HHAs), most of which (85%) are freestanding—HHAs not affiliated with an institution such as a hospital or a nursing facility. The number of HHAs participating in Medicare grew by 62% between 2000 and 2011 (from 7,528 to 12,199), with a vast majority of the increase in for-profit freestanding HHAs. Similar to most Medicare payment methods, Medicare Part A or Part B reimburses HHAs using a prospective payment system (PPS). A PPS reimburses providers with payments that are predetermined by a formula that adjusts payments for beneficiaries' expected care needs and location, among other factors. The home health PPS (HH PPS) was implemented for services beginning on or after October 1, 2000. Generally, the HH PPS provides a single payment for a 60-day episode to HHAs for the estimated costs of home health services. The 60-day episode payment is in contrast to the prior home health payment system that reimbursed HHAs retrospectively on a per visit basis. While total Medicare FFS expenditures have grown at an average annual rate of roughly 5.6% between 2001 and 2011, Medicare FFS expenditures on home health services have increased at an average annual rate of 8.0% over the same time period. In 2011, Medicare FFS expenditures on covered home health services totaled $18.4 billion. In addition to the high growth rate in Medicare home health payments, the home health benefit has drawn attention due to the consistently high Medicare margins (percentage of Medicare revenue that exceeds costs of services) of participating HHAs. Between 2003 and 2011, aggregate Medicare margins for freestanding HHAs have remained consistently high—from 13.6% in 2003 to 14.8% in 2011. As deficit reduction pressures increase, the 113th Congress may debate whether to include beneficiary cost-sharing for home health services (a proposal recommended by the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission and various other groups). Congress may also consider proposals to implement a value-based purchasing program for HHAs that would adjust Medicare payments based upon certain HHA quality measures. Similar proposals are currently being implemented in other Medicare payment systems. Congress may also choose to monitor the implementation of the settlement agreement of a recent class-action lawsuit between the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Center for Medicare Advocacy regarding the so-called \"improvement standard\" as well as the moratoria on new HHAs in targeted geographic areas."}

In recognition of this need, and in an effort to improve overall financial management, Congress passed a series of financial and IT management reform legislation dating back to the early 1980s, including the CFO Act and the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act of 1996 (FFMIA). FFMIA, in particular, requires the 24 departments and agencies covered by the CFO Act to implement and maintain financial management systems that comply substantially with (1) federal financial management systems requirements, (2) applicable federal accounting standards, and (3) the U.S. Government Standard General Ledger at the transaction level. FFMIA also requires auditors, as part of the 24 CFO Act agencies’ financial statement audits, to report whether those agencies’ financial management systems substantially comply with these requirements. In addition, the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 requires OMB to improve the acquisition, use, and disposal of IT by the federal government and continually assess the experiences of executive agencies in managing IT, among other responsibilities. Following enactment of this law, OMB revised Circular No. A-130, Management of Federal Information Resources, which established policy for the management of federal information resources and designated OMB as responsible for overall leadership and coordination, as well as the development and maintenance of a governmentwide strategic plan for federal information resources management within the executive branch. Despite these efforts, long-standing financial management systems weaknesses continue to present a formidable management challenge in providing accountability to the nation’s taxpayers and agency financial statement auditors continue to report that many agencies’ systems do not substantially comply with FFMIA requirements. In March 2004, OMB launched the FMLOB initiative, in part, to reduce the cost and improve the quality and performance of federal financial management systems by leveraging shared service solutions and implementing other reforms. The stated goals of the FMLOB initiative were to (1) provide timely and accurate data for decision making; (2) facilitate stronger internal controls that ensure integrity in accounting and other stewardship activities; (3) reduce costs by providing a competitive alternative for agencies to acquire or develop, implement, and operate financial management systems through shared service solutions; (4) standardize systems, business processes, and data elements; and (5) provide for seamless data exchange between and among federal agencies by implementing a common language and structure for financial information and system interfaces. According to a December 2005 OMB memorandum, to achieve the FMLOB vision—and enable efforts to achieve its goals—federal agencies must have competitive options available for financial systems. OMB described a shared service solution framework consisting of a limited number of providers that deliver competitive alternatives for agencies investing in financial system modernizations and provide financial management services for multiple organizations. OMB stated that the economies of scale and skill of a provider will allow it to provide federal agencies with a lower-risk, lower- cost, and increased service quality alternative for financial system modernization efforts. According to OMB, when the FMLOB is successful, federal agencies will have the ability to migrate from one solution to a more competitive or better performing alternative that is offered by a limited number of stable and high-performing providers. In May 2006, OMB established a migration policy and issued its Competition Framework for FMLOB Migrations to provide guidance to agencies planning to migrate their financial management systems and services. According to this migration policy, “with limited exception, an agency seeking to upgrade to the next major release of its current core financial management system or modernize to a different core financial management system must either migrate to a or qualified private sector provider, or be designated as an. At a minimum, agencies must consider pursuing hosting and application management shared services. However, agencies may also consider other shared services, such as accounting or transaction processing.” This policy was subsequently incorporated into OMB Circular No. A-127 in January 2009; this circular provides guidance on the use and selection of external providers to ensure that agencies rely on such providers to help manage their systems and no longer develop their own unique systems. As program manager for the FMLOB initiative, FSIO had a significant role in achieving FMLOB goals, including the development of standard business processes, core financial system requirements, and testing and product certification. In March 2010, OMB announced that FSIO was ceasing operations effective March 31, 2010, stating that FSIO had achieved its objectives of developing governmentwide financial management business processes and data elements. As part of its new approach, OMB also announced in March 2010 the creation of the Office of Financial Innovation and Transformation (FIT) within the Department of the Treasury’s Office of Fiscal Service. FIT’s stated mission includes (1) helping set a new course for federal financial management using automated solutions to reduce duplicate work at individual agencies and (2) assisting in ensuring consistency with a long-term financial management systems strategy for the federal government. In June 2010, OMB announced key elements of its new approach, which will focus on (1) implementing smaller project segments that deliver critical functionality sooner, (2) increasing oversight and review of financial system projects, (3) promoting higher impact shared service efforts related to transaction processing, (4) assessing compliance with financial system requirements, and (5) revising the process for certifying financial management software. In an effort to capitalize on new technologies to help address financial management weaknesses and help meet their financial management needs, about half of the CFO Act agencies are in the process of or have plans to modernize their core financial systems, which often involve large- scale, multiyear financial system implementation efforts. According to the results of our survey, 12 of 23 civilian CFO Act agencies have migrated, or plan to migrate, certain services supporting 16 current systems to 12 external providers in connection with their modernization efforts. Because of the number of separate external service providers involved, the progress toward a shared service framework among the CFO Act agencies has been limited. Over the years, federal agencies have struggled to develop and implement numerous core financial systems to help meet their financial information needs for managing and overseeing their day-to-day operations and programs. As shown in table 1, the civilian agencies, representing 23 of the 24 CFO Act agencies, identified 45 fully deployed core financial systems in use as of September 30, 2009, in response to our survey of the 24 CFO Act agencies. While some of these agencies have recently completed efforts to deploy modernized systems, 17 agencies continue to use 25 aging legacy systems to help meet their needs, including 8 core financial systems placed into operation prior to 1990. Additional information on the 45 current civilian CFO Act agency core financial systems can be found in table 5 of appendix II. Recognizing the importance of effective core financial systems in meeting their financial information needs and efforts to address financial management weaknesses, many agencies are modernizing these current core financial systems. In this regard, 14 of the 23 civilian CFO Act agencies identified 14 systems they plan to fully deploy after fiscal year 2009, which will replace 27 of the current legacy systems. However, agencies provided this information prior to the issuance of OMB’s June 2010 guidance concerning oversight and review of financial system projects, and some of these 14 planned systems may no longer be viable projects under that guidance. Additional information on the 14 planned civilian CFO Act agency core financial systems can be found in table 6 of appendix II. In addition to the 23 civilian CFO Act agencies that responded to the survey, the Department of Defense (DOD) identified one current system, even though it responded that it has more than 100 core financial systems. DOD also identified 6 enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems it plans to deploy from 2011 through 2017. For example, DOD’s General Fund Enterprise Business System is an ERP system that is expected to eliminate 87 current systems and to be used by approximately 79,000 users once it is fully deployed in January 2012. Detailed information that DOD reported on its current and planned systems is included in tables 5 and 6 in appendix II. Because of the scope and complexity of agency modernization efforts, especially those involving highly integrated ERP systems, these large-scale projects often involve system implementations extending over several years before their intended benefits can be realized. For example, in 1999, the Army initiated its Logistics Modernization Program (LMP) in order to better manage its inventory and repair operations at various depots. Although the Army anticipates completing its 12-year multiphased deployment in fiscal year 2011, this project reflects the substantial challenges in large-scale deployments, such as a lack of a comprehensive set of metrics with which to measure the success of implementation. Similarly, the Department of Justice (DOJ) is involved in a multiyear modernization effort to replace six core financial systems and multiple procurement systems operating across the agency with a new integrated core financial system (referred to as the Unified Financial Management System, or UFMS). DOJ expects to complete its efforts to deploy UFMS in 2013, 10 years after the initial alternatives analysis related to this project was completed. Additional information concerning core financial system modernization efforts at DOJ and other selected case study agencies can be found in appendix III. Although OMB’s previous FMLOB guidance focused on migrating support services in connection with new or upgraded agency systems rather than previously deployed systems, 12 of the 23 civilian CFO Act agencies reported that they had already migrated, or plan to migrate, IT hosting or application management services supporting 16 of the 45 current systems that had already been fully deployed as of September 30, 2009. Further, these agencies plan to rely on eight different commercial providers and four federal SSPs to provide services for current systems. Of the 32 expected systems noted in table 1, there are 14 agencies relying on or expecting to rely on 11 providers—4 federal SSPs and 7 commercial providers—to support 17 core financial systems. Table 2 summarizes civilian agencies’ use of external providers—either federal SSPs or commercial providers—for hosting or application management of the 45 current, 14 planned, and 32 expected core financial systems. Overall, 14 of the 23 civilian CFO Act agencies are planning to complete their efforts to deploy 14 planned systems at various times through fiscal year 2018. Ten of these 14 agencies reported that they migrated, or plan to migrate, IT hosting and application management services supporting 10 of the 14 core financial systems they plan to fully deploy after September 30, 2009. In connection with these migrations, 5 of the 10 agencies plan to rely on five different commercial providers, while 2 of the 10 rely, or plan to rely, on the same federal SSP to provide these services, and 3 of the 10 have not determined who the provider will be. In addition, DOD is planning to use two commercial providers for 2 of its 6 planned systems. Table 6 in appendix II includes additional information concerning the migration of selected support services for the 14 planned civilian agency core financial systems and 6 planned DOD systems. In addition to IT hosting and application management support services, eight CFO Act agencies reported that they have migrated, or plan to migrate, transaction processing services to external providers. Specifically, DOD, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Labor, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) (as shown in table 6 of app. II) reported that they plan to rely on external providers to provide transaction processing support services for their planned systems while the Department of Transportation, the Department of the Treasury, the General Services Administration, and NRC (as shown in table 5 of app. II), reported that they already rely on external providers for these services for their existing systems. Rather than migrating these services, some large agencies are consolidating their transaction processing activities in-house at the agency level or integrating internal accounting operations through their own internal agency shared solution (e.g., the Department of Agriculture and DOJ, as described in app. III). In June 2010, OMB stated that its attempts to mandate the use of shared services under its previous policy—for hosting and application management—yielded inconsistent results as medium and large agencies encountered the same types of costs and risks with an external provider as they did when modernizing in-house. In contrast, smaller agencies are more frequently relying on external providers to provide core financial system support services to leverage the benefits of using external providers, as discussed in more detail later in this report. Specifically, according to officials at the four federal SSPs, 90 non-CFO Act agencies rely on the support services these providers offer. Federal SSP officials also stated that smaller agencies more frequently rely on the transaction processing support services they provide. For example, according to an official from one federal SSP, it provides transaction processing services to all of its 45 non-CFO Act client agencies. See appendix IV for information on the number of clients serviced by federal SSPs. Agencies and external providers reported that migrating support services to external providers offers advantages for helping smaller agencies, in particular, to capitalize on the benefits associated with sharing the services and solutions available through external providers. However, while federal agencies and external providers have made varied progress toward implementing the FMLOB initiative, they continue to face significant challenges affecting their efforts to modernize core financial systems and migrate selected services supporting them. OMB officials acknowledged that efforts to capitalize on shared services at large agencies have achieved limited success and, in a March 2010 memorandum, announced a need to develop a new approach for financial systems in the federal government. The benefits and challenges experienced through agency and provider efforts to implement the FMLOB initiative offer important lessons learned that if considered could assist OMB in developing its new approach. Modernization and migration efforts highlighted a number of lessons learned regarding potential benefits and challenges of agency migrations to external providers. The potential benefits and challenges summarized in this section were identified by the 24 CFO Act agencies, smaller, non-CFO Act agencies, and external providers through survey results, interviews, and agency case studies. We also identified challenges with agency migrations related to OMB’s guidance on competition. See appendix V for more details on key benefits and challenges reported related to agency migration and modernization efforts. As shown in table 3, external providers’ experienced staff, the potential for cost savings through shared services, increased economies of scale, and the ability to focus on mission-related responsibilities were cited in the survey responses of CFO Act agencies as some of the benefits and advantages of migrating core financial system support services to external providers. For example, Treasury cited potential cost savings and benefits associated with using an external provider such as resource sharing, provider expertise in solving application problems, and using cloud computing concepts. In May 2010, we also reported potential benefits associated with cloud computing, such as economies of scale and the faster deployment of patches to address security vulnerabilities. According to external provider officials, smaller agencies rely more frequently on external providers for transaction processing than CFO Act agencies and benefit from providers’ use of shared instances of software applications and standard interfaces across multiple clients, and their ability to more efficiently process complex transactions. To help realize these benefits, CFO Act agencies also identified a variety of key factors that contribute to successful migrations. Many of the factors cited involve the effective use of disciplined processes, such as clearly defining requirements and performing gap analyses to ensure that agency needs will be met, performing appropriate testing and data conversion procedures, minimizing customizations of software, and reengineering business processes to facilitate greater standardization. In addition, agencies cited the need for (1) appropriate and adequate resources to lead, plan, manage, execute, and oversee modernization and migration activities; (2) clearly defined expected outcomes and responsibilities of key stakeholders; and (3) effective service-level agreements and other mechanisms that could help ensure that the intended benefits of migrating are achieved. CFO Act agencies also cited various concerns about migrating to external providers, such as the ability of external providers to provide solutions that meet the complex and unique needs associated with large agency migrations. As shown in table 4, CFO Act agencies expressed concerns about the general loss of control, flexibility, and subject matter expertise and various risks they will experience if IT hosting, application management, and transaction processing are migrated and whether providers had the capacity to meet the extensive needs associated with large CFO Act agencies. External providers acknowledged these concerns, but cited additional challenges affecting their migration-related efforts, such as agencies’ resistance to adopting common processes used by providers and the lack of a clear mechanism for ensuring that agency migrations occur as intended. We found similar migration challenges related to OMB’s guidance on competition affecting agency and external provider migration efforts, its implementation, and effective oversight. For example, we found that agencies were not always required to migrate to an external provider and did not always conduct a competition for IT hosting and application management because they had already decided to use existing in-house resources to meet their needs (e.g., DOJ, which is discussed in more detail in app. III). On the other hand, we found that those agencies migrating to external providers were not using a limited number of external providers, raising significant questions regarding the extent to which the services they are to provide will be shared with other agencies and any related potential cost savings will be realized. Specifically, as previously discussed, based on survey responses, 14 CFO Act agencies were relying, or planning to rely, on a total of 11 different external providers to support 17 expected systems and providers for 4 of the 17 systems were still to be determined. Unlike similar efforts to implement other OMB electronic government (E- gov) initiatives, the FMLOB guidance does not provide a mechanism for determining the appropriate number of providers needed or describe a governance structure to help ensure that agencies migrate to one of the specific providers identified. For example, prior policies for the human resource line of business (HRLOB) and E-Payroll initiatives both involved the migration of agency-performed functions common across federal agencies to specifically designated shared service centers. Further, in connection with the E-Payroll initiative, established in June 2002, four providers were selected to furnish payroll services for the executive branch. In its latest annual report to Congress on E-gov benefits, OMB reported that migrations of payroll functions performed by other agencies to these providers had been completed. OMB officials acknowledged that efforts to modernize financial management systems under its FMLOB initiative have achieved limited success and that a new approach is needed. Detailed information on OMB’s new approach is not yet available because of its early stage of implementation. However, we have summarized the key elements of its new approach and identified related issues, generally based on lessons learned from prior migration and modernization efforts, for OMB to consider as it moves forward with its implementation. To address ongoing challenges with financial management practices, OMB announced a new financial systems modernization approach, which encompasses the following five key areas. Shared services for transaction processing. In March 2010, OMB and Treasury announced the creation of FIT, within Treasury, effective on April 5, 2010. FIT is expected to coordinate with the CFO Council to identify and facilitate the acquisition or development of initial operating capabilities for automated solutions for transaction processing. Initially, FIT’s efforts will focus on developing operating capabilities for vendor invoicing and intergovernmental transactions. According to OMB, based on the success of interested agencies’ efforts to pilot initial capabilities of new solutions, they will be phased in across the federal government as other agencies request to adopt them. OMB stated that its previous policy captured under the FMLOB initiative—requiring agencies to either serve as SSPs or leverage their services—will no longer be mandated in all cases, but supports such arrangements when they are cost effective. Segmented approach for deploying systems. OMB’s new approach for agencies seeking to deploy a financial system includes limiting the overall length of development projects to 24 months and splitting them into segments of 120 days or less, in part to help simplify planning, development, project management, and other tasks and prioritize the most critical financial functions. Oversight and review of financial system projects. According to the June 2010 memorandum, agencies should identify upfront a series of milestones, warning flags, and stop points over the course of the segment life cycle that if deemed necessary, could result in the project being suspended and returned to planning. In addition, mechanisms for review of project status by senior management should be incorporated into project plans. In this regard, the memorandum directed CFO Act agencies to immediately halt activities, as of the date of the memorandum, on financial system modernization projects over a specified dollar threshold pending OMB review and approval of revised agency project plans reflecting this guidance. The guidance also stated that OMB will review project status on a quarterly basis through fiscal year 2012 and that project segment milestones must be met in order to release funding for additional segments. In addition, OMB announced the establishment of the Financial Systems Advisory Board under the CFO Council, which will make recommendations to OMB on selected projects being reviewed in accordance with the memorandum. Compliance with financial system requirements. OMB stated in its June 2010 memorandum that current core financial system requirements remain in effect and federal agencies have an ongoing responsibility to comply with them. OMB is also initiating a performance-based approach for compliance with financial system requirements that it believes will reduce the cost, risk, and complexity of financial system modernizations. OMB plans to issue a revision to OMB Circular No. A-127, Financial Management Systems, which will update existing requirements and include new guidance on how agencies and auditors will assess compliance with these requirements. Process for certifying financial management software. In March 2010, OMB announced the discontinuation of FSIO’s core financial system software testing and certification function and announced that FSIO operations would cease effective March 31, 2010. OMB’s June 2010 memorandum states that OMB is reforming the software testing and certification program by shifting the accountability of software performance to vendors through self-certification. Under this approach, agencies will hold vendors accountable in the same manner in which other contractual obligations are enforced and will be able to hold contractors specifically accountable for false certifications. OMB also plans to provide additional details related to testing process changes in its revision to OMB Circular No. A-127 and revisit this policy on an annual basis. OMB’s decision to embark on this new approach raises several key issues that have far-reaching implications for the government, software vendors, and external providers. Recognizing that the new approach is in an early stage of implementation, the steps taken so far do not fully describe a strategy that will address these issues moving forward, nor do they yet fully take into account lessons learned associated with previous governmentwide modernization efforts, including, in particular, the FMLOB migration activities discussed earlier in this report. Without sufficient detail on how these issues are to be addressed, uncertainties exist concerning the potential effectiveness of OMB’s new approach. The following describes key issues related to each of the five areas of OMB’s new approach. How will the new approach be implemented and what governance structure will be established to fully realize the benefits of common solutions and new technologies? How will new governmentwide shared solutions that are intended to perform functions currently performed at agencies work with current core financial systems and solutions? What guidance will be provided to agencies to encourage their participation in, and adoption of, the new solutions envisioned in the new approach? Previous efforts to realize the benefits associated with shared services have been challenging, in part because of the lack of a governance structure that ensures agency adoption of shared service solutions. Agency participation in the new solutions being developed by FIT is voluntary and OMB’s previous policy regarding migrations to external providers is no longer mandated. Therefore, the potential benefits that will actually be realized through shared services are uncertain. According to the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers, a concept of operations is normally one of the first documents produced during a disciplined development effort. OMB officials stated that they are developing an overall concept of operations but did not provide us an estimated timeframe for its completion. We previously reported on the need for this critical tool to provide an overall road map for describing the interrelationships among financial management systems and how information is to flow from and through them and within and across agencies, and ensuring the validity of each agency’s implementation approach. In addition, a concept of operations can be used to communicate overall quantitative and qualitative system characteristics to users, developers, and other organizational elements and would allow stakeholders to understand the user organizations, missions, and organizational objectives from an integrated systems point of view. We recognize that OMB’s new approach is in an early implementation stage and guidance is still being developed. However, implementing this approach without certain policy guidance carries risk. For instance, without a concept of operations that provides an overall road map to guide implementation efforts, it is unclear how the new governmentwide solutions envisioned under the new approach will integrate with current or planned core financial systems, as well as how they will impact numerous smaller agencies that have already migrated to federal SSPs. In addition, the governance structure for implementing OMB’s new approach will involve efforts expected to be performed by FIT. OMB has described certain activities FIT is expected to perform, but additional information concerning its purpose, its authority, and the resources to be devoted to its efforts remain unclear. For example, although OMB stated that FIT will assist in ensuring consistency with a long-term financial management systems strategy for the federal government, the specific role that FIT will play in developing or implementing a strategy or overseeing efforts to achieve its goals has not yet been defined. What actions will be taken to help ensure that agencies’ efforts to reduce the scope of modernization projects so that they can be completed within 24 months do not inappropriately emphasize schedule-driven priorities at the expense of achieving event-driven objectives? What guidance will be provided to ensure that agencies have developed an overall, high-level system architecture that clearly defines specific development projects that provide interim functionality? Although efforts to reduce the scope of agency modernization projects so that they can be completed within 24 months may result in more manageable projects, we have previously reported on the importance of capturing metrics that identify events and trends to assess whether systems will provide needed functionality rather than schedule-driven approaches that may lead to rework instead of making real progress on a project. The process for ensuring that future modernization projects conducted under the new approach will align with governmentwide and agency goals, achieve measurable results, and minimize future work- arounds and rework has not yet been clearly described. The Clinger-Cohen Act highlights the need for sound, integrated agency IT architectures and lays out specific aspects of a process agency chief information officers are to implement in order to maximize the value of agencies’ IT investments. For example, consistent with OMB’s new approach, the act also advocates the use of a modular acquisition strategy for a major IT system. Under this type of strategy, an agency’s need for a system is satisfied in successive acquisitions of interoperable increments. However, the act also states that each increment should comply with common or commercially accepted standards applicable to IT so that the increments are compatible with other increments of IT that make up the system. Some agency financial system modernization projects involve the implementation of large, integrated ERP systems—which may be designed to perform a variety of business-related tasks, such as accounts payable, general ledger accounting, and supply chain management across multiple organizational units—to help achieve agency strategic goals. Given the tightly integrated nature of these systems, the extent to which implementation projects can be modified and segmented to achieve OMB’s objective for delivering interim functionality to help agencies address critical needs has not yet been determined. What specific criteria will be used to evaluate agency modernization project plans and task orders requiring OMB review and approval? What steps will be taken to ensure that appropriate procedures and resources are in place at the agency level to avoid an improper impoundment of funds? How will the roles and responsibilities of OMB, the Financial Systems Advisory Board, or others involved in conducting the reviews and their efforts be defined and measured? Our prior work has linked financial management system failures, in part, to agencies not effectively incorporating disciplined processes shown to reduce software development and acquisition risks into their implementation projects. We support the principle of increased oversight and review of projects as called for in our prior recommendations. However, the criteria for performing quarterly assessments of agency modernization projects do not clearly define how such assessments will evaluate the extent to which agencies are embracing disciplined processes. Further, OMB’s template for capturing information on agency projects identifies numerous aspects to be reviewed; however, agencies are not required to provide information needed to assess the effectiveness of testing and data conversion efforts necessary to ensure that substantial defects are detected prior to implementation and that modifications of existing data enable them to operate in a different environment. These and other disciplined processes are critical for successfully implementing a new system. Effective oversight to ensure that they are incorporated into agency and governmentwide system implementation projects will also continue to be a critical factor in the success of future modernization efforts envisioned under OMB’s new approach. In addition, OMB’s direction and CFO Act agencies’ implementation of the direction to immediately halt activities on financial system IT projects pending the outcome of OMB’s review present additional risks concerning adherence to procedures to be followed for impoundments of budget authority, as prescribed in the Impoundment Control Act of 1974. Not all delays in obligating funds are impoundments, but where OMB has given direction to agencies to halt the issuance of new task orders or new procurements, we are concerned that agencies may misinterpret that as a direction to withhold budget authority from obligation either during the review process or upon the decision to terminate an investment. OMB issues general guidance in OMB Circular No. A-11 on the applicable procedures for compliance with the Impoundment Control Act. However, in 2006, we reported to Congress and OMB that executive agencies had improperly impounded budget authority following the President’s submission of proposals to Congress to rescind certain budget authority because, in part, agencies were not fully aware of the nature of the proposals and their intended effect on currently available budget authority. OMB officials stated that none of the 24 CFO Act agencies identified an impoundment resulting from OMB’s direction, but OMB had not evaluated the potential impact of the direction on the agencies’ budget authority nor had it issued any clarifying guidance to the agencies to alert them to the potential for impoundments that might arise if agencies withheld budget authority by not awarding contracts as directed. Moreover, OMB’s reliance on the Financial Systems Advisory Board to assist in the review of agency modernization projects will depend, in part, on the availability of sufficient resources to perform effective reviews and having clear criteria for selecting projects and performing the reviews. Having clear, measurable criteria for determining which projects are to be assessed and that provides for objective assessments would help ensure that they are performed completely and consistently for all projects and that oversight efforts help achieve intended results. The extent to which CFOs and chief information officers from major agencies or other experts will be available and used to perform such reviews, including whether such officials may be involved in reviewing projects related to their own agencies, has not been specified. While OMB officials told us that they plan to take steps to exclude officials from reviewing systems at their own agencies, the process for doing so has not been disclosed. How will system requirements and standard business processes be updated and maintained? What criteria will be used to determine whether a performance-based approach for compliance with financial system requirements reduces the cost, risk, and complexity of financial system modernizations? What actions will be taken to help ensure that discontinuing FSIO’s software testing and certification program does not result in lack of interoperability across agency systems? What steps will be taken to ensure that vendor self-certifications comply with applicable provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation? What guidance will be provided to agencies to clarify any changes in agency responsibilities for testing and validating software functionality? FSIO played a significant role in helping to identify and document federal financial management system requirements and the standard business processes on which they should be based. Such efforts were aimed at preventing duplicative research and compilation across government. Prior to ceasing operations effective March 31, 2010, FSIO was working to finalize an exposure draft and issue an updated version of core financial system requirements intended, in part, to reflect changes necessary to align them with current standard business processes. OMB’s June 2010 memorandum states that it plans to issue a revision to OMB Circular No. A-127 to update existing requirements and to provide guidance for agencies and auditors on how to assess compliance. The extent to which these changes will affect modernization efforts as well as improve the ability of financial systems to help address long-standing weaknesses is undetermined. While OMB’s plan to require vendors to self-certify software functionality is intended to shift accountability for software performance to vendors, it does not change vendor accountability for delivering products that meet specified standards. It also does not eliminate the need to develop and update those standards as new requirements are established to facilitate future improvements. Our work on financial management systems modernizations and industry standards has identified the importance of clearly defining systems requirements and managing those requirements throughout system implementations, and failure to do so can have a significant negative impact on their success. OMB plans to provide additional guidance related to the change in the testing process in an upcoming revision to OMB Circular No. A-127 and revisit the policy on an annual basis. However, it is not clear if OMB will be defining system standards and keeping those definitions up to date going forward or if these tasks will be delegated to another entity. The Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (Results Act) highlights the importance of strategic plans and performance plans as a means for assisting agencies to achieve desired results. We previously reported that strategies should be specific enough to enable an assessment of whether they would help achieve the goals of the strategic plan. We also reported on how collaborative efforts involving multiple agencies to address crosscutting issues—such as federal financial management modernization efforts—could benefit from a governmentwide strategic plan that identifies long-term goals and the strategies needed to address them, aligned performance goals, and improved performance information that assists decision making to improve results. Recognizing OMB’s critical role in governmentwide efforts, such as those envisioned under this new approach, the Clinger-Cohen Act, and OMB’s implementing guidance, OMB Circular No. A-130, specifically require OMB to develop a strategic plan for managing information resources. Further, incorporating performance plans, goals, and other key elements that facilitate performance measurement and monitoring is essential for ensuring that efforts are appropriately aligned to achieve desired results. It will be essential that performance plans are expressed in an objective, quantifiable, and measurable form that clearly links strategic goals with the strategies to be used to achieve them. OMB’s FMLOB initiative represented an important effort intended to reduce costs and improve the quality and performance of federal financial management systems that agencies depend on to generate reliable, useful, and timely information needed for decision-making purposes. In connection with their efforts to implement this initiative and modernize their systems, many agencies took steps to migrate selected core financial system support services to external providers. The use of external providers by smaller agencies in particular highlights potential benefits to be realized through these efforts, such as adopting common processes and sharing software. Other agencies continue to rely on aging legacy systems—even though they may have migrated to an external provider. Agencies continue to be challenged with reengineering business processes and effectively incorporating disciplined processes into their implementation efforts to help ensure their success. OMB announced a new strategy and plans for future financial management system modernization efforts, and began issuing a series of guidance on its new approach from March 2010 to June 2010. However, it is too early to determine the extent to which this new approach will address the cost, risk, and complexity of financial system modernizations. The experience and challenges related to efforts to implement the FMLOB initiative provide important lessons learned as OMB continues to develop and implement its new approach. OMB has stated that it plans to develop additional guidance, such as a governmentwide concept of operations, a long-term financial management systems strategy, and a revised OMB Circular No. A-127. Critical next steps will include OMB elaborating on its new approach to address key issues. The following includes our observations on these issues. As we have previously reported in connection with the FMLOB initiative, a concept of operations is one of the first and foremost critical building blocks and is needed to provide an overall road map to guide implementation of OMB’s new approach in accordance with best practices. Until a well-defined concept of operations is developed, questions remain on how the proposed governmentwide solutions can be integrated with current and planned agency financial management systems. Articulating key aspects of a strategic plan, such as goals and performance plans clearly linked to strategies for achieving them and expressed in an objective, quantifiable, and measurable form, is also critical for the success of OMB’s new approach. In addition, a governance structure that provides clear roles and responsibilities of key stakeholders, such as the Financial Systems Advisory Board and FIT, is necessary to help ensure that the stated goals are achieved. Further, detailed guidance and criteria will be important for understanding how ongoing and future modernization projects will be evaluated. In developing its strategy, it is also important for OMB to clarify the need to mitigate the risks involved with the new requirements for agencies to revise project plans to shorter increments. These risks include agencies adopting a schedule-driven approach rather than focusing on achieving event-driven results consistent with agency needs. In addition, providing guidance to agencies on incorporating relevant OMB Circular No. A-11 procedures would help to ensure that OMB efforts to review financial system IT projects under its new approach do not result in improper impoundments. As part of OMB’s revisions to Circular No. A-127, several clarifications would help provide agencies with direction to implement OMB’s new approach, including (1) the requirements for using an SSP, (2) the new process for developing and updating federal financial management system requirements and standard business processes, and (3) the performance- based approach for determining FFMIA compliance. We recognize that OMB is still in the process of fully implementing this new approach and completing related guidance. However, addressing these and other identified key issues and overcoming the historical tendency for agencies to view their needs as unique and resist standardization will depend on prompt and decisive action to develop an effective governmentwide modernization strategy and related guidance. We are not making any new recommendations in this report because of the early implementation stage of OMB’s new approach; however, we will continue to work with OMB to help ensure that it provides agency management and other stakeholders with the guidance needed to bring about meaningful improvements in financial management systems. Finally, to ensure that taxpayers’ dollars are used effectively and efficiently, continued congressional oversight will be crucial for transforming federal financial management systems to better meet federal government needs. We requested comments on a draft of this report from the Acting Director of OMB or his designee. On August 31, 2010, the OMB Controller provided oral comments on the draft report, including technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate. Overall, the Controller was concerned that it was too early for GAO to draw conclusions on the change in policy that was published in OMB Memorandum M-10-26 issued on June 28, 2010, and that the report needed to better reflect the new approach as being a work in progress in the beginning stages of implementation. To help address OMB’s concern, we included additional references to the early implementation stage of OMB’s new approach. The Controller also stated that the questions raised in the report were good for framing the issues, and that some of them were in the process of being addressed. For example, he stated that the planned revisions to OMB Circular No. A-127 will address issues raised on systems requirements and the process for certifying software. We have updated the report accordingly. The Controller also stated that the members of the new Financial Systems Advisory Board adopted a charter dated August 1, 2010, which provides additional detail and specificity on the role and responsibilities of the Board members. We were provided the charter on September 2, 2010, and will evaluate it as part of our future work. We continue to believe that the questions and issues raised in the report need to be addressed by OMB in order to reduce risks and help ensure successful outcomes as it moves forward with its new approach and develops additional guidance. As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce the contents of this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the report date. At that time, we will send copies to the Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Federal Financial Management, Government Information, Federal Services, and International Security, Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs; the Chairman and Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Government Management, Organization, and Procurement, House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform; and the Acting Director of OMB. The report also will be available at no charge on the GAO Web site at http://www.gao.gov. If you or your staff have any questions about this report, please contact Kay Daly, Director, Financial Management and Assurance, who may be reached at (202) 512-9095 or dalykl@gao.gov, or Naba Barkakati, Chief Technologist, Applied Research and Methods, who may be reached at (202) 512-2700 or barkakatin@gao.gov. Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. GAO staff who made major contributions to this report are listed in appendix VI. To address our objectives, we surveyed chief financial officers (CFO), or their designees, at the 24 CFO Act agencies. We asked each agency to identify the core financial systems that were fully deployed in the agency as of September 30, 2009, and any that the agency planned to fully deploy after that date. Through the use of e-mailed, self-administered questionnaires, we collected descriptive information on modernization and migration-related activities about each core financial system, as well as overall agency activities and perspectives regarding financial management line of business (FMLOB) migration efforts. We designed and tested these questionnaires in consultation with subject matter experts at GAO and the Financial Systems Integration Office (FSIO), GAO survey research methodologists, and selected agency officials. Data collection took place from November 2009 to April 2010. All 24 agencies responded to the survey request and returned questionnaires on 46 currently deployed systems and 20 planned systems that they had identified, as shown in appendix II, tables 5 and 6, respectively. While all agencies returned questionnaires, and therefore our data are not subject to sampling or overall questionnaire nonresponse error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey may introduce other errors into our findings. In addition to questionnaire design activities discussed above, to minimize errors of measurement, question-specific nonresponses, and data processing errors, GAO analysts (1) pretested draft questionnaires with two agency officials prior to conducting the survey, (2) contacted respondents to follow up on answers that were missing or required clarification, and (3) answered respondent questions to resolve difficulties they had answering our questions during the survey. In addition, we tested the accuracy of selected responses provided by three agencies by comparing them to data we obtained from case studies. To obtain more detailed information on steps taken to modernize core financial systems and migrate related support services to external providers, we performed case studies at the Department of Justice (DOJ), Department of Agriculture (USDA), Federal Communications Commission (FCC), and Office of Personnel Management (OPM). These agencies were selected to provide a variety of perspectives from agencies actively involved in core financial system modernization efforts. Specifically, the criteria used to select agencies for the case studies included (1) different software solutions, (2) a mix of large and small agencies, and (3) differing experiences concerning the use of external providers to support their core financial systems. To identify the use of different software solutions and differing experiences concerning the use of external providers, we reviewed an inventory of CFO Act agency and non-CFO Act agency core financial systems published by FSIO as of December 2008 that identified agencies’ software, versions, and providers, where applicable, that hosts the systems, as well as selected 2008 agency performance and accountability reports. To provide a mix of large and small agencies, we selected at least one agency from each of three strata defined by gross costs as reported in the 2008 Financial Report of the United States Government. To help ensure an efficient use of audit resources, we did not select agencies for which GAO had done work involving their financial management systems for our case study work performed in this review. We obtained and summarized information regarding these case study agencies from documentation provided by the agencies, such as capital asset plans and alternatives analyses. We also interviewed key agency officials involved with the implementations, including CFOs and project managers. We did not evaluate the effectiveness of the acquisition and implementation processes used by the case study agencies. In addition, we did not verify the accuracy of the data provided. To identify the benefits of, and key challenges that agency officials report as having an impact on, their efforts to modernize and migrate core financial systems to external providers, we reviewed and analyzed survey results from the 24 CFO Act agencies. In addition, we reviewed policies, guidance, reports, and memorandums obtained from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), FSIO, the four selected case study agencies, the four OMB-designated federal shared service providers (SSP), two commercial vendors supporting migration activities at selected case study agencies, and prior GAO reports. The four OMB-designated federal SSPs were the Department of Transportation’s Enterprise Services Center, the Department of the Interior’s National Business Center, the Department of the Treasury’s Bureau of Public Debt’s Administrative Resource Center, and the General Services Administration’s Federal Integrated Solutions Center. We interviewed knowledgeable officials of these organizations, as well as a co-chair of the Small Agency Council Finance Committee and chairman of its Financial Systems Subcommittee (the CFO of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and Deputy CFO of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, respectively) and the team leader of the CFO Council’s FSIO Oversight Transformation Team concerning key factors that contribute to successful migrations and significant challenges that may affect migration efforts at agencies and external providers. We also interviewed key OMB officials, including the Controller and Deputy Controller of the Office of Federal Financial Management, to discuss these factors as well as governmentwide efforts toward migrating core financial systems to external providers and OMB’s newly announced policy and financial systems modernization approach (new approach). We obtained and reviewed recent policies and guidance issued by OMB, such as OMB Memorandum M-10-26 calling for an immediate review of financial systems projects. We analyzed OMB’s new approach, in relation to relevant laws, regulations, and guidance, including the Clinger-Cohen Act, the CFO Act, the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act of 1996 (FFMIA), OMB Circular No. A-127, OMB Circular No. A-130, and standards set by the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers. We conducted this performance audit from June 2009 through September 2010 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We requested comments on a draft of this report from the Acting Director of OMB or his designee. We received oral and technical comments from the OMB Controller, which are discussed in the Agency Comments and Our Evaluation section and incorporated as appropriate. Tables 5 and 6 summarize responses received from CFO Act agencies concerning their core financial systems and efforts to migrate selected core financial system support services to external providers. The agencies completed separate questionnaires on each identified core financial system and the status of activities related to migrating information technology (IT) hosting, application management, and transaction processing services supporting these systems to external providers as of September 30, 2009. The status of agency migration activities and use of external providers are categorized as follows: Migrated - (provider). Agency has already migrated this service to a federal SSP or commercial provider as indicated. Planned - (provider). Agency has decided and planned to migrate this service to a selected federal SSP or commercial provider as indicated. Planned - (provider undetermined). Agency has decided to migrate this service but has not yet selected a provider. Undecided. Agency has not decided to migrate this service. Not planned. Agency does not plan to migrate this service to an external provider. Table 5 summarizes the results of the 24 CFO Act agency responses related to 46 current core financial systems, including 45 civilian systems and 1 defense system, that agency officials identified as being fully deployed as of September 30, 2009. Of these, 12 agencies reported that they have already migrated, or plan to migrate, IT hosting or application management core financial system support services to external providers for 16 systems. Further, 4 agencies reported that they rely on external providers for transaction processing services supporting 4 systems. In addition to completing separate questionnaires concerning current core financial systems that were fully deployed as of September 30, 2009, agencies completed separate questionnaires for 20 core financial systems, including 14 civilian and 6 defense systems, that they planned to fully deploy after that date, as shown in table 6. The surveys were conducted prior to the issuance of OMB’s new guidance. Accordingly, the impact, if any, of the new policy on agencies’ plans to deploy new core financial systems is not reflected in table 6. Some of these systems have already been partially deployed at bureaus or other subagency components within the agencies, and therefore some services may have already been migrated to an external provider even though full deployment had not yet occurred as of September 30, 2009. Of these systems, 10 agencies reported that they have already migrated, or plan to migrate, IT hosting and application management services supporting 10 systems; 4 agencies reported that they either do not plan, or had not yet made a decision, to migrate both these services supporting 4 systems; and 1 agency, the Department of Defense, reported that it did not plan to migrate these services for 4 planned systems and had migrated both services for 1 system and application management services for 1 system. In addition, 4 agencies reported that they plan to rely on external providers to provide transaction processing services supporting 4 planned systems. Additional information concerning selected federal agencies’ migration and modernization efforts is presented in this appendix. The four case study agencies are USDA, FCC, DOJ, and OPM. All four of these agencies reported similar reasons for undertaking efforts to modernize their core financial systems, including reliance on out-dated software that adversely affected their ability to meet financial management challenges, and had a goal of implementing a solution that will provide agencywide, streamlined, real-time accounting and reporting capability. We did not evaluate the effectiveness of the acquisition and implementation processes used by the case study agencies or verify the data provided. Planned software solution: SAP IT Hosting: USDA National Finance Center (NFC) USDA is taking steps to modernize its core financial systems using a solution based on SAP commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software that is intended to provide agencywide online, real-time transaction capability and access. USDA’s Financial Management Modernization Initiative (FMMI) is intended to replace the Foundation Financial Information System (FFIS) and consolidate and eliminate multiple systems currently used in various USDA component agencies and staff offices. USDA launched FMMI after identifying the need to upgrade department and agency financial and administrative payment and program general ledger systems. In 2005, USDA began efforts to identify its new core financial system needs and took steps to determine what software and services could be provided by federal SSPs, private software vendors, and other commercial providers. Figure 1 and table 7 summarize the key migration and modernization activities used by USDA to identify and deploy a core financial system solution. FCC identified a need to modernize its core financial systems and selected a Web-based version of Momentum COTS software to provide agencywide online, real-time transaction capability and access. FCC’s planned new core financial system is also intended to interface electronically with common governmentwide software applications and to replace a number of peripheral supporting software applications currently in use at FCC. FCC’s Core Financial System Replacement Project is intended to replace the Federal Financial System (FFS), which is an older, nonintegrated system that relies on batch processing of transactions and is currently hosted by the Department of the Interior’s National Business Center (NBC). The new core financial system is planned to be used as the system of record for all external reporting requirements, including financial statement preparation access and processing. In 2005, FCC began efforts to identify its core financial system needs and took steps to determine what software and services could be provided by federal SSPs, private software vendors, and other external providers. Figure 2 and table 8 summarize the key modernization and migration activities taken by FCC to identify and plan a core financial system solution. DOJ is configuring its Unified Financial Management System (UFMS) to improve financial management and procurement operations across DOJ. UFMS is planned to replace six core financial management systems and multiple procurement systems currently operating across DOJ with an integrated COTS solution. According to officials, UFMS should allow DOJ to streamline and standardize business processes and procedures across all of its components, providing secure, accurate, timely, and useful financial data to financial and program managers across the department, and produce component- and department-level financial statements. In addition, the system is intended to assist DOJ by improving financial management performance and to aid departmental components in addressing the material weaknesses and nonconformances in internal controls, accounting standards, and systems security identified by DOJ’s Office of Inspector General. Finally, the system is intended to provide procurement functionality to streamline business processes, provide consolidated management information, and provide the capability to meet all mandatory requirements of the Federal Acquisition Regulation and the Justice Acquisition Regulations. In 2003, DOJ began efforts to identify its new core financial system needs and took steps to determine what software and services could be provided by private software vendors and other external providers. Figure 3 and table 9 summarize the key migration and modernization activities taken by DOJ to identify and deploy a core financial system solution. OPM is taking steps to modernize its core financial systems using a solution based on Oracle COTS software that is intended to provide agencywide online, real-time transaction capability and access. The Consolidated Business Information System (CBIS) is intended to consolidate and eliminate multiple systems currently used by OPM with the initial deployment October 1, 2009, replacing the Government Financial Information System (GFIS). GFIS included CGI Momentum, which is used for salaries and expenses, and a revolving fund. OPM deployed phase I, release 1 of CBIS to replace Momentum and, according to officials, plans to launch phase II to incorporate trust fund accounting are currently under review by OPM leadership. Under CBIS, OPM also replaced its contract administration software, Procurement Desktop, with the Compusearch PRISM solution during phase I, release 1. In 2005, OPM began efforts to identify its core financial system needs and took steps to determine what software and services could be provided by federal SSPs, private software vendors, and other external providers. Figure 4 and table 10 summarizes the key actions taken and challenges encountered by OPM in identifying a core financial system solution. OMB designated four federal entities—(1) the National Business Center of the Department of the Interior; (2) the Administrative Resource Center, Bureau of Public Debt, of the Department of the Treasury; (3) the Federal Integrated Solutions Center of the General Services Administration; and (4) the Enterprise Services Center of the Department of Transportation— as SSPs for federal financial management. All four SSPs offer IT hosting, application management, transaction processing, and system implementation services or have a structure for providing all four of these services. Although the SSPs offer the four basic services mentioned above, the specific services provided may vary based on the requirements, size, and complexity of the client agency. SSPs typically offer a range of the following four basic services: IT hosting services may include systems management and monitoring, disaster recovery, help desk, network security compliance and controls, and continuity of operations plans and testing. Application management services may include system/software administration, application configuration, application setup and security, user access and maintenance, configuration management, and coordination of application upgrades and fixes. Transaction processing services may include account maintenance and reconciliation, financial reporting, regulatory and managerial reporting, standard general ledger reconciliation, payment processing, billings and collections, accounts payable, accounts receivable, travel payments, relocation payments, budgetary transactions, and fixed asset accounting. System implementation services may include implementation and integration support services, requirements analysis, system conversions, project management, systems testing, change management, and training. To help monitor and measure the performance of selected external providers in connection with the financial management line of business (FMLOB) services they provide, SSPs and agencies rely on service-level agreements, which are binding agreements that define the specific level and quality of the operational and maintenance services that an external provider will provide to a customer agency and outline penalties and incentives that may arise from not performing or exceeding the expected service levels. The inclusion of appropriate and clearly defined performance measures and metrics in service-level agreements is important for ensuring the usefulness of this tool. OMB’s FMLOB Migration Planning Guidance defines the four service categories and related performance metrics. Although specific metrics included in service-level agreements are negotiated and may vary, examples of performance metrics related to the services described above include the following: (1) For IT hosting, system availability; average total response time for system components; resolution time for critical, high, medium, and low incidents; number of security incidents in the past year; and file recovery time. (2) For application management, average time to restore mission-critical application functionality; unplanned downtime; percentage of on-time upgrades; and average retrieval time for archived data. (3) For transaction processing, invoice process cycle time; percentage of financial transactions with errors; average business days to close the books; and number of business days to report after closing books. (4) For system implementation services, percentage of standard financial management system requirements fulfilled; percentage of satisfactory postimplementation survey responses; and reduction in help desk volume. SSPs are also required to operate and maintain a COTS software package in compliance with FSIO core financial system requirements. As shown in table 11, three of the four SSPs use the Oracle software package, while two of the four use a Momentum software package. One SSP offers SAP software. In addition to the software offered by each SSP, table 11 also provides an overview of key characteristics of the four OMB-designated federal SSPs including detailed information regarding the number of full- time equivalent staff dedicated to providing financial management services and the clients they serve. The selected characteristics provide context for the financial management systems-related operations of the four federal SSPs. This appendix includes additional details on the key benefits and challenges of agencies migrating their core financial systems to external providers for IT hosting, application management, and transaction processing. The potential benefits and challenges include those reported by the CFO Act agencies in response to our survey. The surveys were conducted prior to the issuance of OMB’s new guidance. Accordingly, the effect, if any, of the new policy is not reflected in agencies’ responses. Non-CFO Act agencies’ use of external providers also highlights potential benefits and challenges. While external providers cited efforts to address agency concerns, they also highlighted their own concerns and challenges with agency migrations. We also noted other migration challenges related to OMB’s guidance on competitions. Based on survey responses concerning the potential advantages and disadvantages of migrating core financial system support services, 16 of the 24 (67 percent) CFO Act agencies believe that the benefits of migrating IT hosting greatly or somewhat outweighed their concerns, while 14 of 24 (58 percent) reported similar perceptions concerning the benefits of migrating application management services to external providers. In comparison, as shown in table 12, the responses indicated the perception that potential disadvantages outweigh any potential advantages of migrating transaction processing services to an external provider for 10 of the 24 (42 percent) CFO Act agencies. According to CFO Act agency responses to our survey, some of the potential benefits of migrating the IT hosting, application management, and transaction processing services for agencies’ core financial systems to external providers include the following: Potential cost savings through shared resources. For example, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission cited cost reductions in equipment purchase and maintenance costs, as well as the number of staff needed to maintain the application and process transactions. Allowing agency to focus on mission. For example, OPM stated that migrating its financial management system to an IT hosting provider enables OPM to extricate itself from the business of managing financial systems, transfers some of the risk associated with implementing and maintaining the system, and allows the CFO organization to concentrate on its goal of providing strategic direction based on financial data. Greater efficiency and reliability through experienced staff. For example, the Department of Transportation stated in its survey response that benefits include having a provider that has experience with the specific equipment, operations, and maintenance required by the hosted application. According to Small Agency Council officials, small agencies are more likely to migrate to external providers because they do not have sufficient resources to support infrastructures required to operate and maintain core financial systems. For example, according to one federal SSP, many of its clients consist of small commissions, such as the Election Assistance Commission, that rely on the “end-to-end” services the SSP provides. Further, according to officials at the four federal SSPs, their efforts toward acquiring additional clients are primarily focused on small to midsized agencies that may lack sufficient resources or expertise to meet their core financial system needs. The following summarizes the key reported benefits for non-CFO Act agencies. Potential cost savings through shared resources. Based on information provided by SSP officials, their clients share the same instance of core financial software hosted and maintained by SSPs with eight or more other clients, on average. Federal SSP officials stated that the use of shared instances and other tools, such as standard interfaces that facilitate the exchange of data between core financial systems and other systems, enables agencies to realize significant cost savings by spreading IT hosting, maintenance, and other related costs among multiple clients. Greater efficiency and reliability. According to FCC officials, FCC is currently modernizing its core financial system and is migrating to a commercial provider to take advantage of the provider’s expertise in acquiring and maintaining the latest technology to meet FCC’s needs. Further, since federal SSPs process transactions for multiple agencies, they are able to devote more resources toward processing complex transactions than smaller agencies that may not individually be required to handle such transactions on a regular basis. For example, according to one SSP, although many agencies do not process a large number of transactions involving employees’ permanent changes in duty stations, the SSP maintains the expertise and capability to efficiently process these complex transactions on a regular basis because of the volume it is required to handle on behalf of all its clients. Enhanced compliance with federal standards. External providers are working to incorporate changes in software to facilitate agencies’ efforts to comply with new standards and requirements, such as the Common Governmentwide Accounting Classification (CGAC) and other recently issued standard business processes. According to a federal SSP official, having a limited number of providers incorporate these changes into a common solution shared by multiple agencies, rather than each agency spending valuable resources to accomplish the same objective on its own, represents a significant advantage for the agencies relying on the shared solutions the SSP provides. CFO Act agencies highlighted system implementation disciplined processes, along with reengineering their business processes, among the greatest modernization challenges they face. Additional information on these and other reported key challenges affecting CFO Act agency modernization and migration efforts can be found in table 13. The following summarizes key examples of CFO Act agency survey and case study results related to challenges associated with migrating IT hosting, application management, and transaction processing to external providers. Department of Health and Human Services officials expressed concerns about the loss of control and risks associated with allowing another entity to manage or host the infrastructure on which an agency’s critical data reside, which could become impaired or compromised.\n\n### Summary:", "answer": "In 2004, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) launched the financial management line of business (FMLOB) initiative, in part, to reduce the cost and improve the quality and performance of federal financial management systems by leveraging shared services available from external providers. In response to a request to study FMLOB-related issues, this report (1) identifies the steps agencies have taken, or planned to take, to modernizing their core financial systems and migrate to an external provider and (2) assesses the reported benefits and significant challenges associated with migrations, including any factors related to OMB's new financial systems modernization approach. GAO's methodology included surveying federal agencies to obtain the status of their financial management systems as of September 30, 2009 (prior to OMB's March 2010 announcement of a new approach), and interviewing officials with selected agencies, external providers, and OMB. In oral comments on a draft of this report, OMB stated its position that it was too early for GAO to draw conclusions on its new approach because it is still a work in progress. For this reason, GAO is not making any new recommendations. However, GAO observes that the experience and challenges related to prior migration and modernization efforts offer important lessons learned as OMB continues to develop and implement its new approach. In an effort to capitalize on new technologies to help address serious weaknesses in financial management and help meet their future financial management needs, federal agencies continued to modernize their core financial systems, which often has led to large-scale, multiyear financial system implementation efforts. For the last 6 years, OMB has promoted the use of shared services as a means to more efficiently and effectively meet agency core financial system needs. Overall, 14 of 23 civilian Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Act agencies are planning to complete their efforts to deploy 14 new core financial systems at various times through fiscal year 2018, and in connection with their modernization efforts, 10 of the 14 agencies are migrating, or planning to migrate, hosting and application management support services to external providers. GAO also found that the CFO Act agencies were not using a limited number of external providers, a critical element of OMB's original approach. Five of the 10 agencies planned to rely on five different commercial providers, while 2 of the 10 planned to rely on the same federal provider and 3 had not determined the provider. In contrast, smaller agencies were more frequently relying on the four federal shared service providers to provide core financial system support services to leverage the benefits of using external providers. The most common benefits of migrating cited by CFO Act agencies were external providers' expertise, the potential for cost savings, and the agencies' ability to focus more on mission-related responsibilities. However, CFO Act agencies and external providers cited various challenges affecting modernization and migration efforts, such as reengineering business processes and the ability of external providers to provide specific solutions that meet complex agency needs. In March 2010, OMB announced a new financial systems modernization approach that focuses on the use of common automated solutions for transaction processing, such as invoicing and intergovernmental transactions. OMB issued a memorandum in June 2010 that included guidance for key elements of its new approach, such as agencies splitting financial system modernization projects into smaller segments. This new guidance also requires CFO Act agencies to halt certain modernization projects, pending OMB review and approval of revised project plans. Important aspects of the new approach have not yet been developed or articulated and OMB has stated that it plans to develop additional guidance. In GAO's view, it is critical that OMB's new guidance elaborate on the new approach and address key issues such as goals and performance plans clearly linked to strategies for achieving them, a governance structure, and specific criteria for evaluating projects. GAO believes these issues need to be addressed to reduce risks and help ensure successful outcomes as OMB moves forward with its new approach. GAO will continue to work with OMB to monitor the implementation of its new approach."}

Information may be shared upon request or without a preceding request. The information shared between countries can cover a range of documents and sources, and can occur in a variety of formats. Exchanges include responses to narrowly tailored requests for documents related to a specific taxpayer, as well as records for thousands of taxpayers. Exchanges are not limited to tax returns and other tax system-specific information; other sources can involve public records, information from securities brokers, and real-estate information. Exchanges are also defined to include broad-based discussions of policy and administration between tax authorities. According to the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT), there were nearly 2.5 million disclosures of tax returns or return information to foreign countries under tax treaty disclosure authority in 2010. The total number of disclosures may be greater than the number of taxpayers involved, as the same taxpayer may be the subject of more than one information exchange. Tax treaties, Tax Information Exchange Agreements (TIEA), and Mutual Legal Assistance Treaties (MLAT) provide U.S. officials working on tax matters the authority to exchange information with authorities in other countries. Generally, these agreements contain exchange of information provisions that have been agreed upon by the United States and one other country or jurisdiction; that is, they are bilateral. While U.S. domestic law or international law does not prevent countries from providing the United States with otherwise unprotected information, such exchanges typically do not occur outside the bounds of these agreements. Tax treaty provisions cover a wide range of tax issues but have two primary purposes; (1) avoiding double taxation and (2) enforcing the domestic tax laws of treaty partners. All but one tax treaty between the United States and other countries contains provisions that authorize exchange of information. According to officials at the Department of the Treasury, U.S. officials generally rely on a model income tax treaty to identify the terms and provisions that the United States would like to incorporate into its agreements with other countries. The U.S. Model Income Tax Convention of 2006 is the most recently published model treaty that U.S. officials rely on to negotiate tax treaty provisions, and includes Article 26 concerning information exchange. The Department of State serves as an advisor to the Department of the Treasury, which develops and negotiates tax treaties and other international agreements related to tax matters. Although model treaties are the starting point for U.S. negotiations with other countries, officials we spoke to noted that the terms and conditions of tax treaties, like other international agreements, are the product of negotiations between the countries involved. Specific agreements vary in the terms or provisions governing exchange of information between the United States and individual treaty partners, and, as discussed later in this report, these variations can have meaningful effects on the exchange of information process. When seeking approval for a treaty, including tax treaties, the Secretary of State formally submits the proposed treaty to the President of the United States for transmittal to the United States Senate. Following advice and consent of the United States Senate, the President of the United States signs the treaty, and directs the Secretary of State to take the actions necessary for the treaty to enter into force. After both countries have complied with the entry-into-force provisions of the treaty, it becomes binding under international law. TIEAs also authorize exchange of information between the United States and other countries for tax purposes. Like tax treaties, the provisions contained in TIEAs must be agreed upon by all parties to the agreement, and the terms and conditions governing exchange of information between the United States and other countries may differ from agreement to agreement. Unlike treaties, however, TIEAs are executive agreements that are signed by the President of the United States and do not require the advice and consent of the United States Senate. Also, while tax treaties cover a broad array of tax matters including exchange of information, the sole purpose of a TIEA is to facilitate the exchange of information. As with tax treaties, TIEAs become binding under international law once both countries have complied with the entry-into- force provisions. MLATs create a routine channel for obtaining a broad range of legal assistance for criminal matters. Like tax treaties, MLATs are treaties that require the advice and consent of the Senate. MLATs are negotiated by the DOJ in cooperation with the Department of State. Unlike the information obtained through tax treaties and TIEAs, which authorize the exchange of information for tax purposes, MLATs authorize the exchange of information for criminal matters, which can include criminal tax matters. Information shared through exchange of information and information about such exchanges is confidential and protected by domestic laws and provisions contained in tax treaties and other such agreements. The Internal Revenue Code (IRC) protects information exchanged under tax treaties and other relevant agreements from disclosure in the same manner as information obtained under domestic laws except in specific circumstances, such as to courts and administrative bodies. The identity of taxpayers, information about those taxpayers, and the identity of the countries involved in the exchange of information are protected from public disclosure. Tax treaties, TIEAs, and MLATs require that both the United States and its treaty partners designate and authorize an entity within their respective governments to interpret agreement provisions and disclose information. Tax treaties and TIEAs commonly refer to these entities as “competent authorities” or “taxation authorities,” while MLATs refer to these entities as “central authorities” or “competent authorities.” For information exchanges under tax treaties and TIEAs, the Secretary of the Treasury is the competent authority. For administrative purposes, the authority to exchange information with other tax authorities has been delegated to the IRS Deputy Commissioner (International), Large Business and International Division. All exchanges of information under an agreement involving the United States must occur through formal channels established between the United States and treaty partner competent or central authorities. Exchanges that occur within these formal channels restrict the disclosure of tax information. Also, some foreign governments may restrict foreign tax authorities from conducting investigative activities within their borders. Specific exchanges of information are those in which information is provided by one jurisdiction after it is requested by a partner jurisdiction in the context of a specific audit or investigation. From the U.S. perspective, requests for specific exchange of information are incoming or outgoing. When a treaty partner submits a request for specific exchange of information to the United States, these foreign initiated requests are called incoming requests for specific exchange of information. Conversely, when the United States initiates a request for specific exchange of information, that request is referred to as an outgoing request for specific exchange of information. Treaty partners may also exchange information with one another without a request. For example, tax administration officials may come across information about a taxpayer that officials believe could be of interest to tax administration and compliance officials in another country. The competent authority may then send this information to the treaty partner’s competent authority through what is referred to as a spontaneous exchange of information. Treaty partners may also exchange information with one another on a regular or routine basis, through what is referred to as an automatic exchange of information. Such exchanges typically involve the voluntary exchange of information on multiple taxpayers, and cumulatively can include millions of records. For example, a country may routinely provide information on domestic dividends paid to foreign citizens. Automatic exchanges of information are similar to spontaneous exchanges because they are not associated with a formal, one-time written request for information on a specific taxpayer or taxpayers. The United States also exchanges information with treaty partners through the Simultaneous Examination Program (SEP) and Simultaneous Criminal Investigation Program (SCIP). SEP/SCIP is used in situations where the United States and a treaty partner have common issues concerning the examination or investigation of a taxpayer or related taxpayers. Officials meet to discuss audit plans, information requirements, and other issues related to the examination or investigation. Treaties also allow broad-based discussions on matters such as tax administration trends, operating practices, and tax matters related to particular economic sectors. In the United States, these exchanges are referred to as industrywide exchanges of information. According to IRS officials, industrywide exchanges are rare and do not involve sharing information about specific taxpayers. While the provisions of most tax treaties and relevant agreements are broad enough to permit the exchanges of information previously described, specific exchanges of information are the only type of exchanges that the United States and its treaty partners are obligated or required to do under the terms of these agreements. Therefore, the administrative processes and much of the data presented in later sections of this report will focus on the activity occurring through specific exchanges of information. All administrative activities associated with processing incoming and outgoing requests for specific exchanges of information are handled by IRS Tax Attachés or EOI/OO staff located in one of the agency’s civilian posts of duty or in Washington, D.C. IRS has four overseas posts of duty located in Europe and Asia and one domestic duty post in Plantation, Florida. Each foreign duty post is headed by a Tax Attaché and the domestic post is headed by a Revenue Service Representative (RSR). Tax Attachés, RSRs, and EOI/OO headquarters staff are responsible for ensuring that the incoming and outgoing requests pertaining to their designated jurisdictions meet agreement standards and are processed in a timely manner. Requests for information involving Australia, Canada, France, Japan, and New Zealand are processed through EOI/OO in Washington, D.C. Incoming requests for information are assessed by the relevant Tax Attaché, RSR, or headquarters staff to ensure that they comport with the agreement in place with the country and with U.S. laws. All incoming requests must specifically include (1) the identity of the taxpayer about whom the information is being requested, (2) an itemized list of all the information requested, (3) a detailed explanation of relevance of the information requested and the taxpayer and issue being examined, and (4) an explanation of how the information that is being requested relates to the taxes or liabilities covered by the agreement authorizing the exchange. To ensure that these requirements are met, IRS personnel are required to complete a checklist for each incoming request for information. IRS officials stated that they do not fulfill requests for information they deem to be inadequately supported, and will frequently ask the relevant treaty partner to provide additional details to support the request. Incoming requests that meet the specified standards are typically forwarded to other business operating divisions within the IRS, which then assign the request to appropriate examiners or revenue agents to obtain the information. The information obtained to meet the request, or a determination that the requested information is not obtainable, is passed back to EOI/OO staff that then send the response to the requesting jurisdiction. A similar IRS process is used for U.S.-initiated, outgoing requests for information. EOI/OO receives requests for information from IRS or DOJ field staff, and passes the requests along to Tax Attaché, RSR, or EOI/OO staff. The staff evaluate the request to ensure that it includes all of the information that the treaty partner will need, including   general case information to establish that a tax examination or the name and address of the taxpayer under examination or investigation, when it is known; the type of tax and tax years (whether calendar or fiscal) involved; investigation is being conducted; the location of the information and an explanation as to why the information is believed to be in the country from which the information is being requested; the specific information needed and how the information is relevant to the investigation; the date by which the information is needed (can include statute of limitations or court dates); and  whether certified copies of the documents are required. Although the international examiner, revenue agent, revenue officer, investigator, or attorney in charge of the original examination or investigation summarizes these details using a template developed by EOI/OO, the formal written request is prepared and transmitted to the treaty partner by the Tax Attaché, RSR, or EOI/OO staff assigned to the request. An interactive graphic illustrating the administrative process for incoming and outgoing specific exchanges of information is shown in figure 1. Process details can also be found in appendix III. EOI/OO procedures require that the Tax Attaché, RSR, or EOI/OO staff responsible for processing the outgoing request provide status updates to the person requesting the information every 60 days. After the information has been secured, the response is reviewed by the Tax Attaché, RSR, or EOI/OO staff responsible for processing the request and forwarded to the requester. When a treaty partner supplies only part of the information requested, the IRS official responsible for processing the request follows up with the treaty partner until all information requested has been secured, or until all attempts by the treaty partner to secure the information have been exhausted and it is determined that the information does not exist or cannot be obtained from the country. The Tax Attaché, RSR, or EOI/OO staff working the case will forward information to the requester as it is received. As of April 30, 2011, the United States had 143 bilateral agreements authorizing exchange of information with 90 treaty partners. These agreements include 58 tax treaties, 27 TIEAs, 49 MLATs plus 7 partial MLATs, and 2 MLAAs in force between the United States and foreign jurisdictions. Another 12 instruments (7 tax treaties, 2 TIEAs, and 3 MLATs), all incorporating tax information exchange, were signed but were not in force as of that date. See appendix IV for a list of all income tax treaties, TIEAs, and MLATs in force as of April 30, 2011. Agreements signed but not in force are also listed in appendix IV. Of the 90 treaty partners, 7 were located in the Africa and Middle East regions, 12 in the Americas region, 18 in the Asia-Pacific region, 16 in the Caribbean region, and 37 in the Europe region. See figure 2 for an interactive graphic showing the different agreements that the United States has with its foreign partners, including a map for each agreement type. The number of bilateral instruments involving the United States does not match the number of tax information exchange relationships the United States has with foreign partners. For example, the United States has an MLAT with Uruguay, but that MLAT does not allow for assistance related to tax offenses unless they pertain to other crimes. Since the United States has no other instrument with Uruguay, tax information is not exchanged with that country except if the tax offense relates to the concealment of income obtained from another crime covered by the treaty. Therefore, Uruguay is not counted as an exchange partner. At the same time, multiple partners may be signatories to a single instrument. For example, the United States has an MLAT with four countries of the Eastern Caribbean States Organization, which provides a basis for its tax information exchange relationships with Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Grenada, and St. Lucia. The terms of an agreement may specifically include or exclude an associated territory. For example, the U.S.-Australia income tax treaty includes Australia’s territories of Norfolk Island, Christmas Island, Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Ashmore and Cartier Islands, and the Coral Sea Islands, while the U.S.-Denmark income tax treaty terms exclude the Faroe Islands and Greenland. A territory may also be included in one agreement and excluded in another. For example, the U.S.-United Kingdom MLAT extends to the Isle of Man (a dependency of the British Crown), but the territory is excluded from U.S.-United Kingdom income tax treaty. Since the United States also has a unique TIEA with the Isle of Man, it is counted as a separate foreign treaty partner. Tax information exchange relationships may be created by a single instrument or by multiple instruments of different types. Figure 3 shows the numbers of foreign treaty partners with which the United States has different combinations of agreements. All U.S. tax treaties (with information exchange provisions) and TIEAs currently in force obligate the United States and its treaty partners to exchange certain information upon request. In general, the text of tax treaties and TIEAs is written broadly, allowing for specific, automatic, and spontaneous tax information exchanges. Treasury Department officials told us that the starting point for new agreements and renegotiations is generally the most recent U.S. Model Tax Convention in use by the United States. Department of the Treasury officials also noted that the policies embodied in the most recent Model Tax Convention may evolve after the publication of the document, therefore changes in policy may not be documented until the publication of an updated model convention. The language of particular agreements and the terms governing each bilateral relationship can vary significantly from agreement to agreement, depending on when the agreement was negotiated and what the two countries agree to. Tax treaties with information exchange articles and TIEAs create, at a minimum, the obligation for exchange partners to respond to permitted requests for information. Fifty-eight treaties and 12 TIEAs explicitly describe a standard for the relevance or necessity of the information allowed to be requested. The standard found in the 2006 U.S. Model Tax Convention is that information that “may be relevant for carrying out the provisions of this Convention or of the domestic laws of the Contracting States concerning taxes of every kind” is to be exchanged upon request, which mirrors the statutory standard governing IRS’s authority to access records in a domestic context. Some agreements use a variation of the standard, however, such as “foreseeably relevant,” “as is necessary,” “as is relevant,” or “as is pertinent.” The “may be relevant” standard and the “forseeably relevant” standard—regarded as equivalent by the U.S. government—are considered a lower bar than some other standards. The 2006 U.S. Model Tax Convention technical explanation cites a U.S. Supreme Court case and states that the “may be” language “would not support a request in which a Contracting State simply asked for information regarding all bank accounts maintained by residents of that Contracting State in the other Contracting State, or even all accounts maintained by its residents with respect to a particular bank.” This means that, as a general rule, the United States does not make requests or respond to requests under these agreements where the names or other identifier (such as an account number) of potentially noncompliant persons are unknown. The information exchange provisions of TIEAs and bilateral tax treaties concluded by the United States require that a request for information satisfy a standard of relevance in order to be considered a valid request under the agreement. One of the requirements of the relevance standard is that requests contain “the identity of the person(s) under examination or investigation.” During interviews, officials of the IRS and Treasury Department explained that the recent global recognition of the importance of full exchange of information for tax purposes has led countries to refine information exchange practices to ensure that exchange will occur to the widest appropriate extent, and that these topics are under active discussion at international standard-setting bodies such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information that focuses on exchange of information issues. Accordingly, a valid request for information will not always require the name of particular taxpayers under examination or investigation. In addition, the Treasury Department’s Technical Explanation of the 2009 protocol amending the 1996 bilateral tax treaty with Switzerland states the following: “In a typical case, information sufficient to identify the person under examination or investigation would include a name, and to the extent known, an address, account number or similar identifying information.” Moreover, IRS and Treasury Department officials explained that the template TIEA text used by the United States was changed in January 2011 to state that a request for information must contain “the identity of the person or ascertainable group or category of persons under examination or investigation.” It is mutually understood that there can be circumstances in which there is information sufficient to identify the person under examination or investigation even though the requesting state cannot provide a name. At the time that this study was conducted, however, the Internal Revenue Manual had not been correspondingly updated to reflect this clearer articulation of policy. Some arrangements contain provisions that outline particular types of information-gathering measures beyond specific exchanges upon request. For example, the U.S.–Austria treaty explicitly states that “states shall spontaneously or upon request exchange information” and that “states may agree on information to be furnished on a regular basis.” Several other tax treaties state that exchange of information shall be on a “routine basis” or “upon request” with reference to particular cases. Several TIEAs specifically provide for automatic and spontaneous exchange of information in addition to providing information upon request. The presence of automatic or spontaneous exchange language in an agreement does not mean such exchanges necessarily happen, and the absence of such language does not mean automatic or spontaneous exchanges do not occur, as treaties and TIEAs are generally broad enough to permit such types of exchange. Certain limits to specific information exchange are common to most tax treaties and TIEAs. Specifically, countries are not obligated to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws and administrative practice of either contracting state (47 out of 67 tax treaties and 24 out of 27 TIEAs); supply information that contracting states would not be able to obtain under their own laws (51 out of 67 tax treaties and 26 out of 27 TIEAs); or  provide information that would disclose trade, business, industrial, commercial, or professional secret or trade-process or information that would be contrary to public policy of either contracting state (46 out of 67 tax treaties and 26 out of 27 TIEAs). Additionally, all tax treaties with information exchange articles and all TIEAs contain disclosure provisions that protect the confidentiality of the information exchanged. Forty tax treaties and 12 TIEAs also state that an exchange partner may not decline a request simply because it may not need that information for its own purposes. These agreements also contain provisions that obligate the requested state to use its information- gathering measures to obtain the requested information even though it may not need that information for its own purposes. While tax treaties and TIEAs share many common principles, many also contain unique features. For example, information exchange arrangements can cover different types of tax information. Twenty-seven tax treaties permit exchange of information in any case concerning U.S. federal taxes, 21 limit information exchange to cases concerning taxes described under the general scope of the convention, and 10 limit exchange to cases concerning specific taxes or apply other restrictions. All U.S. TIEAs cover exchanges on all U.S. federal taxes, although most specifically state that they do not cover state and local taxes or taxes levied by political subdivisions. Eighteen treaties and 23 TIEAs also expressly provide that an exchange partner cannot decline to share information because it is held by a bank or other financial institution, though the absence of such a provision does not mean that a treaty partner will decline to share such information. Five treaties specify that the requested state will allow representatives to interview individuals and examine evidence in the requested state, while 18 TIEAs include provisions to this effect. Two treaties—with Canada and the Netherlands—have provisions within their exchange of information articles that specifically permit disclosure of information to an arbitration board. One agreement—the Panama TIEA—has a provision that “parties may exchange technical know-how, develop new audit techniques, identify new areas of non-compliance, and jointly study non-compliance areas.” The focus of information exchange under MLATs is different than tax treaties and TIEAs. Assistance under a MLAT, including on tax matters, is generally only available for the investigation, prosecution, and prevention of criminal offenses or for proceedings related to criminal matters. MLATs may also explicitly state that no dual-criminality requirement exists for that MLAT. Dual-criminality is the requirement that the conduct in question be a crime under the domestic laws of both the requesting and requested state for assistance to be provided. In 25 MLATs there is a limited dual- criminality requirement, such as for any searches, seizures, or forfeitures. Where a dual-criminality requirement exists, whether or not assistance can be provided on tax matters depends, in part, on the domestic law of the other jurisdiction. MLATs also commonly provide grounds on which a request for information may be refused, but these grounds for refusal vary among agreements. Appendix V provides detailed information on the contents of each of the agreements. IRS provided us with the number of new incoming and outgoing specific information exchange requests for the years 2006 through 2010. The number of incoming requests fluctuated over the 5-year period, ranging from a high of 1,173 requests in 2006 to a low of 797 in 2008. The number of outgoing requests also fluctuated during this period and ranged from a high of 236 requests in 2008 to a low of 165 in 2010. Table 1 provides the number of new incoming and outgoing requests for each year. Requests in this table include both closed requests and requests that were still open at the end of 2010. The number of outgoing specific requests does not equal IRS’s international enforcement presence or the number of U.S. taxpayers who have been the subject of IRS examinations. According to IRS and Treasury officials, one reason for this is that a single specific request for information from a treaty partner can involve multiple taxpayers. Also, an outgoing information exchange request typically comes after IRS has tried other means to obtain information, including a review of information received from treaty partners through automatic exchanges (approximately 2.1 million records about U.S. taxpayers are received annually by IRS, as discussed below) or through obtaining the information directly from the taxpayer or from third parties using other enforcement tools. Between 2006 and 2010, the IRS closed 5,111 incoming and outgoing requests involving 75 treaty partners. There were 4,217 foreign-initiated incoming requests, and 894 U.S.-initiated outgoing requests closed during this period. The number of closed incoming and outgoing specific requests between the United States and a single treaty partner varied widely, ranging from five treaty partners that had just 1 incoming or outgoing request during the period to a single treaty partner with 711 requests. Also, request activity is concentrated in a small number of countries, with the 10 most-active countries representing roughly 68 percent of all requests. IRS provided us with data about the type of information that was requested in 3,569 exchanges (2,971 incoming requests and 598 outgoing requests between 2006 and 2009). Corporate records, tax return data, and third-party interviews constituted about 78 percent of closed incoming requests for which we received data on information type. For outgoing requests, corporate records, tax return data, and bank records accounted for 77 percent of exchanges. Requests for bank records made up 6 percent of incoming exchange requests, but 21 percent of outgoing requests. Conversely, requests for third-party interviews were 20 percent of incoming requests, but only 6 percent of outgoing requests. Figure 4 shows incoming and outgoing requests by type of information that was requested for the 3,569 exchanges for which we received data on information type. IRS also receives and provides information through automatic and spontaneous exchanges. According to EOI/OO officials, the United States is currently engaged in the automatic exchange of information with 25 countries, transmitting approximately 2.5 million records annually to other countries and receiving approximately 2.1 million records from its treaty partners. Through automatic exchange of information, the United States provides some treaty partners with information on taxable income and federal tax withholding related to certain types of income received by U.S. nonresidents. IRS officials told us that the information that the United States receives through automatic exchange of information varies by treaty partner and includes data on wages, interest, dividends, and other forms of income. Regarding spontaneous exchanges, the United States sends about 10 spontaneous exchanges of information to its treaty partners annually, according to EOI/OO officials. They also said that the United States receives around 300 spontaneous exchanges of information annually, mostly from developed countries with sophisticated tax systems, and that the number fluctuates widely from year to year. IRS officials stated that information the IRS receives spontaneously is processed by IRS Tax Attachés or EOI/OO staff located in one of the agency’s posts of duty or in Washington, D.C. If the taxpayer is the subject of an ongoing examination, the information is forwarded to the appropriate IRS staff for possible action. If the taxpayer is not the subject of an ongoing examination, the information is evaluated to determine if there are tax consequences and whether or not a recommendation for action should be made to the appropriate field staff. Although Tax Attachés and EOI/OO staff evaluate and forward information to the appropriate field offices, agency officials stated that each office has its own business plan which may not include examinations based on spontaneously provided information. Consequently, these examinations would be worked on to the extent local offices consider them to be better opportunities than other cases they would work on using their discretionary audit authority. Nevertheless, officials noted that spontaneous exchanges have led to some significant tax assessments, including several of $100,000 or more. Taxpayers affected by spontaneous exchanges have at times alerted IRS to others who turned out to have significant additional tax liabilities. In at least some cases, IRS would not have known about the noncompliance in the absence of the spontaneously shared information. The amount of time that the United States and its treaty partners took to close specific requests for information, or processing time, varied widely for requests made between 2006 and 2010. During this period of time, the number of calendar days to close both incoming and outgoing requests for information ranged from requests opened and closed on the same day to one request that took 1,442 calendar days to close. The United States tended to respond to requests for information faster than treaty partners responded to outgoing requests from the United States. The median number of calendar days to close U.S.-initiated outgoing requests was 149, compared to 108 calendar days for incoming requests. To identify factors that could explain the differences in processing time, we considered the possibility that the type of information requested may be associated with the length of time taken to close the request. We found that, overall, processing times varied by the type of information requested. For all incoming and outgoing requests, processing times ranged from a median of 152 calendar days for requests involving bank records to 31 days for public records. Outgoing requests made by the United States to its treaty partners took longer to close than incoming requests for the same types of information for nearly all categories of information requested. Table 2 provides the processing times for all of the 3,569 requests where the type of information requested was recorded. Because request processing times for different information types varies, we developed a statistical model to estimate the amount of time that a new request will take to close, holding the type of information requested constant. When controlling for information type, incoming requests to the United States are processed an estimated 17 percent faster on average than outgoing requests from the United States to its treaty partners. As shown in figure 5, our model estimates that most information exchange requests are likely to close about 50 to 200 days after being opened, but some can take much longer. We also explored whether certain treaty partner characteristics were associated with processing times for incoming and outgoing requests. Assuming that treaty partners who share characteristics would respond to requests similarly, we developed five groups of treaty partners that shared a particular set of characteristics. These characteristics included (1) the type of agreements authorizing exchange of information with the United States, (2) the existence of active automatic exchange of information with the United States, (3) membership in the OECD, (4) implementation of OECD standards for improving transparency and establishing effective exchange of information in tax matters, and (5) trade volume with the United States. Descriptions of the treaty partner groupings that we identified and our hypotheses concerning potential factors that could explain differences in request processing times are summarized as follows:  Agreement type—Tax treaties have multiple purposes, including preventing double taxation and improving tax-law compliance through information exchange, while TIEAs are focused primarily on the exchange of information. Because a TIEA represents a particular commitment to information exchange, we considered the possibility that information exchange requests involving TIEA partners may be addressed more quickly than exchanges with partners with whom the United States does not have a TIEA.  Treaty partners that actively engage in automatic exchange of information with the United States—As noted previously, the United States engages in automatic information exchange with 25 partners. The presence of an active automatic exchange of information arrangement with these countries signifies an agreement between the United States and its treaty partners to exchange information on a routine basis. Given the potential for IRS to leverage relationships established through the automatic exchange of information and the nature of information exchanged, we considered the possibility that specific-exchange requests may be addressed more quickly between the United States and these partners than with partners with whom the United States does not currently share information automatically. We also considered the possibility that automatic exchange may obviate the need for requests for information that IRS or treaty partner tax authorities have readily on hand, leaving a larger percentage of requests for information that take more time to obtain.  OECD Members and Nonmembers—OECD member countries have established and committed to principles and standards of transparency and information exchange for tax purposes, as reflected in the 2002 OECD Model Agreement on Exchange of Information on Tax Matters and Article 26 of the OECD Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital. We considered the possibility that these shared principles related to information exchange, including standards for information availability and access, have contributed to faster request processing times between the United States and treaty partners who are members of the OECD than with partners who are not members of the OECD.  Trade Volume—We considered the possibility that higher trade volume with the United States (imports and exports) could reduce the amount of time that it takes to address requests for information. Higher volumes of cross-border trade can present more opportunities for taxpayers in the United States and abroad to generate foreign- source income, and could indicate an established relationship between the United States and a treaty partner. Given these factors, we examined differences in specific exchange–request processing times between the top 25 U.S. trade partners (among U.S. treaty partners) and all other treaty partners.  Treaty Partner Implementation of International Tax Standards Related to Transparency and Effective Exchange of Information—The international tax standards for improving transparency and establishing effective exchange of information in tax matters were developed by the OECD in cooperation with non-OECD countries and have been endorsed by other organizations in the international community (the United Nations and the Group of Twenty Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors). The standards require jurisdictions to exchange information on-request in all tax matters for the purposes of administering and enforcing domestic tax law without regard to domestic tax interest or bank secrecy. We considered the possibility that substantial implementation of these standards could contribute to faster request processing times, comparing request processing times for treaty partners that had substantially implemented these standards with those that either had not substantially implemented these standards or were not included in the OECD review of transparency and exchange of information standards as of 2006 (the beginning of our evaluation period). Using statistical models, and controlling for information type, we compared how processing times for both incoming and outgoing requests differed across the previously described treaty partner groupings. Table 3, provides estimates of the percentage difference in average processing time between incoming and outgoing requests, adjusted for information type, along with 95 percent confidence intervals. After adjusting for the type of information requested, we found no statistically significant difference in processing times for outgoing requests. For example, our model estimates that countries with TIEAs responded to outgoing U.S. requests 5 percent faster than countries without TIEAs, but the difference could range between 14 percent slower and 28 percent faster. This indicates that there is no observable difference between countries with and without TIEAs. The relatively smaller number of outgoing requests tends to increase our uncertainty about the differences across groupings. Fewer opportunities to observe the processing of requests typically produces larger confidence intervals. Our analysis of the time it takes the United States to respond to incoming requests found that, adjusted for information type, statistically meaningful differences were present among the country groupings, as shown in table 3. The United States responds to information requests from treaty partners with TIEAs significantly faster than to countries without TIEAs, suggesting that the focus on tax information exchange represented by the signing of a TIEA may make a difference in processing time. Response times by the United States for requests from countries with which automatic information exchange is taking place are significantly slower than response times for incoming requests from countries with which automatic information exchange is not taking place. This suggests that automatic exchange may be taking care of simpler requests leaving a larger body of more complicated, time-consuming requests to be handled through specific exchange cases. The United States also responds more quickly to requests from OECD members than to other countries, suggesting that the explicit commitment and common standards between the United States and these countries may make a difference in the time it takes the United States to respond to requests from OECD countries. For countries that have implemented the international transparency and information exchange standards, we considered the possibility that response times would be faster for countries that have implemented the standards, but instead we found that the U.S. response time to incoming requests from these countries was between 25 and 57 percent slower than the U.S. response to countries that had either not substantially implemented the standards or had not been evaluated. In analyzing the time it takes the United States to respond to requests from the top 25 U.S. trading partners, we considered the possibility that higher volumes of trade would indicate more established relationships between the United States and these countries and faster response times. Instead we found that the U.S. response time to requests from top trading partners was significantly slower. U.S. response times were between 63 and 96 percent slower for requests from top trading partners than from other countries, after adjusting for information type. The unavailability of certain data to us for this analysis, particularly the details of specific requests, means that we are unable to analyze why the U.S. response time to requests might be slower for some types of countries. While the factors that we analyzed may contribute to differences in processing times among groups of treaty partners, other factors that we cannot analyze may be at work. For example, if a single country involved in a large portion of exchange activity had especially short or long response times, the presence of that country in any of the treaty partner groupings we analyzed could have a disproportionate influence on the estimated differences. Also, with respect to the processing time differences across the treaty partner groupings, IRS officials noted that country-specific factors, such as the sophistication or complexity of a country’s tax rules and the existence of administrative arrangements such as automatic exchange arrangements, can influence the nature of the information requested and the amount of time required to obtain it. For example, developed countries (like many major U.S. trade partners) tend to have tax systems that are administered through a complex set of tax rules. Under these rules, taxpayers can use intricate tax avoidance or tax evasion strategies, which can lead to examinations of elaborate business relationships, involving one or more entities under the direct or indirect control of a taxpayer. Examinations of this nature can require large volumes of detailed information that can be difficult and time-consuming to obtain. Conversely, the information needs for countries with less complex tax rules tend to be straightforward, uncomplicated and require much less processing time for information requests. Similarly, officials stated that processing times for requests from countries with which the United States exchanges information automatically may take longer because the information requested is more complex and difficult to obtain than the information that is exchanged on a routine basis. Similar to processing time across groups of treaty partners, the time required to process a specific exchange varies by individual request. According to IRS and DOJ officials that we interviewed, some of these differences are attributable to factors such as the complexity of the information requested, whether requested information is already on-hand at the tax authority, and whether legal processes must be invoked to secure the requested information. Examples of factors raised in the interviews that can affect the time it takes another country to respond to U.S.-initiated requests are listed below. Officials we spoke to noted that some of these factors may also influence the length of time it takes the United States to respond to requests from other countries.  Requests for complex information take more time to fulfill than requests for less complex information.  Narrowly focused requests for information already reported to the tax authority of the treaty partner are usually quickly addressed because that information is readily available, while requests that require the government agency responding to the request to go to third-party record keepers often take more time and effort to address.  Requests that appear to officials in the foreign country to be inadequately supported or to not demonstrate “foreseeable relevance” to a case can require extensive follow-up between IRS and the exchange partner.  The laws of other jurisdictions have a big influence on the time required to fulfill a request. For instance, some jurisdictions’ bank secrecy rules involve a lengthy court process and possibly a petition to a national banking commission to secure information. Officials also told us that some jurisdictions may give priority to criminal matters, and may view tax matters as civil (as opposed to criminal) in nature.  The organizational structure of a partner jurisdiction’s exchange office can also influence response times, such as when requests are passed through multiple employees and levels of review.  Translation issues can also slow down the amount of time it takes to secure requests if officials in the requested country have to translate the request into or from English before it can be assigned to appropriate staff. The volume of information exchange activity, especially outgoing requests from the United States, can be influenced by the time it takes for partner countries to respond to requests. We were told that officials consider the costs and benefits of making information exchange requests, including their expectations about the amount of time it will take the treaty partner to respond to the request. Over time, the IRS field staff and others who make requests for foreign information become more willing to request information where they expect to get the information they need in a timely manner. This is particularly true in cases where information has to be secured quickly because, for example, the statute of limitations period is coming to a close. The relationship between competent authorities of the United States and a treaty partner can also influence the volume of exchange activity. An IRS official described a situation in which a country that received information from the United States subsequently made that information public, in violation of the agreement confidentiality provisions. When an IRS field staff person inquired about making a new request to the country that had not protected U.S. taxpayer privacy, he was told that his request could not be processed at that time because the disclosure issue had not yet been resolved. In another case, an official was informed by an EOI/OO point of contact that one of several requested countries was unlikely to comply with the request and therefore the request was not pursued with that country. GAO guidance on internal controls and numerous other GAO reports say that reliable performance information is a critical tool for managers to use to understand how well processes are working and to identify opportunities to improve those processes. Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA) guidance also states that balanced performance information can help managers measure or monitor program accomplishments and progress toward pre-established goals. The collection of balanced performance information should, amongst other things, address both program outputs (product or service delivery) and program outcomes (results of the product or services delivered). Currently, the IRS collects performance information on the specific exchange of information program in two ways. For IRS, much of the performance information related to exchange of information is collected through an electronic information system called the Issue Management System (IMS). Implemented in October of 2009, IMS is a consolidated database that combines case-management data from multiple programs within the Large Business and International (LB&I) division to (1) support revenue agents in remote locations; (2) improve issue identification; (3) improve information tracking, reporting and sharing; and (4) capture data in support of performance assessment. According to EOI/OO officials, the information exchange–related data collected in IMS is used primarily as an inventory-management tool. They said that managers use the system routinely as new cases come in to make decisions about dividing up the new exchange request cases among the staff based on the staff members’ inventory of open cases. The information collected in IMS also allows managers to monitor program output information such as how much program activity is occurring and the length of time it takes to close requests. EOI/OO, however, does not currently use the system to collect performance outcome information such as whether IRS actually secured information from or was successful in providing information to U.S. treaty partners. An earlier system used by EOI/OO had a data field for noting that the requested information was provided. Managers told us, however, that it was not useful because it had a default setting of “no,” meaning that negative responses included cases where the staff person entering the data did not make any entry in that field. While the IMS system now in use does not include a field for noting if the requested information was obtained, IRS has deemed the collection of such information worthwhile in the past. Because the primary obligation of the competent authority is to exchange information for tax purposes, collecting information on the extent to which requests are fulfilled would provide managers with valuable information on program outputs. IRS officials also said that they are not currently capturing or analyzing data on the type of information being requested in their information system which, as our analysis shows, may influence the time that it takes the United States and its treaty partners to respond to requests. Consequently, IRS managers may be missing opportunities to determine why certain countries are much slower than other countries to respond to some kinds of information requests and possibly take steps to work with those countries to improve response times. For instance, IRS might need to explain its requests differently for some countries or may have a basis for encouraging another country to streamline inefficient processes. IRS also collects data on program performance from agency personnel who make requests for information through the Foreign Information Assistance Request Appraisal Questionnaire, though only rarely. The Appraisal Questionnaire includes a series of questions about the quality of their interactions with EOI/OO staff, usefulness of the information received, and other program outcomes. However, EOI/OO officials told us that fewer than 25 questionnaires were returned between 2006 and 2010. They said that the questionnaires are distributed to program customers with the bundle of information obtained by EOI/OO from the treaty partner, but that they do not usually follow up with customers when questionnaires are not returned. In order to get a sense of how IRS and DOJ field staff perceive the process of obtaining information from other countries, we interviewed 27 such staff who made specific requests for foreign information in recent years. They described a variety of experiences with the process. Some of these officials told us about problems they encountered or ways that the program could have better helped their audits, investigations, collections activities, or court cases. For example, several said that they would have liked to have known more about the program and its operations prior to preparing their requests. Given the amount of time required to prepare information requests, other program users expressed interest in receiving more up-front guidance on how to prepare a request. Others expressed concern about the length of time required to obtain the information requested or the completeness and utility of the information received. Several of the staff we interviewed also noted how helpful and informative the Tax Attachés, RSRs, or EOI/OO staff that facilitated the process were. Though collected infrequently, the use of the Appraisal Questionnaire by EOI/OO demonstrates that IRS has judged the collection of such performance information to be worthwhile. If EOI/OO routinely obtained information on, for example, the usefulness of its instructions to field staff or the timeliness of responses, managers would know how common such concerns may be among program users and might be able improve the exchange of information. Furthermore, currently available data do not provide important outcome information on the program as a whole, such as the usefulness of specific exchanges to IRS tax compliance enforcement efforts. Such information could help identify opportunities to, for instance, better train IRS personnel on when and how to request foreign information and what types of information are most useful in resolving cases. To the extent that IRS would like to minimize the cost of collecting and analyzing information on program outcomes, the agency could consider using a sampling approach that would allow program managers to generalize the information collected from a smaller population of program users to the overall population of program users. The United States has developed a broad information exchange network. While agreements have many similar features, the specific parameters under which information can be exchanged are unique to the legal and administrative arrangements negotiated by the United States and each separate treaty partner. The volume of information exchanges under these agreements and the amount of time required to process those exchanges varies, and may be influenced by several factors. Although the IRS collects data on exchanges between the United States and its treaty partners, the agency does not assemble or make use of information such as the extent to which requests for information are fulfilled or the type of information requested, and does not consistently collect customer feedback. Without reliable and consistent data like these, IRS managers may be missing opportunities to identify and address possible problems with the information exchange program and improvements that could make the program more successful. Such information could tell program managers how well IRS is meeting its obligations as the U.S. competent authority and whether administrative processes and procedures need to be examined for ways to improve the transmission of information. Better performance information could not only help improve administrative operations, but could also enhance the usefulness of this important tax law enforcement tool. To identify opportunities to improve the administrative processes and procedures that the IRS uses to exchange information between the United States and its treaty partners, we recommend that the Commissioner of Internal Revenue determine the key types of information that exchange program managers could use to ensure the program is working as well as possible. The commissioner should specifically require the collection of (1) consistent and accurate data on specific tax information exchange cases, such as the extent to which requests for information are satisfied and the type of information requested, and (2) feedback from information exchange program users on how well the program is working and how it might be improved. We provided a draft of this report to the Secretary of the Treasury, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, the Secretary of State, and the Assistant Attorney General for Administration Department of Justice. We received written comments from the Deputy Commissioner for Services and Enforcement of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS); his comments are reprinted in appendix VII. The Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of State, and the Assistant Attorney General for Administration Department of Justice did not provide written comments. The Department of the Treasury, IRS, and the Department of Justice also suggested several technical changes to the report, which we incorporated where appropriate. The IRS agreed with our observation that opportunities exist to improve information exchange between the United States and its treaty partners through improved collection of performance data and information exchange program user feedback. The IRS also agreed with our recommendation that the IRS identify key types of information that exchange program managers could use to ensure that the program is working as well as possible, including consistent and accurate data on specific tax information exchange cases and feedback from information exchange program users. As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the report date. At that time, we will send copies to the appropriate congressional committees, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of State, the Attorney General of the United States, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, and other interested parties. This report will also be available at no charge on GAO’s website at http://www.gao.gov.

Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. Key contributors to this report are listed in appendix VIII. This report (1) identifies all bilateral income tax treaties, Tax Information Exchange Agreements (TIEA), and Mutual Legal Assistance Treaties (MLAT) between the United States and other countries in force, proposed, or signed as of April 30, 2011, and describes the legal framework and administrative processes that the United States uses to exchange information with its treaty partners; (2) describes the volume and types of information exchanged between the United States and its treaty partners and the time to process requests for information; and (3) identifies opportunities to improve the effectiveness of current U.S. information exchange processes and procedures. To develop a comprehensive list of countries with which the United States has entered income tax treaties, TIEAs, and MLATs, we examined information obtained from a combination of government and commercially available data to identify agreements that were in force, proposed, or signed as of April 30, 2011. Specifically, we relied on information obtained from Treaties in Force—a compilation of international agreements between the United States and other countries published by the U.S. Department of State, U.S. Tax Treaties (Publication 901) published by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the Government Printing Office (GPO) website, Thomson Reuters’s Checkpoint, and Lexis Nexis. For each agreement, we identified the name of the country with which the United States entered into the agreement, the year the agreement was signed, the year the agreement entered into force, and the date the provisions of the agreement were made effective (when provided). For tax treaties, we identified the article within the agreement authorizing information exchange. Where applicable, we also recorded the year of any revisions made to the original agreement, and the effective date of the most recent protocol or other such amendment to the agreement. We consulted with knowledgeable officials at the U.S. Department of State, Department of the Treasury, IRS, and the Department of Justice to ensure the completeness and accuracy of the consolidated list we developed from these sources. To describe the legal framework for information exchange, including the types of information covered and limitations on information, we systematically analyzed the information exchange provisions contained in all of the income tax treaties, TIEAs, and MLATs that were in force as of April 30, 2011. For income tax treaties, we compared the information exchange provisions in each agreement to key information exchange provisions contained in the 2006 U.S. Model Tax Convention of November 15, 2006. We conducted similar content analysis for TIEAs, by analyzing similarities and differences in the information exchange provisions across the agreements identified. We analyzed each MLAT to determine the extent to which the agreements permit assistance in investigations involving criminal tax matters and limitations on such assistance. To describe the administrative processes that the United States uses to exchange information with its treaty partners, we reviewed guidance contained in policy documents such as the IRS Internal Revenue Manual and the Department of Justice Criminal Tax Manual. From this guidance we also identified the general procedures that the United States uses to exchange information, including the U.S. departments and agencies involved and paperwork requirements. We also examined user guides for the information systems used to collect data on information requests. We interviewed knowledgeable officials in the Department of the Treasury, the IRS, and the Department of Justice to further understand the role of these agencies and any process or procedural requirements for administering information exchange between the United States and its treaty partners. To develop summary information on the volume of incoming and outgoing requests for information, processing times, and other characteristics of requested exchanges under the authority of income tax treaties and TIEAs, we analyzed IRS data on all exchange requests that were initiated and completed between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2010. The information exchange data provided by IRS and discussed in this report also included exchanges made under estate tax treaties, although IRS and Department of the Treasury officials told us that information exchange under these treaties is rare. The information developed only applies to exchanges occurring during this period and cannot be generalized to exchanges occurring outside of this time frame. Because the information exchanged under income tax treaty, TIEA, and MLAT authority is protected by confidentiality provisions contained in the agreements and by U.S. domestic law, we did not have access to data that could reveal the identity of individual taxpayers or individual treaty partners. Therefore, we relied on anonymous country codes assigned by IRS and treaty partner groupings that we developed in consultation with IRS to examine the exchange activity between the United States and its treaty partners. To assess the reliability of these data, we interviewed knowledgeable officials, reviewed system documentation, and examined the data for obvious errors. We determined the data to be sufficiently reliable for this report. We used statistical models to estimate the difference in closing times among various groups of requests, holding constant the type of information requested. These “duration” models apply only to requests initiated and closed between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2010. Our data exclude requests that were open at the end of this period, “and IRS could not provide the type of information requested for 1,542 out of 5,111 requests. Our models assumed that most requests close quickly, while a few requests remain open for longer periods of time. This assumption was reasonable, given the actual number of requests that closed at various times in this period. The models made different assumptions about how the mean closing time varied across the groups of interest, such as incoming versus outgoing requests for various types of information. This allowed us to estimate the proportional differences across groups while holding constant the type of information requested, along with the statistical certainty of the estimates. To identify ways in which the United States can enhance the effectiveness of its administrative practices for sharing information with foreign jurisdictions, we interviewed and collected information from IRS, Justice, and OECD officials and assessed the information obtained against criteria contained in GAO guidance on internal controls and performance measurement. IRS and the Department of Justice provided us the names of officials who had requested information in 2009 and 2010 for use in criminal and civil investigations or cases, and we interviewed 6 IRS and 12 DOJ officials identified in this way. We also selected 11 additional IRS officials to interview using a nonprobability sampling technique, through which we randomly selected at least one exchange case from each of the exchange groupings discussed in the section of this report titled “Volume, Type and Processing Time of Requests Varies,” and asked EOI/OO to provide contact information for the officials involved in the cases. The staff person responsible for two of our randomly selected cases was also on the list of names that IRS had previously provided to us. The total number of IRS and DOJ staff who had made information exchange requests that we interviewed was 27. The information obtained through these interviews is only applicable to the experiences of the officials interviewed and cannot be generalized to the entire population of IRS and DOJ officials making requests through the IRS-specific exchange of information program. We conducted this audit from January 2010 to September 2011 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. The provisions of Article 26 of the 2006 U.S. Model Tax Convention serve as the basis for information exchange in new tax treaties. The article’s provisions are reprinted below.

GAO was asked to (1) identify and describe all income tax treaties and other such agreements between the United States and other countries, (2) describe the volume of exchange activity, types of information exchanged between the United States and its treaty partners, and request processing times, and (3) identify opportunities to improve the effectiveness of current U.S. information exchange processes and procedures. GAO analyzed agreement documents, IRS data on information exchanges, and interviewed program officials and the users of exchanged information. Treaties and other agreements authorizing information exchange provide tax authorities in the United States and abroad with a useful tax law enforcement tool. As of April 30, 2011, the United States had such agreements in force with 90 foreign jurisdictions. Agreements have many similar features, but the bounds within which information can be exchanged are unique to the legal and administrative arrangements agreed to by the United States and each partner. Between 2006 and 2010, 5,111 requests for information to or from the United States and 75 foreign jurisdictions were completed; 4,217 were incoming requests for information such as tax returns or corporate records and 894 were outgoing requests from the United States. IRS's enforcement presence also relies on several other methods to obtain relevant information, including a mechanism which yields about 2.1 million records annually from treaty partners. GAO estimates that most requests close about 50 to 200 days after being opened, but some take much longer. The time it takes to close requests can be influenced by factors such as the complexity of the requested information and the legal system of the treaty partner. GAO analysis of IRS data shows that the United States takes more time to close incoming requests for some groups of countries than others. Although IRS collects data on exchanges between the United States and its treaty partners, the agency does not consistently collect or analyze performance information, such as the type of information requested, whether the information was collected successfully, or feedback from staff making the requests about the usefulness of the information or their views on the process for obtaining it. Collecting this information could help program managers assess how well the IRS is managing the information exchange process, and whether changes to administrative processes and procedures could improve the exchange of information between the United States and its treaty partners. GAO recommends that the Commissioner of Internal Revenue determine the key types of performance information that exchange program managers could use to ensure the program is working as well as possible. Specifically, the Commissioner should require the collection of (1) consistent and accurate data on specific tax information exchange cases and (2) feedback from program users on a routine basis as part of regular program operations. IRS concurred with our recommendation. The agencies discussed in this report also suggested technical changes to a draft of this report which GAO incorporated as appropriate."}

With the increased number of aircraft hijackings that occurred during the late 1960s and early 1970s, the government directed that all passengers and their carry-on baggage be screened for dangerous items before boarding. During the 1990s, as the volume of passengers requiring screening and the awareness of the terrorist threat against the United States increased, a computerized system was proposed to help identify passengers posing the greatest risk to a flight so that they could receive additional security attention. In 1994, the Federal Aviation Administration provided funding to a major U.S. air carrier to develop such a computerized system for prescreening passengers. This system, known as CAPPS, was implemented in 1998 and is in use today by most U.S. air carriers. CAPPS enables air carriers to separate passengers into two categories: those who require additional security scrutiny—termed “selectees”—and those who do not. When a passenger checks in at the airport, the air carrier’s reservation system uses certain information from the passenger’s itinerary for analysis in CAPPS. This analysis checks the passenger’s information against the CAPPS rules and also against a government supplied watch list that contains the names of known or suspected terrorists. A passenger’s selectee status is then transmitted to the check-in counter where a code is printed on the boarding pass of any passenger determined to require additional screening, and at the screening checkpoint, passengers who are selectees are subject to additional security measures. CAPPS currently prescreens an estimated 99 percent of passengers on domestic flights. Certain air carriers manually prescreen their passengers using CAPPS criteria. The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, however, became the impetus for change in both the way in which passengers are screened and the entities responsible for conducting the screening. The Aviation and Transportation Security Act, passed in November 2001, directed that a computer-assisted passenger prescreening system be used to evaluate all passengers before they board an aircraft. The act also directed the creation of TSA within the Department of Transportation. TSA assumed responsibility for civil aviation security from the Federal Aviation Administration, and for passenger and baggage screening from the air carriers. Within TSA, the Office of National Risk Assessment was charged with developing CAPPS II in response to the act’s requirement. TSA plans to begin operating CAPPS II with a single air carrier and then expand to other air carriers at dates to be determined. When fully developed, CAPPS II is envisioned to operate in the following manner. 1. During the reservation process, the passenger will be required to provide four pieces of information: full name, home address, home phone number, and date of birth. This information will be entered into the Passenger Name Record and sent electronically to CAPPS II. 2. At a specified time prior to the flight, CAPPS II will request an identity authentication from commercial data provider(s), meaning that a passenger’s personal information—full name, home address, home phone number, and date of birth—will be verified by information in the databases of one or more of the commercial data providers. Next, rather than the commercial data provider sending back any personal information, an identity authentication score will be returned to CAPPS II that identifies the level of confidence that the data provided by the passenger is authentic. 3. After obtaining passengers’ authentication scores, CAPPS II will conduct risk assessments using government databases, including classified and intelligence data, to generate a risk score categorizing the passenger as an acceptable risk, unknown risk, or unacceptable risk. 4. When the passenger checks in for a flight at the airport, the passenger’s risk category will be transmitted from CAPPS II to the check-in counter. Passengers who are an acceptable or unknown risk will receive a boarding pass encoded with their risk level so that checkpoint screeners will know the level of scrutiny required. If the passenger’s risk is determined to be unknown, additional security checks will be required. Passengers whose risk assessment is determined to be unacceptable will not be issued boarding passes; instead, appropriate law enforcement agencies will be notified. Law enforcement officials will determine whether the individual will be allowed to proceed through the screening checkpoint or if other actions are warranted, such as additional questioning of the passenger or taking the passenger into custody. Figure 1 displays the steps in the CAPPS II passenger prescreening process. TSA program officials and TSA’s draft Business Case for CAPPS II state that the system will provide significant improvements over the existing CAPPS. For example, most air carriers currently use CAPPS within their reservation systems to assess passengers for possible risk, while CAPPS II will be owned and operated by the federal government. TSA believes that this consolidation will allow for more effective and efficient use of up-to- date intelligence information and make CAPPS II more capable of being modified in response to changing threats. In addition, TSA believes that CAPPS II has the potential to improve identity authentication. Another expected benefit of the system is the ability to aggregate risk scores to identify higher-risk flights, airports, or geographic regions. Improved identity authentication could reduce the number of passengers who are falsely identified as needing additional security screening. Although exact numbers are not available, TSA officials estimate that currently 15 percent of passengers require additional checkpoint screening under CAPPS, compared to an expected 1 to 3 percent under CAPPS II. CAPPS II is also ultimately expected to prescreen all passengers on flights either originating in or destined for the United States. According to the draft Business Case for CAPPS II, the system has an estimated life cycle cost of over $380 million through fiscal year 2008. Life cycle costs beyond fiscal year 2008 have not been estimated. According to program officials, approximately $41.5 million has been allocated for the system’s acquisition to date. TSA has encountered delays in the development of CAPPS II. TSA plans to develop CAPPS II in nine increments, with each increment providing increased functionality. (See appendix III for a description of these increments.) TSA planned to test each increment after it was developed to ensure the system met the objectives of that increment before proceeding to the next increment. TSA contracted to begin developing CAPPS II in March 2003 and completed increments 1 and 2 in August and October 2003, respectively. However, TSA has not fully completed testing these initial two increments because it was unable to obtain passenger data needed for testing from air carriers, which would not provide the passenger data because of privacy concerns. Instead, the agency deferred completing these tests until increment 3. TSA is currently developing increment 3, and had originally planned to complete this increment by November 2003. However, due to the unavailability of passenger data needed for testing, TSA has delayed completion of this increment by five months and reduced the functionality that this increment is expected to achieve. Increment 3 was originally intended to provide a functioning system that could handle live passenger data from one air carrier in a test environment to demonstrate that the system can satisfy operational and functional requirements. However, TSA officials reported that they recently modified increment 3 to instead provide a functional application using a test simulator rather than an airline. Officials also stated that they were uncertain when the testing that was deferred from increments 1 and 2 to increment 3 will be completed. TSA recognizes that system testing is a high-risk area and plans to further delay the system’s schedule to ensure that sufficient testing is completed. As a result, all succeeding increments of CAPPS II have been delayed, moving CAPPS II initial operating capability—the point at which the system will be ready to operate with one airline—from November 2003 to a date unknown. See figure 2 for a timeline showing the original and revised schedule for CAPPS II increments. TSA has not yet developed critical elements associated with sound project planning, including a plan for what specific functionality will be delivered, by when, and at what cost throughout the development of the system. Our work on similar systems and other best practice research have shown that the application of rigorous practices to the acquisition and development of information systems improves the likelihood of the systems’ success. In other words, the quality of information technology systems and services is governed largely by the quality of the processes involved in developing and acquiring the system. We have reported that the lack of such practices has contributed to cost, schedule, and performance problems for major system acquisition efforts. Sound project planning includes identifying specific functions to be delivered as well as the cost and schedule for delivering these functions. TSA established plans for the initial increments of the system, including defined requirements for increments 1 and 2 and costs and schedules for increments 1 through 4. However, officials lack a complete plan identifying the specific functions that will be delivered during the remaining increments; for example, which government and commercial databases will be incorporated, the date when these functions will be delivered, and an estimated cost of the functions. In addition, TSA officials recently reported that the expected functionality to be achieved during early increments has been reduced, and officials are uncertain when CAPPS II will achieve initial operating capability—the point at which the system will be ready to operate with one airline. Project officials also stated that because of testing delays, they are unable to plan for future increments with any certainty. By not completing these key system development planning activities, TSA runs the risk that CAPPS II will not provide the full functionality promised. Further, without a clear link between deliverables, cost, and schedule, it will be difficult to know what will be delivered and when in order to track development progress. Until project officials develop a plan that includes schedule milestones and cost estimates for key deliverables, CAPPS II is at increased risk of not providing the promised functionality, not being fielded when planned, and being fielded at an increased cost. TSA has not fully addressed seven of the eight issues identified by the Congress as key areas of interest related to the development and implementation of CAPPS II. Public Law 108-90 identified eight key issues that TSA must fully address before the system is deployed or implemented. Taken together, addressing these issues will help ensure that (1) CAPPS II development and operation is effectively managed and monitored and that the system will function as intended and (2) the public has assurance that adequate measures exist to protect passenger privacy. Although TSA is in various stages of progress on addressing each of these eight issues, as of January 1, 2004, only one—the establishment of an internal oversight board to review the development of CAPPS II—has been fully addressed, as shown in table 1. TSA program officials reported that they have not fully addressed these issues due to the early stage of CAPPS II development and not being able to obtain needed passenger data for testing, but reported that they are taking actions that they believe will ultimately address each issue. However, due to system development delays, uncertainties regarding when needed passenger data will be obtained, and the need to finalize key policy decisions, officials were unable to identify a time frame for when all remaining issues will be fully addressed. The following sections summarize the status of TSA’s efforts to address each of the eight issues as of January 1, 2004. DHS created an oversight board—the Investment Review Board—to review the department’s capital asset programs with contracts exceeding $50 million to ensure that projects meet mission needs at the expected levels of cost and risk. Comprised of senior DHS executives and chaired by the Deputy Secretary, the Investment Review Board is tasked with reviewing these programs—termed Level 1 investments—at key phases of program development, and reviewed the CAPPS II program in October 2003. As a result of the October review, the Board authorized TSA to proceed with the system’s development. However, it noted some areas that the program needed to address. The Board identified concerns regarding privacy and policy issues, coordinating with other stakeholders, and identifying program staffing requirements and costs, among others, and directed that these issues be addressed before the system proceeds to the next phase. Although DHS has the Investment Review Board in place to provide internal oversight and monitoring for CAPPS II and other Level 1 investments, concerns exist regarding the timeliness of future reviews by the Board. DHS officials acknowledged that the Investment Review Board is having difficulty reviewing all of the critical departmental programs in a timely manner. As of January 2004, DHS had identified about 50 Level 1 investments that would be subject to the Board’s review. As the CAPPS II program proceeds, it will be important for the Investment Review Board to oversee the program on a regular and thorough basis to provide needed oversight. TSA has not yet determined the accuracy—or conversely, the error rate— of commercial and government databases that will be used by CAPPS II. According to commercial data providers and TSA officials, commercial data providers maintain certain information on the accuracy of their databases. However, since each commercial provider assesses accuracy with different measures and criteria, each company’s accuracy information is not comparable across the industry or to any consistent standard. In addition, accuracy data for government databases is not systematically collected. As a result, TSA officials stated that they will develop and conduct their own tests to assess the overall accuracy of information contained in commercial and government databases. These tests are not intended to identify all errors existing within a database, but rather assess the overall accuracy of a database before determining whether it is acceptable to be used by CAPPS II. TSA is developing accuracy tests for commercial databases—which will compare a limited set of data known to be 100 percent accurate against the databases—and estimates that the tests will be ready for application before the system achieves initial operating capability. A senior program official said that because commercial data companies already perform their own data quality testing and evaluations, TSA expects that its testing, when conducted, will demonstrate that the accuracy of the databases are sufficient for CAPPS II purposes. However, if testing shows that commercial databases planned to be used are not of adequate accuracy, TSA will need to identify and work with other commercial data providers to test and use their data. TSA officials stated that they also plan to conduct other quality assessments of the database companies by assessing their practices for ensuring and improving data quality. Finally, since databases will be added throughout the system’s development, accuracy testing will need to continue as additional government and commercial databases are used. In addition to testing the accuracy of commercial databases, TSA plans to better ensure the accuracy of commercial databases by using multiple databases in a layered approach to authenticating a passenger’s identity. If available information is insufficient to validate the passenger’s identification in the first database accessed, then CAPPS II will access another commercial database to provide a second layer of data, and if necessary, still other commercial databases. This layered system, which relies on multiple databases, is expected by TSA to ultimately save resources because not all passengers would have to be checked against all data sources. TSA also plans to improve the overall accuracy of authentication scores through a process that targets errors such as misspellings and typographical errors. TSA officials stated that this process may help to differentiate passengers with similar names. TSA program officials said that testing government databases for overall accuracy will be challenging. For example, TSA does not know exactly what type of information the government databases contain, such as whether a database will contain a person’s name and full address, a partial address, or no address at all. Furthermore, a senior program official said that TSA has no indication of the accuracy of information contained in government databases. The official stated that using data without assessing accuracy and mitigating data errors could result in erroneous passenger assessments, and that government database accuracy and mitigation measures will be completed before the system is placed in operation. Although TSA plans to take measures to mitigate errors in commercial and government databases used by CAPPS II, TSA officials and commercial data providers stated that databases determined to have an acceptable level of accuracy will likely still contain errors. Consequently, in addition to using multiple databases and a process to identify misspellings to correct errors in commercial databases, TSA is also developing a redress process whereby passengers can attempt to get erroneous data corrected. However, it is unclear what access passengers will have to information found in either government or commercial databases, or who is ultimately responsible for making corrections. Additionally, if errors are identified during the redress process, TSA does not have the authority to correct erroneous data in commercial or government databases. TSA officials said they plan to address this issue by establishing protocols with commercial data providers and other federal agencies to assist in the process of getting erroneous data corrected. (TSA’s planning for a CAPPS II redress process is discussed in further detail in a later section of this report.) TSA has not yet stress tested CAPPS II increments developed to date or conducted other system-related testing to fully demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the system’s search capabilities, or search tools, to correctly assess passenger risk levels. Stress and system testing are critical mechanisms performed during each stage of a system’s development to ensure that the system and its components meet requirements and user needs. TSA initially planned to conduct stress testing on an early increment of the system by August 2003. However, stress testing was delayed several times due to TSA’s inability to obtain the 1.5 million Passenger Name Records it estimates are needed to test the system. TSA attempted to obtain the data needed for testing from three different sources—two U.S. air carriers and a global distribution service, also known as a reservation company—but encountered problems due to privacy concerns associated with its access to the data. For example, one air carrier initially agreed to provide passenger data for testing purposes, but adverse publicity resulted in its withdrawal from participation. Similar situations occurred for the other two potential data providers. TSA’s attempts to obtain test data are still ongoing, and privacy issues remain a stumbling block. Further, as TSA continues to develop the system, it will need to conduct additional stress testing. For example, there is a stringent performance requirement for the system to process 3.5 million risk assessment transactions per day with a peak load of 300 transactions per second that cannot be fully tested until the system is further along in development. Program officials acknowledge that achieving this performance requirement is a high-risk area, and have initiated discussions to define how this requirement will be achieved. However, TSA has not yet developed a complete mitigation strategy to address this risk. Without a strategy for mitigating the risk of not meeting peak load requirements, the likelihood that the system may not be able to meet performance requirements increases. Other system related testing to fully demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the system’s search tools in assessing passenger risk levels also have not been conducted. This testing was also planned for completion by August 2003, but similar to the delays in stress testing, TSA’s lack of access to passenger data prevented the agency from conducting these tests. In fact, TSA has only used 32 simulated passenger records—created by TSA from the itineraries of its employees and contractor staff who volunteered to provide the data—to conduct this testing. TSA officials stated that the limited testing—conducted during increment 2—has demonstrated the effectiveness of the system’s various search tools. However, tests using these limited records do not replicate the wide variety of situations they expect to encounter with actual passenger data when full-scale testing is actually undertaken. As a result, the full effectiveness and accuracy of the tools have not been demonstrated. Similarly, these 32 records are not a sufficient amount of data to conduct a valid stress test of the system. TSA officials stated that they are continuing to seek needed passenger data for testing, but believe they will continue to have difficulty in obtaining data for both stress and other testing until TSA issues a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to require airlines to provide passenger data to TSA. This action is currently under consideration within TSA and DHS. In addition, TSA officials stated that before the system is implemented, a final Privacy Act notice will be published. According to DHS’s Chief Privacy Officer, this notice is expected to be finalized sometime after March 1, 2004, at the earliest. Due to the lack of test data, TSA delayed the stress and system testing planned for increments 1 and 2 to increment 3, scheduled to be completed by March 31, 2004. However, a TSA official recently stated that they no longer expect to conduct this testing during increment 3, and do not have an estimated date for when these tests will be conducted. Uncertainties surrounding when stress and system testing will be conducted could impact TSA’s ability to allow sufficient time for testing, resolving defects, and retesting before CAPPS II can achieve initial operating capability, and may further delay system deployment. Ensuring that information systems contain safeguards to reduce opportunities for abuse, and have substantial security measures in place to protect against unauthorized access by hackers or other intruders, are two elements of an information system security program. Such a program typically involves policies, processes, and practices for protecting a system, its networks, and the facilities that house these systems, and for ensuring that personnel who work on these systems have undergone appropriate checks and have been provided appropriate access to the system’s information. Because of schedule delays and the early stage of CAPPS II development, TSA has not implemented critical elements of an information system security program. Therefore, TSA does not yet have assurance that CAPPS II will be adequately protected from abuse, computer hackers, or other information security concerns. The Federal Information Security Management Act, Office of Management and Budget guidance, and industry best practices describe critical elements of a comprehensive information system security management program. These elements include security policies, a system security plan, a security risk assessment, and certification and accreditation of the security of the system. Together, these elements help provide a strong security framework for protecting information technology data and assets. However, as of January 1, 2004, none of these four elements have been completed for CAPPS II. Each of these elements, and the status of TSA’s efforts to complete them, is discussed below. Security policies are the primary mechanism by which management communicates its security views and requirements, and are a key element of a comprehensive information security management program. TSA security officials responsible for securing CAPPS II stated that they are developing a security policy specific to their office that is expected to incorporate system, personnel, and physical security controls. In the interim, officials reported that they are using relevant portions of TSA’s information security policy, the Director of Central Intelligence Directives, the National Industrial Security Program, and the Defense Information Technology Security Certification and Accreditation Process to guide CAPPS II security. System security plans provide an overview of the security requirements of the system, describe established controls for meeting those requirements, and delineate responsibilities and expected behaviors for all individuals who access the system. The CAPPS II security plan is currently in draft and is expected to be complete by the time initial operating capability is achieved. TSA officials stated that the security plan, when fully developed, will contain system security requirements, a security risk assessment, and plans for addressing security requirements. Although the draft CAPPS II system security plan contains sections on securing the system, personnel, and facility, the details of most sections are incomplete. Identifying and assessing information security risks are essential steps in determining what controls are required and what level of resources should be expended on controls, and are required by the Federal Information Security Management Act. Moreover, by increasing awareness of risks, these assessments generate support for policies and controls, which helps ensure that policies and controls operate as intended. The CAPPS II security risk assessment was originally scheduled for completion in the January/February 2004 time frame. However, TSA officials stated that the assessment has been postponed due to CAPPS II development delays and has not been rescheduled. Certifying and accrediting a system as secure entails that the appropriate officials have the necessary information to make a credible risk-based decision regarding whether to place the system into operation. A TSA security official stated that TSA is planning a three- phased approach for certifying and accrediting CAPPS II: (1) the sensitive compartmental information facility containing CAPPS II is to be accredited by the Central Intelligence Agency in March 2004; (2) the two government networks CAPPS II is using to transfer secret and top secret data are to be accredited, again by the Central Intelligence Agency; and (3) the fully developed CAPPS II will be accredited by DHS at a date to be determined. The TSA security official stated that TSA is unable to schedule the final certification and accreditation of CAPPS II because of the uncertainty regarding the system’s development schedule. The official also stated that CAPPS II must be fully developed so that TSA can perform the necessary tests for final accreditation. While TSA has begun to implement critical elements of an information security management program, these elements have not been completed. The completion of the system security plan, security risk assessment, and certification and accreditation process are critical to ensuring the security of CAPPS II. Until these efforts are completed, there is decreased assurance that TSA will be able to adequately protect CAPPS II information and an increased risk of operational abuse and access by unauthorized users. TSA has not yet fully established controls to oversee the effective use and operation of CAPPS II. TSA plans to provide oversight of CAPPS II through two methods: (1) establishing goals and measures to assess the program’s strengths, weaknesses, and performance; and (2) establishing mechanisms to monitor and evaluate the use and operation of the system. TSA has established preliminary performance goals and measures for CAPPS II; however, these measures may not provide all of the objective data needed to conduct appropriate oversight. In addition, TSA has not fully established or documented additional oversight controls to ensure that operations are effectively monitored and evaluated. TSA has established preliminary goals and measures to assess the CAPPS II program’s performance in meeting its objectives. The Government Performance and Results Act requires that agencies establish goals and measures in order to appropriately oversee the performance of programs. As stated in TSA’s draft Business Case for CAPPS II, the agency has established five strategic objectives with performance goals and measures, as shown in table 2. Goals and measures are intended to allow TSA and DHS management, other oversight bodies, and the Congress to systematically assess a program’s strengths, weaknesses, and performance, and then identify appropriate remedies. In this regard, these preliminary goals and measures represent a good first step. They provide some useful intermediate performance information on key aspects of the program and, according to TSA, are tied to DHS and TSA strategic goals. We have previously reported that TSA had linked its aviation security goals to those of its then parent department, the Department of Transportation, and that linking goals of component organizations to goals of the parent organization are helpful in moving towards a results oriented culture and providing accountability for results. However, CAPPS II performance goals and measures could be strengthened. Two of the planned goals and measures are potentially redundant, as the goal of prescreening 100 percent of passengers by 2005 will, by necessity, require meeting the goal of having all airlines participating in the system. Further, goals to improve the reliability and effectiveness of CAPPS II could be included. For example, although a performance measure is established for the percentage of referrals to law enforcement being verified as representing an increased risk, no goals or measures are established for assessing whether the system’s performance is producing accurate scores and not producing errors, such as “false negatives”—when a passenger is not identified for increased screening when that passenger should have been. This is a key area for which TSA has acknowledged that data must be identified, quantified, and tracked for improvement. However, TSA has not developed a measure to assess its performance in this area. TSA officials stated that they are working with five universities to assess system effectiveness and management, and will develop metrics to be used to measure effectiveness of CAPPS II. With this information, officials expect to review and, as necessary, revise their goals and objectives to provide management and the Congress with objective information to provide system oversight. In addition, TSA has not fully established policies and procedures to monitor and evaluate the use and operation of the system. TSA has built capabilities into CAPPS II to monitor and evaluate the system’s operation and record actions taken by the program, and it plans to conduct audits of the system to determine whether it is functioning as intended. However, at this time, TSA has not written all of the rules that will govern how the system will operate. Consequently, officials do not yet know how these capabilities will function, how they will be applied to monitor the system to provide oversight, and what positions and offices will be responsible for maintaining the oversight. For example, TSA has not created all of the policies that will govern CAPPS II operations for compliance with privacy requirements. Until these policies and procedures for CAPPS II are developed, there is no assurance that proper controls are in place to monitor and oversee the system. TSA’s plans for CAPPS II reflect an effort to protect individual privacy rights, but certain issues remain unresolved. Specifically, TSA plans appear to address many of the requirements of the Privacy Act, the primary legislation that regulates the government’s use of personal information. For example, in January 2003, TSA issued a notice in the Federal Register that generally describes the Privacy Act system of records that will reside in CAPPS II and asked the public to comment. While TSA has taken these initial steps, it has not yet finalized its plans for complying with the act. For example, the act and related Office of Management and Budget guidance state that an agency proposing to exempt a system of records from a Privacy Act provision must explain the reasons for the exemption in a published rule. In January 2003, TSA published a proposed rule to exempt the system from seven Privacy Act provisions but has not yet provided the reasons for these exemptions, stating that this information will be provided in a final rule to be published before the system becomes operational. As a result, TSA’s justification for these exemptions remains unclear. Until TSA finalizes its privacy plans for CAPPS II and addresses such concerns, we lack assurance that the system will fully comply with the Privacy Act. When viewed in the larger context of Fair Information Practices— internationally recognized privacy principles that also underlie the Privacy Act—TSA plans reflect some actions to address each of these practices. For example, TSA’s plan to not collect passengers’ social security numbers from commercial data providers and to destroy most passenger information shortly after they have completed their travel itinerary appears consistent with the collection limitation practice, which states that collections of personal information should be limited. In addition, TSA’s plan to prohibit commercial data providers from using information they receive from TSA for commercial purposes appears consistent with the use limitation practice, which states that personal information should not be disclosed or used for other than the specified purpose except with consent of the individual or legal authority. However, to meet its evolving mission goals, TSA plans also appear to limit the application of certain of these practices. For example, TSA plans to exempt CAPPS II from the Privacy Act’s requirements to maintain only that information about an individual that is relevant and necessary to accomplish a proper agency purpose. These plans reflect the subordination of the use limitation practice and data quality practice (personal information should be relevant to the purpose for which it is collected) to other goals and raises concerns that TSA may collect and maintain more information than is needed for the purpose of CAPPS II, and perhaps use this information for new purposes in the future. Further, TSA plans to limit the application of the individual participation practice—which states that individuals should have the right to know about the collection of personal information, to access that information, and request correction—by prohibiting passenger access to all personal information about them accessed by CAPPS II. This raises concerns that inaccurate personal information will remain uncorrected in and continue to be accessed by CAPPS II. Such actions to limit the application of the Fair Information Practices do not violate federal requirements. Rather, they reflect TSA’s efforts to balance privacy with other public policy interests such as national security, law enforcement, and administrative efficiency. As the program evolves, it will ultimately be up to policymakers to determine if TSA has struck an appropriate balance among these competing interests. See appendix IV for a more detailed analysis of TSA’s plans to address privacy issues. TSA has not yet finalized a redress process for passengers who are erroneously delayed or prohibited from boarding their scheduled flights, termed “false positives.” According to TSA officials, a redress process for such passengers is a critical element of CAPPS II, and TSA intends to establish a process by which passengers who are subject to additional screening or denied boarding will be provided the opportunity to seek redress by filing a complaint. However, officials stated that such a program cannot be fully developed until key program policies are finalized, such as the length of time CAPPS II will retain passenger data and the conditions under which TSA will retain records longer than normal. Although the redress process is not fully developed, TSA officials identified key elements they expect to include in the process. First, TSA will use its existing complaint procedures—currently used for complaints from passengers denied boarding passes—to document complaints and provide these to the TSA Ombudsman. Complaints relating to CAPPS II will be routed to the Passenger Advocate, a position to be established within TSA for assisting individuals with CAPPS II-related concerns. The Passenger Advocate will represent the passenger and help identify errors in the system that may have caused a person to be identified as a false positive. Second, if the passengers are not satisfied with the response received from TSA with regard to the complaint, they will have the opportunity to appeal their case to the DHS Privacy Office. Third, TSA plans to conduct a public awareness campaign to inform travelers about what to expect from the new CAPPS II process and how to register complaints if they believe they are erroneously selected for additional security attention. A number of key policy issues associated with the redress process, however, still need to be resolved. These include defining the role of the Passenger Advocate and the mechanisms that will be used to inform passengers of the outcomes of their complaints. More significantly, there are three concerns regarding data in CAPPS II that may complicate the redress process. These concerns involve data retention, access, and correction. Data retention: TSA has not yet determined how long CAPPS II will retain passenger data. Current plans indicate that data on U.S. travelers and lawful permanent residents will be deleted from the system at a specified time following the completion of the passengers’ itinerary. Although TSA’s decision to limit the retention of data was made for privacy considerations, the short retention period might make it impossible for passengers to seek redress if they do not register complaints quickly. TSA could rerun the passenger information through CAPPS II in an effort to recreate the deleted data, but TSA has no way of determining whether the results would be the same—the algorithms used to calculate risk scores change—or that risk scores were even the reason for the additional screening. Additional screening can be the result of factors such as setting off the alarm on screening checkpoint metal detectors or random selection, and not as a result of a risk score calculated by CAPPS II. Data access: TSA has not yet determined what information the Passenger Advocate will be able to share with passengers who file a complaint. Although TSA has stated that it is committed to providing access to information in CAPPS II to the greatest extent feasible, TSA officials stated that passengers will not have access to any government data used to generate a passenger risk score due to national security concerns. TSA officials have also not determined to what extent, if any, passengers will be allowed to view information used by commercial data providers. Data correction: TSA has not yet determined how the process of correcting erroneous information will work in practice. TSA documents and program officials stated that it may be difficult for the Passenger Advocate to identify errors. Further, it will be the responsibility of passengers to correct errors in commercial databases at their source, as TSA will refer the passengers to the original source of the data to seek correction. Correcting erroneous information is further complicated by the fact that commercial data providers may not be obligated to correct their databases, and that names of the data sources may not even be made available to the passengers due to licensing agreements. To address these concerns, TSA is exploring ways to assist passengers who are consistently determined to be false positives. For example, TSA has discussed incorporating an “alert list” that would consist of passengers who coincidentally share a name with a person on a government watch list and are therefore continually flagged for additional screening. Although the process has not been finalized, current plans indicate that a passenger would be required to submit to an extensive background check in order to be placed on the alert list. TSA stated that available remedies for all persons seeking redress will be more fully detailed in the CAPPS II privacy policy, which will be published before the system achieves initial operating capability. In addition to facing developmental, operational, and public acceptance challenges related to key areas of interest to the Congress, CAPPS II also faces a number of additional challenges that may impede its success. We identified three issues that, if not adequately resolved, pose major risks to the successful development, implementation, and operation of CAPPS II. These issues include developing the international cooperation needed to obtain passenger data, managing the expansion of the program’s mission beyond its original purpose, and ensuring that identity theft—in which an individual poses as and uses information of another individual—cannot be used to negate the security benefits of the system. For CAPPS II to operate fully and effectively, it needs data not only on U.S. citizens who are passengers on flights of domestic origin, but also on foreign nationals on domestic flights and on flights to the United States originating in other countries. This information is critical to achieving the program’s objective of reducing the risk of foreign terrorism and helping to avoid events like those of September 11, 2001. Moreover, as evidenced by the cancellation for security reasons of several flights to the United States from December 2003 through February 2004, the use of commercial aircraft originating in foreign countries may be the means terrorists choose to use to attempt future attacks. To prescreen passengers on flights originating in foreign countries requires that CAPPS II obtain Passenger Name Record data on passengers from foreign countries, flying on foreign airlines, or purchasing tickets through foreign sources. However, obtaining international cooperation for access to this data remains a substantial challenge. The European Union, in particular, has objected to its citizens’ data being used by CAPPS II, whether a citizen of a European Union country flies on a U.S. carrier or an air carrier under another country’s flag. The European Union has asserted that using such data is not in compliance with its privacy directive and violates the civil liberties and privacy rights of its citizens. Its position extends not only to international flights to the United States, but also to U.S. domestic flights that carry citizens of European Union countries. DHS and European Union officials are in the process of finalizing an understanding regarding the transfer of passenger data for use by the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection for preventing and combating (1) terrorism and related crimes; (2) other serious crimes, including organized crime, that are transnational in nature; and (3) flight from warrants or custody for these crimes. However, this understanding does not permit the passenger data to be used by TSA in the operation of CAPPS II but does allow for the data to be used for testing purposes. According to a December 16, 2003, report from the Commission of European Communities, the European Union will not be in a position to agree to the use of its citizens’ passenger data for CAPPS II until internal U.S. processes have been completed and it is clear that the U.S. Congress’s privacy concerns have been resolved. The Commission stated that it would discuss the use of European Union citizen passenger data in a second, later round of discussions. TSA officials stated that in the short term, the lack of data on non-U.S. citizens could potentially affect the implementation of the system’s initial operating capabilities. Moreover, officials stated that in the longer term, an inability to obtain data on non-U.S. citizens would hamper the effectiveness of the system. Without data on foreign nationals traveling to, from, and within the United States, CAPPS II would be unable to assess the threat posed by all individuals or by a group of passengers on a single flight, thus compromising the full capabilities and effectiveness of CAPPS II. Program officials and several privacy advocacy organizations have noted that the mission of CAPPS II may be expanded beyond its original purpose, and have expressed concern that this expansion may affect program objectives and public acceptance of the system. The primary objective of CAPPS II was to protect the commercial aviation system from the risk of foreign terrorism by screening for high-risk or potentially high- risk passengers, and to identify known foreign terrorists or their associates who are planning to board a flight. However, TSA has stated that it may expand the number of people targeted for additional security screening through CAPPS II. In the August 2003 interim final Privacy Act notice for CAPPS II, TSA stated that the system would seek to identify terrorists (both domestic and foreign) and not just foreign terrorists as previously proposed. The August notice also stated that the system could be expanded to identify persons who are subject to outstanding federal or state arrest warrants for violent crimes. Finally, in the notice, TSA also stated that CAPPS II could ultimately be expanded to include identifying individuals who are in the United States illegally or who have overstayed their visas. DHS officials stated that they believe that such changes are not an expansion of the system’s mission. Rather, they believe that the mission of CAPPS II is to strengthen aviation security, and as stated by the DHS Chief Privacy Officer, identifying wanted violent criminals and fugitives is consistent with that mission. DHS officials also stated that using CAPPS II to identify individuals not legally in this country is consistent with the broader DHS mission to protect the nation’s borders from illegal immigration. However, focusing on persons with outstanding warrants, and possibly immigration violators, could put TSA at risk of diverting attention from the program’s fundamental purpose, which is identifying persons who pose a threat to aviation security. Expanding the CAPPS II mission could also lead to an erosion of public confidence in the system, which program officials agreed is essential to the effective operation of CAPPS II. This expansion could also increase the number of passengers erroneously identified as needing additional security attention as well as the costs of passenger screening. Privacy advocacy organizations also expressed concern regarding the potential expansion of the CAPPS II mission to identify persons who are subject to outstanding warrants for violent crimes and illegal immigrants because they believe these individuals do not necessarily pose a threat to aviation security. According to TSA program officials, the expansion of CAPPS II would also pose substantial operational challenges that they do not yet know how to effectively address. For example, implementing these possible changes could require integration with other data systems, such as the National Crime Information Center and immigration databases, as well as other databases that may contain data on persons with outstanding warrants. This would require involving additional agencies in the system, as well as additional equipment to effectively query these databases and integrate responses into CAPPS II. Further, TSA officials stated that some of these databases have reliability concerns, including the National Crime Information Center database. Recognizing these concerns, TSA officials reported that they are working to identify alternate sources of reliable data if CAPPS II were to be expanded as described. Another challenge facing the successful operation of CAPPS II is the system’s ability to effectively identify passengers who assume the identity of another individual, known as identity theft. As our previous work has shown, identity theft appears to be growing in this country. TSA officials stated that while they believe CAPPS II will be able to detect some instances of identity theft, they recognized that the system will not detect all instances of identity theft without implementing some type of biometric indicator, such as fingerprinting or retinal scans. Successful identity theft would encompass two elements. First, an individual would have to obtain the personal identifiers (name, home address, date of birth, and home phone number) of an individual who would likely be classified by CAPPS II as an acceptable risk. Next, the person would have to obtain falsified documents associated with the stolen identity (such as a driver’s license containing the stolen identifiers with the thief’s picture) to present at the airport ticket counter and screening checkpoint. TSA officials stated that while CAPPS II cannot address all cases of identity theft, CAPPS II should detect situations in which a passenger submits fictitious information such as a false address. These instances would likely be detected since the data being provided would either not be validated or would be inconsistent with information maintained by the commercial data provider. Additionally, officials said that identity theft and other fraud data may be available through credit bureaus, and that in the future they expect to work with the credit bureaus to obtain such data. However, they acknowledge that some identity theft is difficult to spot, particularly if the identity theft is unreported or if collusion, where someone permits his or her identity to be assumed by another person, is involved. TSA officials stated that there should not be an expectation that CAPPS II will be 100 percent accurate in identifying all cases of identity theft. Further, they said that CAPPS II is just one layer in the system of systems that TSA has in place to improve aviation security, and that passengers who were able to thwart CAPPS II by committing identity theft would still need to go through normal checkpoint screening and other standard security procedures. TSA officials believe that, although not fool-proof, CAPPS II represents an improvement in identity authentication over the current system. The events of September 11, 2001, and the ongoing threat of commercial aircraft hijackings as a means of terrorist attack against the United States, highlight the reasoning behind effectively prescreening airline passengers. An effective prescreening system would not only expedite the screening of passengers of acceptable risk, but would also accurately identify those passengers warranting additional security attention, including those passengers determined to have an unacceptable level of risk who would be immediately assessed by law enforcement personnel. CAPPS II, while holding the promise of providing increased benefits over the current CAPPS system, faces significant challenges to its successful implementation. Uncertainties surrounding the system’s future functionality and schedule alone result in the potential that the system may not meet expected requirements, may experience delayed deployment, and may incur increased costs throughout the system’s development. Of the eight issues identified by the Congress related to CAPPS II implementation, only one—establishing an internal oversight board—has been fully addressed. Of particular concern among the remaining seven issues is the security of both the system and passenger data contained in the system, as well as a means to provide adequate system oversight. Without proper oversight, there is limited assurance that the system and its data will be adequately protected against misuse, and that the system is operating as intended. Additionally, significant risks exist that adequate system testing, particularly to assure that CAPPS II can meet expected load demands, may be shortchanged. An effective risk mitigation strategy for system testing would help assure that system functionality and expected peak loads can be achieved. Lastly, given the concerns regarding the protection of passenger data, the system cannot be fully accepted if it lacks a comprehensive redress process for those who believe they are erroneously labeled as an unknown or unacceptable risk. To address the challenges associated with the development, implementation, and operation of CAPPS II, we recommend that the Secretary of Homeland Security instruct the Administrator of the Transportation Security Administration to take the following seven actions: Develop plans identifying the specific functionality that will be delivered during each increment of CAPPS II, the specific milestones for delivering this functionality, and expected costs for each increment. Use established plans to track development progress to ensure that promised functionality is being delivered on time and within established cost estimates. Develop a schedule for critical security activities, including finalizing the security policy, the security risk assessment, and system certification and accreditation. Develop a strategy for mitigating the high risk associated with system and database testing that ensures (1) accuracy testing of commercial and government databases is conducted prior to the database being used and (2) appropriate stress testing is conducted to demonstrate the system can meet peak load requirements. Develop results-oriented performance goals and measures to evaluate the program’s effectiveness, including measures to assess performance of the system in generating reliable risk scores. Develop policies and procedures detailing CAPPS II oversight mechanisms, including offices responsible for providing oversight, and reporting requirements for oversight information. Develop policies and procedures outlining the CAPPS II passenger redress process that include defining the appeal rights of passengers and their ability to access and correct personal data. We provided draft copies of this report to DHS for its review and comment. In a February 4, 2004, letter, the DHS Under Secretary for Management commented that the department generally concurred with the report and its recommendations. However, the Under Secretary provided the following comments related to CAPPS II development, international cooperation, and mission expansion. First, the department does not believe that the report accurately describes its progress in developing CAPPS II. DHS acknowledged that the report discusses much of the system’s progress in detail, but stated that the report’s results in brief and summary charts do not characterize this progress accurately. Specifically, the Under Secretary stated that CAPPS II is not yet, nor could it be, at the point of having fully addressed many of the congressional areas of concern since it is still under development. Additionally, the Under Secretary stated that CAPPS II exists as a fully integrated, baseline functioning system that is not able to advance beyond its current state because the department is not authorized to receive passenger data. We believe our description of the progress of CAPPS II is appropriate and balanced, and fairly describes the status of the system and its progress in achieving the requirements established by the Congress. Where appropriate, we provide DHS’s perspective that the program is in an early stage of development. We also recognize throughout the report that delays in obtaining passenger data needed for testing has significantly impacted CAPPS II development. However, we believe that the department’s description of the system as being a fully integrated, baseline functioning system is misleading. The system has not yet been fully integrated with commercial and government databases. In addition, the system as it currently exists offers only limited functionality in a simulated environment, with additional functionality not to be added until later increments. DHS officials also recognized that they were uncertain when initial operating capability for CAPPS II would be achieved. The department also expressed concern regarding the draft report’s discussion of international issues as an impediment to CAPPS II deployment. Specifically, the Under Secretary stated that the draft report did not (1) clearly convey the complexity of the situation, (2) adequately convey the degree of international cooperation achieved, or (3) acknowledge that an agreement in principle with the European Commission permits the use of passenger data for testing CAPPS II. We agree that international cooperation is a complex, multi-faceted issue. However, we believe that our report appropriately addresses this issue in sufficient detail as it relates to impediments to CAPPS II deployment and use. Further, presenting more information on this issue would require us to have discussed CAPPS II with other countries. However, as agreed to with DHS officials, we did not contact the European Union or other involved countries due to on-going negotiations with the United States regarding the use of foreign passenger data for CAPPS II. Thus, we included in the report information on international cooperation obtained from DHS and TSA officials as well as public documents from European Union organizations. However, based on our review of additional documentation provided by DHS, we revised our report to reflect that passenger data from European Union countries can be used for CAPPS II testing. Finally, the department stated that the draft report was not accurate in asserting that the potential use of CAPPS II to detect individuals wanted for violent crimes or visa violations was an expansion of the program’s mission. Moreover, the department states that differences between its January and August 2003 Privacy Act notices reflect limiting uses of personal information by CAPPS II. We stand by the report’s presentation on the potential expansion of the CAPPS II mission. Numerous TSA and DHS documents stated initially that the mission of CAPPS II was to protect the U.S. transportation systems and the public by conducting risk assessments to detect known and potential foreign terrorists. More recent documents added the potential purposes of CAPPS II to identify domestic terrorists, individuals with outstanding warrants for violent crimes, and individuals with potential visa violations. Further, the differences in the Privacy Act notices to which the department’s comments refer focuses on routine uses—disclosures of personal information that the act permits \"for a purpose which is compatible with the purpose for which it was collected.\" Contrary to the department's suggestion, the scope of a routine use does not, alone, describe the purpose of a system covered by the Privacy Act. DHS also provided technical comments related to the program’s development, status, and future plans. These comments were incorporated as appropriate. The department’s written comments are reprinted in appendix V. We are also sending copies of this report to the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, the Administrator of the Transportation Security Administration, and the Director of the Office of National Risk Assessment. Copies of this report will be made available to others on request. In addition, the report will be available at no charge on GAO’s Web site at http://www.gao.gov. If you have any questions about this report, please contact Cathleen Berrick at (202) 512-3404 or Jack Schulze, Assistant Director, at (202) 512- 4390. Questions concerning security and privacy issues should be directed to David Powner at (202) 512-9286, and Linda Koontz at (202) 512-6240, respectively. Major contributors to this report are listed in appendix VI. SEC. 519. a) None of the funds provided by this or previous appropriations Acts may be obligated for deployment or implementation, on other than a test basis, of the Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System (CAPPS II) that the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) plans to utilize to screen aviation passengers, until the General Accounting Office has reported to the Committees on Appropriations of the Senate and the House of Representatives that— 1. a system of due process exists whereby aviation passengers determined to pose a threat and either delayed or prohibited from boarding their scheduled flights by the TSA may appeal such decision and correct erroneous information contained in CAPPS II; 2. the underlying error rate of the government and private data bases that will be used both to establish identity and assign a risk level to a passenger will not produce a large number of false positives that will result in a significant number of passengers being treated mistakenly or security resources being diverted; 3. the TSA has stress-tested and demonstrated the efficacy and accuracy of all search tools in CAPPS II and has demonstrated that CAPPS II can make an accurate predictive assessment of those passengers who may constitute a threat to aviation; 4. the Secretary of Homeland Security has established an internal oversight board to monitor the manner in which CAPPS II is being developed and prepared; 5. the TSA has built in sufficient operational safeguards to reduce the 6. substantial security measures are in place to protect CAPPS II from unauthorized access by hackers or other intruders; 7. the TSA has adopted policies establishing effective oversight of the use and operation of the system; and 8. there are no specific privacy concerns with the technological architecture of the system. To address our objectives, we reviewed documentation from the Transportation Security Administration’s (TSA) Office of National Risk Assessment, and interviewed officials responsible for overseeing the development of the system, including associated contractors. We also interviewed officials at Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and TSA with oversight and implementation responsibilities for the Computer- Assisted Passenger Prescreening System II (CAPPS II), including the DHS Chief Privacy Officer, officials in the Office of Aviation Operations, and others responsible for CAPPS II oversight. In addition, we interviewed officials from privacy advocacy organizations, commercial database companies, air carriers, and other organizations that have knowledge of and/or concerns regarding CAPPS II. To determine the status of CAPPS II’s development and its related plans, we reviewed the CAPPS II draft Business Case, project schedules, planning documents, and associated system development documents. We also interviewed DHS and TSA program officials, as well as contractors associated with the development of CAPPS II. To assess the status of CAPPS II in addressing the issues identified in Public Law 108-90, we did the following. To determine how the development and implementation of CAPPS II is overseen internally, we interviewed DHS and TSA officials with oversight responsibilities. We also reviewed available documentation of oversight mechanisms, such as the Investment Review Board. To determine whether TSA calculated database error rates and how the agency plans to mitigate those errors, we interviewed program officials and reviewed documentation on how TSA plans to assess data quality for CAPPS II. We also interviewed officials from several private database companies to discuss industry standards and practices for data quality and error mitigation. To determine whether TSA performed stress tests on the system and demonstrated the effectiveness and accuracy of CAPPS II search tools to make an accurate predictive assessment, we interviewed TSA officials to determine how the system is being designed and reviewed plans and procedures for stress and system testing. However, because the system is not yet operational, and TSA has not been able to obtain actual passenger data to conduct tests, no output results existed for us to review and analyze that would demonstrate whether CAPPS II would be able to make an accurate predictive assessment of passengers who may pose a risk to aviation security. To determine what safeguards and security measures are in place to protect the system from abuse and misuse, we reviewed the system’s draft security plans and TSA’s security policies. We also interviewed TSA officials with system security responsibilities to determine what safeguards and security measures are planned and how they will function. To identify how TSA plans to oversee the use and operation of the system after implementation, we reviewed DHS and TSA policies and procedures governing oversight of the system. We also interviewed officials on how they plan to incorporate oversight mechanisms and performance measures into CAPPS II. To identify how agency officials are addressing Privacy Act requirements and other privacy-related issues, such as the Fair Information Practices, we analyzed agency documentation and interviewed agency officials with privacy-related responsibilities, including DHS and the Office of National Risk Assessment privacy officers. Based on our analysis of agency documentation and interviews, we assessed the extent to which CAPPS II is complying with the Privacy Act and following the Fair Information Practices. We also interviewed several privacy advocacy organizations, including the American Civil Liberties Union, the Electronic Privacy Information Center, the Center for Democracy and Technology, and the Electronic Frontier Foundation, to gain insight into domestic and international privacy concerns regarding CAPPS II. To determine whether a redress system for CAPPS II is planned and to describe it, we analyzed draft documents and working papers related to redress procedures for passengers identified for additional screening or denied boarding based on the CAPPS II risk assessment process. We also interviewed officials responsible for making policy decisions regarding redress procedures, including the DHS and TSA’s Office of National Risk Assessment privacy officers, to obtain their input regarding planned redress processes. To determine additional challenges TSA must address to successfully develop and implement CAPPS II, we interviewed and obtained relevant documentation from DHS and TSA regarding concerns and risks associated with the system’s development. We used our prior reports and criteria we developed in reviewing similar systems. We also interviewed privacy and public interest groups, as well as air carriers and airline associations, to obtain their perspectives on these challenges. The CAPPS II program also has international implications that may result in challenges to its implementation. However, due to ongoing discussions between the U.S. government and European Union regarding the use of data for CAPPS II, and the sensitive nature of these discussions, we did not discuss the system’s development and implementation with representatives of foreign governments. We instead obtained information on international cooperation on CAPPS II from DHS and secured public documents from European Union organizations. In reviewing CAPPS II and its development, we did not rely on computer- processed data and therefore did not conduct any data reliability assessments. We conducted our work from June 2003 through February 2004 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. The following describes general areas of functionality to be completed during each of the currently planned nine developmental increments of CAPPS II. Increment 1. System functionality established at the central processing center. By completion of increment 1, the system will be functional at the central processing center and can process passenger data and support intelligence validation using in-house data (no use of airline data). Additionally, at this increment, validation will be completed for privacy and policy enforcement tools; the exchange of, and processing with, data from multiple commercial data sources; and processing of government databases to support multiple watch-lists. Increment 2. System functionality established to support processing airline data. At the completion of increment 2, the system is functionally and operationally able to process airline data. Additionally, the system can perform functions such as prioritizing data requests, reacting to threat level changes, and manually triggering a “rescore” for individual passengers in response to reservation changes or adjustments to the threat level. Increment 3. This increment will provide for a functional system that will use a test simulator that will not be connected to an airline’s reservation system. System hardware that includes the establishment of test and production environments will be in place and a facility capable of performing risk assessment will be established. Design and development work for system failure with a back up system and help desk infrastructure will be put in place. Increment 4. By this increment a back up location will be functionally and operationally able to support airlines processing application, similar to the main location. A help desk will be installed to provide assistance to airlines, authenticator, and other user personnel. Increment 5. Enhanced intelligence interface. At the conclusion of this increment, the system will be able to receive from DHS the current threat level automatically and be able to adjust the system in response to changes in threat levels. The system will also be able to semi-automatically rescore and reclassify passengers that have already been authenticated. Increment 6. Enhanced passenger authentication. This increment will allow the system to perform passenger authentication using multiple commercial data sources in the instance that little information on a passenger is available from original commercial data source. Increment 7. Integration of other system users. By the completion of this increment, TSA Aviation Operations and law enforcement organizations will be integrated into CAPPS II, allowing multiple agencies and organizations to do manpower planning and resource allocations based on the risk level of the nation, region, airport, or specific flight. Increment 8. Enhanced risk assessments. This increment provides for the installation of capabilities and data sources to enhance risk assessments, which will lower the number of passengers falsely identified for additional screening. This increment also provides for a direct link to the checkpoint for passenger classification, rather than having the passenger’s score encoded on their boarding pass. Increment 9. Completion of system. Increment 9 marks the completion of the system as it moves into full operation and maintenance, which will include around-the-clock support, and administration of the system, database, and network, among other things. TSA’s plans for CAPPS II appear to address many requirements of the Privacy Act, but certain issues remain unresolved. When viewed in the larger context of the Fair Information Practices that are internationally recognized and underlie the act, TSA’s plans reflect actions to address each of these practices to at least some extent. However, in its efforts to balance privacy with national security and other public policy interests, TSA has proposed a number of actions which limit the application of certain of these practices and consequently, raise privacy concerns. Until TSA completes its privacy plans and the program is further developed, it cannot be determined whether the agency has identified all the CAPPS II privacy risks and taken actions to mitigate them. The Privacy Act of 1974 is the primary act that regulates the federal government’s use of personal information. The act places limitations on agencies’ collection, disclosure, and use of personal information. At this early stage of program development, TSA has taken some initial actions to respond to the act’s requirements for public notice. In January 2003, TSA issued (1) a notice in the Federal Register that generally describes the Privacy Act system of records that will reside in CAPPS II and asked the public to comment, and (2) a proposed rule to exempt this system of records from seven Privacy Act provisions as permitted under the act. In August 2003, the agency issued an interim final notice in the Federal Register that describes planned changes to CAPPS II based on the public’s comments on the January 2003 notice. The August notice also stated that TSA would issue a further Privacy Act notice before any implementation of CAPPS II. Other initial TSA plans for CAPPS II are consistent with various Privacy Act requirements. For example, TSA plans to provide passengers with a Privacy Act notice that explains the authority for collecting their information, its principal purposes, and other information as the act requires. TSA also plans to perform real-time auditing and testing to identify data quality problems and improve accuracy. This appears consistent with the act’s provision that agencies maintain only personal information that is accurate, complete, timely, and relevant. Our assessment may change after TSA completes its privacy plans and the program is further developed. While TSA has taken these initial steps, it has not yet finalized its plans for complying with the act. For example, the act and related Office of Management and Budget guidance state that an agency proposing to exempt a system of records from a Privacy Act provision must explain the reasons for the exemption in a published rule.\n\n### Summary:", "answer": "The security of U.S. commercial aviation is a long-standing concern, and substantial efforts have been undertaken to strengthen it. One of these efforts is the development of a new Computer-Assisted Passenger Prescreening System (CAPPS II) to identify passengers requiring additional security attention. The development of CAPPS II has raised a number of issues, including whether individuals may be inappropriately targeted for additional screening, and whether data accessed by the system may compromise passengers' privacy. GAO was asked to determine (1) the development status and plans for CAPPS II; (2) the status of CAPPS II in addressing key developmental, operational, and public acceptance issues; and (3) other challenges that could impede the successful implementation of the system. Key activities in the development of CAPPS II have been delayed, and the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has not yet completed important system planning activities. TSA is currently behind schedule in testing and developing initial increments of CAPPS II, due in large part to delays in obtaining needed passenger data for testing from air carriers because of privacy concerns. TSA also has not established a complete plan identifying specific system functionality that will be delivered, the schedule for delivery, and estimated costs. The establishment of such plans is critical to maintaining project focus and achieving intended results within budget. Without such plans, TSA is at an increased risk of CAPPS II not providing the promised functionality, of its deployment being delayed, and of incurring increased costs throughout the system's development. TSA also has not completely addressed seven of the eight issues identified by the Congress as key areas of interest related to the development, operation, and public acceptance of CAPPS II. Although TSA is in various stages of progress on addressing each of these eight issues, as of January 1, 2004, only one--the establishment of an internal oversight board to review the development of CAPPS II--has been fully addressed. However, concerns exist regarding the timeliness of the board's future reviews. Other issues, including ensuring the accuracy of data used by CAPPS II, stress testing, preventing unauthorized access to the system, and resolving privacy concerns have not been completely addressed, due in part to the early stage of the system's development. The following table is a summary of TSA's status in addressing the eight key issues. GAO identified three additional challenges TSA faces that may impede the success of CAPPS II. These challenges are developing the international cooperation needed to obtain passenger data, managing the possible expansion of the program's mission beyond its original purpose, and ensuring that identity theft--in which an individual poses as and uses information of another individual--cannot be used to negate the security benefits of the system. GAO believes that these issues, if not resolved, pose major risks to the successful deployment and implementation of CAPPS II."}
