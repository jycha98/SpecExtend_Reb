If any\nshould suspect the truth of what is here related, they are referred to\npeople now living who are acquainted with most of the facts mentioned\nin this narrative.\n\nThe reader is here presented with an account, not of a renowned\npolitician or warrior, but of an untutored African slave, brought into\nthis Christian country at eight years of age, wholly destitute of all\neducation but what he received in common with other domesticated\nanimals, enjoying no advantages that could lead him to suppose himself\nsuperior to the beasts, his fellow servants.  And if he shall enjoy no\nother advantage from perusing this narrative, he may experience those\nsensations of shame and indignation, that will prove him to be not\nwholly destitute of every noble and generous feeling.\n\nThe subject of the following pages, had he received only a common\neducation, might have been a man of high respectability and\nusefulness; and had his education been suited to his genius, he might\nhave been an ornament and an honor to human nature.  It may perhaps,\nnot be unpleasing to see the efforts of a great mind wholly\nuncultivated, enfeebled and depressed by slavery, and struggling under\nevery disadvantage.  The reader may here see a Franklin and a\nWashington, in a state of nature, or rather, in a state of slavery.\nDestitute as he is of all education, he still exhibits striking traces\nof native ingenuity and good sense.\n\nThis narrative exhibits a pattern of honesty, prudence, and industry,\nto people of his own colour; and perhaps some white people would not\nfind themselves degraded by imitating such an example.\n\nThe following account is published in compliance with the earnest\ndesire of the subject of it, and likewise a number of respectable\npersons who are acquainted with him.\n\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\n_Containing an account of his life, from his birth to the time of his\n                  leaving his native country._\n\nI was born at Dukandarra, in Guinea, about the year 1729.  My father's\nname was Saungm Furro, Prince of the Tribe of Dukandarra.  My father\nhad three wives.  Polygamy was not uncommon in that country,\nespecially among the rich, as every man was allowed to keep as many\nwives as he could maintain.  By his first wife he had three children.\nThe eldest of them was myself, named by my father Broteer.  The other\ntwo were named Cundazo and Soozaduka.  My father had two children by\nhis second wife, and one by his third.  I descended from a very large,\ntall and stout race of beings, much larger than the generality of\npeople in other parts of the globe, being commonly considerably above\nsix feet in height, and in every way well proportioned.\n\nThe first thing worthy of notice which I remember was, a contention\nbetween my father and mother, on account of my father's marrying his\nthird wife without the consent of his first and eldest, which was\ncontrary to the custom generally observed among my countrymen.  In\nconsequence of this rupture, my mother left her husband and country,\nand travelled away with her three children to the eastward.  I was\nthen five years old.  She took not the least sustenance along with\nher, to support either herself or children.  I was able to travel\nalong by her side; the other two of her offspring she carried one on\nher back, and the other being a sucking child, in her arms.  When we\nbecame hungry, my mother used to set us down on the ground, and gather\nsome of the fruits which grew spontaneously in that climate.  These\nserved us for food on the way.  At night we all lay down together in\nthe most secure place we could find, and reposed ourselves until\nmorning.  Though there were many noxious animals there; yet so kind\nwas our Almighty protector, that none of them were ever permitted to\nhurt or molest us.  Thus we went on our journey until the second day\nafter our departure from Dukandarra, when we came to the entrance of a\ngreat desert.  During our travel in that we were often affrighted with\nthe doleful howlings and yellings of wolves, lions, and other animals.\nAfter five days travel we came to the end of this desert, and\nimmediately entered into a beautiful and extensive interval country.\nHere my mother was pleased to stop and seek a refuge for me.  She left\nme at the house of a very rich farmer.  I was then, I should judge,\nnot less than one hundred forty miles from my native place, separated\nfrom all my relations and acquaintance.  At this place my mother took\nher farewell of me, and set out for her own country.  My new guardian,\nas I shall call the man with whom I was left, put me into the business\nof tending sheep, immediately after I was left with him.  The flock\nwhich I kept with the assistance of a boy, consisted of about forty.\nWe drove them every morning between two and three miles to pasture,\ninto the wide and delightful plains.  When night drew on, we drove\nthem home and secured them in the cote.  In this round I continued\nduring my stay there.  One incident that befel me when I was driving\nmy flock from pasture, was so dreadful to me at that age, and is to\nthis time fresh in my memory, that I cannot help noticing it in this\nplace.  Two large dogs sallied out of a certain house and set upon me.\nOne of them took me by the arm, and the other by the thigh, and before\ntheir master could come and relieve me, they lacerated my flesh to\nsuch a degree, that the scars are very visible to the present day.  My\nmaster was immediately sent for.  He came and carried me home, as I\nwas unable to go myself on account of my wounds.  Nothing remarkable\nhappened afterwards until my father sent for me to return home.\n\nBefore I dismiss this country, I must just inform my reader what I\nremember concerning this place.  A large river runs through this\ncountry in a westerly course.  The land for a great way on each side\nis flat and level, hedged in by a considerable rise of the country at\na great distance from it.  It scarce ever rains there, yet the land is\nfertile; great dews fall in the night which refresh the soil.  About\nthe latter end of June or first of July, the river begins to rise, and\ngradually increases until it has inundated the country for a great\ndistance, to a height of seven or eight feet.  This brings on a slime\nwhich enriches the land surprisingly.  When the river has subsided,\nthe natives begin to sow and plant, and the vegetation is exceedingly\nrapid.  Near this rich river my guardian's land lay.  He possessed, I\ncannot tell exactly how much, yet this I am certain of respecting it,\nthat he owned an immense tract.  He possessed likewise a great many\ncattle and goats.  During my stay with him I was kindly used, and with\nas much tenderness, for what I saw, as his only son, although I was an\nentire stranger to him, remote from friends and relations.  The\nprincipal occupation of the inhabitants there, were the cultivation of\nthe soil and the care of their flocks.  They were a people pretty\nsimilar in every respect to that of mine,  except in their persons,\nwhich were not so tall and stout.  They appeared to be very kind and\nfriendly.  I will now return to my departure from that place.\n\nMy father sent a man and horse after me.  After settling with my\nguardian for keeping me, he took me away and went for home.  It was\nthen about one year since my mother brought me here.  Nothing\nremarkable occured to us on our journey until we arrived safe home.\n\nI found then that the difference between my parents had been made up\nprevious to their sending for me.  On my return, I was received both\nby my father and mother with great joy and affection, and was once\nmore restored to my paternal dwelling in peace and happiness.  I was\nthen about six years old.\n\nNot more than six weeks had passed after my return, before a message\nwas brought by an inhabitant of the place where I lived the preceding\nyear to my father, that that place had been invaded by a numerous\narmy, from a nation not far distant, furnished with musical\ninstruments, and all kinds of arms then in use; that they were\ninstigated by some white nation who equipped and sent them to subdue\nand possess the country, that his nation had made no preparation for\nwar, having been for a long time in profound peace that they could not\ndefend themselves against such a formidable train of invaders, and\nmust therefore necessarily evacuate their lands to the fierce enemy,\nand fly to the protection of some chief; and that if he would permit\nthem they should come under his rule and protection when they had to\nretreat from their own possessions.  He was a kind and merciful\nprince, and therefore consented to these proposals.\n\nHe had scarcely returned to his nation with the message, before the\nwhole of his people were obliged to retreat from their country, and\ncome to my fathers dominions.\n\nHe gave them every privilege and all the protection his government\ncould afford.  But they had not been there longer than four days\nbefore news came to them that the invaders had laid waste their\ncountry, and were coming speedily to destroy them in my father's\nterritories. This affrighted them, and therefore they immediately\npushed off to the southward, into the unknown countries there, and\nwere never more heard of.\n\nTwo days after their retreat, the report turned out to be but too\ntrue.  A detachment of the enemy came to my father and informed him,\nthat the whole army was encamped not far out of his dominions, and\nwould invade the territory and deprive his people of their liberties\nand rights, if he did not comply with the following terms.  These were\nto pay them a large sum of money, three hundred fat cattle, and a\ngreat number of goats, sheep, asses, &c.\n\nMy father told the messenger that he would comply rather than that his\nsubjects should be deprived of their rights and privileges, which he\nwas not then in circumstances to defend from so sudden an invasion.\nUpon turning out those articles, the enemy pledged their faith and\nhonor that they would not attack him.  On these he relied and\ntherefore thought it unnecessary to be on his guard against the enemy.\nBut their pledges of faith and honor proved no better than those of\nother unprincipled hostile nations; for a few days after a certain\nrelation of the king came and informed him, that the enemy who sent\nterms of accommodation to him, and received tribute to their\nsatisfaction, yet meditated an attack on his subjects by surprise, and\nthat probably they would commence their attack in less than one day,\nand concluded with advising him, as he was not prepared for war, to\norder a speedy retreat of his family and subjects.  He complied with\nthis advice.\n\nThe same night which was fixed upon to retreat, my father and his\nfamily set off about break of day.  The king and his two younger wives\nwent in one company, and my mother and her children in another.  We\nleft our dwellings in succession, and my father's company went on\nfirst.  We directed our course for a large shrub plain, some distance\noff, where we intended to conceal ourselves from the approaching\nenemy, until we could refresh and rest ourselves a little.  But we\npresently found that our retreat was not secure.  For having struck up\na little fire for purposes of cooking victuals, the enemy who happened\nto be encamped a little distance off, had sent out a scouting party\nwhich discovered us by the smoke of the fire, just as we were\nextinguishing it and about to eat.  As soon as we had finished eating,\nmy father discovered the party, and immediately began to discharge\narrows at them.  This was what I first saw, and it alarmed both me and\nthe women, who being unable to make any resistance, immediately betook\nourselves to the tall thick reeds not far off, and left the old king\nto fight alone.  For some time, I beheld him from the reeds defending\nhimself with  great courage and firmness, till at last he was obliged\nto surrender himself into their hands.\n\nThen they came to us in the reeds, and the very first salute I had\nfrom them was a violent blow on the head with the fore part of a gun,\nand at the same time a grasp round the neck.  I then had a rope put\nabout my neck, as had all the women in the thicket with me, and were\nimmediately led to my father, who was likewise pinioned and haltered\nfor leading.  In this condition we were all led to the camp.  The\nwomen and myself being pretty submissive, had tolerable treatment from\nthe enemy, while my father was closely interrogated respecting his\nmoney which they knew he must have.  But as he gave them no account of\nit, he was instantly cut and pounded on his body with great\ninhumanity, that he might be induced by the torture he suffered to\nmake the discovery.  All this availed not the least to make him give\nup his money, but he despised all the tortures which they inflicted,\nuntil the continued exercise and increase of torment, obliged him to\nsink and expire.  He thus died without informing his enemies of the\nplace where his money lay.  I saw him while he was thus tortured to\ndeath.  The shocking scene is to this day fresh in my mind, and I have\noften been overcome while thinking on it.  He was a man of remarkable\nstature.  I should judge as much as six feet and six or seven inches\nhigh, two feet across his shoulders, and every way well proportioned.\nHe as a man of remarkable strength and resolution, affable, kind and\ngentle, ruling with equity and moderation.\n\nThe army of the enemy was large, I should suppose consisting of about\nsix thousand men.  Their leader was called Baukurre.  After destroying\nthe old prince, they decamped and immediately marched towards the sea,\nlying to the west, taking with them myself and the women prisoners.\nIn the march a scouting party was detached from the main army.  To the\nleader of this party I was made waiter, having to carry his gun, &c.\nAs we were a scouting we came across a herd of fat cattle, consisting\nof about thirty in number.  These we set upon, and immediately wrested\nfrom their keepers, and afterwards converted them into food for the\narmy.  The enemy had remarkable success in destroying the country\nwherever they went.  For as far as they had penetrated, they laid the\nhabitations waste and captured the people.  The distance they had now\nbrought me was about four hundred miles.  All the march I had very\nhard tasks imposed on me, which I must perform on pain of punishment.\nI was obliged to carry on my head a large flat stone used for grinding\nour corn, weighing as I should suppose, as much as 25 pounds; besides\nvictuals, mat and cooking utensils.  Though I was pretty large and\nstout of my age, yet these burthens were very grievous to me, being\nonly about six years and a half old.\n\nWe were then come to a place called Malagafco.  When we entered the\nplace we could not see the least appearance of either houses or\ninhabitants, but upon stricter search found, that instead of houses\nabove ground they had dens in the sides of hillocks, contiguous to\nponds and streams of water.  In these we perceived they had all hid\nthemselves, as I suppose they usually did upon such occasions.  In\norder to compel them to surrender, the enemy contrived to smoke them\nout with <DW19>s.  These they put to the entrance of the caves and set\nthem on fire.  While they were engaged in this business, to their\ngreat surprise some of them were desperately wounded with arrows which\nfell from above on them.  This mystery they soon found out.  They\nperceived that the enemy discharged these arrows through holes on the\ntop of the dens directly in to the air.  Their weight brought them\nback, point downwards on their enemies heads, whilst they were smoking\nthe inhabitants out.  The points of the arrows were poisoned, but\ntheir enemy had an antidote for it, which they instantly applied to\nthe wounded part.  The smoke at last obliged the people to give\nthemselves up.  They came out of their caves, first spatting the palms\nof their hands together, then and immediately after extended their\narms, crossed at their wrists, ready to be bound and pinioned.  I\nshould judge that the dens above mentioned were extended about eight\nfeet horizontally into the earth, five feet in height and as many\nwide.  They were arched over head and lined with earth, which was of\nthe clay kind, and made the surface of their walls firm and smooth.\n\nThe invaders then pinioned the prisoners of all ages and sexes\nindiscriminately, took their flocks and all their effects, and moved\non their way towards the sea.  On the march the prisoners were treated\nwith clemency, on account of their being submissive and humble.\nHaving come to the next tribe, the enemy laid siege and immediately\ntook men, women, children, flocks, and all their valuable effects.\nThey then went on to the next district which was contiguous with the\nsea, called in Africa, Anamaboo.  The enemies provisions were then\nalmost spent, as well as their strength.  The inhabitants knowing what\nkind of conduct they had pursued, and what were their present\nintentions, improved the favorable opportunity, attacked them, and\ntook enemy, prisoners, flocks and all their effects.  I was then taken\na second time.  All of us were then put into the castle, and kept for\nmarket.  On a certain time I and other prisoners were put on board a\ncanoe, under our master, and rowed away to a vessel belonging to Rhode\nIsland, commanded by capt. Collingwood, and the mate Thomas Mumford.\nWhile we were going to the vessel, our master told us all to appear to\nthe best possible advantage for sale.  I was bought on board by one\nRobertson Mumford, steward of said vessel, for four gallons of rum,\nand a piece of calico, and called VENTURE, on account of his having\npurchased me with his own private venture.  Thus I came by my name.\nAll the slaves that were bought for that vessel's cargo, were two\nhundred and sixty.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\n  _Containing an account of his life, from the time of his leaving\n               Africa, to that of his becoming free._\n\nAfter all the business was ended on the coast of Africa, the ship\nsailed from thence to Barbadoes.  After an ordinary passage, except\ngreat mortality from small pox, which broke out on board, we arrived\nat the island of Barbadoes: but when we reached it, there were found\nout of the two hundred and sixty that sailed from Africa, not more\nthan two hundred alive.  These were all sold, except for myself and\nthree more, to the planters there.\n\nThe vessel then sailed for Rhode Island, and arrived there after a\ncomfortable passage.  Here my master sent me to live with one of his\nsisters, until he could carry me to Fisher's Island, the place of his\nresidence.  I had then competed my eighth year.  After staying with\nhis sister some time I was taken to my master's place to live.\n\nWhen we arrived at Narragansett, my master went ashore in order to\nreturn a part of the way by land, and gave me the charge of the keys\nof his trunks on board the vessel, and charged me not to deliver them\nup to any body, not even to his father without his orders.  To his\ndirections I promised faithfully to conform.  When I arrived with my\nmaster's articles at his house, my master's father asked me for his\nson's keys, as he wanted to see what his trunks contained.  I told him\nthat my master intrusted me with the care of them until he should\nreturn, and that I had given him my word to be faithful to the trust,\nand could not therefore give him or any other person the keys without\nmy master's directions.  He insisted that I should deliver him the\nkeys, threatening to punish me if I did not.  But I let him know that\nhe should not have them say what he would.  He then laid aside trying\nto get them.  But notwithstanding he appeared to give up trying to\nobtain them from me, yet I mistrusted that he would take some time\nwhen I was off my guard, either in the day time or at night to get\nthem, therefore I slung them around my neck, and in the day concealed\nthem in my bosom, and at night I always lay with them under me, that\nno person might take them from me without being apprized of it.  Thus\nI kept the keys from every body until my master came home.  When he\nreturned he asked where VENTURE was.  As I was then within hearing, I\ncame, said, here sir, at your service.  He asked me for his keys, and\nI immediately took them off my neck and reached them out to him.  He\ntook them, stroked my hair, and commended me, saying in presence of\nhis father that his young VENTURE was so faithful that he would never\nhave been able to have taken the keys from him but by violence; that\nhe should not fear to trust him with his whole fortune, for that he\nhad been in his native place so habituated to keeping his word, that\nhe would sacrifice even his life to maintain it.\n\nThe first of the time of living at my master's own place, I was pretty\nmuch employed in the house at carding wool and other household\nbusiness.  In this situation I continued for some years, after which\nmy master put me to work out of doors.  After many proofs of my\nfaithfulness and honesty, my master began to put great confidence in\nme.  My behavior to him had as yet been submissive and obedient.  I\nthen began to have hard tasks imposed on me.  Some of these were to\npound four bushels of ears of corn every night in a barrel for the\npoultry, or be rigorously punished.  At other seasons of the year I\nhad to card wool until a very late hour.  These tasks I had to perform\nwhen I was about nine years old.  Some time after I had another\ndifficulty and oppression which was greater than any I had ever\nexperienced since I came into this country.  This was to serve two\nmasters.  James Mumford, my master's son, when his father had gone\nfrom home in the morning, and given me a stint to perform that day,\nwould order me to do _this_ and _that_ business different from what my\nmaster directed me.  One day in particular, the authority which my\nmaster's son had set up, had like to have produce melancholy effects.\nFor my master having set me off my business to perform that day and\nthen left me to perform it, his son came up to me in the course of the\nday, big with authority, and and commanded me very arrogantly to quit\nmy present business and go directly about what he should order me.  I\nreplied to him that my master had given me so much to perform that\nday, and that I must therefore faithfully complete it in that time.\nHe then broke out in a great rage, snatched a pitchfork and went to\nlay me over the head therewith; but I as soon got another and defended\nmyself with it, or otherwise he might have murdered me in his outrage.\nHe immediately called some people who were hearing at work for him,\nand ordered them to take his hair rope and and come and bind me with\nit.  They all tried to bind me but in vain, tho' there were three\nassistants in number.  My upstart master than desisted, put his pocket\nhandkerchief before his eyes and went home with a design to tell his\nmother of the struggle with young VENTURE.  He told her that their\nyoung VENTURE had become so stubborn that he could not controul him,\nand asked her what he should do with him.  In the mean time I\nrecovered my temper, voluntarily caused myself to be bound by the same\nmen who tried in vain before, and carried before my young master, that\nhe might do what he pleased with me.  He took me to a gallows made for\nthe purpose of hanging cattle on, and suspended me on it.  Afterwards\nhe ordered one of his hands to go to the peach orchard and cut him\nthree dozens of whips to punish me with.  These were brought to him,\nand that was all that was done with them, as I was released and went\nto work after hanging on the gallows about an hour.\n\nAfter I lived with my master thirteen years, being then about twenty\ntwo years old, I married Meg, a slave of his who was about my age.  My\nmaster owned a certain Irishman, named Heddy, who about that time\nformed a plan of secretly leaving his master.  After he had long had\nthis plan in meditation he suggested it to me.  At first I cast a deaf\near on it, and rebuked Heddy for harboring in his mind such a rash\nundertaking.  But after he had persuaded and much enchanted me with\nthe prospect of gaining my freedom with such a method, I at length\nagreed to accompany him.  Heddy next inveigled two of his fellow\nservants to accompany us.  The place to which we designed to go was\nthe Mississippi.  Our next business was to lay in a sufficient store\nof provisions for our voyage.  We privately collected out of our\nmaster's store, six great old cheeses, two firkins of butter, and one\nwhole batch of new bread.  When we had gathered all our own clothes\nand some more, we took them all about midnight, and went to the water\nside.  We stole our master's boat, embarked, then directed our course\nfor the Mississippi river.\n\nWe mutually confederated not to betray or desert one another on pain\nof death.  We first steered our course for Montauk point, the east end\nof Long-Island.  After our arrival there we landed, and Heddy and I\nmade an incursion into the island after fresh water, while our two\ncomrades were left at a little distance from the boat, employed at\ncooking.  When Heddy and I had sought some time for water, he returned\nto our companions, and I continued on looking for my object.  When\nHeddy had performed his business with our companions, who were engaged\nin cooking, he went directly to the boat, stole all the clothes in it,\nand then travelled away for East-Hampton, as I was informed.  I\nreturned to my fellows not long after.  They informed me that our\nclothes were stolen, but could not determine who was the thief, yet\nthey suspected Heddy as he was missing.  After reproving my two\ncomrades for not taking care of our things which were in the boat, I\nadvertised Heddy and sent two men in search of him.  They pursued and\novertook him at Southampton and returned him to the boat.  I then\nthought it might afford some chance for my freedom, or at least a\npalliation for my running away, to return Heddy immediately to his\nmaster, and inform him that I was induced to go away by Heddy's\naddress.  Accordingly I set off with him and the rest of my companions\nfor our master's, and arrived there without any difficulty.  I\ninformed my master that Heddy was the ringleader of our revolt, and\nthat he had used us ill.  He immediately put Heddy into custody, and\nmyself and companions were well received and went to work as usual.\n\nNot a long time passed after that, before Heddy was sent by my master\nto New-London gaol.  At the close of that year I was sold to a Thomas\nStanton, and had to be separated from my wife and one daughter, who\nwas about one month old.  He resided at Stonington-point.  To this\nplace I brought with me from my last master's, two johannes, three old\nSpanish dollars, and two thousand of coppers, besides five pounds of\nmy wife's money.  This money I got by cleaning gentlemen's shoes and\ndrawing boots, by catching musk-rats and minks, raising potatoes and\ncarrots, &c. and by fishing in the night, and at odd spells.\n\nAll this money amounting to near twenty-one pounds York currency, my\nmaster's brother, Robert Stanton, hired of me, for which he gave me\nhis note.  About one year and a half after that time, my master\npurchased my wife and and her child, for severn hundred pounds old\ntenor.  One time my master sent me two miles after a barrel of\nmolasses, and ordered me to carry it on my shoulders.  I made out to\ncarry it all the way to my master's house.  When I lived with Captain\nGeorge Mumford, only to try my strength, I took up on my knees a\ntierce of salt containing seven bushels, and carried it two or three\nrods.  Of this fact there are several eye witnesses now living.\n\nTowards the close of the time that I resided with this master, I had a\nfalling out with my mistress.  This happened one time when my master\nwas gone to Long-Island a gunning.  At first the quarrel began between\nmy wife and her mistress.  I was then at work in the barn, and hearing\na racket in the house, induced me to run there and see what had broken\nout.  When I entered the house, I found my mistress in a violent\npassion with my wife, for what she informed me was a mere trifle; such\na small affair that I forbear to put my mistress to the shame of\nhaving it known.  I earnestly requested my wife to beg pardon of her\nmistress for the sake of peace even if she had given no just occasion\nfor offence.  But whilst I was thus saying my mistress turned the\nblows which she was repeating on my wife to me.  She took down her\nhorse-whip, and while she was glutting her fury with it, I reached out\nmy great black hand, raised it up and received the blows of the whip\non it which were designed for my head.  Then I immediately committed\nthe whip to the devouring fire.\n\nWhen my master returned from the island, his wife told him of the\naffair, but for the present he seemed to take no notice of it, and\nmentioned not a word of it to me.  Some days after his return, in the\nmorning as I was putting on a log in the fire-place, not suspecting\nharm from any one, I received a most violent stroke on the crown of my\nhead with a club two feet long and and as large around as a chair-\npost.  This blow very badly wounded my head, and the scar of it\nremains to this day.  The first blow made me have my wits about me as\nyou may suppose, for as soon as he went to renew it, I snatched the\nclub out of his hands and dragged him out of the door.  He then sent\nfor his brother to come and assist him, but I presently left my\nmaster, took the club he wounded me with, carried it to a neighboring\nJustice of the Peace, and complained of my master.  He finally advised\nme to return to my master, and live contented with him until he abused\nme again, and then complain.  I consented to do accordingly.  But\nbefore I set out for my master's, up he come and his brother Robert\nafter me.  The Justice improved this convenient opportunity to caution\nmy master.  He asked him for what he treated his slave thus hastily\nand unjustly, and told him what would be the consequence if he\ncontinued the same treatment towards me.  After the Justice had ended\nhis discourse with my master, he and his brother set out with me for\nhome, one before and the other behind me.  When they had come to a bye\nplace, they both dismounted their respective horses, and fell to\nbeating me with great violence.

JOHNSON\n\nColumbia University, New York\n\n1917.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPUBLISHER'S NOTE.\n\n\n_The following letter, written by Professor Douglas W. Johnson, of\nColumbia University, is in reply to a letter, pleading the cause of\nGermany, which he received from a German correspondent. Professor\nJohnson's letter appeared in the \"Revue de Paris\" of September_, 1916.\n\n\n\n\nPLAIN WORDS FROM AMERICA\n\n_February_, 1916.\n\nYour two letters, with enclosed newspaper clippings, and your postal\ncard were duly received. I can assure you that my failure to reply more\npromptly was not meant as any discourtesy. The clippings were gladly\nreceived, for I am always anxious to read what prominent Germans regard\nas able and convincing presentations of their side of disputed matters.\nYour own letters, particularly the long one of July 9, were read most\ncarefully. I appreciate your earnest endeavour to convince me of the\nrighteousness of your country's cause, and am not unmindful of the time\nand trouble you spent in preparing for me so carefully worded a\npresentation of the German point of view touching several matters of the\nprofoundest importance to our two Governments.\n\nMy failure to reply has been due to a doubt in my own mind as to whether\ngood would be accomplished by any letter which I could write. I could\nnot agree with your opinions regarding Germany's responsibility for the\nwar, nor regarding her methods of conducting the war; and it did not\nseem to me that you would profit by any statement I might make as to the\nreasons for my own opinions on such vital matters. Your letters clearly\nshowed that you wrote under the influence of an intense emotion--an\nemotion which I can both understand and respect, but which might well\nmake it impossible for you to accord a dispassionate reception to a\nreply which controverted your own views. With your country surrounded by\npowerful foes, with your sons deluging alien soil in an heroic defence\nof your Government's decrees, with the nation you love most dearly\nstanding in moral isolation, condemned by the entire neutral world for\nbarbarous crimes against civilisation, you could hardly be expected to\nwrite with that scientific accuracy and care which would, in normal\ntimes, be your ideal.\n\nFor this reason I have not resented much in your letters which would\notherwise call for earnest protest. I feel sure, for example, your\nassertion that I and my fellow-countrymen derive our opinions of German\nconduct wholly from corrupt and venal newspapers, or usually from a\nsingle newspaper which doles out mental poison in subservience to a\nsingle political party, was not intended to be as insulting as it really\nsounded. Your emotion doubtless led you to make charges which your sense\nof justice and courtesy would, under other circumstances, condemn. I\nbelieve also that in a calmer time you would not entertain the sweeping\nopinion that \"the daily press has become one of the direst plagues of\nhumanity, an ulcer in the frame of society, whose one object it is, for\nprivate ends (wealth, political influence, and social position), to pit\nthe races, nations, religions, and classes against one another.\" I\nrealise that some of our papers are a disgrace to the high calling of\njournalism; I believe that some sacrifice honour for gain and that some\nare subservient to special interests; but the roll of American\njournalists is honoured by the presence of many names which command\nrespect at home and abroad because of a long-standing reputation for\nhonesty, fearlessness, and distinguished service in the cause of\nhumanity. To one such name was added at our last commencement the degree\nrepresenting one of the highest honours which Columbia University has to\nbestow upon a man of lofty ideals and honourable achievement. The paper\nedited by this man is among those most extensively read by myself and\nhundreds of thousands of other Americans who demand to know the truth.\nHowever low may be the moral plane of some newspapers, your\ncharacterisation of all newspapers as mere business concerns, founded\nand carried on with the purpose of enriching their owners, and\nsupporting certain special interests, \"quite regardless of their effect,\nbeneficial or the reverse, upon the real public interests of their own\ncountry, regardless of truth and justice,\" is not at all true of the\nclass of papers read by the majority of intelligent Americans. I am not\nsufficiently familiar with a large number of German newspapers to make\nassertions as to their standards; but, in spite of the smaller amount\nof freedom allowed to the press in your country, I can scarcely imagine\nthat conditions are bad enough to justify your sweeping condemnation of\nall newspapers.\n\nIf you had stopped to consider the radically different relations\nexisting between the press and the Government in Germany and in America,\nyou would scarcely have fallen into the error of asserting that a\nconsiderable proportion of our papers, in common with those of other\nnations, have \"laboured in the employ or at the instigation of\" the\nGovernment, \"with all the implements of mendacity and defamation, to\nspread hatred and contempt for Germany.\" Unlike your own, our press is\nwholly free from Government control. Any attempt on the part of our\nGovernment to dictate the policy of any newspaper would be hotly\nresented, and would be doomed to certain failure. Americans do not\nbelieve in the German doctrine that the press must be \"so far controlled\nas is requisite for the welfare of the community,\" and hold that\nabsolute freedom of speech is essential to true liberty. There is no\ncensorship of the American press. You have a censorship which all the\noutside world knows has been wonderfully effective in keeping some\nimportant facts from the knowledge of the German people. No American\npaper can be suppressed because of what it prints. You are, of course,\nwell aware that, on more than one occasion, German papers have been\nsuppressed for certain periods because your Government did not believe\nthat what they said was for the good of the country. I enclose a message\nreceived by wireless under German control which is only one of the many\nannouncements telling of suppression of your papers. It does not alter\nthe situation to say that censorship and suppression are necessary for\nthe good of the Fatherland, and that the papers in question deserved to\nbe suppressed. The vital fact remains that your newspapers are not free\nto publish anything they like. Ours are thus free. Every issue of your\npapers must be submitted to your police, so that your rulers may control\nwhat you write and read. Not a paper in America is submitted to any\nofficial whatever. You cannot read anything which your Government\nbelieves it wise to keep from you. We can read everything, whether the\nGovernment likes it or not. Americans believe there can be no truly free\npress, and no real unfettered public opinion, with the possibility of\npunishment hanging over the press of a country. Where the police,\nrepresenting the ruling power, controls the press there is no true\nliberty. Whatever else may be said against the American press, it must\nbe admitted that it is free from Government control. It is not\nnecessary, therefore, to inquire whether the American Government has\nemployed or instigated the public press to attack Germany, since, even\nif it desired to do so, it would not dare make the attempt.\n\nThere are many other statements in your letters which can only be\nexplained as the result of writing under stress of intense emotion; you\nwould probably wish to modify many of these were you writing under\nhappier circumstances. It is not my desire, however, to dwell upon this\nphase of your correspondence. I do not for a moment doubt your\nsincerity, and believe you were yourself convinced of the truth of all\nyou wrote. My purpose in writing this letter is to accept in good faith\nyour expressed wish for a better understanding between two peoples who\nhave long been on friendly terms with one another, and to contribute\ntoward this end by removing, at least so far as we two are concerned,\none serious misunderstanding which now exists.\n\nAs you are well aware, the American people, with the exception of a\ncertain proportion of German-born population, are practically unanimous\nin condemning Germany for bringing on the war and for conducting it in a\nbarbarous manner. You, together with hosts of your fellow-countrymen,\nbelieve this unfavourable opinion is the result of the truth being kept\nfrom the American public by improper means. It is, of course, a\ncomforting thought to you that when the whole truth is known we will\nrevise our opinions and realise that Germany acted righteously, and was\nnot guilty of the crimes which have been charged against her. But, as a\nscientific man, devoted to the search for truth, no matter where it\nleads you, you would not want to deceive yourself with such a comforting\nassurance if it were founded on false premises. If, therefore, you\nreally want to know the conditions under which American opinion of\nGermany's conduct has been formed, I will endeavour to describe them\nwith the same calmness and careful attention to accuracy which I\nearnestly endeavour to observe in my scientific investigations. In\ndiscussing this vitally important matter, I will first endeavour to\npicture the American opinion of Germany and the Germans before the war,\nsince this was the background upon which later opinions were formed. I\nwill then explain the sources of information which were open to\nAmericans after the war began; and will next describe how this\ninformation produced an American opinion unfavourable to Germany, as\nobserved by one who has read widely and watched the trend of his\ncountry's thought with keen interest. If this analysis is successful in\nconvincing you that American opinion does not rest on English lies, is\nnot the result of a venal press controlled by British gold, but has a\nfar more substantial foundation, then my letter will not have been\nwritten in vain. If you are not convinced, but prefer to retain the\ncomforting belief that if America only knew the truth it would applaud\nGermany's actions, then I shall, at least, have the satisfaction of\nknowing that I earnestly endeavoured, in good faith, to return the\ncourtesy which you showed me when you wrote so fully, by telling you\nwith equal fulness the truth as I see it.\n\n\n\n\nI.\n\n\nFirst, then, let me picture the background of public opinion toward\nGermany and the Germans as I saw it before the war began. Inasmuch as\none's vision may be affected favourably or unfavourably by his personal\nexperiences, it is only fair that I state briefly my own experiences\nwith people of German birth or parentage. One of my earliest\nrecollections is of a German maid in our household who taught me to make\nmy wants known in the German language, and also taught me to love her as\nI did members of my own family. In college, one of my two favourite\nprofessors and one of my college chums were of German parentage. Both\nthese men are still valued friends, and both believe in the\nrighteousness of Germany's cause. I have spent parts of three summers in\nGermany, and have many German friends, both in America and in Europe.\nThe two Europeans in my special field of science for whom I have the\ngreatest personal affection are German professors in Berlin and Leipzig\nrespectively. I have more personal friends in the German army than in\nthe Allied armies. My sister is married to a professor of German\ndescent and German sympathies. Surely, therefore, if personal\nrelationships prejudice me at all, they should prejudice me in favour of\nGermans and things German.\n\nIn my opinion, the American estimate of Germany and her citizens prior\nto the war was, in general, most favourable. Certainly America looked\nwith admiration upon the remarkable advance achieved by Germany in the\nshort space of forty years. To your universities we have always\nacknowledged a great debt. We have profited much by your advances in\neconomic lines and admired the combination of scientific research and\nbusiness which made your countrymen efficient in many lines. The large\nnumber of your people who have emigrated to America have, in the main,\nmade good citizens, and we have welcomed them as among the best of the\nforeigners who flock to our shores. German music and German musicians\nfind nowhere a more cordial welcome than here where admiration for their\nachievements is unstinted. Nor have we forgotten the heroic services of\nthe many Germans who laid down their lives in defence of our flag, that\nthe Union might live. The Germans' love of honour and family has touched\nthe American heart in a tender spot, and many of my acquaintances admit\nthat with no other foreigners do they establish such intimate and\naffectionate relations as with their German friends.\n\nThis admiration and friendship has not blinded us to certain defects in\nthe German character, any more than has your friendship for Americans\nclosed your eyes to our defects. The bad manners of Germans are\nproverbial, not only among Americans, but all over the world; so much so\nthat certain German writers, admitting that Germans as a nation are\nill-mannered, have sought to find in this fact an explanation for the\nworld-wide antagonism toward Germany's policy in the war. I do not\nbelieve, however, that, so far as American sentiment is concerned, there\nis any considerable element of truth in this explanation. It is true\nthat we do not like the lack of respect accorded to women by the average\nGerman; that the position of woman in Germany seems to us anomalous in a\nnation claiming a superior type of civilisation; that the bumptious\nattitude of the German \"intellectual\" amuses or disgusts us; and that\nthe insolence of your young officers who elbow us off the sidewalks in\nyour cities makes us long to meet those individuals again outside the\nboundaries of Germany, where no military Government, jealous of their\n\"honour,\" could protect them from the thrashing they deserve. It is also\ntrue that, at international congresses, excursions and banquets,\nattended by both men and women representatives of all nations, the\nGermans have gained an unenviable reputation for bad manners because\nthey have pushed themselves into the best places, crowded into the\ntrains ahead of the women, and generally ignored the courtesies due to\nladies and gentlemen associated with them. But, in spite of our full\nrecognition of this undesirable national trait, I doubt whether any\ngreat number of Americans have permitted a dislike of German manners to\naffect their opinion as to German morals in the conduct of war, though\nsome do hold that lack of good manners is a characteristic mark of\ninferior civilisation. On the whole, we have been inclined to be\ntolerant of German rudeness, regarding it as in part due to the rapid\nmaterial development of a young nation, and possibly as, in part, the\nresult of over-aggressiveness fostered by a military training.\n\nIt is only fair to say, also, that our admiration of Germany's\nachievements in art, literature, and science never led us so far as to\naccept the claim of superiority in these lines advanced by many Germans\non behalf of their country. The insistence with which this claim has\nbeen reiterated and proclaimed abroad by Germans, often with more of\npatriotism than of good taste, may have led a part of the public to\nbelieve it. But the more intelligent and thoughtful portion of the\npeople, accustomed to analyse such claims by careful comparison with the\nproducts of non-Teutonic civilisation, has been unable to find any\nadequate basis for the assumed superiority. Indeed, while intelligent\nand fair-minded Americans are not slow to recognise Germany's great\ncontributions to the world's art, literature, and science, they believe\nthat, with the possible exception of music, greater contributions have\nbeen made in these lines by France, England, and other nations. In the\nrealm of invention, we fully appreciate the skill and resourcefulness\nmanifested by the German people in adapting new discoveries to their own\nneeds; but we cannot deny the fact that most of the discoveries which\nhave played so vital a part in the development of modern civilisation\nhave been made, not in Germany, but in other countries.\n\nIn regard to municipal government and various forms of social\nlegislation, we have long recognised the high position held by your\nnation. But in the more vital matter of the relation of the individual to\nthe supreme governing power, we have always held, and still believe,\nthat Germany is sadly reactionary. For half a century your professors,\nin the employ of an educational system controlled by a bureaucratic\nGovernment, have taught what we condemn as a false philosophy of\ngovernment. Your histories, your books on philosophy, your whole\nliterature, glorify the _State_; and you have accepted the dangerous\ndoctrine that the individual exists to serve the State, forgetting that\nthe State is not the mystical, divine thing you picture it, but a\ngovernment carried on by human beings like yourselves, most of them\nreasonably upright, but some incompetent and others deliberately bad,\njust like any other human government. We believe that the only excuse\nfor the existence of the State is to serve the individual, to create\nconditions which will insure the greatest liberty and highest possible\ndevelopment to the individual citizen. It has never seemed to us\ncreditable to the German intellect that it could be satisfied with a\ntheory of government outgrown by most other civilised nations. That you\nshould confuse efficiency with freedom has always seemed to us a tragic\nmistake, and never so tragic as now, when a small coterie of human\nbeings, subject to the same mistakes and sins as other human beings, can\nhurl you into a terrible war before you know what has happened, clap on\na rigid censorship to keep out any news they do not want you to learn,\nthen publish a white book which pretends to explain the causes of the\nwar, but omits documents of the most vital importance, thereby causing\nthe people of a confiding nation to drench the earth with their\nlife-blood in the fond illusion that the war was forced upon them, and\nthat they are fighting for a noble cause. Most pitiful is the sad\ncomment of an intelligent German woman in a letter recently received in\nthis country: \"We, of course, only see such things as the Government\nthinks best. We were told that this war was purely a defensive one,\nforced upon us. I begin to believe this may not be true, but hope for a\nfavourable ending.\"\n\nCertainly in what you wrote to me you were thoroughly sincere and\nhonest; yet your letter was full of untrue statements because you were\ndependent for your information upon a Government-controlled press which\nhas misled you for military and political reasons. How can a nation know\nthe truth, think clearly, and act righteously when a few men, called the\n\"State,\" can commit you to the most serious enterprise in your history\nwithout your previous knowledge or consent, and can then keep you in\nignorance of vitally important documents and activities in order to\ninsure your full support of their perilous undertaking? Such is the\nthought which has always led America to denounce as false the old theory\nof \"divine right of kings,\" long imposed upon the German people in the\nmore subtle and, therefore, more dangerous form of \"the divine right of\nthe State.\" Our conviction that such a government as yours is\nreactionary and incompatible with true liberty, and that it stunts and\nwarps the intellects of its citizens, has been amply confirmed by\nextended observation in your country, and more particularly by the\nunanswerable fact that millions of your best blood, including\ndistinguished men of intelligence and wealth, have forsaken Germany to\nseek true liberty of intellect and action in America, renouncing\nallegiance to the Fatherland to become citizens here. Some of them\nstill love the scenes of their childhood, but few of them would be\nwilling to return to a life under such a Government as Germany\npossesses.\n\nTo summarise what I said above: Americans, prior to the war, admired the\nremarkable advances made by Germany in recent years in economic and\ncommercial lines; held in high regard your universities and many of your\nuniversity professors; loved your music, and felt most cordial toward\nthe millions of Germans who came to live among us and share the benefits\nof our free institutions. The prevalence of bad manners among Germans we\nregretted, but made allowance for this defect; and we did not fail to\nrecognise that some Germans are fine gentlemen of the most perfect\nculture, while most of them have traits of character which we admired.\n\nWe recognised the immense value of Germany's contributions to art,\nliterature, and science, but did not consider Germany's contributions in\nthese lines as equal to those of other nations. We never have regarded\nGerman culture as superior, but rather as inferior, to that of certain\nother countries; and the Germans' loud claims to superiority have seemed\nto us egotistical and the result of a weak point in the German\ncharacter. For your form of government and the philosophy of history\ntaught by your university professors we could never have much admiration\nor respect. Both seemed to us unworthy of an intelligent, civilised\npeople, and sure to lead to disaster. Your military preparations,\nevident to every observant visitor, have long caused us to distrust your\nGovernment and to consider your country a menace to the world's peace.\nIn a word, we admired and loved your people, although we considered them\nneither perfect nor even superior to other people; but we disapproved\nand distrusted your reactionary military Government.\n\n\n\n\nII.\n\n\nSuch was our attitude when the war burst upon the world. Since that time\nwhat opportunities have the American people had to form an intelligent\nopinion as to who was wrong and who was right? What sources of\ninformation have been open to us, what means of getting at the facts?\nHave we been drowned in English lies, as several of your professors have\nwritten me is the case? Have we relied on one corrupt party newspaper,\nas you intimate is our habit? Have we been dependent on a press bought\nup with English gold, as is continually asserted by the German press?\n\nIn the first place, we have relied in part upon our previous knowledge\nof the German Government and the German people. The hundreds of\nAmericans who have studied in your universities, the thousands who have\nvisited your country, and the millions who have come into close contact\nwith Germans in this country, all have a pretty good idea of the German\ntype of mind, German standards of national morality, German virtues and\ndefects. Americans have, of course, used this information in reaching a\nconclusion as to the truth or falsehood of charges against Germany. I\ntalked with some of our American professors just as they landed on the\npier in New York fresh from a summer in Germany which was cut short by\nthe outbreak of the war. They came direct from your country and were as\nfully informed of the German points of view right up to the declaration\nof war as were any of your citizens. Many Americans who have spent\nmonths and even years on German soil, and who know the country and the\npeople intimately, have made us well acquainted with German standards\nand German methods of thinking.\n\nIt is true that since the war began much of our news has come through\ncables controlled by the Allies; but Americans have too much common\nsense to accept such reports as final. News from biassed sources is\nalways accepted with reservation, and not fully believed unless\nconfirmed from independent sources. Furthermore, Americans have never\nlacked for first-hand information from Germany. Direct wireless reports\nfrom your country to several stations in America have given us a\nvaluable check on cable reports. German papers come to us regularly, and\nare continually and extensively quoted. Germany has sent special agents\nto this country to represent her side of every issue. The speeches and\nwritings of these agents have been published repeatedly and at length in\nalmost every paper in our country from the Atlantic to the Pacific.\nAmerican correspondents in Germany and in the war-zone have told as much\nas your censors would permit concerning what they saw of Germany and\nGermany's army. Many Americans have returned from Germany during the\nwar, and have published their experiences and impressions. Some of them\nhave seen your army at work, suffered from its inhumanity, and been\nsubjected to outrages and indignities by the civil officials of your\nGovernment. Others were dined and honoured as notable guests and given\nunusual opportunities for seeing as much as your officials wanted them\nto see. Both have offered valuable first-hand testimony as to the\nbehaviour of the German nation at war. Your university professors and\nother prominent citizens of your country have written us circular and\nprivate letters without number, presenting Germany's arguments in every\nconceivable form. Your Ambassador and other officials of your Government\nhave been most active in keeping first-hand information before the\nAmerican public. Thousands of your reservists, unable to cross the sea\nin safety, remain in this country to talk and write in behalf of their\nFatherland.\n\nIn addition to all this, Germany's cause has been most vigorously\nchampioned by many Germans and German-Americans long resident in\nAmerica. Muensterberg and others have published numerous articles and\nbooks in Germany's favour. Every possible plea to justify Germany's\nposition has been enthusiastically spread abroad by the German-American\npress, and with that love of \"fair play\" which is a widely-recognised\ncharacteristic of Americans, even those papers which believe Germany\nresponsible for the war and its worst horrors, have printed volumes of\nmaterial from pro-German authors in order that the whole truth might be\nknown by a full and free discussion of both sides of every question. I\nhave read many pro-German articles in the _New York Times_, the _New\nYork Sun_, the _Outlook_, and other papers and magazines opposed to\nGerman policy--articles by Muensterberg, Kuno Franke, Von Bernstorff,\nDernburg, and other staunch defenders of Germany. The columns of our\npapers are freely open to every authoritative champion of the German\ncause, no matter what the editorial policy of the papers may be. Never\nwas fuller and freer opportunity for defence accorded to anyone than has\nbeen given to the friends of Germany to present in print to the American\npublic every possible justification for Germany's acts. Only the\ngrossest ignorance of the actual facts could ever lead anyone to make\nthe charge in good faith that the truth about Germany has been\nconcealed from Americans. Your letter did not contain a single statement\nor argument that has not been printed over and over again in papers from\none end of America to the other by various defenders of the German\ncause. Germany's official documents issued in defence of her position at\nthe beginning of the war, her charges of atrocities against her enemies\nand her supposed proofs of the falsity of atrocity charges against the\nGermans, have all been published fully and widely, although you seem not\nto be aware of this fact.\n\nStill further, in addition to the legitimate publicity in favour of\nGermany related above, there has been forced upon the American public\nthe most stupendous propaganda which the world has ever witnessed.\nMillions of dollars have been spent by German agents in a colossal\nendeavour to shape public opinion. America has been literally deluged\nwith leaflets, pamphlets, books, articles, and advertisements,\nsubsidised by these propagandists. Money has been lavishly spent in\nevery form of appeal which might be expected to turn American sentiment\nagainst the Allies and in favour of the Teutons. Contributions have been\nwidely solicited to finance this propaganda, and one of my colleagues in\nColumbia is among those bearing German names who, in published letters,\nhave refused to support this moneyed campaign, engineered by German\nagents. Strikes have been organised in our factories, newspapers have\nbeen subsidised, labour orators have been employed to incite trouble,\nall with gold supplied from Teutonic sources. Ambassador Dumba was\nforced to leave this country because of the capture of secret letters\nrevealing plots to organise strikes in our munitions factories, to buy\nup orators to incite workmen to discontent, and to pay newspapers for\nadvancing the German propaganda. For all of this the Austrian Government\nwas to supply the necessary funds. German spies now in our prisons have\nadmitted that they were sent here by high German officials and provided\nwith ample supplies of money to engage in secret plots against our\nneutrality with the object of stopping munition shipments. German\nofficials in this country have admitted handling millions of dollars in\nillegal operations carried on in defiance of our laws and in insolent\ndisregard of international diplomatic courtesy. Our courts have\nconvicted and sentenced to 18 months' penal servitude three high German\nofficials of the Hamburg-American Steamship Line for a conspiracy to\nhelp German warships in defiance of our laws. These officials admitted\nspending nearly two million dollars of German gold in this illegal work.\nOur detectives estimate that German authorities have spent twenty-seven\nmillion dollars in America alone to influence us against the Allies, to\nstir up trouble against us in labour circles, and to foment a revolution\nin Mexico to our embarrassment. Our Government asked that the German\nMilitary and Naval Attaches be removed from this country because of\ntheir insolent violations of our neutrality, by activities in connection\nwith which they handled immense sums of German gold for the propaganda\nto influence us against England and in favour of Germany.\n\nFor every pamphlet, paper, or article sent to me by English, French,\nRussian, and Italian organisations I get several dozen from German\norganisations. I get but a few circulars a month from Allied countries.\nNot a week passes that I do not receive many from German sources.\nAmerica has been flooded with German propagandist literature; very\nlittle ever comes from other countries. Full-page advertisements, paid\nby German agents, have appeared repeatedly in American papers, urging\nthe merits of Germany's case. I have never seen one on behalf of the\nAllies. All over New York City, before I left for my summer vacation,\nwere giant posters on the billboards, put there by a pro-German society,\nurging the people to ask President Wilson to stop the exportation of\narms to Germany's enemies. I have never seen one poster of any kind put\nup by friends of the Allies. Indeed, America has been so deluged with\nGerman propaganda and German-paid advertisements, and requests for money\nto carry on the propaganda in favour of Germany, that the whole nation\nhas become heartily sick of it, and has urged the Government to expel\nfrom the country some of your agents who have been particularly\noffensive in carrying on such a propaganda among our citizens. German\ngold, not English gold, has been lavishly used to influence American\nopinion. Our Government has had to employ a special detective force to\ndiscover and destroy the many plots in which German and Austrian gold\nhas been lavishly used to influence opinion and action in America; and\nfrom other neutral countries comes abundant evidence that the same\nstupendous propaganda, to turn opinion and action in favour of Germany,\nhas been carried on everywhere, with an audacity and utter disregard of\ncost which has astonished the world. In the face of such facts as these\nthe German outcry against \"English gold\" has seemed wholly insincere,\nand little less than ridiculous.\n\nFinally, American opinion has been based more than all else on Germany's\nofficial communications, directly addressed to our Government, on\ncertain acts which Germany has admitted, and on the nature of the\ndefence and excuses offered by the German Government in palliation of\nthose acts. You must not forget that the many lengthy notes addressed by\nyour Government to Americans have been published in full in American\npapers. The outcry against English gold, against cable dispatches\naltered by the English, and against corrupt newspaper publishers cannot\nbe raised in connection with diplomatic correspondence transmitted\ndirect to your Ambassador here. This authentic, official correspondence\nhas given us an excellent measure of the standards of morality and\nhumanity which actuate the present German Government. Our opinion of\nGermany has been profoundly influenced by these official documents.\n\nGermany has committed certain acts which are freely admitted by your\nGovernment. A nation, like a man, is judged by its deeds. After all\nexcuses and explanations are made, the deeds remain. Americans have read\nthe excuses and the explanations fully and repeatedly; and with these\nexcuses and explanations in mind have formed an opinion of the power\nresponsible for the deeds. No English gold, no manipulated cable\ndispatches can have had anything to do with that opinion. The deeds\nthemselves have been the supreme force in shaping American opinion of\nGermany. Germany has defended the many acts which have brought down upon\nher the contempt and opprobrium of the entire civilised world. As you\nwell know, one of the best tests of a man's morals is the kind of a\ndefence he offers for his acts. Americans have read most carefully the\nmany defences offered by your Chancellor, your Minister of Foreign\nAffairs, your Under-Secretary of Foreign Affairs, your official\nspokesmen sent to this country, and your Ambassador here; and in the\nnotes sent officially and directly to our Government by your\nGovernment.

the galling chain.\nAnd it came to pass when his time was up\n  And hell's gates were opened wide\nThat all hell rang, and the clinkered imps sang\n  When the Devil passed Outside.\n\n\"I have served my time,\" the Devil said\n  As he halted by heaven's gate;\nI have sweated in hell for a thousand years\n  And each year was a year of hate.\nI have framed my plans for a thousand years,\n  I have worked out the details well\nNow I'd have a place near the human race\n  As a sort of a prep school for hell.\n\nThe sons of men, on the earth below\n  Have scarcely a chance to sin,\nChurched, belled and gowned, they mope around\n  By precept, all sealed in;\nThere is never a sin for lust of flesh\n  Nor sin for a man struck blow,\nAnd the red blood crime of the olden time\n  Has passed with the long ago.\n\nHell's motley crew is scarce worth coal\n  When they come to the thing called death;\nThey squat on the coals with the real damned souls\n  And listen with bated breath,\nTo the tales of the earth, when the world was new,\nWhen a man had to fight for his own,\nWhen he took his wife at the risk of his life\n  And killed for a half-baked bone.\n\nNow I'd build a place where a man might sin\n  For the sake of his own desires;\nMake his the cause, and his the laws,\n  And the penalty, mine own fires;\nHast a place on earth to breed such men\n  Each for his own deeds blamed?\nIf you'll give me a place, I'll breed a race\n  That hell may not be shamed.\n\nThe God King sighed as he searched the plat\n  And the map of the earth below;\nI have given a place for every race\n  In the belt from snow to snow.\nI have given a home to each bird and beast\n  For even the fox has its hole,\nI have given all land to the sons of man\n  And I've builded a home for his soul.\n\nIn the seven days that I toiled below\n  When I builded the seas and lands,\nThere was much to do, and I didn't get thru\n  And one place unfinished stands.\nIt's the part of my work that I really regret,\n  For I know it's the worst of the lot,\nIt's known down below as The Land of the Snow,\n  Or, The Country that God forgot.\n\nIt stands apart by the Northern Pole,\n  Unfinished, forgotten, alone,\nAnd no man's hand has won this land,\n  And no man calls it his own.\nThe country is made up of odds and ends,\n  Unfinished mountain, and swamp and lake,\nStuff that couldn't be used when the earth was fused;\n  If you want it, it's yours to take.\n\n\"I'll take this plot,\" the Devil quoth,\n  \"For I like your description well,\nYes, I'll take this place and I'll mould a race\n  That will be a credit to hell.\"\nThen he whistled an imp from the uttermost part\n  And they dropped as the comets whirled\nPast the white baked stars, past Venus and Mars\n  To the unfinished part of the world.\n\nHe landed at last on Denali's crest\n  And he gazed on his acres wide--\nBarren and bleak, from each mountain peak\n  And swamp to the Arctic's tide.\nThe Devil grinned as he stood and gazed\n  Said he, \"This is just what I need,\nIt's the place of my plan, for the downfall of man\n  Where I'll change his ambition to greed.\"\n\nThen he summoned the legions of hell to his side\n  Named an arch imp to straw boss each crew.\nTho they gibbered and cursed, each one did the worst\n  With the jobs Satan gave them to do.\nThey tumbled the mountains high up, and on end,\n  Piled glaciers where streams ought to be,\nAnd swamp land was placed in the desolate waste\n  That stretched from the hills to the sea.\n\nThey shook down all hell for a climate to fit,\n  But they couldn't get suited in hell,\nSo they took the worst parts and with devilish arts\n  They built one that suited them well.\nThey laid out muck swamps where the water lies dead\n  Bred mosquitoes and moose flies and gnats\nPut the brown bear that kills on the barren brown hills\n  And with quill pigs infested the flats.\n\nThey shut off the sun for full half of the year,\n  Made each glacier a blizzard blown trap,\nThey strung out volcanoes half way to Japan\n  Each one with a hair trigger cap.\nThey planned for the coast line a system of storms\n  Each equipped with a ninety mile breath\nAnd then spread o'er it all the fog that men call\n  The North Coast mantle of death.\n\nThen knowing full well that man would not go\n  To a Land so forlorn to behold,\nHe salted the hillsides and some of the streams\n  With nuggets and traces of gold.\nHe tinted the hills with a green copper ledge\n  And covered the valleys with game,\nAll this for a lure, then the Devil felt sure\n  That the white man would fall for the same.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTHE LAND\n\nThe lure of the little known places\n  Still calls, as it called to your sires;\nThe longing for wide open spaces,\n  The perfume of evening camp fires;\nThe hunting for treasure unfound yet\n  The knocking at fortune's own gate;\nThe doing of deeds for the joy that it breeds\n  Were all used by the Devil as bait.\n\nThe summers besprinkled with sunshine,\n  The hillsides a riot of bloom\nWith meadows a color shot grandeur\n  And valleys as still as a tomb.\nWith mountains of cloud-encased beauty\n  Or with stars shining down on it all\nIt's the trails we don't know that call us to go\n  And no wonder man heeded the call.\n\nThe winters, the trails all unbroken,\n  The far fields that beckon and call;\nThe song of the frost on the runners\n  And the Northern Lights high over all;\nThe trees in the bend of the river,\n  The streams that nobody has spanned;\nThe whisper of gold, the story half told,\n  All this by the Devil was planned.\n\nWhen the trap of the Devil was ready\n  Widespread went the whisper of gold,\nAnd the white men stampeded like cattle,\n  There never was tie that could hold.\nThe first mad rush to the Northland\n  When the scum from the four ends of earth\nCame in with a rush, a scramble, a crush\n  Like scrap in a fusing pot hurled.\n\nThey came all untaught and not ready,\n  Spurred on in the mad rush for gold;\nThey died here unsung and uncared for\n  Of famine, and scurvy and cold.\nThey had the same laws as the wolf pack,\n  Stay up, for you die if you fail,\nAnd the paths to the Northern placers\n  Are marked by their graves on the trail.\n\nThe towns that they started were plague spots\n  With brothels and dance halls aglare,\nWith cribs, faro banks and roulette wheels\n  And phonographs adding their blare.\nAll traps for the young and unwary,\n  All builded to help with his fall,\nNever dealer was fair, never game on the square\n  For the Devil presided o'er all.\n\nNick fiendishly grinned when he saw his work\n  And he chuckled with devilish glee--\n\"When it comes to making an up-to-date hell\n  They've sure got to hand it to me.\nFor every ten souls that come in to this land\n  There's nine of them headed for hell\nWith never a fight, the percentage is right,\n  And my prep school is doing quite well.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThus for a time he ruled this land\n  Where few might venture forth,\nFor never a man-made law held good\n  From Dixon's Entrance north.\nHe held this land in his claw tipped grip,\n  And he took his pay in souls,\nTheirs was the blame, for they played his game,\n  And they paid for it on hell's coals.\n\nBut the Devil lost when the law came in,\n  Or the men who made the laws,\nThe gambling hall and the dance hall went\n  And the Devil was forced to pause.\nFor the life in the land develops men,\n  Men of an alien breed,\nA new made lot, that couldn't be bought,\n  And strangers to graft or greed.\n\nThey loosed the land from the Devil's grip,\n  They pierced the hills with their trails,\nThey flagged the rocks at the harbor's mouth,\n  They paved the way for the rails.\nThey builded a school where the dance hall stood\n  And they brought in their children and wives;\nThey gave their all to the new land's call\n  And some of them gave their lives.\n\nNow the pimp and the brothel have passed away\n  And the gambling hall is a dream;\nA railroad train now follows the trail\n  Where we followed a nine-dog team.\nA thousand stamps now sing their song\n  Where we panned on the gold shot ledge,\nAnd a picture show now marks the line\n  That once was the frontier's edge.\n\nThe milch cows graze where the brown bear roamed\n  And a saw mill sings its lay\nOn a bar in the Yukon River\n  Where we panned one summer day.\nThey are raising wheat where the bull moose grazed\n  In the summers of long ago,\nIt seems kind of strange when we note the change,\n  But we'd rather have it so.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nYet, sometimes we dream as we camp at night\n  In the bend of the river's flow\nOf the land that was, of the land we knew\n  In the days of the long ago.\nThe wild free land that bred the men\n  Who fought with might and main\nAnd took this land from the Devil's hand,\n  And we'd like to see it again,\n\n\n\n\n\nA WOMAN, A DOG, AND A WALNUT TREE\n\nThis Land is the orphan kiddie\n  Of the group with their stars in the Flag,\nAnd it's looked on Outside as an alien,\n  Where its treatment makes honest men gag.\nIt's treated the same as the harlot\n  Who barters her body for pelf\nAnd carries it home to her master\n  And is told to look after herself.\n\nOf course we're an orphan, adopted\n  When cast off by the great Russian Bear\nAnd our lot's been the lot of an orphan\n  And we've had a \"stage orphan's\" care.\nOur coal land was grabbed by our Uncle,\n  Our copper and fur by the Jews,\nWhile another gang took all our salmon\n  And corrupted our natives with booze.\n\nSam gave us an Army Commission\n  And told it to build us a Trail,\nBut all that Sam gave was permission--\n  He didn't come thru with the kale.\nNow a trail in Alaska costs money\n  And when Dick tries to get a bill thru\nSome jackass from Maine reads the figures\n  And \"moves the amount cut in two.\"\n\nOur Uncle Sam owns all the cables,\n  And the prices he gets are a sin,\nIt costs more for a word to Seattle\n  Than it does from Salt Lake to Berlin.\nOur coast line is rugged and broken,\n  A menace to each ship that sails,\nBut Sam has no money for coast lights,\n  They get the same treatment as trails.\n\nAnd Alaska is some husky orphan,\n  We can reach from the Gulf to B.C.,\nWe could stand with one foot in Kansas\n  While the other was washed by the sea.\nWe're allowed only one voice in Congress,\n  And that one bereft of a vote,\nAnd has to get some one's permission\n  Ere he loose a protest from his throat.\n\nSam gave us a group legislative,\n  But barred them the making of laws,\nThey could only memorialize Congress\n  And give it the reasons and cause.\nThe cry of the world is for Home Rule\n  Yet imported fools crowd our bench,\nAnd some of their mining decisions\n  Send up to high Heaven their stench.\n\nSam made us quit gambling, that's all right,\n  But one thing that nobody knows\nIs why he allowed a bone head from Georgia\n  Hang the crepe on our own picture shows.\nWe're all hedged about with restrictions\n  And, Sam, won't you in us confide\nWhy some of your damphool ideas\n  Are not tried out on some one outside?\n\nThis Land's not the land of the weakling\n  And the men up here know what we need,\nAnd we're sick of your bunch from the Outside\n  Who's only incentive is greed.\nWe've stood for Pinchot's conservation\n  And we've stood for your carpet-bag horde\nWho have grabbed off the jobs in Alaska\n  As a sort of political reward.\n\nBut, Sam, take a tip from a Roughneck,\n  Go slow now and don't crowd your hand\nOr some day you may find that the orphan\n  Has quit creeping and learned how to stand.\nDon't make us the goat for the theories\n  Advanced by some government cog,\nAnd don't use this land as a station\n  For trying things out on the dog.\n\nWe gaze o'er the line of the Yukon\n  As we're watching our neighbors at play\nAnd we wonder why Our Uncle Sammy\n  Don't treat his Alaskans that way.\nWe look at their broad graded highways\n  And then at our own half blazed trails\nAnd, Sam, it comes damned nigh to envy\n  When we think of their thrice a week mails.\n\nThey don't know the word conservation,\n  Their resources, all theirs to use,\nAnd when they ask their Uncle to help them\n  Their Uncle don't often refuse.\nTheir Uncle has helped them develop,\n  Furnished work there for men who were broke,\nAnd, Sam, when it comes to Coast Lights\n  They make ours look like a joke.\n\nBut in spite of it all, Sam, we love you,\n  We love every thread in the Flag,\nWe love every stream in Alaska,\n  We love every cliff, every crag.\nWe're not like the Woman or Dog, Sam,\n  And we're not like the Walnut Tree\nCause we want to be loved in return, Sam,\n  And, Sam, you are blind, or you'd see.\n\n\n_Old English Proverb_:\n\n\"A Woman, a Dog, and a Walnut Tree\nThe more you beat them the better they'll be.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWHEN THE WATER STARTS TO RUN\n\nAlong in early spring time, as the sun starts swinging North\nTo linger with the land it loves, and violets peep forth,\nWhen the water starts to running thru the riffle blocks at noon\nAnd you figure that you'll clean up, about the first of June.\nYou've been thru a long hard winter, but you see the end in sight,\nYou don't worry 'bout the cleanup, cause you know the pay is right;\nBut you're feeling sort of restless, as your blood warms with the sun\nAnd your heart will start to itching, when the water starts to run.\n\nYou may leave your Camp at evening and mush away to Town\nTo dally with the hootch a bit, but the feeling will not down.\nYou may mix up in a poker game, or try the dance hall's lure\nBut you're fighting off a feeling, that the old cures cannot cure.\nYou've got that longing feeling that there's nothing satisfies,\nAnd your pard can't interest you, no matter how he tries,\nYou're lonesome, moody, restless, out at Camp, or in the Town\nYour mind will not rest easy, and your troubles will not drown.\n\nThen memory pulls her picket pins, your thoughts go back thru years\nTo Outside, Home, and Sweetheart, and this last thought sort of cheers;\nYou recollect the days you spent beneath a Southern sky\nAnd with regret you now remember they all ended with good-by.\nIt's the same old world-wide feeling that comes to man each year,\nBut it seems to hit us harder, when we're getting in the \"clear\";\nIt seems that it grows stronger, each year added to our life--\nIt's the hankering of the white man for a Pal, a Home, a Wife.\n\nMan was not meant to live alone, why quarrel with Nature's laws,\nGod gave you strength to build a home, wherefor then do you pause?\nGo forward like your father did, go forth and seek your mate,\nFor till you know a wife and home, you know not Heaven's Gate.\nIt's the deep inherent longing for a baby on your knee,\nFor the sound of children's voices, beneath your own fig tree.\nThe male instinct to have a mate, to love, to guard, to hold,\nThe one instinct that's left to us, that triumphs over gold.\n\nWith strength enough to build a home when once you get a wife\nBear gently with her follies, but guard her with your life;\nCrowd full her heart with loving, yet hold a guarded rein,\nLest ye two now that rate as one, again be counted twain.\nAnd if she come from Outside Camp, remember all is new\nAnd give her time to find herself, teach her to lean on you.\nAnd should homesickness grip her, and you find your wife in tears\nForget the jest and love her, remember your first years.\n\nThen gone that restless feeling, gone all desire to roam,\nLife's interest all is centered, deep in your Northern home.\nLife waits in peace the cleanup, you pass up Outside joys,\nAnd the tempter's voice is silenced by the music of her voice.\nThen you're a true Alaskan, with a home won from the North,\nGod grant you children's voices when the violets peep forth,\nAnd in the summer evening, beneath the midnight sun,\nMay your heart grow closer to her, when the water starts to run.\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE THROWBACK\n\nHe was born far east of the Rockies\n  Of a pet in society's van;\nA wine-soaked daughter of pleasure\n  Bred back and threw a man;\nA man-child who grew up a stranger,\n  Who never could learn the way\nOf a people who gauge their pleasure\n  On a line with the price they pay.\n\nJust a shred of an education--\n  A few years of college life,\nA course in the card and wine room,\n  A year with a chorus-girl wife,\nThen disgust with a life unnatural\n  Spurred on with the curse of the go,\nHe quitted that life forever\n  For the land of the gold and snow.\n\nThe Lure of the Land had gripped him,\n  The Land where you die if you fail;\nThe Land of the fabled fortunes,\n  The Land of the endless trail.\nThe Land of the lonely silence,\n  The Land of the cruel cold,\nThe Land of the lost ambitions\n  Alaska, the Land of gold.\n\nThere winters of long hungry hardships,\n  Summers of pest-ridden heat;\nDicing with death for a grub stake,\n  Risking his life for meat.\nTossing away his young manhood,\n  Giving the best of his youth\nTo the holes that he bedrocked on wildcats,\n  Where gold was scarcer than truth.\n\nTen years spent in Alaska\n  Gray haired, with cheeks all atan,\nBeaten, but still unconquered.\n  Flat broke, but still a man,\nDigging and sinking and drifting,\n  Trying to locate the \"pay,\"\nWith each hole a fresh disappointment--\n  Yet hoping to strike it next day.\n\nScorning the letters recalling,\n  Forgetting the friends he had known,\nTurning his back on the Outside,\n  Facing the future alone.\nA Cabin, a Squaw, and a Fishwheel,\n  A bend in the river's flow,\nA band of half-naked breed kids--\n  He stayed there, a sourdough.\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE MALAMUTE\n\nWhen the stars from the skies have fallen\n  And the smoke of the world's cleared away;\nWhen Saint Peter marks \"30\" in Life's Book\n  And we meet there on Judgment Day;\nWhen our trials and troubles are ended\n  And we're wise to the best and the worst;\nWhen the time has arrived that the wise ones\n  Have told us the last shall be first;\n\nWhen the men who've made good are rewarded\n  And the losers are turned loose in Hell;\nThat's the time that a lot will be learning\n  The true reason and cause that they fell.\nAnd I wonder when Peter gets busy\n  As he works out the tenement plan,\nAnd when Heaven's thrown free for location\n  Will he confine the locations to man?\n\nIf he does, my claim's open for jumping\n  For I can't figure Heaven complete,\nIf the dim distant trails of the sky land\n  Are not pattered by malamutes' feet.\nCause I know it would never seem home-like\n  No matter how golden the strand,\nIf I lose out that pal-loving feeling\n  Of a malamute's nose in my hand.\n\nAnd it's that way with lots of Alaskans\n  These men of our own last frontier,\nWho tear into nature unaided\n  And who scarce know the meaning of fear.\nWho live on lone creeks all alone here\n  Where the living and dying are hard,\nAnd where oft times their only companion\n  Is a malamute pup for a pard.\n\nHe's a real chum with things coming easy,\n  He's a pal with things breaking tough,\nHe's a hell-roaring fighting companion\n  When somebody starts something rough.\nHe's a true friend in sorrow and sickness\n  And he doesn't mind hunger or cold,\nAnd he's really the only one pardner\n  You can trust when you uncover gold.\n\nHe's a guard you can trust at the sluice box,\n  And he'll watch by your cache thru the night,\nAnd if some cheechako tries to molest it\n  That cheechako's in for a fight.\nAs a pardner he's silent, but cheerful\n  With never a kick 'bout the trails\nAnd if it wasn't for him in the winter\n  There never would be any mails.\n\nHe pulls on our sleds in the winter\n  He's first in the rushing stampede\nHe goes where a horse couldn't travel\n  And besides that he rustles his feed.\nHe takes a pack saddle in summer\n  And follows us off thru the hills\nAnd when we go short on the grub pile\n  He shares up whatever he kills.\n\n'Twas a malamute first scaled the Chilkoot\n  At the time of the great Klondike charge;\n'Twas a malamute first saw Lake Bennett\n  And left his footprints at La Barge;\nThey hauled the first mail into Dawson,\n  That Land of the Old Timer's dream,\nAnd when Wada first drove in from Fairbanks\n  He was driving a malamute team.\n\nThey broke the first trail into Bettles\n  With no guide save the lone Northern Star;\nThey freighted next year to Kantishna\n  And from there to the famed Chandelar.\nThey know the long trail to Innoko,\n  Tacotna and Iditarod too,\nFor there's never a Camp in the Northland\n  But what these same malamutes knew.\n\nThey brought the first sport to the Nome Beach\n  Where they showed up in action and deed\nThat the North dog is game as they make them\n  And besides that has plenty of speed.\nHe came home with the bacon from Candle\n  Like a bat out of Hell, thru the snow,\nAnd the plunger that cashed in his \"out tab\"\n  Was his pardner, the Old Sourdough.\n\nSo it seems to me kind of unfair now\n  As we drift toward that permanent Camp\nWhere the angels are running a dance hall\n  And a millionaire grades with a tramp;\nWhere the trails are located on pay dirt\n  And a grub stake can never expire--\nWell, if they shut out my dog, they can keep it\n  And I'll \"siwash\" it, down by Hell's Fire.\n\nThey herald the growth of the Northland\n  And progress is marked by their trail;\nA railroad now goes where they brought out\n  The Seward-Iditarod mail.\nHe's first in the growth of Alaska\n  And without him this land would be lost,\nFor there's never a stream in this country\n  That the malamutes' trail has not crossed.\n\nBut you can't tell me God would have Heaven\n  So a man couldn't mix with his friends;\nThat we're doomed to meet disappointment\n  When we come to the place the trail ends.\nThat would be a low-grade sort of Heaven\n  And I'd never regret a damned sin\nIf I mush up to the gates, white and pearly,\n  And they don't let my malamute in.\n\n\n\n\n\nUNSATISFIED\n\nSome sigh for the breath of the desert\n  Where the stifling heat waves blow;\nSome pant for the trackless tundra\n  And the sting of the cold and snow;\nSome long for the wash of a sultry sea\n  As it breaks on a tropic shore;\nSome pine for the breeze of the northern seas\n  And the sound of the Arctic's roar.\n\nThe things that men love be countless\n  But they're seldom the same with two,\nFor the things I care for most of all\n  Might never appeal to you.\nSome men run to wine and woman,\n  Some long for a wife and a home,\nAnd he drifts with the tide, unsatisfied,\n  Who leaves these things to roam.\n\nFor he hates the sands of the desert\n  And the slimy tropic south,\nOr his dreams of a northern fortune\n  Are as ashes in his mouth.\nHe loses the best life holds for man\n  His existence means discontent\nStill he goes his way, until comes the day\n  When he quits it--a life misspent.\n\n\nYET\n\nSome sigh for the breath of the desert\n  Where the stifling heat waves blow;\nSome pant for the trackless tundra\n  And the sting of the cold and snow;\nSome long for the wash of a sultry sea\n  As it breaks on a tropic shore;\nSome pine for the breeze of the northern seas\n  And the sound of the Arctic's roar.\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE PROSPECTOR\n\nWhere the ragged, snow-capped saw tooth\n  Cuts the azure of the sky\nAnd watches o'er the lonely land\n  As ages wander by;\nWhere the sentinel pines in grandeur\n  Murmur to the glacier stream\nAs it, ice-gorged, gluts the canyon,\n  Never brightened by the gleam\nOf sun at brightest noon day,\n  Nor moon of Arctic night,\nAnd whose only link with Heaven\n  Is the fitful Northern Light.\nWhere the Whistler shrills in triumph\n  And the Big Horn dreams in peace,\nWhere the Brown Bear skulks to cover\n  Up where silence holds the lease;\nWhere the land is as God left it\n  Nor has known the tread of man,\nThere's a treasure ledge a-waiting--\n  Go and find it if you can.\n\nIf your heart be steeled to triumph\n  Nor beats less at your defeat;\nCan you watch your whole world melt away\n  And still smiling, fortune greet?\nWill your heart and brain and sinew\n  Crowd you on, when hunger's pain\nGnaws your belly and you're beaten,\n  Can you lose, and fight again?\nCan you raise the cup of fortune\n  To your lips and bravely quaff\nThe draught she has prepared for you\n  And win or lose and laugh?\nCan you see the fruits of hardships\n  Centered on one desperate throw\nAnd know Fate's dice are loaded\n  Nor curse to see them go?\nThen take your burden up again\n  And stagger up the trail,\nYou're bound to make a winning\n  Cause you don't know how to fail.\n\nI, who've spent my youth in following\n  The lure of hidden gold\nMust pass the buck to Nature\n  And admit I'm growing old.\nAnd yet each spring I hear it calling\n  And it's music to my ears,\nThe call of lonely places\n  That I've listened to for years.\nIt's cost me all most men hold dear\n  Some forty years of life,\nAnd all the joys that others get\n  In babies, home, and wife.\nMy life's been all to-morrows\n  And my family only dreams\nAnd to the average plodder\n  I've missed it all it seems.\nStill, I've never taken orders\n  And I've always liked the game,\nAnd if life could be lived over,\n  Why,--I'd live it just the same.\n\n\n\n\n\nIF\n\n(_A Steal from Kipling_)\n\nIf you can hit the trail in zero weather\n  And laugh at frozen hand, or foot or face;\nIf you can eat your dogs, and still keep moving\n  And beat the rest, and hold the stampede's pace;\nIf you can stake and dig alone, unaided\n  And hold your ground, if needs be with a gun\nAnd find the gold and have some lawyer steal it,\n  And lose, and start again, and call it fun.\n\nIf you can go a year on mouldy bacon\n  And fight the scurvy off with bayo beans;\nIf you can jump your socks and do your washing\n  And smile the while you patch your threadbare jeans;\nIf you can laugh when sordid hunger mocks you\n  And smile while passing strangers eat your grub;\nIf you can boost when everybody knocks you\n  And know him wrong who holds you but a dub.\n\nIf you can still the pain when Outside calls you\n  And choke back thoughts of friends you still hold dear;\nIf you can still the dreams when night befalls you\n  And w\n\n### Summary:\n\n"}

E. E. Adams.\n\nPublished by Request.\n\n1861.\n\n\n\n\nGovernment and Rebellion.\n\n\n  An evil man seeketh only rebellion; therefore a cruel messenger shall be\n  sent against him.--Prov. xvii. 11.\n\n\nWe have in these words this plain announcement--that Rebellion is a crime,\nand shall be visited with terrible judgment. Solomon here speaks his own\nconvictions; God declares his thought, and utters his sanction of law.\nThis is also the expression of natural conscience,--vindicating in our\nbreast the Divine procedure, when the majesty of insulted government is\nasserted, and penalty applied.\n\nGod never overlooks rebellion against his throne--never pardons the rebel\nuntil he repent and submit. God does not command us to forgive our\noffending fellow-men, unless they repent. \"If thy brother trespass against\nthee seven times in a day, and seven times in a day turn to thee, saying,\nI repent, thou shalt forgive him.\" God is in a forgiving attitude; so\nought we to be. But he does not _express_ forgiveness until the rebel\nexpresses penitence; neither are we under obligation to _pronounce_ an\nenemy forgiven until he signify his compunction and sorrow, and desist\nfrom his injurious conduct. If my child rebel against my law and my\nrightful discipline, I am not allowed by the spirit of love to pursue him\nwith vengeance; neither am I bound by the law of God to release him from\nthe penalty of his sin, until he shall have exhibited signs of submission,\nof sorrow, and of obedience. I may pity him, and cherish toward him the\n_spirit_ of forgiveness; but for his own sake, for the order of the\nhousehold, and on account of my innate sense of justice, I must not\npronounce his acquittal, nor declare the controversy ended, until he shall\nhave satisfied my governmental authority, and the sentiment of justice\nwhich both his own conscience and mine, constitutionally, and therefore by\nnecessity, cherish. And I do not see that Government can safely pardon a\nrebel against its statutes, its honor and its common brotherhood, until\nhis rebellion cease; until he bow to law, confess his crime, and signify\nhis sorrow. I speak not of oppressive government, of iniquitous law; but\nof _good_ government, of statutes healthful, humane, equal. Although in\nthe former case rebellion cannot be justified until every constitutional\nmeasure has been resorted to for redress,--then, if redress be not given,\nthe voice of the people in all representative governments may legally\nchange oppressive for just laws, and oppressors for rulers who shall\nregard the popular will. And in despotisms, when the people have the\n_power_ to redress their wrongs, and to enter on a career of development\nin mind and morals, in the arts of civilization,--when every other course\nfails--\"resistance to tyrants is obedience to God!\" Man was not _made_ for\ntyranny. He was not made for any form of government that crushes out his\nintellect and his religious capabilities. He was made to be governed\nmorally; to be under righteous law; law which, while it restrains passion,\nselfishness and crime, gives a man all the freedom that he is able and\nwilling to _use_ safely for himself, and for the commonwealth; all that is\nconsistent with individual development and the national good.\n\nI am not one of those who believe that the voice of the people is, without\nexception, the voice of God. It was not so at the Deluge, but quite the\nreverse. It was not so when Israel clamored for a king--not in mercy but\nin anger, God gave them their request. It was not so when Absalom stole\nthe hearts of the people, and stirred up rebellion against his father. And\nyet, when a nation, independent of party, free from the excitements of\nmomentary interest, without the influence of ambitious leaders, under the\ncalm guidance of reason, history, and the spirit of the age,--rises\nspontaneously against oppression, against iniquity, and _demands_ just\nlaws; rights for all; free thought, free speech, free labor, free worship;\nwhen compacts are not violated; when moderation is maintained; when the\nspirit of humanity is preserved,--_then_, I believe, \"the voice of the\npeople _is_ the voice of God.\" I have no question that, in the great\nprinciple, Cromwell and his puritan hosts were right in their\nrevolutionary action. I could never doubt that our fathers did a noble,\nglorious, and Christian deed in throwing off the yoke of Britain, and\nproclaiming a new government for themselves and their posterity. It was\nright to contend and bleed for equal representation, for freedom of\nconscience, and for an independent nationality in which these high ends\ncould be secured.\n\nThe first government of which we have account was a Theocracy--that is,\n\"the government of God.\" _He_ was the only King. He revealed the law,\nappointed leaders, gave rules for worship, instruction and warfare. Thus\nin the outset did he set up his claims among men. He established the great\nprecedent, which men ought to have followed, which the world has ignored;\nbut to which the thoughts and the will of the race shall ultimately\nreturn. It is true _now_ that government, as such, is ordained of God. All\ngovernment, in its elemental authority, is a theocracy. All power is of\nGod; he ordains law. He originates the idea of civil compact. While,\ntherefore, the principles of governments among men may be defective, and\nthe administration wrong and hurtful, the great _fact_ of government is a\n_Divine fact. Good_ government is _emphatically God's_ government--intended\nto suppress evil, to promote holiness and happiness. \"The powers that be\nare ordained of God.\" \"Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth\nthe ordinance of God: and they that resist shall receive to themselves\ndamnation.\" Despisers of government are enumerated by the Apostle as among\nthe most flagitious of men. There are _statutes_ in almost every government\nwhich may not be absolutely right; some which may be oppressive. These are\nto be distinguished from the principles, from the general bearing of a\ngovernment, and endured for the good therein, or be rid of by\nconstitutional and safe methods. It is a duty of each subject and citizen\nto surrender some of his desires and preferences--some of his convictions\npossibly--for the _general_ sentiment--the comprehensive good; while he has\nthe privilege of convincing by fair argument all others, and winning them\nto his views and measures if possible, without violence, without\ninfringement of law. It is not to be expected that every man should be\nabsolutely satisfied with any government. If he is called to yield only\nhis share of personal interest and preference, for the sake of all the\nprotection and blessing in which he participates in common with the state,\nhis reason, his conscience, his patriotism will joyfully acquiesce; he will\nfreely make so much sacrifice for the interests of the whole, knowing very\nwell that every other citizen is likely to be under an equal sacrifice.\nNatural, individual liberty, without law, is only barbarism. Where every\nman is free to do whatever his worst passions prompt, there is in fact no\nfreedom; there is tyranny; for the strong will subdue the weak, bone and\nmuscle will govern mind and conscience. In laws and governments men have\ntheir best thoughts; human _law_ is likely to be better than human\nnature. Men feel the need of restraint--are convinced of the necessity of\nlaw. They therefore make laws in self-defence; if thereby they would _not_\nrestrain their own selfishness, they _would_ restrain the selfishness\nof others; but that which is made a barrier to _one_ bad subject is\nalso a defence against all;--thus men do restrain themselves by their\ndefences against others. Thus it is that, with healthful convictions, men\nmay control diseased passion; with a right _ideal_ is intimately\njoined a safe actuality; with good law, a comparatively good condition.\nEven in the worst administration, and when the public mind is most\ndemoralized, there may remain the purity of law; the sublime thought.\nIf the mind finds itself sinking into lawlessness and disorganism, and\nborne away by the pressure of evil, it can look upward, and, catching new\nenergy from the unquenched light--\n\n    \"Spring into the realm of the ideal.\"\n\nOur destiny is ideal. We are on our way to the Unseen. The ideal draws us\nupward,--_real_ now, to the spirits of just men made perfect--to be real\nto us when we are perfect--_once_ ideal to them, as now to us. We must\nkeep above us the model of life and of law which we have not yet attained.\nLet it never be dim. It is a star shining through time's night! A banner\nwaving from the throne of God. It tells us of the goal. It points out our\nfuturity--the altitude of our virtue, our exaltation, our bliss.\n\nOur subject is GOVERNMENT AND MAN. We proceed to consider it in a\nthree-fold aspect, inquiring\n\n    I. _What is good government?_\n   II. _What constitutes rebellion against such government?_\n  III. _What is the duty of each citizen when rebellion exists?_\n\n\n\n\nI. _What is a good government_?\n\n\n\nNo citizen looks for an absolutely perfect form of nationality--of law.\nBut we have a right to ask for good government. We have been accustomed to\nthink that it depends more on administration than on principle; and the\nline of the poet, \"That which is best administered, is best,\" is a\nproverb, to the sentiment of which we too freely yield. No doubt a\ngovernment with bad statutes and wrong laws, may be so administered as to\nproduce a tolerable degree of national comfort and development for a\nseason; while a Constitution perfect in its theories and principles, may\nbe so maladministered as to corrupt and distract, impoverish and\ndemoralize, a people. And yet, I agree with an old patriot of the past\ncentury who said, \"There is no foundation to imagine that the goodness or\nbadness of any government depends solely upon its administration. It must\nbe allowed that the ultimate design of government is to restrain the\ncorruptions of human nature; and, since human nature is the same at all\ntimes and in all places, the same form of government which is best for one\nnation is best for all nations, if they would _only agree to adopt_ it.\"\n\nThere is a deep thought in this remark. We often say, for example, \"France\nis not fit for a republican form of government,\" and it is true; but that\nis _not_ to say, \"A republican form of government is not fit for France,\"\nif the population would agree to adopt and preserve it. Man, in his\nfallen state, is not fit for the holy government of God; but that holy\ngovernment is, nevertheless, the _only_ one that is fit for man as a moral\nbeing; and it is man's ignorance and folly, his guilt and ruin, that he\ndoes not adopt it. It is owing to the ignorance and wickedness of the\nworld that it is not fit for a representative government; and that all do\nnot choose Christ to be their King.\n\nWere a score of the professional politicians of our land to frame a\nConstitution for us in full accordance with their own schemes and choice,\nwe would soon find ourselves under an oligarchy of schemers, who cared for\nthe Republic only so far as to secure from it their own fame and\nemolument. Were as many brokers or merchants to make and administer our\nlaws, without regard to other industrial interests, we should have an\noligarchy of trade. Were as many husbandmen, or mechanics, or lawyers, to\nhave full control of our legislation and government, we would have one\ninterest towering above all others, and true equalization, true\nbrotherhood, just representation, healthful nationality would be\nimpossible. Or, were we dependent on officers in the army or navy for our\ngovernment, legislative and administrative, we would be likely to have\nmany of our rights circumscribed. Were as many clergymen to frame a\nConstitution, and administer laws, we might be under a crushing\npriesthood. A government of mere scholars, poets or orators, would be only\na sublime dream. A Constitution of philosophies alone, would glitter with\nabstractions beautiful, cold, grand as the snow-capt Alps, and as distant,\ntoo, from the actualities of men! A government of mere gentlemen who have\nnothing to do but think for slaves, to enjoy the chase and the\nrace-ground, to extol their pedigree, and traduce labor, and lead\nretainers to war--would be a government for the few over the many, an\naristocracy of blood and privilege, of curled moustache and taper fingers;\nbut not a republic of patriots, of self-made men, of equal privilege and\njust laws. It would be a return to semi-barbarism, to the age of Louis\nXIV., or even of Charles I.\n\nThis is now the strong tendency in the Rebel States: even along our free\nborder, but below it, such is the system of representation, that a county\ncontaining only about 3,000 inhabitants, sends as many representatives to\nthe legislature as another county of 30,000, and a single proprietor casts\nas many votes as a whole commune. So much liberty of citizens is already\nsacrificed to the chevalier, to the system of forced service.\n\nBut were a select number of experienced men, of true statesmen, embracing\ndifferent pursuits and professions, educated in different parts of the\nworld, and drawn together by grand national events,--statesmen born in the\nage when liberty had its first grand revival, and was guarded by soberness\nof thought, and tried by every variety and extent of sacrifice--by men who\nhad no professional, exclusive interest to provide for, but who expected\nto fight and die for their convictions, who sought only to lay the\nfoundation of a nationality for future generations, and for the world; who\naimed at a healthful union of all popular interests, both among poor and\nrich, among masters and dependents; who provided for freedom of action\nunder law; of worship and education, of commerce, agriculture, and the\narts; for the easy and equitable support of government,--for its\nperpetuity indeed, infusing into it elements that appeal powerfully, both\nto the self-interest and the patriotism of the citizens,--I say, were such\nmen, with such ends in view, by such sacrifice, to frame such a\ngovernment, containing the most delicate balance of interests, with strong\nchecks against the encroachment of any branch, either the legislative,\nexecutive or judicial, giving all trades and professions, and all men, an\nequal chance for excellence, influence, and honor; you would not hesitate\nto pronounce that a good government, even though you might find slight\nexception to some of its terms, though you might not interpret as others\ndo, all its constitutional phrases.\n\nIn view of the protection which such a constitution affords, especially if\nit had been tested, for a period of eighty years, by all the inward strain\nof domestic evils, and all the outward pressure of invasion; by the\ninfluence of foreign envy, of intrigue, of hostility; by the debasing\npower of disloyalty, the incompetency of rulers, and the general\ndegeneracy of human nature; I say, in view of all these untoward\ninfluences, the government which could still retain its majesty and power,\nstill stretch its Aegis over every national and individual right--you\nwould pronounce the best, both for ruler and people, that ever blessed a\nnation. And you would not hesitate to declare _that_ man a _traitor_, who\nshould attempt _to weaken_ and destroy it!\n\nNow we pretend to say that _our_ government was thus formed by the\nchoicest wisdom and patriotism of the world, with the largest liberty in\nview, under the restraint of law, giving equitable privilege to all its\ncitizens, and so balancing its different departments that they are\nmutually a defence. We pretend to claim for our government the loftiest\npurpose, the most comprehensive views, and the best practical results. We\nclaim for it justice, equality, and power. It does not stand out--a thing\ndistinct from the people and the states. It is not an objective power\nonly, but subjective; it is in every State and in every freeman. It is not\nin machinery, which can be set in motion and work out certain results, as\nif every part of it were iron or steel, and put into action by applied\nheat; but in _men_, in minds, in hearts, in the family circle, in the\nchurch, in every throb of patriotism, in every fibre of the husbandman and\nthe artizan, in the pastor's prayers, and the student's living thoughts.\nIt is in the _nation_ like latent fire, like a hidden life--evoked in time\nof peril, and flashing along the telegraph, breathed in song, uttered in\noratory, thundered from the cannon's mouth, hung out in streaming banners\nwhose \"every hue was born in heaven,\" felt in firm resolve, illustrated in\nresponse to the call of country and of law. Where is our government? Not\nat Washington alone. That is but its symbol. It is throughout all our\nLoyal States. It is enthroned on the granite hills of New Hampshire, sends\nits voice along the Alleghanies, and on the swelling floods of the\nMississippi, and spreads its wing over the children of the West, even to\nthe shores of Oregon. It lives in every cottage, and every mansion, and\nhas a throne in every true, free, noble, Christian heart.\n\nThat it is a _good_ government, you have only in imagination to blot from\nthe face of the earth whatever has grown up under its protection and\nencouragement, by the will and the blessing of the Almighty, during the\nfourscore years of its existence; level all the cities, sink the commerce,\nprostrate the schools and churches, obliterate all the science, history\nand thought it has fostered, quench the light of oratory, turn back the\nwheel of improvement, and leave us at the opening of 1776; estimate all\nthe freedom of act, of utterance, of industry; reckon the sum of human\ncomforts, even of luxuries, it has brought to our hand. Look at all our\nships, our mechanism, our homes, our sanctuaries, our institutions of\nmorality, of mercy and of religion; our wealth, intelligence, order,\npower; consider the elevation given to millions in the worst form of\ncivilization in the land, showing that such is the vitalizing force of our\nnational life, that even slavery here, bad as it is--and we know of\nnothing worse as a system--lifts men above the natural license of savage\nexistence. Consider all this, and much more, that I may not stop to utter,\nand you cannot--you _do_ not--no sane mind _can_ question the supreme\nexcellence--I had almost said the _divine_ excellence--of our\ngovernment. And if there were need of other proof, we have only to remind\nyou with what promptness the call of our noble Chief Magistrate was\nanswered from every free State--from the city and the hamlet; from the\nbank, the bar, the press and the pulpit; from the workshop and the soil;\nfrom the calm and comfort of home and ease and affluence, and from the\ncottage of the poor, as if the pulse of the government were beating in\nevery vein, and the will of the Cabinet had its home in every bosom!\nStrong men, young men, aged men, men of leisure, Christian men--all ready\nto march under the stars and stripes, or to pour out their treasure for\nothers. Mothers and wives and sisters, with breaking hearts and tremulous\nbenedictions, bidding the heroes go--offering them on their country's\naltar. Oh, it would not be thus but for the true manhood which our\ngovernment infuses into loyal citizens. It would not be so, but for the\nChristianity it protects without dictation, and acknowledges without\nostentation.\n\n\n\nII. We come now to the question, _What constitutes rebellion against good\ngovernment_?\n\n\nThere may be criminal rebellion even against a wicked and oppressive\ngovernment. The people may take the law into their own hands, and put to\ndeath, or imprison their rulers, without _first_ having tried\nconstitutional methods of redress. But I speak of rebellion against _good_\ngovernment--such as we have already had in review. There is a difference\nbetween insurrection and rebellion. The former is an act of a people or\npopulation against a single statute, or against a portion of the\nlegislative enactments, without necessarily growing into warfare, or\nrevolt against the whole constitution and the laws. This may become\nrebellion. There is also a difference between rebellion and revolution.\nThe latter, in a political sense, is a change, either wholly or in part,\nof the constitution. This may be effected by argument and a peaceful\nvote--by abdication, by a change of national policy in view of some new\nrelation, and by general consent, or by warfare. \"The revolution in\nEngland in 1688, was occasioned by the abdication of James II., the\nestablishment of the House of Orange on the throne, and the restoring of\nthe constitution to its primitive state.\"\n\nOur revolution of '76, and onward, was not a rebellion; it was resistance\nof oppression, of burdensome taxation without equal representation, and it\nresulted in our distinct nationality.\n\nThe revolutions of France have been of a similar character; they have\nsprung from oppression of the most severe and unnatural kind. This was the\nfact, at least, in 1797 and in 1830. In 1848, when it was my lot to be in\nthe midst of it, the revolution arose from the selfish conduct of Louis\nPhilippe, who enriched himself and his family out of the national\ntreasury, and encouraged his sons in a course which was at war with\nnational precedent, with the commercial interests and democratic\nindividualism of the French; for with their imperial prestiges and tastes\nthey are extreme in their personal democracy.\n\nBut all these revolutions resulted in good to the people. Education,\npublic spirit, enterprise, labor, all the arts of civilization, and even\nevangelical Christianity received a new impulse. Mind was opened and\nenlarged; the people thought for themselves, and sighed for knowledge and\na better faith.\n\nRevolution is going on silently, from year to year, in England. The\nnobility yield by slow, almost imperceptible degrees, to the demands of\nthe people. It is by this process that the Government avoids the shocks\nwhich startle Austria, France and Italy.\n\nSuch is the variety of honest opinion among men on all subjects; so\ndifferent are the degrees of information, and the opportunities of judging\nwith regard to the best measures of government; such a diversity exists in\nthe interests and abilities of a people,--that they may be good citizens\nwithout being satisfied altogether with the constitution, or with those\nwho administer its laws. There will be different political parties. It is\nthe glory of a government that the people are allowed to think and vote as\nthey please, and to express their honest opinions. Perhaps with us,\nexpression is too free, especially in regard to public men and measures.\nWe may have diverse views and convictions, and yet feel and act loyally.\nBut men who endeavor by any influence or means to lessen the loyalty of\nothers, to alienate the love of the people from the government, and who\nsignify their own aversion, not by condemning a single statute and seeking\nits lawful repeal, but by heaping abuse on the constitution and on those\nwho are chosen to administer the laws, by avowing their hostility to the\ngovernment and its policy, or their purpose to resist and war against\nit,--are in a posture of rebellion. Those who, being in office, commanding\nthe arms and other property of the government, cause them to be removed so\nas to weaken its power and strengthen those in actual rebellion, or who\nare threatening the same; those who aid and comfort a population or\nsoldiery who are in a state of actual resistance, and finally, those who\ndo openly and avowedly renounce the authority of the government to which\nthey have sworn allegiance, or take up arms to attack its strongholds,\nseize or destroy its property, or injure the soldiers and citizens who are\nsent to protect it,--are in a state of rebellion against its laws and\nagainst the commonwealth over which it holds the shield of its authority.\n\nKorah was a rebel and a traitor, who having, by intrigue, inspired some\nother leaders with the spirit of sedition, succeeded in drawing from their\nallegiance to Moses and Aaron, a large number of the people, who came\ntogether in a mob to demand a different administration. They were invited\nto refer the matter to the Divine decision, but they stoutly refused,\naccusing Moses of assumption, thus endeavoring to destroy his authority\nover the nation. That was rebellion. Again, in the reign of David, his son\nAbsalom drew the people from their allegiance, then seized the reins of\ngovernment and pursued his father with an army. That was rebellion against\nwholesome law, against the will of God.\n\nNow we have the painful fact before us, that rebellion has sprung up\nagainst our good government. Men in many quarters have secretly plotted,\nand openly avowed hostility to our Federal Union. Eight of our States have\npassed the Ordinance of Secession, four or five others are assuming an\nattitude of hostility to the General Government, or refusing to comply\nwith the Executive, who calls on them to aid in the defence of the\nCapital. This state of things has been preceded by acts of treachery on\nthe part of leading men in the States, by seizure of arms, money, and\npublic defences,--the property of the government. A new Confederacy is\nformed, contrary to oaths and compacts, for the purpose of destroying our\nUnion, and giving perpetuity to slavery. It has attacked our forts,\nadulterated our coin, stolen our arms, proclaimed piracy against our\ncommerce, set a price on the head of our Chief Magistrate, threatened our\nCapital, and raised armies to exterminate, if possible, our nationality.\nAnd all this it has done without one act of the Government to provoke such\nprocedure; without any oppression; without any threat; but in the face of\nevery honorable proposal on our part, after long and patient endurance of\ntheir encroachment and plunders; even until foreign journals deride us for\nour forbearance, and the rebels themselves insult our delay.\n\nThere are those who have compared this rebellion with our revolution of\n'76. There could hardly be a wider distinction, both in principle and in\nfact, than between these two movements. The Colonies, had been oppressed\nby \"navigation laws,\" intended by the British Parliament to crush out\ntheir commerce for a whole century, from 1660 to 1775. Their weakness\nduring that period did not allow of resistance. They were taxed\noppressively, while they were not allowed a representation. This was in\nviolation of Magna Charta; for the government of Great Britain was\nrepresentative. Having been aided by the Colonists during the Seven Years'\nWar, in the subjugation of Canada, the Parent Government--without asking\ntaxation through the regular action of the Colonial Government--assumed\nthe right to tax our expanding commerce, and commenced a vigorous\nenforcement of revenue laws. \"Writs of Assistance\" were issued, whereby\nofficers of the king were allowed to break open any citizen's store or\ndwelling, to search for, and seize foreign merchandise; sheriffs also were\ncompelled to assist in the work. The sanctions of private life might, by\nthis act be invaded at any time by hirelings; and bad as it was in itself,\nit was liable to more monstrous abuse. Then came the \"_sugar bill_,\"\nimposing enormous duties on various articles of merchandise from the West\nIndies, and greatly crippling Colonial commerce: then the infamous Stamp\nAct, by which every legal instrument, in order to validity, must have the\nseal of the British Government--deeds, diplomas, &c., costing from\nthirty-six cents to ten dollars apiece: then the duty on tea; and,\nfinally, the quartering of soldiers on our citizens in time of peace, for\nthe express purpose of subjugating our industry and energy to the selfish\npurposes of the crown.\n\nIt is enough to say, that the rebels against our Government have suffered\nno oppression. They do not set forth any legal ground of Secession. The\ngovernment has done nothing to call out their indignation, or to inflict\non them a wrong. They have had more than their share of public office;\nthey have had a larger representation, in proportion to their free\ncitizens, than we have; they have been protected in their claims, even\nagainst the convictions of the North; we yielding, as a political demand,\nwhat we do not wholly admit as a Christian duty. We have assisted them by\nenactments, by money, and by arms, in the preservation of a system at war\nwith our conscience, and with our liberties. We have paid for lands which\nthey occupy; and after all their indignities and taunts, and attacks on\nour citizens, their plunders, and their warlike demonstrations, we have\nbeen patient; and are even now imposing on ourselves restraint from the\nexecution of that chastisement, which many of their sober and awed\ncitizens acknowledge to be just, and which, if the call were made by the\nExecutive, would at once be hurled on the rebels by an indignant people,\nlike the rush of destiny.\n\nNow, I grant, for I do not wish to make the matter worse than it is\nagainst them, that in the North, individuals have demanded more than the\nSouth were able, at once, to give. Some have pushed reform faster than it\nwould bear, faster than the laws of Providence would allow; but it was\nhonestly and conscientiously done. We have sometimes in our warmth,\nuttered irritating words; but all this has been returned by blows, and by\nsavage vindictiveness. We have shown a willingness, of late, to yield some\nthings; to abide by the sense of the whole people; but these States are,\nby their rulers, declared _out of the Union_, without appeal to the\npeople; they have commenced the war, and now they are regarded by the\nwhole world as in a state of rebellion, not of justifiable revolution.\nThey would submit to no method of adjustment that we could honorably\nallow. They desired war, as they have been for years preparing for it, at\nthe expense of the Government, and in its service and trust, drawing their\nlife from the bosom which they now sting; and because freedom will no\nlonger bow, as it has done for a whole generation, to their will, they\nrebel, proclaim a system of piracy, and threaten the subjugation of the\nwhole American people. It is a deep, and long determined treason, running\ninto the whole national life, and is become to ourselves a question of\n_personal_ liberty.\n\n\n\n\nIII. What then, we ask, _is the duty of all citizens when good government\nis assailed by rebellion_?\n\n\nDoubtless, _one_ duty is to inquire whether they have in any way\ncontributed criminally to the occasion or the causes of such rebellion;\nwhether they have demanded too much of the disaffected, or encouraged a\nwrong spirit in them by coinciding with views leading to their present\nattitude; whether they have participated in any way with a policy\ncalculated to irritate, to defy, to provoke honest minds to anger? Whether\nas individuals, as Christians, they have been bitter and harsh, and\nvengeful, or are so now; and if they find any such spirit, it becomes them\nto repent, and school themselves into Christian charity and moderation.\nBut, notwithstanding any possible error in the past, the Christian citizen\nmust consecrate himself to the defence of the government and its _policy_;\nfor however, there is a distinction ordinarily between the two; in a\ncrisis that involves a nation's life, the policy which would save it, is\nthe spirit\n\n### Summary:\n\n"}

Of\nthe great desire of this fourth pilgrim, and how it was denied, yet\naccomplished in the denial; of his many wanderings and the probations of\nhis soul; of the long way of his seeking, and the strange way of his\nfinding, the One whom he sought--I would tell the tale as I have heard\nfragments of it in the Hall of Dreams, in the palace of the Heart of\nMan.\n\n\n\n\nTHE SIGN IN THE SKY\n\n\nIn the days when Augustus Caesar was master of many kings and Herod\nreigned in Jerusalem, there lived in the city of Ecbatana, among the\nmountains of Persia, a certain man named Artaban, the Median. His house\nstood close to the outermost of the seven walls which encircled the\nroyal treasury. From his roof he could look over the rising battlements\nof black and white and crimson and blue and red and silver and gold, to\nthe hill where the summer palace of the Parthian emperors glittered like\na jewel in a sevenfold crown.\n\nAround the dwelling of Artaban spread a fair garden, a tangle of flowers\nand fruit-trees, watered by a score of streams descending from the\n<DW72>s of Mount Orontes, and made musical by innumerable birds. But all\ncolour was lost in the soft and odorous darkness of the late September\nnight, and all sounds were hushed in the deep charm of its silence, save\nthe plashing of the water, like a voice half sobbing and half laughing\nunder the shadows. High above the trees a dim glow of light shone\nthrough the curtained arches of the upper chamber, where the master of\nthe house was holding council with his friends.\n\nHe stood by the doorway to greet his guests--a tall, dark man of about\nforty years, with brilliant eyes set near together under his broad brow,\nand firm lines graven around his fine, thin lips; the brow of a dreamer\nand the mouth of a soldier, a man of sensitive feeling but inflexible\nwill--one of those who, in whatever age they may live, are born for\ninward conflict and a life of quest.\n\nHis robe was of pure white wool, thrown over a tunic of silk; and a\nwhite, pointed cap, with long lapels at the sides, rested on his flowing\nblack hair. It was the dress of the ancient priesthood of the Magi,\ncalled the fire-worshippers.\n\n\"Welcome!\" he said, in his low, pleasant voice, as one after another\nentered the room--\"welcome, Abdus; peace be with you, Rhodaspes and\nTigranes, and with you my father, Abgarus. You are all welcome, and this\nhouse grows bright with the joy of your presence.\"\n\nThere were nine of the men, differing widely in age, but alike in the\nrichness of their dress of many- silks, and in the massive\ngolden collars around their necks, marking them as Parthian nobles, and\nin the winged circles of gold resting upon their breasts, the sign of\nthe followers of Zoroaster.\n\nThey took their places around a small black altar at the end of the\nroom, where a tiny flame was burning. Artaban, standing beside it, and\nwaving a barsom of thin tamarisk branches above the fire, fed it with\ndry sticks of pine and fragrant oils. Then he began the ancient chant of\nthe Yasna, and the voices of his companions joined in the beautiful hymn\nto Ahura-Mazda:\n\nWe worship the Spirit Divine,\n   all wisdom and goodness possessing,\nSurrounded by Holy Immortals,\n   the givers of bounty and blessing.\nWe joy in the works of His hands,\n   His truth and His power confessing.\n\nWe praise all the things that are pure,\n    for these are His only Creation;\nThe thoughts that are true, and the words\n    and deeds that have won approbation;\nThese are supported by Him,\n    and for these we make adoration.\n\nHear us, O Mazda! Thou livest\n    in truth and in heavenly gladness;\nCleanse us from falsehood, and keep us\n    from evil and bondage to badness;\nPour out the light and the joy of Thy life\n    on our darkness and sadness.\n\nShine on our gardens and fields,\n    Shine on our working and weaving;\nShine on the whole race of man,\n    Believing and unbelieving;\n    Shine on us now through the night,\n    Shine on us now in Thy might,\nThe flame of our holy love\n    and the song of our worship receiving.\n\nThe fire rose with the chant, throbbing as if it were made of musical\nflame, until it cast a bright illumination through the whole apartment,\nrevealing its simplicity and splendour.\n\nThe floor was laid with tiles of dark blue veined with white; pilasters\nof twisted silver stood out against the blue walls; the clearstory of\nround-arched windows above them was hung with azure silk; the vaulted\nceiling was a pavement of sapphires, like the body of heaven in its\nclearness, sown with silver stars. From the four corners of the roof\nhung four golden magic-wheels, called the tongues of the gods. At the\neastern end, behind the altar, there were two dark-red pillars of\nporphyry; above them a lintel of the same stone, on which was carved the\nfigure of a winged archer, with his arrow set to the string and his bow\ndrawn.\n\nThe doorway between the pillars, which opened upon the terrace of the\nroof, was covered with a heavy curtain of the colour of a ripe\npomegranate, embroidered with innumerable golden rays shooting upward\nfrom the floor. In effect the room was like a quiet, starry night, all\nazure and silver, flushed in the East with rosy promise of the dawn. It\nwas, as the house of a man should be, an expression of the character and\nspirit of the master.\n\nHe turned to his friends when the song was ended, and invited them to be\nseated on the divan at the western end of the room.\n\n\"You have come to-night,\" said he, looking around the circle, \"at my\ncall, as the faithful scholars of Zoroaster, to renew your worship and\nrekindle your faith in the God of Purity, even as this fire has been\nrekindled on the altar. We worship not the fire, but Him of whom it is\nthe chosen symbol, because it is the purest of all created things. It\nspeaks to us of one who is Light and Truth. Is it not so, my father?\"\n\n\"It is well said, my son,\" answered the venerable Abgarus. \"The\nenlightened are never idolaters. They lift the veil of the form and go\nin to the shrine of the reality, and new light and truth are coming to\nthem continually through the old symbols.\" \"Hear me, then, my father\nand my friends,\" said Artaban, very quietly, \"while I tell you of the\nnew light and truth that have come to me through the most ancient of all\nsigns. We have searched the secrets of nature together, and studied the\nhealing virtues of water and fire and the plants. We have read also the\nbooks of prophecy in which the future is dimly foretold in words that\nare hard to understand. But the highest of all learning is the knowledge\nof the stars. To trace their courses is to untangle the threads of the\nmystery of life from the beginning to the end. If we could follow them\nperfectly, nothing would be hidden from us. But is not our knowledge of\nthem still incomplete? Are there not many stars still beyond our\nhorizon--lights that are known only to the dwellers in the far\nsouth-land, among the spice-trees of Punt and the gold mines of Ophir?\"\n\nThere was a murmur of assent among the listeners.\n\n\"The stars,\" said Tigranes, \"are the thoughts of the Eternal. They are\nnumberless. But the thoughts of man can be counted, like the years\nof his life. The wisdom of the Magi is the greatest of all wisdoms on\nearth, because it knows its own ignorance. And that is the secret of\npower. We keep men always looking and waiting for a new sunrise. But we\nourselves know that the darkness is equal to the light, and that the\nconflict between them will never be ended.\"\n\n\"That does not satisfy me,\" answered Artaban, \"for, if the waiting must\nbe endless, if there could be no fulfilment of it, then it would not be\nwisdom to look and wait. We should become like those new teachers of the\nGreeks, who say that there is no truth, and that the only wise men are\nthose who spend their lives in discovering and exposing the lies that\nhave been believed in the world. But the new sunrise will certainly dawn\nin the appointed time. Do not our own books tell us that this will come\nto pass, and that men will see the brightness of a great light?\"\n\n\"That is true,\" said the voice of Abgarus; \"every faithful disciple of\nZoroaster knows the prophecy of the Avesta and carries the word in his\nheart. 'In that day Sosiosh the Victorious shall arise out of the number\nof the prophets in the east country. Around him shall shine a mighty\nbrightness, and he shall make life everlasting, incorruptible, and\nimmortal, and the dead shall rise again.'\"\n\n\"This is a dark saying,\" said Tigranes, \"and it may be that we shall\nnever understand it. It is better to consider the things that are near\nat hand, and to increase the influence of the Magi in their own country,\nrather than to look for one who may be a stranger, and to whom we must\nresign our power.\"\n\nThe others seemed to approve these words. There was a silent feeling of\nagreement manifest among them; their looks responded with that\nindefinable expression which always follows when a speaker has uttered\nthe thought that has been slumbering in the hearts of his listeners. But\nArtaban turned to Abgarus with a glow on his face, and said:\n\n\"My father, I have kept this prophecy in the secret place of my soul.\nReligion without a great hope would be like an altar without a living\nfire. And now the flame has burned more brightly, and by the light of it\nI have read other words which also have come from the fountain of Truth,\nand speak yet more clearly of the rising of the Victorious One in his\nbrightness.\"\n\nHe drew from the breast of his tunic two small rolls of fine linen, with\nwriting upon them, and unfolded them carefully upon his knee.\n\n\"In the years that are lost in the past, long before our fathers came\ninto the land of Babylon, there were wise men in Chaldea, from whom the\nfirst of the Magi learned the secret of the heavens. And of these Balaam\nthe son of Beor was one of the mightiest. Hear the words of his\nprophecy: 'There shall come a star out of Jacob, and a sceptre shall\narise out of Israel.'\"\n\nThe lips of Tigranes drew downward with contempt, as he said:\n\n\"Judah was a captive by the waters of Babylon, and the sons of Jacob\nwere in bondage to our kings. The tribes of Israel are scattered through\nthe mountains like lost sheep, and from the remnant that dwells in Judea\nunder the yoke of Rome neither star nor sceptre shall arise.\"\n\n\"And yet,\" answered Artaban, \"it was the Hebrew Daniel, the mighty\nsearcher of dreams, the counsellor of kings, the wise Belteshazzar, who\nwas most honored and beloved of our great King Cyrus. A prophet of sure\nthings and a reader of the thoughts of God, Daniel proved himself to our\npeople. And these are the words that he wrote.\" (Artaban read from the\nsecond roll:) \"'Know, therefore, and understand that from the going\nforth of the commandment to restore Jerusalem, unto the Anointed One,\nthe Prince, the time shall be seven and threescore and two weeks.'\"\n\n\"But, my son,\" said Abgarus, doubtfully, \"these are mystical numbers.\nWho can interpret them, or who can find the key that shall unlock their\nmeaning?\"\n\nArtaban answered: \"It has been shown to me and to my three companions\namong the Magi--Caspar, Melchior, and Balthazar. We have searched the\nancient tablets of Chaldea and computed the time. It falls in this year.\nWe have studied the sky, and in the spring of the year we saw two of the\ngreatest stars draw near together in the sign of the Fish, which is the\nhouse of the Hebrews. We also saw a new star there, which shone for one\nnight and then vanished. Now again the two great planets are meeting.\nThis night is their conjunction. My three brothers are watching at the\nancient temple of the Seven Spheres, at Borsippa, in Babylonia, and I am\nwatching here. If the star shines again, they will wait ten days for me\nat the temple, and then we will set out together for Jerusalem, to see\nand worship the promised one who shall be born King of Israel. I believe\nthe sign will come. I have made ready for the journey. I have sold my\nhouse and my possessions, and bought these three jewels--a sapphire, a\nruby, and a pearl--to carry them as tribute to the King. And I ask you\nto go with me on the pilgrimage, that we may have joy together in\nfinding the Prince who is worthy to be served.\"\n\nWhile he was speaking he thrust his hand into the inmost fold of his\ngirdle and drew out three great gems--one blue as a fragment of the\nnight sky, one redder than a ray of sunrise, and one as pure as the peak\nof a snow mountain at twilight--and laid them on the outspread linen\nscrolls before him.\n\nBut his friends looked on with strange and alien eyes. A veil of doubt\nand mistrust came over their faces, like a fog creeping up from the\nmarshes to hide the hills. They glanced at each other with looks of\nwonder and pity, as those who have listened to incredible sayings, the\nstory of a wild vision, or the proposal of an impossible enterprise.\n\nAt last Tigranes said: \"Artaban, this is a vain dream. It comes from too\nmuch looking upon the stars and the cherishing of lofty thoughts. It\nwould be wiser to spend the time in gathering money for the new\nfire-temple at Chala. No king will ever rise from the broken race of\nIsrael, and no end will ever come to the eternal strife of light and\ndarkness. He who looks for it is a chaser of shadows. Farewell.\"\n\nAnd another said: \"Artaban, I have no knowledge of these things, and my\noffice as guardian of the royal treasure binds me here. The quest is not\nfor me. But if thou must follow it, fare thee well.\"\n\nAnd another said: \"In my house there sleeps a new bride, and I cannot\nleave her nor take her with me on this strange journey. This quest is\nnot for me. But may thy steps be prospered wherever thou goest. So,\nfarewell.\"\n\nAnd another said: \"I am ill and unfit for hardship, but there is a man\namong my servants whom I will send with thee when thou goest, to bring\nme word how thou farest.\"\n\nBut Abgarus, the oldest and the one who loved Artaban the best, lingered\nafter the others had gone, and said, gravely: \"My son, it may be that\nthe light of truth is in this sign that has appeared in the skies, and\nthen it will surely lead to the Prince and the mighty brightness. Or\nit may be that it is only a shadow of the light, as Tigranes has said,\nand then he who follows it will have only a long pilgrimage and an empty\nsearch. But it is better to follow even the shadow of the best than to\nremain content with the worst. And those who would see wonderful things\nmust often be ready to travel alone. I am too old for this journey, but\nmy heart shall be a companion of the pilgrimage day and night, and I\nshall know the end of thy quest. Go in peace.\"\n\nSo one by one they went out of the azure chamber with its silver stars,\nand Artaban was left in solitude.\n\nHe gathered up the jewels and replaced them in his girdle. For a long\ntime he stood and watched the flame that flickered and sank upon the\naltar. Then he crossed the hall, lifted the heavy curtain, and passed\nout between the dull red pillars of porphyry to the terrace on the roof.\n\nThe shiver that thrills through the earth ere she rouses from her\nnight sleep had already begun, and the cool wind that heralds the\ndaybreak was drawing downward from the lofty snow-traced ravines of\nMount Orontes. Birds, half awakened, crept and chirped among the\nrustling leaves, and the smell of ripened grapes came in brief wafts\nfrom the arbours.\n\nFar over the eastern plain a white mist stretched like a lake. But where\nthe distant peak of Zagros serrated the western horizon the sky was\nclear. Jupiter and Saturn rolled together like drops of lambent flame\nabout to blend in one.\n\nAs Artaban watched them, behold, an azure spark was born out of the\ndarkness beneath, rounding itself with purple splendours to a crimson\nsphere, and spiring upward through rays of saffron and orange into a\npoint of white radiance. Tiny and infinitely remote, yet perfect in\nevery part, it pulsated in the enormous vault as if the three jewels in\nthe Magian's breast had mingled and been transformed into a living heart\nof light. He bowed his head. He covered his brow with his hands.\n\n\"It is the sign,\" he said. \"The King is coming, and I will go to meet\nhim.\"\n\n\n\n\nBY THE WATERS OF BABYLON\n\n\nAll night long Vasda, the swiftest of Artaban's horses, had been\nwaiting, saddled and bridled, in her stall, pawing the ground\nimpatiently, and shaking her bit as if she shared the eagerness of her\nmaster's purpose, though she knew not its meaning.\n\nBefore the birds had fully roused to their strong, high, joyful chant of\nmorning song, before the white mist had begun to lift lazily from the\nplain, the other wise man was in the saddle, riding swiftly along the\nhigh-road, which skirted the base of Mount Orontes, westward.\n\nHow close, how intimate is the comradeship between a man and his\nfavourite horse on a long journey. It is a silent, comprehensive\nfriendship, an intercourse beyond the need of words. They drink at the\nsame way-side springs, and sleep under the same guardian stars. They are\nconscious together of the subduing spell of nightfall and the quickening\njoy of daybreak. The master shares his evening meal with his hungry\ncompanion, and feels the soft, moist lips caressing the palm of his hand\nas they close over the morsel of bread. In the gray dawn he is roused\nfrom his bivouac by the gentle stir of a warm, sweet breath over his\nsleeping face, and looks up into the eyes of his faithful\nfellow-traveller, ready and waiting for the toil of the day. Surely,\nunless he is a pagan and an unbeliever, by whatever name he calls upon\nhis God, he will thank Him for this voiceless sympathy, this dumb\naffection, and his morning prayer will embrace a double blessing--God\nbless us both, and keep our feet from falling and our souls from death!\n\nAnd then, through the keen morning air, the swift hoofs beat their\nspirited music along the road, keeping time to the pulsing of two hearts\nthat are moved with the same eager desire--to conquer space, to devour\nthe distance, to attain the goal of the journey.\n\nArtaban must indeed ride wisely and well if he would keep the appointed\nhour with the other Magi; for the route was a hundred and fifty\nparasangs, and fifteen was the utmost that he could travel in a day. But\nhe knew Vasda's strength, and pushed forward without anxiety, making the\nfixed distance every day, though he must travel late into the night, and\nin the morning long before sunrise.\n\nHe passed along the brown <DW72>s of Mt. Orontes, furrowed by the rocky\ncourses of a hundred torrents.\n\nHe crossed the level plains of the Nisaeans, where the famous herds of\nhorses, feeding in the wide pastures, tossed their heads at Vasda's\napproach, and galloped away with a thunder of many hoofs, and flocks of\nwild birds rose suddenly from the swampy meadows, wheeling in great\ncircles with a shining flutter of innumerable wings and shrill cries of\nsurprise.\n\nHe traversed the fertile fields of Concabar, where the dust from the\nthreshing-floors filled the air with a golden mist, half hiding the\nhuge temple of Astarte with its four hundred pillars.\n\nAt Baghistan, among the rich gardens watered by fountains from the rock,\nhe looked up at the mountain thrusting its immense rugged brow out over\nthe road, and saw the figure of King Darius trampling upon his fallen\nfoes, and the proud list of his wars and conquests graven high upon the\nface of the eternal cliff.\n\nOver many a cold and desolate pass, crawling painfully across the\nwind-swept shoulders of the hills; down many a black mountain-gorge,\nwhere the river roared and raced before him like a savage guide; across\nmany a smiling vale, with terraces of yellow limestone full of vines and\nfruit-trees; through the oak-groves of Carine and the dark Gates of\nZagros, walled in by precipices; into the ancient city of Chala, where\nthe people of Samaria had been kept in captivity long ago; and out again\nby the mighty portal, riven through the encircling hills, where he saw\nthe image of the High Priest of the Magi sculptured on the wall of\nrock, with hand uplifted as if to bless the centuries of pilgrims; past\nthe entrance of the narrow defile, filled from end to end with orchards\nof peaches and figs, through which the river Gyndes foamed down to meet\nhim; over the broad rice-fields, where the autumnal vapours spread their\ndeathly mists; following along the course of the river, under tremulous\nshadows of poplar and tamarind, among the lower hills; and out upon the\nflat plain, where the road ran straight as an arrow through the\nstubble-fields and parched meadows; past the city of Ctesiphon, where\nthe Parthian emperors reigned, and the vast metropolis of Seleucia which\nAlexander built; across the swirling floods of Tigris and the many\nchannels of Euphrates, flowing yellow through the corn-lands--Artaban\npressed onward until he arrived, at nightfall of the tenth day, beneath\nthe shattered walls of populous Babylon.\n\nVasda was almost spent, and he would gladly have turned into the city to\nfind rest and refreshment for himself and for her. But he knew that it\nwas three hours' journey yet to the Temple of the Seven Spheres, and\nhe must reach the place by midnight if he would find his comrades\nwaiting. So he did not halt, but rode steadily across the\nstubble-fields.\n\nA grove of date-palms made an island of gloom in the pale yellow sea. As\nshe passed into the shadow Vasda slackened her pace, and began to pick\nher way more carefully.\n\nNear the farther end of the darkness an access of caution seemed to fall\nupon her. She scented some danger or difficulty; it was not in her heart\nto fly from it--only to be prepared for it, and to meet it wisely, as a\ngood horse should do. The grove was close and silent as the tomb; not a\nleaf rustled, not a bird sang.\n\nShe felt her steps before her delicately, carrying her head low, and\nsighing now and then with apprehension. At last she gave a quick breath\nof anxiety and dismay, and stood stock-still, quivering in every muscle,\nbefore a dark object in the shadow of the last palm-tree.\n\nArtaban dismounted. The dim starlight revealed the form of a man lying\nacross the road. His humble dress and the outline of his haggard face\nshowed that he was probably one of the poor Hebrew exiles who still\ndwelt in great numbers in the vicinity. His pallid skin, dry and yellow\nas parchment, bore the mark of the deadly fever which ravaged the\nmarsh-lands in autumn. The chill of death was in his lean hand, and, as\nArtaban released it, the arm fell back inertly upon the motionless\nbreast.\n\nHe turned away with a thought of pity, consigning the body to that\nstrange burial which the Magians deem most fitting--the funeral of the\ndesert, from which the kites and vultures rise on dark wings, and the\nbeasts of prey slink furtively away, leaving only a heap of white bones\nin the sand.\n\nBut, as he turned, a long, faint, ghostly sigh came from the man's lips.\nThe brown, bony fingers closed convulsively on the hem of the Magian's\nrobe and held him fast.\n\nArtaban's heart leaped to his throat, not with fear, but with a dumb\nresentment at the importunity of this blind delay. How could he stay\nhere in the darkness to minister to a dying stranger? What claim had\nthis unknown fragment of human life upon his compassion or his service?\nIf he lingered but for an hour he could hardly reach Borsippa at the\nappointed time. His companions would think he had given up the journey.\nThey would go without him. He would lose his quest.\n\nBut if he went on now, the man would surely die. If he stayed, life\nmight be restored. His spirit throbbed and fluttered with the urgency of\nthe crisis. Should he risk the great reward of his divine faith for the\nsake of a single deed of human love? Should he turn aside, if only for a\nmoment, from the following of the star, to give a cup of cold water to a\npoor, perishing Hebrew?\n\n\"God of truth and purity,\" he prayed, \"direct me in the holy path, the\nway of wisdom which Thou only knowest.\"\n\nThen he turned back to the sick man. Loosening the grasp of his hand, he\ncarried him to a little mound at the foot of the palm-tree. He unbound\nthe thick folds of the turban and opened the garment above the sunken\nbreast. He brought water from one of the small canals near by, and\nmoistened the sufferer's brow and mouth. He mingled a draught of one of\nthose simple but potent remedies which he carried always in his\ngirdle--for the Magians were physicians as well as astrologers--and\npoured it slowly between the colourless lips. Hour after hour he labored\nas only a skilful healer of disease can do; and, at last, the man's\nstrength returned; he sat up and looked about him.\n\n\"Who art thou?\" he said, in the rude dialect of the country, \"and why\nhast thou sought me here to bring back my life?\"\n\n\"I am Artaban the Magian, of the city of Ecbatana, and I am going to\nJerusalem in search of one who is to be born King of the Jews, a great\nPrince and Deliverer for all men. I dare not delay any longer upon my\njourney, for the caravan that has waited for me may depart without me.\nBut see, here is all that I have left of bread and wine, and here is a\npotion of healing herbs. When thy strength is restored thou can'st\nfind the dwellings of the Hebrews among the houses of Babylon.\"\n\nThe Jew raised his trembling hands solemnly to heaven.\n\n\"Now may the God of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob bless and prosper the\njourney of the merciful, and bring him in peace to his desired haven.\nBut stay; I have nothing to give thee in return--only this: that I can\ntell thee where the Messiah must be sought. For our prophets have said\nthat he should be born not in Jerusalem, but in Bethlehem of Judah. May\nthe Lord bring thee in safety to that place, because thou hast had pity\nupon the sick.\"\n\nIt was already long past midnight. Artaban rode in haste, and Vasda,\nrestored by the brief rest, ran eagerly through the silent plain and\nswam the channels of the river. She put forth the remnant of her\nstrength, and fled over the ground like a gazelle.\n\n[Illustration: \"HE CAUGHT IT UP AND READ\"]\n\nBut the first beam of the sun sent her shadow before her as she entered\nupon the final stadium of the journey, and the eyes of Artaban\nanxiously scanning the great mound of Nimrod and the Temple of the Seven\nSpheres, could discern no trace of his friends.\n\nThe many- terraces of black and orange and red and yellow and\ngreen and blue and white, shattered by the convulsions of nature, and\ncrumbling under the repeated blows of human violence, still glittered\nlike a ruined rainbow in the morning light.\n\nArtaban rode swiftly around the hill. He dismounted and climbed to the\nhighest terrace, looking out towards the west.\n\nThe huge desolation of the marshes stretched away to the horizon and the\nborder of the desert. Bitterns stood by the stagnant pools and jackals\nskulked through the low bushes; but there was no sign of the caravan of\nthe wise men, far or near.\n\nAt the edge of the terrace he saw a little cairn of broken bricks, and\nunder them a piece of parchment. He caught it up and read: \"We have\nwaited past the midnight, and can delay no longer. We go to find the\nKing. Follow us across the desert.\" Artaban sat down upon the ground\nand covered his head in despair.\n\n\"How can I cross the desert,\" said he, \"with no food and with a spent\nhorse? I must return to Babylon, sell my sapphire, and buy a train of\ncamels, and provision for the journey. I may never overtake my friends.\nOnly God the merciful knows whether I shall not lose the sight of the\nKing because I tarried to show mercy.\"\n\n\n\n\nFOR THE SAKE OF A LITTLE CHILD\n\n\nThere was a silence in the Hall of Dreams, where I was\nlistening to the story of the other wise man. And through this silence I\nsaw, but very dimly, his figure passing over the dreary undulations of\nthe desert, high upon the back of his camel, rocking steadily onward\nlike a ship over the waves.\n\nThe land of death spread its cruel net around him. The stony wastes bore\nno fruit but briers and thorns. The dark ledges of rock thrust\nthemselves above the surface here and there, like the bones of perished\nmonsters. Arid and inhospitable mountain ranges rose before him\n\n### Summary:\n\n"}

It was like the beating of wings.\" Frontispiece\n\n\"I told you the place was uncanny.\"\n\nInstinctively they all knelt down.\n\nCarried with them an inalienable joy and possession into the great\nworld.\n\n\n\n\n\nA CHRISTMAS MYSTERY\n\n\n\nThree men who had gained great fame and honour throughout the world met\nunexpectedly in front of the bookstall at Paddington Station. Like most\nof the great ones of the earth they were personally acquainted, and they\nexchanged surprised greetings.\n\nSir Angus McCurdie, the eminent physicist, scowled at the two others\nbeneath his heavy black eyebrows.\n\n\"I'm going to a God-forsaken place in Cornwall called Trehenna,\" said\nhe.\n\n\"That's odd; so am I,\" croaked Professor Biggleswade. He was a little,\nuntidy man with round spectacles, a fringe of greyish beard and a weak,\nrasping voice, and he knew more of Assyriology than any man, living or\ndead. A flippant pupil once remarked that the Professor's face was\nfurnished with a Babylonic cuneiform in lieu of features.\n\n\"People called Deverill, at Foulis Castle?\" asked Sir Angus.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Professor Biggleswade.\n\n\"How curious! I am going to the Deverills, too,\" said the third man.\n\nThis man was the Right Honourable Viscount Doyne, the renowned Empire\nBuilder and Administrator, around whose solitary and remote life popular\nimagination had woven many legends. He looked at the world through tired\ngrey eyes, and the heavy, drooping, blonde moustache seemed tired, too,\nand had dragged down the tired face into deep furrows. He was smoking a\nlong black cigar.\n\n\"I suppose we may as well travel down together,\" said Sir Angus, not\nvery cordially.\n\nLord Doyne said courteously: \"I have a reserved carriage. The railway\ncompany is always good enough to place one at my disposal. It would give\nme great pleasure if you would share it.\"\n\nThe invitation was accepted, and the three men crossed the busy, crowded\nplatform to take their seats in the great express train. A porter, laden\nwith an incredible load of paraphernalia, trying to make his way through\nthe press, happened to jostle Sir Angus McCurdie. He rubbed his shoulder\nfretfully.\n\n\"Why the whole land should be turned into a bear garden on account of\nthis exploded superstition of Christmas is one of the anomalies of\nmodern civilization. Look at this insensate welter of fools travelling\nin wild herds to disgusting places merely because it's Christmas!\"\n\n\"You seem to be travelling yourself, McCurdie,\" said Lord Doyne.\n\n\"Yes--and why the devil I'm doing it, I've not the faintest notion,\"\nreplied Sir Angus.\n\n\"It's going to be a beast of a journey,\" he remarked some moments later,\nas the train carried them slowly out of the station. \"The whole country\nis under snow--and as far as I can understand we have to change twice\nand wind up with a twenty-mile motor drive.\"\n\nHe was an iron-faced, beetle-browed, stern man, and this morning he did\nnot seem to be in the best of tempers. Finding his companions inclined\nto be sympathetic, he continued his lamentation.\n\n\"And merely because it's Christmas I've had to shut up my laboratory and\ngive my young fools a holiday--just when I was in the midst of a most\nimportant series of experiments.\"\n\nProfessor Biggleswade, who had heard vaguely of and rather looked down\nupon such new-fangled toys as radium and thorium and helium and\nargon--for the latest astonishing developments in the theory of\nradio-activity had brought Sir Angus McCurdie his world-wide fame--said\nsomewhat ironically:\n\n\"If the experiments were so important, why didn't you lock yourself up\nwith your test tubes and electric batteries and finish them alone?\"\n\n\"Man!\" said McCurdie, bending across the carriage, and speaking with a\ncurious intensity of voice, \"d'ye know I'd give a hundred pounds to be\nable to answer that question?\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" asked the Professor, startled.\n\n\"I should like to know why I'm sitting in this damned train and going to\nvisit a couple of addle-headed society people whom I'm scarcely\nacquainted with, when I might be at home in my own good company\nfurthering the progress of science.\"\n\n\"I myself,\" said the Professor, \"am not acquainted with them at all.\"\n\nIt was Sir Angus McCurdie's turn to look surprised.\n\n\"Then why are you spending Christmas with them?\"\n\n\"I reviewed a ridiculous blank-verse tragedy written by Deverill on the\nDeath of Sennacherib. Historically it was puerile. I said so in no\nmeasured terms. He wrote a letter claiming to be a poet and not an\narchaeologist. I replied that the day had passed when poets could with\nimpunity commit the abominable crime of distorting history. He retorted\nwith some futile argument, and we went on exchanging letters, until his\ninvitation and my acceptance concluded the correspondence.\"\n\nMcCurdie, still bending his black brows on him, asked him why he had not\ndeclined. The Professor screwed up his face till it looked more like a\ncuneiform than ever. He, too, found the question difficult to answer,\nbut he showed a bold front.\n\n\"I felt it my duty,\" said he, \"to teach that preposterous ignoramus\nsomething worth knowing about Sennacherib. Besides I am a bachelor and\nwould sooner spend Christmas, as to whose irritating and meaningless\nannoyance I cordially agree with you, among strangers than among my\nmarried sisters' numerous and nerve-racking families.\"\n\nSir Angus McCurdie, the hard, metallic apostle of radio-activity,\nglanced for a moment out of the window at the grey, frost-bitten fields.\nThen he said:\n\n\"I'm a widower. My wife died many years ago and, thank God, we had no\nchildren. I generally spend Christmas alone.\"\n\nHe looked out of the window again. Professor Biggleswade suddenly\nremembered the popular story of the great scientist's antecedents, and\nreflected that as McCurdie had once run, a barefoot urchin, through the\nGlasgow mud, he was likely to have little kith or kin. He himself envied\nMcCurdie. He was always praying to be delivered from his sisters and\nnephews and nieces, whose embarrassing demands no calculated coldness\ncould repress.\n\n\"Children are the root of all evil,\" said he. \"Happy the man who has his\nquiver empty.\"\n\nSir Angus McCurdie did not reply at once; when he spoke again it was\nwith reference to their prospective host.\n\n\"I met Deverill,\" said he, \"at the Royal Society's Soiree this year. One\nof my assistants was demonstrating a peculiar property of thorium and\nDeverill seemed interested. I asked him to come to my laboratory the\nnext day, and found he didn't know a damned thing about anything. That's\nall the acquaintance I have with him.\"\n\nLord Doyne, the great administrator, who had been wearily turning over\nthe pages of an illustrated weekly chiefly filled with flamboyant\nphotographs of obscure actresses, took his gold glasses from his nose\nand the black cigar from his lips, and addressed his companions.\n\n\"I've been considerably interested in your conversation,\" said he, \"and\nas you've been frank, I'll be frank too. I knew Mrs. Deverill's mother,\nLady Carstairs, very well years ago, and of course Mrs. Deverill when\nshe was a child. Deverill I came across once in Egypt--he had been sent\non a diplomatic mission to Teheran. As for our being invited on such\nslight acquaintance, little Mrs. Deverill has the reputation of being\nthe only really successful celebrity hunter in England. She inherited\nthe faculty from her mother, who entertained the whole world. We're sure\nto find archbishops, and eminent actors, and illustrious divorcees asked\nto meet us. That's one thing. But why I, who loathe country house\nparties and children and Christmas as much as Biggleswade, am going down\nthere to-day, I can no more explain than you can. It's a devilish odd\ncoincidence.\"\n\nThe three men looked at one another. Suddenly McCurdie shivered and drew\nhis fur coat around him.\n\n\"I'll thank you,\" said he, \"to shut that window.\"\n\n\"It is shut,\" said Doyne.\n\n\"It's just uncanny,\" said McCurdie, looking from one to the other.\n\n\"What?\" asked Doyne.\n\n\"Nothing, if you didn't feel it.\"\n\n\"There did seem to be a sudden draught,\" said Professor Biggleswade.\n\"But as both window and door are shut, it could only be imaginary.\"\n\n\"It wasn't imaginary,\" muttered McCurdie.\n\nThen he laughed harshly. \"My father and mother came from Cromarty,\" he\nsaid with apparent irrelevance.\n\n\"That's the Highlands,\" said the Professor.\n\n\"Ay,\" said McCurdie.\n\nLord Doyne said nothing, but tugged at his moustache and looked out of\nthe window as the frozen meadows and bits of river and willows raced\npast. A dead silence fell on them. McCurdie broke it with another laugh\nand took a whiskey flask from his hand-bag.\n\n\"Have a nip?\"\n\n\"Thanks, no,\" said the Professor. \"I have to keep to a strict dietary,\nand I only drink hot milk and water--and of that sparingly. I have some\nin a thermos bottle.\"\n\nLord Doyne also declining the whiskey, McCurdie swallowed a dram and\ndeclared himself to be better. The Professor took from his bag a foreign\nreview in which a German sciolist had dared to question his\ninterpretation of a Hittite inscription. Over the man's ineptitude he\nfell asleep and snored loudly.\n\nTo escape from his immediate neighbourhood McCurdie went to the other\nend of the seat and faced Lord Doyne, who had resumed his gold glasses\nand his listless contemplation of obscure actresses. McCurdie lit a\npipe, Doyne another black cigar. The train thundered on.\n\nPresently they all lunched together in the restaurant car. The windows\nsteamed, but here and there through a wiped patch of pane a white world\nwas revealed. The snow was falling. As they passed through Westbury,\nMcCurdie looked mechanically for the famous white horse carved into the\nchalk of the down; but it was not visible beneath the thick covering of\nsnow.\n\n\"It'll be just like this all the way to Gehenna--Trehenna, I mean,\" said\nMcCurdie.\n\nDoyne nodded. He had done his life's work amid all extreme fiercenesses\nof heat and cold, in burning droughts, in simoons and in icy\nwildernesses, and a ray or two more of the pale sun or a flake or two\nmore of the gentle snow of England mattered to him but little. But\nBiggleswade rubbed the pane with his table-napkin and gazed\napprehensively at the prospect.\n\n\"If only this wretched train would stop,\" said he, \"I would go back\nagain.\"\n\nAnd he thought how comfortable it would be to sneak home again to his\nbooks and thus elude not only the Deverills, but the Christmas jollities\nof his sisters' families, who would think him miles away. But the train\nwas timed not to stop till Plymouth, two hundred and thirty-five miles\nfrom London, and thither was he being relentlessly carried. Then he\nquarrelled with his food, which brought a certain consolation.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe train did stop, however, before Plymouth--indeed, before Exeter. An\naccident on the line had dislocated the traffic. The express was held up\nfor an hour, and when it was permitted to proceed, instead of thundering\non, it went cautiously, subject to continual stoppings. It arrived at\nPlymouth two hours late. The travellers learned that they had missed the\nconnection on which they had counted and that they could not reach\nTrehenna till nearly ten o'clock. After weary waiting at Plymouth they\ntook their seats in the little, cold local train that was to carry them\nanother stage on their journey. Hot-water cans put in at Plymouth\nmitigated to some extent the iciness of the compartment. But that only\nlasted a comparatively short time, for soon they were set down at a\ndesolate, shelterless wayside junction, dumped in the midst of a hilly\nsnow-covered waste, where they went through another weary wait for\nanother dismal local train that was to carry them to Trehenna. And in\nthis train there were no hot-water cans, so that the compartment was as\ncold as death. McCurdie fretted and shook his fist in the direction of\nTrehenna.\n\n\"And when we get there we have still a twenty miles' motor drive to\nFoullis Castle. It's a fool name and we're fools to be going there.\"\n\n\"I shall die of bronchitis,\" wailed Professor Biggleswade.\n\n\"A man dies when it is appointed for him to die,\" said Lord Doyne, in\nhis tired way; and he went on smoking long black cigars.\n\n\"It's not the dying that worries me,\" said McCurdie. \"That's a mere\nmechanical process which every organic being from a king to a\ncauliflower has to pass through. It's the being forced against my will\nand my reason to come on this accursed journey, which something tells me\nwill become more and more accursed as we go on, that is driving me to\ndistraction.\"\n\n\"What will be, will be,\" said Doyne.\n\n\"I can't see where the comfort of that reflection comes in,\" said\nBiggleswade.\n\n\"And yet you've travelled in the East,\" said Doyne. \"I suppose you know\nthe Valley of the Tigris as well as any man living.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the Professor. \"I can say I dug my way from Tekrit to Bagdad\nand left not a stone unexamined.\"\n\n\"Perhaps, after all,\" Doyne remarked, \"that's not quite the way to know\nthe East.\"\n\n\"I never wanted to know the modern East,\" returned the Professor. \"What\nis there in it of interest compared with the mighty civilizations that\nhave gone before?\"\n\nMcCurdie took a pull from his flask.\n\n\"I'm glad I thought of having a refill at Plymouth,\" said he.\n\nAt last, after many stops at little lonely stations they arrived at\nTrehenna. The guard opened the door and they stepped out on to the\nsnow-covered platform. An oil lamp hung from the tiny pent-house roof\nthat, structurally, was Trehenna Station. They looked around at the\nsilent gloom of white undulating moorland, and it seemed a place where\nno man lived and only ghosts could have a bleak and unsheltered being. A\nporter came up and helped the guard with the luggage. Then they realized\nthat the station was built on a small embankment, for, looking over the\nrailing, they saw below the two great lamps of a motor car. A fur-clad\nchauffeur met them at the bottom of the stairs. He clapped his hands\ntogether and informed them cheerily that he had been waiting for four\nhours. It was the bitterest winter in these parts within the memory of\nman, said he, and he himself had not seen snow there for five years.\nThen he settled the three travellers in the great roomy touring car\ncovered with a Cape-cart hood, wrapped them up in many rugs and started.\n\nAfter a few moments, the huddling together of their bodies--for, the\nProfessor being a spare man, there was room for them all on the back\nseat--the pile of rugs, the serviceable and all but air-tight hood,\ninduced a pleasant warmth and a pleasant drowsiness. Where they were\nbeing driven they knew not. The perfectly upholstered seat eased their\nlimbs, the easy swinging motion of the car soothed their spirits. They\nfelt that already they had reached the luxuriously appointed home which,\nafter all, they knew awaited them. McCurdie no longer railed, Professor\nBiggleswade forgot the dangers of bronchitis, and Lord Doyne twisted the\nstump of a black cigar between his lips without any desire to relight\nit. A tiny electric lamp inside the hood made the darkness of the world\nto right and left and in front of the talc windows still darker.\nMcCurdie and Biggleswade fell into a doze. Lord Doyne chewed the end of\nhis cigar. The car sped on through an unseen wilderness.\n\nSuddenly there was a horrid jolt and a lurch and a leap and a rebound,\nand then the car stood still, quivering like a ship that has been struck\nby a heavy sea. The three men were pitched and tossed and thrown\nsprawling over one another onto the bottom of the car. Biggleswade\nscreamed. McCurdie cursed. Doyne scrambled from the confusion of rugs\nand limbs and, tearing open the side of the Cape-cart hood, jumped out.\nThe chauffeur had also just leaped from his seat. It was pitch dark save\nfor the great shaft of light down the snowy road cast by the acetylene\nlamps. The snow had ceased falling.\n\n\"What's gone wrong?\"\n\n\"It sounds like the axle,\" said the chauffeur ruefully.\n\nHe unshipped a lamp and examined the car, which had wedged itself\nagainst a great drift of snow on the off side. Meanwhile McCurdie and\nBiggleswade had alighted.\n\n\"Yes, it's the axle,\" said the chauffeur.\n\n\"Then we're done,\" remarked Doyne.\n\n\"I'm afraid so, my lord.\"\n\n\"What's the matter? Can't we get on?\" asked Biggleswade in his querulous\nvoice.\n\nMcCurdie laughed. \"How can we get on with a broken axle? The thing's as\nuseless as a man with a broken back. Gad, I was right. I said it was\ngoing to be an infernal journey.\"\n\nThe little Professor wrung his hands. \"But what's to be done?\" he cried.\n\n\"Tramp it,\" said Lord Doyne, lighting a fresh cigar.\n\n\"It's ten miles,\" said the chauffeur.\n\n\"It would be the death of me,\" the Professor wailed.\n\n\"I utterly refuse to walk ten miles through a Polar waste with a gouty\nfoot,\" McCurdie declared wrathfully.\n\nThe chauffeur offered a solution of the difficulty. He would set out\nalone for Foullis Castle--five miles farther on was an inn where he\ncould obtain a horse and trap--and would return for the three gentlemen\nwith another car. In the meanwhile they could take shelter in a little\nhouse which they had just passed, some half mile up the road. This was\nagreed to. The chauffeur went on cheerily enough with a lamp, and the\nthree travellers with another lamp started off in the opposite\ndirection. As far as they could see they were in a long, desolate\nvalley, a sort of No Man's Land, deathly silent. The eastern sky had\ncleared somewhat, and they faced a loose rack through which one pale\nstar was dimly visible.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I'm a man of science,\" said McCurdie as they trudged through the snow,\n\"and I dismiss the supernatural as contrary to reason; but I have\nHighland blood in my veins that plays me exasperating tricks. My reason\ntells me that this place is only a commonplace moor, yet it seems like a\nValley of Bones haunted by malignant spirits who have lured us here to\nour destruction. There's something guiding us now. It's just uncanny.\"\n\n\"Why on earth did we ever come?\" croaked Biggleswade.\n\nLord Doyne answered: \"The Koran says, 'Nothing can befall us but what\nGod hath destined for us.' So why worry?\"\n\n\"Because I'm not a Mohammedan,\" retorted Biggleswade.\n\n\"You might be worse,\" said Doyne.\n\nPresently the dim outline of the little house grew perceptible. A faint\nlight shone from the window. It stood unfenced by any kind of hedge or\nrailing a few feet away from the road in a little hollow beneath some\nrising ground. As far as they could discern in the darkness when they\ndrew near, the house was a mean, dilapidated hovel. A guttering candle\nstood on the inner sill of the small window and afforded a vague view\ninto a mean interior. Doyne held up the lamp so that its rays fell full\non the door. As he did so, an exclamation broke from his lips and he\nhurried forward, followed by the others. A man's body lay huddled\ntogether on the snow by the threshold. He was dressed like a peasant, in\nold corduroy trousers and rough coat, and a handkerchief was knotted\nround his neck. In his hand he grasped the neck of a broken bottle.\nDoyne set the lamp on the ground and the three bent down together over\nthe man. Close by the neck lay the rest of the broken bottle, whose\ncontents had evidently run out into the snow.\n\n\"Drunk?\" asked Biggleswade.\n\nDoyne felt the man and laid his hand on his heart.\n\n\"No,\" said he, \"dead.\"\n\nMcCurdie leaped to his full height. \"I told you the place was uncanny!\"\nhe cried. \"It's fey.\" Then he hammered wildly at the door.\n\nThere was no response. He hammered again till it rattled. This time a\nfaint prolonged sound like the wailing of a strange sea-creature was\nheard from within the house. McCurdie turned round, his teeth\nchattering.\n\n\"Did ye hear that, Doyne?\"\n\n\n[Illustration: I TOLD YOU THE PLACE WAS UNCANNY.]\n\n\n\"Perhaps it's a dog,\" said the Professor.\n\nLord Doyne, the man of action, pushed them aside and tried the\ndoor-handle. It yielded, the door stood open, and the gust of cold wind\nentering the house extinguished the candle within. They entered and\nfound themselves in a miserable stone-paved kitchen, furnished with\npoverty-stricken meagreness--a wooden chair or two, a dirty table, some\nbroken crockery, old cooking utensils, a fly-blown missionary society\nalmanac, and a fireless grate. Doyne set the lamp on the table.\n\n\"We must bring him in,\" said he.\n\nThey returned to the threshold, and as they were bending over to grip\nthe dead man the same sound filled the air, but this time louder, more\nintense, a cry of great agony. The sweat dripped from McCurdie's\nforehead. They lifted the dead man and brought him into the room, and\nafter laying him on a dirty strip of carpet they did their best to\nstraighten the stiff limbs. Biggleswade put on the table a bundle which\nhe had picked up outside. It contained some poor provisions--a loaf, a\npiece of fat bacon, and a paper of tea. As far as they could guess (and\nas they learned later they guessed rightly) the man was the master of\nthe house, who, coming home blind drunk from some distant inn, had\nfallen at his own threshold and got frozen to death. As they could not\nunclasp his fingers from the broken bottleneck they had to let him\nclutch it as a dead warrior clutches the hilt of his broken sword.\n\nThen suddenly the whole place was rent with another and yet another\nlong, soul-piercing moan of anguish.\n\n\"There's a second room,\" said Doyne, pointing to a door. \"The sound\ncomes from there.\" He opened the door, peeped in, and then, returning\nfor the lamp, disappeared, leaving McCurdie and Biggleswade in the pitch\ndarkness, with the dead man on the floor.\n\n\"For heaven's sake, give me a drop of whiskey,\" said the Professor, \"or\nI shall faint.\"\n\nPresently the door opened and Lord Doyne appeared in the shaft of light.\nHe beckoned to his companions.\n\n\"It is a woman in childbirth,\" he said in his even, tired voice. \"We\nmust aid her. She appears unconscious. Does either of you know anything\nabout such things?\"\n\nThey shook their heads, and the three looked at each other in dismay.\nMasters of knowledge that had won them world-wide fame and honour, they\nstood helpless, abashed before this, the commonest phenomenon of nature.\n\n\"My wife had no child,\" said McCurdie.\n\n\"I've avoided women all my life,\" said Biggleswade.\n\n\"And I've been too busy to think of them. God forgive me,\" said Doyne.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe history of the next two hours was one that none of the three men\never cared to touch upon. They did things blindly, instinctively, as men\ndo when they come face to face with the elemental. A fire was made, they\nknew not how, water drawn they knew not whence, and a kettle boiled.\nDoyne accustomed to command, directed. The others obeyed. At his\nsuggestion they hastened to the wreck of the car and came staggering\nback beneath rugs and travelling bags which could supply clean linen and\nneedful things, for amid the poverty of the house they could find\nnothing fit for human touch or use. Early they saw that the woman's\nstrength was failing, and that she could not live. And there, in that\nnameless hovel, with death on the hearthstone and death and life\nhovering over the pitiful bed, the three great men went through the pain\nand the horror and squalor of birth, and they knew that they had never\nyet stood before so great a mystery.\n\nWith the first wail of the newly born infant a last convulsive shudder\npassed through the frame of the unconscious mother. Then three or four\nshort gasps for breath, and the spirit passed away. She was dead.\nProfessor Biggleswade threw a corner of the sheet over her face, for he\ncould not bear to see it.\n\nThey washed and dried the child as any crone of a midwife would have\ndone, and dipped a small sponge which had always remained unused in a\ncut-glass bottle in Doyne's dressing-bag in the hot milk and water of\nBiggleswade's thermos bottle, and put it to his lips; and then they\nwrapped him up warm in some of their own woollen undergarments, and took\nhim into the kitchen and placed him on a bed made of their fur coats in\nfront of the fire. As the last piece of fuel was exhausted they took one\nof the wooden chairs and broke it up and cast it into the blaze. And\nthen they raised the dead man from the strip of carpet and carried him\ninto the bedroom and laid him reverently by the side of his dead wife,\nafter which they left the dead in darkness and returned to the living.\nAnd the three grave men stood over the wisp of flesh that had been born\na male into the world. Then, their task being accomplished, reaction\ncame, and even Doyne, who had seen death in many lands, turned faint.\nBut the others, losing control of their nerves, shook like men stricken\nwith palsy.\n\nSuddenly McCurdie cried in a high pitched voice, \"My God! Don't you feel\nit?\" and clutched Doyne by the arm. An expression of terror appeared on\nhis iron features.\n\n\"There! It's here with us.\"\n\nLittle Professor Biggleswade sat on a corner of the table and wiped his\nforehead.\n\n\"I heard it. I felt it. It was like the beating of wings.\"\n\n\"It's the fourth time,\" said McCurdie. \"The first time was just before I\naccepted the Deverills' invitation. The second in the railway carriage\nthis afternoon. The third on the way here. This is the fourth.\"\n\nBiggleswade plucked nervously at the fringe of whisker under his jaws\nand said faintly, \"It's the fourth time up to now. I thought it was\nfancy.\"\n\n\"I have felt it, too,\" said Doyne. \"It is the Angel of Death.\" And he\npointed to the room where the dead man and woman lay.\n\n\"For God's sake let us get away from this,\" cried Biggleswade.\n\n\"And leave the child to die, like the others?\" said Doyne.\n\n\"We must see it through,\" said McCurdie.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA silence fell upon them as they sat round in the blaze with the\nnew-born babe wrapped in its odd swaddling clothes asleep on the pile of\nfur coats, and it lasted until Sir Angus McCurdie looked at his watch.\n\n\"Good Lord,\" said he, \"it's twelve o'clock.\"\n\n\"Christmas morning,\" said Biggleswade.\n\n\"A strange Christmas,\" mused Doyne.\n\nMcCurdie put up his hand. \"There it is again! The beating of wings.\" And\nthey listened like men spellbound. McCurdie kept his hand uplifted, and\ngazed over their heads at the wall, and his gaze was that of a man in a\ntrance, and he spoke:\n\n\"Unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given--\"\n\nDoyne sprang from his chair, which fell behind him with a crash.\n\n\"Man--what the devil are you saying?\"\n\nThen McCurdie rose and met Biggleswade's eyes staring at him through the\ngreat round spectacles, and Biggleswade turned and met the eyes of\nDoyne. A pulsation like the beating of wings stirred the air.\n\nThe three wise men shivered with a queer exaltation. Something strange,\nmystical, dynamic had happened. It was as if scales had fallen from\ntheir eyes and they saw with a new vision.

He was hun-gry and wea-ry, and\nhad a great sor-row at his heart, for he had lost his fa-ther in the\near-ly spring, leav-ing his mo-ther to toil for a scant live-li-hood to\nsup-port her-self and him.\n\nHe threw the wood up-on the cin-ders on the hearth, and quick-ly rais-ed\na cheer-ful blaze, at which he warm-ed his na-ked, swol-len feet, as he\nwatch-ed the smoke ma-king its fan-tas-tic ed-dies up the wide chim-ney,\nand a-midst the raf-ters of the low roof. He heav-ed a deep sigh; for he\nsaw no pot up-on the fire, which ought to have been bub-bling up with\ntheir fru-gal din-ner: but, a-las! they had none.\n\n\"This must not be any long-er,\" thought he, \"for I am get-ting ve-ry big\nand strong, and have a pair of hands that ought not to be i-dle. As my\npoor mo-ther gets weak-er, I should work for her; and as I grow in-to a\nman, she should not work any more, but sit by the fire and get the\ndin-ner rea-dy, which I shall then be a-ble to la-bour for.\"\n\n[Illustration: MEETING THE HANDS.]\n\nWil-lie was of an in-dus-tri-ous mind, and did not love to sit i-dle\nwhen e-ven his ti-ny strength might be used to some end.\n\nSo he sat and lis-ten-ed for the foot-step of his poor mo-ther, who, he\nknew, would come home, wea-ri-ed with la-bour, to share her scan-ty\ncrust with her boy.\n\nHe had not to wait long be-fore the latch lift-ed, and his mo-ther\nen-ter-ed. She kiss-ed him, and threw her-self in-to a chair, with the\ntears of fa-tigue and ex-haus-tion in her eyes.\n\nHe em-bra-ced her, and whis-per-ed in-to her ear his firm resolve to\nstart out in-to the world, and seek for la-bour, that he might no\nlong-er be a bur-then to her. Her heart sank at the i-dea; but she saw\nno o-ther means to save them from star-va-tion, as her fail-ing strength\ngave warn-ing of the in-e-vi-ta-ble e-vil.\n\nThe morn-ing a-rose bright and cheer-ful. The old lock-er was o-pen-ed,\nand his on-ly shoes, trea-sur-ed for high-days and ho-li-days, were\nta-ken out and brush-ed up, as was al-so his best suit, which was\nin-deed ve-ry lit-tle bet-ter than the care-ful-ly mend-ed suit of his\ne-ve-ry-day wear. He, how-e-ver, thought him-self ve-ry fine, and felt\nthat his ap-pear-ance would act as a re-com-men-da-tion in his fa-vour.\n\nThey sat down to break-fast: it was a ve-ry tear-ful one, and, with a\nstrange feel-ing, they a-void-ed each o-ther's looks, hop-ing to hide\ntheir tears one from the o-ther.\n\nOh! it want-ed a great re-so-lu-tion for poor Wil-lie to say, \"Well!\ndear mo-ther, I must be start-ing;\" but he did do it at last, al-though\nit was af-ter ma-ny strug-gles to keep down the beat-ings of his heart.\n\n[Illustration: THE FIRST ASSISTANCE.]\n\nHis mo-ther heard him with a be-wil-der-ed look, as if she heard the\npro-po-sal for the first time; and her grief burst forth with\nun-con-trol-la-ble vi-o-lence as she threw her arms round his neck with\nan a-go-ny on-ly known to a fond mo-ther.\n\nHe tried to com-fort her, and to smile through his tears, as he put on\nhis hat with a re-so-lute thump, seiz-ed up-on his stick and wal-let,\nand lift-ed the latch of the door that was to o-pen for his bold\nen-trance in-to the world, so full of pro-mise to him.\n\nAgain they lin-ger-ed in their lit-tle gar-den, where e-ve-ry flow-er\nseem-ed an old friend to be part-ed with: a-gain the tears and the\nem-bra-ces. At last the lit-tle gate was swung wide o-pen, and Wil-lie\nstep-ped bold-ly forth. His mo-ther co-ver-ed her face and wept. He\nturn-ed to-wards her with ir-re-so-lu-tion: he felt how dif-fi-cult it\nwas to leave one so dear and af-fec-tion-ate; but his du-ty was sim-ple,\nand he would do it: with one more \"good bye,\" he was gone on his way\nweep-ing.\n\nThe lark rose in the morn-ing sky, and sang her joy-ous song. The sweet,\nbal-my air of ear-ly day cool-ed his throb-bing brow, and his tears\ngra-du-al-ly ceas-ed to flow; but his lit-tle breast heav-ed now and\nthen with sobs as the storm of grief sub-si-ded. His foot-steps grew\nquick-er the far-ther he left his home be-hind; for be-fore him lay the\nland of pro-mise, and his lit-tle brain was full of dreams of suc-cess,\nand the con-se-quent joy that would be at his heart when he re-trod\nthose ve-ry fields on his re-turn, la-den with rich-es to throw in-to\nhis mo-ther's lap.\n\n[Illustration: THE LITTLE TENT.]\n\nAs these thoughts rush-ed through his mind, they gave him much com-fort;\nand he even hummed an air as he trot-ted on, to show his man-li-ness and\ncou-rage.\n\nPre-sen-tly, as he pass-ed through a val-ley which was la-den with the\nsweets of wild flow-ers that bloom-ed on ei-ther side, a cu-ri-ous and\nal-most trans-pa-rent flee-cy cloud ap-pear-ed a-cross his path, from\nwhich a-rose _two e-nor-mous hands_. He start-ed, and well he\nmight, for he saw no-bo-dy be-long-ing to them: no, there they were,\non-ly hands. There was no fear of them, for they were spread o-pen up-on\nthe grass be-fore him with-out the slight-est ex-pres-sion of\nthreat-en-ing in them.\n\nAs he stood ga-zing with won-der up-on them, a voice, which ap-pear-ed\nto pr-oceed from the cloud, said,--\n\n\"Wil-lie, be not a-fraid: I know the praise-wor-thy er-rand that you are\non, and I come to be-friend you. Per-se-vere in your de-sire to be\nin-dus-tri-ous, and. I will be e-ver rea-dy to as-sist you. I shall be\nin-vi-si-ble to all eyes but yours, and will work when the need\nap-pears. Come on, then, and fear not; the road to suc-cess is o-pen to\nyou, as it al-ways is to in-dus-tr-ious re-so-lu-tion.\"\n\n\"Thank you, good hands,\" said Wil-lie; \"I am sure you mean me good, for\nI am too lit-tle for you to wish to harm.\" The arms va-nish-ed, and\nWil-lie pro-ceed-ed on his way.\n\nHe felt so re-as-su-red by this ex-tra-or-di-na-ry ad-ven-ture, which\npro-mi-sed so well for his fu-ture suc-cess, that he leap-ed and dan-ced\na-long his path with ex-cite-ment and de-light: he look-ed for-ward to\nno ob-sta-cle to stop him in his ca-reer, and he pur-su-ed his way\nre-joic-ing.\n\n[Illustration: THE OGRESS'S CASTLE.]\n\nHow-e-ver, as the day grew on, he slack-en-ed his pace, for the\nun-ac-cus-tom-ed fa-tigue be-gan to tell up-on his frame; so at last he\nthrew him-self up-on the grass, and look-ed up-wards to the blue sky,\nand watch-ed the flee-cy clouds pur-sue each o-ther a-cross the\nbound-less ex-panse of the hea-vens. As he lay, half dream-ing, he\nthought he heard some-thing like the roll-ing of thun-der: he lis-ten-ed\nwith great-er at-ten-tion, un-til he was as-sur-ed there was some cause\nin his close vi-ci-ni-ty for the un-u-su-al and cu-ri-ous sounds. He\na-rose, and pro-ceed-ed to-wards the di-rec-tion of the sounds, which\ngrew loud-er and loud-er as he ad-van-ced; when, com-ing to the edge of\na pre-ci-pice, he be-held a grand and aw-ful rush of foam-ing wa-ters,\nwhich threw them-selves head-long down the riv-en rocks with a\ndeaf-en-ing roar and tu-mult.\n\nHe look-ed from right to left, and his way seem-ed bar-red by this\ntre-men-dous ob-sta-cle. His heart fail-ed him as he saw how\nim-pos-si-ble it was for him to pro-ceed: in-deed, as he sat him-self\ndown on the edge of the ca-ta-ract, he could not help weep-ing at his\nun-ex-pect-ed di-lem-ma.\n\nHe had not been ma-ny mi-nutes in-dul-ging in his grief, when he felt\nhim-self gent-ly lift-ed from the ground by a gi-gan-tic hand, which\npass-ed him high a-bove the threat-en-ing wa-ters, and pla-ced him in\nsafe-ty on the op-po-site bank. As the hand put him on his feet, it\nbe-came in-dis-tinct; but be-fore it had quite van-ish-ed, Wil-lie took\noff his hat, and, bow-ing, said,--\"Thank you kind-ly, good hand; you\nhave kept your promise well.\"\n\n[Illustration: THE OGRESS'S CASTLE.]\n\nCer-tain now that the fai-ry hands were not a dream, which he had\nreal-ly be-gun to think them, his cou-rage rose with the con-vic-tion of\nthe pro-tec-tion which sur-round-ed him from their great pow-er and\ngood-will to-wards him.\n\nHe soon came to a dense wood, where the gi-gan-tic trees, with gnarl-ed\nand twist-ed trunks, wound their e-nor-mous limbs a-round each o-ther in\nthe most fan-tas-tic forms, and the tan-gled un-der-wood twi-ned like\nsnakes a-cross the path, as if to for-bid any ven-tu-rous foot from\nen-ter-ing into the dark green depths. He, how-e-ver, look-ed up-on all\nsuch ob-sta-cles as no-thing in com-pa-ri-son with the last which he had\nbeen en-a-bled to sur-mount with the as-sist-ance of the hands. So he\nplun-ged on, strik-ing right and left, to clear his way, with his good\nstick. As he was lay-ing a-bout with a right good will, he was brought\nto a stand-still by a fe-ro-ci-ous growl. He turn-ed his eyes a-round,\nand be-held, much to his dis-may, a fierce wolf pre-par-ing to spring\nup-on him. He shrank down with ter-ror as he look-ed up-on the white\nteeth and fi-e-ry eyes of the sa-vage brute, and gave him-self up for\nlost, when, to his joy, one of the great hands e-mer-ged from a-midst\nthe thick fo-li-age of a tree, and pla-ced it-self be-tween him and his\nen-e-my; at the same time the o-ther hand seiz-ed the wolf, and crush-ed\nit in its grasp.\n\nWil-lie fell on his knees, and re-turn-ed thanks for his de-li-ver-ance;\nthen, look-ing round for the hands, he found they had va-nish-ed.\n\n[Illustration: THE KITCHEN OF THE OGRESS.]\n\nWea-ri-ed with his jour-ney, he sat down un-der a tree, de-ter-min-ed to\nrest for the night; and pull-ing out his wal-let, pre-par-ed to re-fresh\nhim-self with part of its con-tents, for he had scarce-ly eat-en any all\nday, so com-plete-ly had he been ta-ken up by the won-der-ful\nap-pear-ance of the good hands.\n\nAf-ter fi-nish-ing his meal, which he did with ex-ceed-ing rel-ish, he\nbe-gan to turn o-ver in his mind how he was to make up his bed in his\nve-ry large bed-cham-ber, for it ap-pear-ed as if he had got the great\nfo-rest all to him-self. When he had col-lect-ed a suf-fi-ci-en-cy of\ndri-ed leaves to-ge-ther to make his rest-ing place soft-er, he\npre-par-ed to lie down, when, to his as-to-nish-ment and de-light, he\nbe-held the gi-gan-tic hands spread them-selves over him, with the\nfin-gers en-twin-ed, ma-king for him the most per-fect lit-tle tent in\nthe world. How his heart bound-ed with gra-ti-tude to-wards the good\nfai-ry hands, as he felt how safe-ly he might in-dulge in his slum-bers\nbe-neath such pro-tec-tion!\n\n\"Thank you a-gain, good hands,\" said he, \"for your kind care of me; but\nbe-fore I say my pray-ers, can-not you, since you are so pow-er-ful,\ntell me some-thing of my dear mo-ther--whe-ther she is more con-so-led,\nand whe-ther she has food to eat?\"\n\n\"Good Wil-lie,\" re-plied a voice, \"your mo-ther knows that you will be\npro-tect-ed, as all good chil-dren are; and she has food, for she is\nin-dus-tri-ous; her hands were giv-en to her from my king-dom, in which\nno i-dle hands are ever made, as you shall know from me here-af-ter.\nSleep, then, in peace, that you may rise pre-pa-red for la-bour on the\ncom-ing morn.\" So Wil-lie slept.\n\n[Illustration: THE DEATH OF THE OGRESS.]\n\nWil-lie was ear-ly a-foot; for the day, ac-cord-ing to the hands, was to\nbe a day of la-bour, with its fruits. He soon left the wood be-hind him,\nand saw a large cas-tle before him.\n\n\"Here, sure-ly, is some-thing to be done,\" thought he; so he leapt up\nthe steps, and tri-ed to raise the knock-er, but it was too hea-vy for\nhis pu-ny strength. In an in-stant the hands ap-pear-ed, and knock-ed\nsuch a dou-ble knock, that it e-cho-ed like thun-der through the\nval-ley, and you might have heard it rum-bling a-way on the dis-tant\nmoun-tains.\n\nThe door o-pen-ed with a sud-den jerk, and the mis-tress of the man-sion\nap-pear-ed. The mo-ment Wil-lie saw her, he back-ed down the steps, for\nshe was an o-gress, and as ug-ly as o-gress-es ge-ne-ral-ly are. She\ngla-red up-on the lit-tle-man who she sup-po-sed had giv-en that great\nknock, with sur-prise and as-to-nish-ment; and then, in a voice like a\nve-ry hoarse ra-ven, she cri-ed--\n\n\"How dar-ed you to knock like that at my door, you lit-tle var-let? You\nhave put me all in a twit-ter.\"\n\nWil-lie trem-bling-ly took off his hat, and re-pli-ed in an hum-ble\nvoice, \"If you please, prin-cess, I wish-ed to know whe-ther you want-ed\na ser-vant to as-sist in your mag-ni-fi-cent cas-tle.\"\n\n\"A ser-vant, brat!\" said she; \"what can you do?\"\n\n\"Any-thing to please your high-ness, for I want to work.\"\n\n\"Oh, oh! do you? Then, come in, for my ser-vants have all left me\nbe-cause I don't put my work out,\" said she.\n\n[Illustration: THE RESCUE.]\n\nWith that, Wil-lie en-ter-ed, and soon found that he had plen-ty to do;\nfor his first job was to get the o-gress's din-ner ready, who, in truth,\nhad no de-li-cate ap-pe-tite, for the pro-vi-si-on con-sist-ed of fish,\nfowl, beef, soup, mut-ton, and ham-pers of ve-ge-ta-bles.\n\nHe sigh-ed as he look-ed up-on such a-bun-dance, which would have di-ned\nsump-tu-ous-ly his own na-tive vil-lage. A-gain he sigh-ed: as he did\nso, the gi-ant hands ap-pear-ed. If you could on-ly have seen them truss\nthis, skew-er that, boil the o-ther, turn out the sau-ces, pick the\npic-kles, cut the bread, and put the dish-es to the fire, you would have\nbeen as-to-nish-ed, Wil-lie all the time do-ing all he knew to aid in\nthe work.\n\nThe o-gress di-ned, and smi-led up-on her trea-sure of a ser-vant.\n\nSelf-in-dul-gent people are al-ways un-grate-ful; and so the o-gress\npro-ved, for she was con-ti-nu-al-ly de-si-ring more and more at the\nhands of poor Wil-lie, un-til he had no rest: and, one day, when she had\nbeen more im-po-sing than u-su-al, he turn-ed round, and told her that\nshe left him hard-ly time to sleep, and that her ap-pe-tite was\nfright-ful.\n\nCould you have seen her face, you would have been as fright-en-ed as\nWil-lie was.\n\n\"Lit-tle wretch!\" scream-ed she, \"I have half a mind to snap you up as I\nwould the wing of a chick-en: and, re-mem-ber from this mo-ment, if my\ndin-ner is short of what I de-sire, I will eat you to make up for what\nyou have o-mit-ted.\"\n\n\"Then I shall leave you,\" said Wil-lie.\n\n[Illustration: THE REAPING.]\n\nRage made the face of the o-gress glow like a fur-nace, as she made a\npounce at poor Wil-lie for his ill-ad-vis-ed speech; and she would have\ncaught him in her gripe, had he not dod-ged round a large bun-dle of\nve-ge-ta-bles which luck-i-ly lay on the floor. Round and round she went\naf-ter him, un-til he felt that he must be caught; when a ve-ry large\nhand grasp-ed her round the waist, and hur-ri-ed her, yell-ing, out of\nthe kit-chen; Wil-lie fol-low-ing, re-turn-ing thanks for his\nde-li-ver-ance. They came to a large win-dow which o-pen-ed to the sea:\nthe hand thrust the o-gress out, and held her ex-ten-ded over the\nroll-ing waves.\n\n\"Mercy! mercy!\" groan-ed, the o-gress, as she gaz-ed upon the aw-ful\ndepth be-neath her.\n\nThe hand gra-du-al-ly re-lax-ed its hold; and the o-gress, with one\ndes-pair-ing cry, whirl-ed o-ver and o-ver, and fell with such a plump\nin-to the sea, that the spray flew o-ver the high-est tow-er, and the\nfish-es swam a-way in ter-ror. She went down, down, down: but never came\nup, up, up.\n\nWil-lie ran out of the front door; and when he got to the mar-gin of the\nsea, he turn-ed his eye to the waves, ex-pect-ing every mo-ment to see\nthe head of the dread-ful o-gress pop up a-gain; but it did not. He saw\nthe good hands fol-low-ing him: they plun-ged into the sea close at his\nfeet; he jump-ed in-to the palm of one, and seat-ed himself. Be-tween\nthe fin-ger and thumb of each hand was one of his cook-ing forks, stuck\nthrough two of the o-gress's ve-ry best hand-ker-chiefs, which made\nve-ry ad-mi-ra-ble sails, catch-ing the wind, and waft-ing him a-long\no-ver the sea as well as the fi-nest ship e-ver built.\n\n[Illustration: THE PLOUGHING.]\n\nAs the moon rose, it found him safe-ly land-ed and snug under the roof\nof a good farm-er who had pro-mi-sed him work--ay, e-ven as much as he\ncould do: but the farm-er did not know the trea-sure he pos-sess-ed, for\nthe next morn-ing lit-tle Wil-lie was work-ing in his shirt-sleeves in\nthe corn-field reap-ing and shear-ing as much as two men, and stout ones\ntoo, could do in a long day. But there, un-der the shel-ter of the high\ncorn, were the friend-ly hands work-ing mi-ra-cles; ga-ther-ing up the\ncorn, and put-ting it in-to sheaves in a man-ner that could not be\ne-qual-led by mor-tal hands.\n\nWil-lie whistl-ed, and cut a-way, not-with-stand-ing the burn-ing heat\nof the sun: his sic-kle glis-ten-ed, and the corn fell in such long\nsweeps that I do be-lieve it was as ma-gi-cal as the hands them-selves.\n\nThe long-est day will, how-e-ver, have an end: but when Wil-lie's first\nday wa-ned, the farm-er was struck with as-to-nish-ment at be-hold-ing\nthe gold-en rows of hea-vy corn, stand-ing for his ad-mi-ra-tion in the\nwell ti-ed sheaves. He look-ed from the lit-tle man to the fruits of his\nla-bour, and pro-mi-sed to him-self to do his best to se-cure so\nva-lu-a-ble a ser-vant.\n\n\"Oh, oh!\" said the farm-er, \"if he can reap so well, per-haps he can\nplough:\" so ac-cord-ing-ly the next morn-ing found lit-tle Wil-lie as a\nplough-man. But how could he know how to do it? any one would say. Why,\nthe hands guid-ed the plough; and the lands were plough-ed in fur-rows\nas straight as the flight of an ar-row sped by the strong-est arm.\n\n[Illustration: THE BRIDGE.]\n\nThe farm-er watch-ed from his win-dow, but the hands were in-vi-si-ble\nto his eyes: he saw the plough cut its way un-err-ing-ly in-to the\nbo-som of the earth, in a man-ner that sur-pri-sed e-ven his\nex-pe-ri-ence, and he a-gain bless-ed his good for-tune that had giv-en\nhim such a won-der-ful lit-tle la-bour-er.\n\nWil-lie sat at the board of the good farm-er, who thought he could not\nmake too much of him, for he was grate-ful to the in-dus-tri-ous youth,\nwho seem-ed to take plea-sure in work-ing for the in-ter-est of his\nmas-ter. Time roll-ed on, and Wil-lie be-came quite head man, for it was\nfound that he could be en-trust-ed with any-thing. One day, when he was\nout on the moun-tains, where he had gone to ga-ther the flocks for the\nshear-ing, heavy storms came on, and the floods de-lu-ged the val-ley,\nsweep-ing the flocks and the herds a-way in their head-long course.\nWil-lie wise-ly kept his charge upon the moun-tain's side un-til the\nwa-ters had in some de-gree sub-si-ded; but he was a-larm-ed when he\nde-scend-ed in-to the val-leys to find that, in ma-ny pla-ces, the\nwa-ter was im-pass-a-ble to his charge. As he stood in deep thought, the\ngi-ant hands spread them-selves over the tur-bid wa-ters, form-ing the\nmost per-fect bridge im-a-gin-a-ble. He drove the sheep a-cross with-out\nfear, and reach-ed his mas-ter's house in safe-ty, much to the joy of\nall, who had giv-en him up for lost.\n\n[Illustration: THE ESCAPE FROM THE FIRE.]\n\nAs Wil-lie lay down that night, full of gra-ti-tude for his great good\nfor-tune, and think-ing of his home, to which he knew he should so soon\nre-turn to take hap-pi-ness to his fond mo-ther, he was sud-den-ly\na-rous-ed by screams of ter-ror and cries of a-larm. He jump-ed from his\nbed, and put-ting on his clothes, rush-ed in-to the farm-yard, where, to\nhis hor-ror, he be-held his good mas-ter wring-ing his hands, and\na-ban-don-ed to grief; for the flames were fast de-vour-ing his\npeace-ful house, and, worse than all, they had reach-ed the cham-ber of\nhis fa-vour-ite daugh-ter, whom he had in vain at-tempt-ed to res-cue,\nfor no lad-der could reach her win-dow, and the stair-case had long been\nburnt. Wil-lie look-ed on in des-pair, for he could de-vise no means to\nsave the poor child; when sud-den-ly the gi-ant hands ap-pear-ed, and\nplac-ing them-selves a-gainst the side of the house, form-ed a lad-der,\nup which Wil-lie sprang with-out the least he-si-ta-tion. In a few\nmo-ments he gain-ed the suf-fo-cat-ing cham-ber of the girl, and\nfold-ing her in his arms, rush-ed down the friend-ly hands, and pla-ced\nher, unharm-ed, in the em-brace of her des-pair-ing fa-ther.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA hea-vi-ly la-den wag-gon creaks along the wind-ing road, co-ver-ed\nwith a tilt as white as snow; but what has it in-side? You can peep and\nsee: beau-ti-ful ta-bles and chairs, and sides of ba-con, and geese and\nchick-ens, and fair round chees-es, and rolls of gold-en but-ter, with\nwhite eggs peep-ing through the bars of their wick-er pris-on. Where is\nthe wag-gon go-ing? To mar-ket, per-haps: ask the youth who is trudg-ing\nby its side, with a smil-ing, hap-py face, rud-dy with health and the\nwarm tinge of the sun.\n\n[Illustration: THE TRIUMPHANT RETURN.]\n\nWhy, I de-clare that it is Wil-lie, grown quite stout and strong!

The\nadjective \"bromidic\" is at present adopted as a general vehicle, a\ncommon carrier for the thoughtless damnation of the Philistine. The time\nhas come to formulate, authoritatively, the precise scope of intellect\nwhich such distinctions suggest and to define the shorthand of\nconversation which their use has made practicable. The rapid spread of\nthe theory, traveling from Sulphite to Sulphite, like the spark of a\npyrotechnic set-piece, till the thinking world has been over-violently\nilluminated, has obscured its genesis and diverted attention from the\nsimplicity and force of its fundamental principles.[1] In this, its\nprogress has been like that of slang, which, gaining in popularity, must\ninevitably decrease in aptness and definiteness.\n\n[Footnote 1: It was in April that I first heard of the Theory from the\nChatelaine. The following August, in Venice, a lady said to me: \"Aren't\nthese old palaces a great deal more sulphitic in their decay than they\nwere originally, during the Renaissance?\"]\n\nIn attempting to solve the problem which for so long was the despair of\nphilosophers I have made modest use of the word \"theory.\" But to the\nSulphite, this simple, convincing, comprehensive explanation is more;\nit is an opinion, even a belief, if not a _credo_. It is the\n_crux_ by which society is tested. But as I shall proceed\nscientifically, my conclusion will, I trust, effect rational proof of\nwhat was an _a priori_ hypothesis.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe history of the origin of the theory is brief. The Chatelaine of a\ncertain sugar plantation in Louisiana, in preparing a list of guests\nfor her house-party, discovered, in one of those explosive moments of\ninspiration, that all people were easily divided into two fundamental\ngroups or families, the Sulphites and the Bromides. The revelation was\napodictic, convincing; it made life a different thing; it made society\nalmost plausible. So, too, it simplified human relationship and gave\nthe first hint of a method by which to adjust and equalize affinities.\nThe primary theorems sprang quickly into her mind, and, such is their\npower, they have attained almost the nature of axioms. The discovery,\nindeed, was greater, more far-reaching than she knew, for, having\nundergone the test of philosophical analysis as well as of practical\napplication, it stands, now, a vital, convincing interpretation of the\nmysteries of human nature.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe have all tried our hands at categories. Philosophy is, itself, but a\nsystem of definitions. What, then, made the Chatelaine's theory\nremarkable, when Civilization has wearied itself with distinctions? The\nattempt to classify one's acquaintance is the common sport of the\nthinker, from the fastidious who says: \"There are two kinds of\npersons--those who like olives and those who don't,\" to the fatuous,\nimmemorial lover who says: \"There are two kinds of women--Daisy, and\nthe Other Kind!\"\n\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPrevious attempts, less fantastic, have had this fault in common: their\ncategories were susceptible of gradation--extremes fused one into the\nother. What thinking person has not felt the need of some definite,\nfinal, absolute classification? We speak of \"my kind\" and \"the other\nsort,\" of Those who Understand, of Impossibles, and Outsiders. Some of\nthese categories have attained considerable vogue. There is the\nBohemian versus the Philistine, the Radical versus the Conservative,\nthe Interesting versus the Bores, and so on. But always there is a\nshifting population at the vague frontier--the types intermingle and\nlose identity. Your Philistine is the very one who says: \"This is\nLiberty Hall!\"--and one must drink beer whether one likes it or not. It\nis the conservative business man, hard-headed, stubborn, who is\nconverted by the mind-reader or the spiritualistic medium--one extreme\nflying to the other. It is the bore who, at times, unconsciously to\nhimself, amuses you to the point of repressed laughter. These terms are\nfluent--your friends have a way of escaping from the labeled boxes into\nwhich you have put them; they seem to defy your definitions, your\nOrders and Genera. Fifteen minutes' consideration of the great\nSulphitic Theory will, as the patent medicines say, convince one of its\nefficacy. A Bromide will never jump out of his box into that ticketed\n\"Sulphite.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSo much comment has been made upon the terminology of this theory that\nit should be stated frankly, at the start, that the words Sulphite and\nBromide, and their derivatives, sulphitic and bromidic, are themselves\nso sulphitic that they are not susceptible of explanation. In a word,\nthey are empirical, although, accidentally it might seem, they do\nappeal and convince the most skeptical. I myself balked, at first, at\nthese inconsequent names. I would have suggested the terms \"Gothic\" and\n\"Classic\" to describe the fundamental types of mind. But it took but a\nshort conversation with the Chatelaine to demonstrate the fact that the\nwords were inevitable, and the rapid increase in their use has proved\nthem something more real than slang--an acceptable and accepted\nterminology. Swallow them whole, therefore, and you will be so much\nbetter for the dose that, upon finishing this thesis you will say,\n\"Why, _of course_ there are no other words possible!\"\n\nLet us, therefore, first proceed with a general statement of the theory\nand then develop some of its corollaries. It is comparatively easy to\ndefine the Bromide; let us consider his traits and then classify the\nSulphite by a mere process of exclusion.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn this our world the Bromides constitute, alas! by far the larger\ngroup. In this, the type resembles the primary bodies or other systems\nof classification, such as the Philistines, the Conservatives, the\nBores and so on, _ad nauseam_. The Bromide does his thinking by\nsyndicate. He follows the main traveled roads, he goes with the crowd.\nIn a word, they all think and talk alike--one may predicate their\nopinion upon any given subject. They follow custom and costume, they\nobey the Law of Averages. They are, intellectually, all peas in the\nsame conventional pod, unenlightened, prosaic, living by rule and rote.\nThey have their hair cut every month and their minds keep regular\noffice hours. Their habits of thought are all ready-made, proper,\nsober, befitting the Average Man. They worship dogma. The Bromide\nconforms to everything sanctioned by the majority, and may be depended\nupon to be trite, banal and arbitrary.\n\nSo much has a mere name already done for us that we may say, boldly,\nand this is our First Theorem: that all Bromides are bromidic in every\nmanifestation of their being. But a better comprehension of the term,\nand one which will perhaps remove the taint of malediction, will be\nattained if we examine in detail a few essential bromidic tendencies.\nThe adjective is used more in pity than in anger or disgust. The\nBromide can't possibly help being bromidic--though, on the other hand,\nhe wouldn't if he could.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe chief characteristic, then, seems to be a certain reflex\npsychological action of the bromidic brain. This is evidenced by the\naccepted bromidic belief that each of the ordinary acts of life is, and\nnecessarily must be, accompanied by its own especial remark or opinion.\nIt is an association of ideas intensified in each generation by the\ncontinual correlation of certain groups of brain cells. It has become\nnot only unnecessary for him to think, but almost impossible, so deeply\nthese well-worn paths of thought have become. His intellectual\nprocesses are automatic--his train of thought can never get off the\ntrack.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA single illustration will suffice for analysis. You have heard it\noften enough; fie upon you if you have said it!\n\n\"_If you saw that sunset painted in a picture, you'd never believe it\nwould be possible!_\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt must be borne distinctly in mind that _it is not merely because\nthis remark is trite that it is bromidic_; it is because that, with\nthe Bromide, the remark is _inevitable_. One expects it from him,\nand one is never disappointed. And, moreover, it is always offered by\nthe Bromide as a fresh, new, apt and rather clever thing to say. He\nreally believes, no doubt, that it is original--it is, at any rate,\nneat, as he indicates by his evident expectation of applause. The\nremark follows upon the physical or mental stimulus as the night the\nday; he cannot, then, be true to any other impulse. Originality was\ninhibited in him since his great-grandmother's time. He has \"got the\nhabit.\"\n\nAccepting his irresponsibility, and with all charity to his undeveloped\npersonality, we may note a few other examples of his mental reflexes.\nThe list is long, but it would take a large encyclopaedia to exhaust\nthe subject. The pastime, recently come into vogue, of collecting\nBromidioms,[1] is a pursuit by itself, worthy enough of practice if one\nappreciates the subtleties of the game and does not merely collate\nhackneyed phrases, irrespective of their true bromidic quality. For our\npurpose in elucidating the thesis in hand, however, we need cull but a\nfew specimens, leaving the list to be completed by the reader at his\nleisure.\n\n[Footnote 1: For this apt and cleverly coined word I am indebted to Mr.\nFrank O'Malley of the New York \"Sun,\" who has been one of the most\nardent and discriminating collectors of Bromidioms.]\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n If you both happen to know Mr. Smith of Des Moines, the Bromide\ninevitably will say:\n\n\"_This world is such a small place, after all, isn't it_?\"\n\nThe Bromide never mentions such a vulgar thing as a birth, but\n\n\"_The Year Baby Came_.\"\n\nThe Bromide's euphemisms are the slang of her caste. When she departs\nfrom her visit, she says:\n\n_\"I've had a perfectly charming time.\"_\n\n_\"It's SO good of you to have asked me_!\"\n\n\"_Now, DO come and see us_!\"\n\nAnd when her caller leaves, her mind springs with a snap to fasten the\ntime-worn farewell:\n\n\"_Now you have found the way, do come often_!\"\n\nAnd this piece of ancient cynicism has run through a thousand changes:\n\n\"_Of course if you leave your umbrella at home it's sure to\nrain!_\"\n\nBut comment, to the Sulphite, is unnecessary. These remarks would all\nbe in his Index Epurgatorius, if one were necessary. Except in jest it\nwould never even occur to him to use any of the following remarks:\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI.\n\n\"_I don't know much about Art, but I know what I like._\"\n\nII.\n\n\"_My mother is seventy years old, but she doesn't look a day over\nfifty._\"\n\nIII.\n\n\"_That dog understands every word I say._\"\n\nIV.\n\n\"_You'll feel differently about these things when you're\nmarried!_\"\n\nV.\n\n\"_It isn't money, it's the PRINCIPLE of the thing I object to._\"\n\nVI.\n\n\"_Why aren't there any good stories in the magazines, nowadays?_\"\n\nVII.\n\n\"_I'm afraid I'm not educated up to Japanese prints._\"\n\nVIII.\n\n\"_The Japanese are such an interesting little people!_\"\n\nIX.\n\n\"_No, I don't play chess.

They have found, for instance, that\ngreen is restful to the eyes, and the fact goes without saying, in a\nhint, in a mere word. They are aware that heat is more disagreeable\nwhen accompanied by a high degree of humidity, and do not put forth\nthis axiom as a sensational discovery. They have noticed the\ncoincidences known as mental telepathy usual in correspondence, and\nhave long ceased to be more than mildly amused at the occurrence of the\nphenomenon. They do not speak in awe-struck voices of supernatural\napparitions, for of all fiction the ghost story is most apt to be\nbromidic, nor do they expect others to be impressed by their strange\ndreams any more than with their pathological symptoms. Hypnotism, they\nare convinced, has attained the standing of a science whose rationale\nis pretty well understood and established, and the subject is no longer\nan affording subject for anecdote. Sulphites can even listen to tales\nof Oriental magic, miraculously-growing trees, disappearing boys and\nwhat-not, without suggesting that the audience was mesmerized. Above\nall, the Sulphite recognizes as a principle that, if a story is really\nfunny, it is probably untrue, and he does not seek to give an adjuvant\nrelish to it, by dilating with verisimilitude upon the authenticity of\nthe facts in the case. But your Bromide is impressive and asserts, \"I\nknew the man that died!\" The Sulphite, too, has little need for\neuphemisms. He can speak of birth and death without metaphor.\n\nBut to the Bromide all such matters of fact and fancy are perpetually\npicturesque, and, a discoverer, he leaps up and shouts out\nenthusiastically that two and two are four, and defends his statement\nwith eloquent logic. Each scene, each incident has its magic\nspell--like the little woolly toy lamb, he presses the fact, and\n\"_ba--ba_\" the appropriate sentiment comes forth. Does he have,\nback in the shadows of his mind, perhaps, the ghost of a perception\nthat the thing has been said before? Who can tell! But, if he does,\nhis vanity exorcises the spirit. Bromides seldom listen to one\nanother; they are content with talk for talk's sake, and so escape\nall chance of education. It is this fact, most likely, which has\nendowed the bromidiom with immortality. Never heard, it seems always\nnew, appropriate, clever.\n\nNo, it Isn't so much the things they say, as the way they say them! Do\nyou not recall the smug, confident look, the assurance of having said a\nparticularly happy thing? They come inevitably as the alarm clock; when\nthe hands of circumstance touch the hour, the bromidic remark will\nsurely go off.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut, lest one make too much of this particular symptom, let us consider\na few other tendencies. The Bromide has no surprises for you. When you\nsee one enter a room, you must reconcile yourself to the inevitable. No\nhope for flashes of original thought, no illuminating, newer point of\nview, no sulphitic flashes of fancy--the steady glow of bromidic\nconversation and action is all one can hope for. He may be wise and\ngood, he may be loved and respected--but he lives inland; he puts not\nforth to sea. He is there when you want him, always the same.\n\nBromides also enjoy pathological symptoms. They are fond of describing\nsickness and death-bed scenes. \"His face swelled up to twice its\nnatural size!\" they say, in awed whispers. They attend funerals with\ninterest and scrutiny.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe are all born with certain bromidic tendencies, and children are the\ngreatest bromides in the world. What boy of ten will wear a collar\ndifferent from what his school-mates are all wearing? He must conform\nto the rule and custom of the majority or he suffers fearfully. But, if\nhe has a sulphitic leaven in his soul, adolescence frees him from the\ntyrannical traditions of thought. In costume, perhaps, men still are\nmore bromidic than women. A man has, for choice, a narrow range in\ngarments--for everyday wear at most but four coats, three collars and\ntwo pairs of shoes.\n\nFewer women become Sulphites. The confession is ungallant and painful,\nbut it must be made. We have only to watch them, to listen--and to\npity.\n\nBut stay! If there is anything in heredity, women should be most\nsulphitic. For of all Bromides Adam was the progenitor, while Eve was a\nSulphite from the first!\n\nAlice in Wonderland, however, is the modern type--a Bromide amidst\nSulphites.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhat, then, is a Sulphite? Ah, that is harder to define. A Sulphite is\na person who does his own thinking, he is a person who has surprises up\nhis sleeve. He is explosive. One can never foresee what he will do,\nexcept that it will be a direct and spontaneous manifestation of his\nown personality.\n\nYou cannot tell them by the looks. Sulphites come together like drops\nof mercury, in this bromidic world. Unknown, unsuspected groups of them\nare scattered over the earth, and we never know where we are going to\nmeet them--like fireflies in Summer, like Americans in Europe. The\nBromide we have always with us, predicating the obvious. The Sulphite\nappears uncalled.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut you must not jump to the conclusion that all Sulphites are\nagreeable company. This is no classification as of desirable and\nundesirable people. The Sulphite, from his very nature, must\ncontinually surprise you by an unexpected course of action. He must\nexplode. You never know what he will say or do. He is always sulphitic,\nbut as often impossible. He will not bore you, but he may shock you.\nYou find yourself watching him to see what is coming next, and it may\nbe a subtle jest, a paradox, or an atrocious violation of etiquette.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAll cranks, all reformers, and most artists are sulphitic. The insane\nasylums are full of Sulphites. They not only do ordinary things in\nunusual ways, but they do unusual things in ordinary ways. What is more\nintensely sulphitic than, when you have said your farewells, to go\nimmediately? Or, as you swim out to rescue a drowning girl, to keep\nyour pipe burning, all the while? They do not attempt to \"entertain\"\nyou, but let you choose your own pastime. When they present a gift, it\nhas either rhyme or reason to it. Their letters are not passed about to\nbe read by the family.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHamlet was a Sulphite; Polonius a Bromide. Becky Sharp was sulphitic;\nAmelia Sedley bromidic. So we might follow the line of cleavage between\nthe two groups in Art, Religion and Politics. Compare, for instance,\nPresident Roosevelt with his predecessor in office--the Unexpected\nversus the sedate Thermometer of Public Opinion. Compare Bernard Shaw\nwith Marie Corelli--one would swear that their very brains were\ndifferently colored! Their epigrams and platitudes are merely the\nsymptoms of different methods of thought. One need not consult one's\nprejudice, affection or taste--the Sulphitic Theory explains without\neither condemning or approving. The leopard cannot change his spots.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut if, along with these contrasts, we take, for example, Lewis Carroll\nas opposed to Dr. Johnson, we are brought up against an extraordinary\ninconsistency. It is, however, only an apparent paradox--beneath it\nlies a vital principle. Dr. Johnson was, himself, a Sulphite of the\nSulphites, but how intensely bromidic were his writings! One yawns to\nthink of them. As for Lewis Carroll, in his classic nonsense, so\nsulphitic as often to be accused by Bromides of having a secret\nmeaning, his private life was that of a Bromide. Read his biography and\nlearn the terrors of his formal, set entertainments to the little girls\nwhom he patronized! They knew what to expect of him, and he never,\nhowever agreeably, disappointed them. No, unfortunately a Sulphite does\nnot always produce sulphitic art. How many writers we know who are more\ninteresting than their work! How many who are infinitely less so! Your\nprofessional humorist is usually a dull, melancholy fellow in his\nprivate life--and a clergyman may preach infant damnation and be a\nmerry father at home.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSuch considerations point inevitably to the truth that our theory\ndepends essentially not upon action or talk, but upon the quality and\nrationale of thought. It is a question of Potentiality, rather than of\nDynamics. It is the process of reasoning which concerns us, not its\ntranslation into conduct. A man may be a devoted supporter of Mrs.\nGrundy and yet be a Sulphite, if he has, in his own mind, reached an\noriginal conclusion that society needs her safeguards. He may be the\nwildest-eyed of Anarchists and yet bromidic, if he has accepted\nanother's reasons and swallowed the propaganda whole.\n\nIt will be doubtless through a misconception of this principle that the\nfirst schism in the Sulphitic Theory arises. Already the cult has\nbecome so important that a newer heretic sect threatens it. These\nprotestants cannot believe that there is a definite line to be drawn\nbetween Sulphites and Bromides, and hold that one may partake of a dual\nnature. All such logic is fatuous, and founded upon a misconception of\nthe Theory.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere is, however, a subtlety which has perhaps had something to do\nwith confusing the neophyte. It is this: Sulphitism and Bromidism are,\nsymbolically, the two halves of a circle, and their extremes meet. One\nmay be so extremely bromidic that one becomes, at a leap, sulphitic,\nand _vice versa_. This may be easily illustrated.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMiss Herford's inimitable monologues, being each the apotheosis of some\ntypical Bromide--a shopgirl, a country dressmaker, a bargain-hunter and\nso on--become, through her art, intensely sulphitic. They are\nexcruciatingly funny, just because she represents types so common that\nwe recognize them instantly. Each expresses the crystallized thought of\nher particular bromidic group. Done, then, by a person who is herself a\nSulphite _par excellence_, the result is droll. \"One has,\" says\nEmerson, \"but to remove an object from its environment and instantly it\nbecomes comic.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe same thing is done less artistically every day upon the vaudeville\nstage. We love to recognize types; and what Browning said of beauty:\n\n   We're made so that we love\n   First, when we see them painted,\n   Things we have passed\n   Perhaps a hundred times nor cared to see\n\ncan be easily extended to our sense of humor in caricature. A recent\nhit upon the variety stage does still more to illustrate the problem.\n\nThe \"Cherry Sisters\" aroused immense curiosity by an act so bromidic as\nto be ridiculous. Were they rank amateurs, doing their simple best, or\nwere they clever artists, simulating the awkward crudeness of country\ngirls? That was the question. In a word, were they Sulphites or\nBromides?\n\nWhat such artists have done histrionically, Hillaire Belloc has done\nexquisitely for literature in his \"Story of Manuel Burden.\" This tale,\naffecting to be a serious encomium upon a middle class British\nmerchant, shows plainly that all satire is, in its essence, a sulphitic\njuggling with bromidic topics. It is done unconsciously by many a\nsimple rhymester whose verses are bought by Sulphites and read with\nglee.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the terminology of our theory we must, therefore, include two new\nterms, describing the variation of intensity of these two different\nstates of mind. The extremes meet at the points of Nitro-Bromidism and\nHypo-Sulphitism, respectively. Intensity of Bromidism becomes, then,\nNitro-Bromidism, and we have seen how, through the artist's, or through\na Sulphite's subtle point of view, such Nitro-Bromide becomes\nimmediately sulphitic.\n\nBy a similar reasoning, a Hypo-Sulphite can, at a step, become\nbromidic. The illustration most obvious is that of insanity. We are not\nmuch amused, usually, by the quaint modes of thought exhibited by\nlunatics and madmen.\n\nIt cannot be denied, however, that their processes of thought are\nsulphitic; indeed, they are so wildly original, so fanciful, that we\nmust denominate all such crazed brains, Hypo-Sulphites. Such persons\nare so surprising that they end by having no surprises left for us. We\naccept their mania and cease to regard it; it, in a word, becomes\nbromidic. So, in their ways, are all cranks and eccentrics, all whose\nset purpose is to astonish or to shock. We end\n\n### Summary:\n\n"}

But needs must suck\n  At the great wound, and could not pluck\n  My lips away till I had drawn\n  All venom out.--Ah, fearful pawn!\n  For my omniscience paid I toll\n  In infinite remorse of soul.\n  All sin was of my sinning, all\n  Atoning mine, and mine the gall\n  Of all regret. Mine was the weight\n  Of every brooded wrong, the hate\n  That stood behind each envious thrust,\n  Mine every greed, mine every lust.\n  And all the while for every grief,\n  Each suffering, I craved relief\n  With individual desire,--\n  Craved all in vain!  And felt fierce fire\n  About a thousand people crawl;\n  Perished with each,--then mourned for all!\n  A man was starving in Capri;\n  He moved his eyes and looked at me;\n  I felt his gaze, I heard his moan,\n  And knew his hunger as my own.\n  I saw at sea a great fog bank\n  Between two ships that struck and sank;\n  A thousand screams the heavens smote;\n  And every scream tore through my throat.\n  No hurt I did not feel, no death\n  That was not mine; mine each last breath\n  That, crying, met an answering cry\n  From the compassion that was I.\n  All suffering mine, and mine its rod;\n  Mine, pity like the pity of God.\n  Ah, awful weight!  Infinity\n  Pressed down upon the finite Me!\n  My anguished spirit, like a bird,\n  Beating against my lips I heard;\n  Yet lay the weight so close about\n  There was no room for it without.\n  And so beneath the weight lay I\n  And suffered death, but could not die.\n\n  Long had I lain thus, craving death,\n  When quietly the earth beneath\n  Gave way, and inch by inch, so great\n  At last had grown the crushing weight,\n  Into the earth I sank till I\n  Full six feet under ground did lie,\n  And sank no more,--there is no weight\n  Can follow here, however great.\n  From off my breast I felt it roll,\n  And as it went my tortured soul\n  Burst forth and fled in such a gust\n  That all about me swirled the dust.\n\n  Deep in the earth I rested now;\n  Cool is its hand upon the brow\n  And soft its breast beneath the head\n  Of one who is so gladly dead.\n  And all at once, and over all\n  The pitying rain began to fall;\n  I lay and heard each pattering hoof\n  Upon my lowly, thatched roof,\n  And seemed to love the sound far more\n  Than ever I had done before.\n  For rain it hath a friendly sound\n  To one who's six feet underground;\n  And scarce the friendly voice or face:\n  A grave is such a quiet place.\n\n  The rain, I said, is kind to come\n  And speak to me in my new home.\n  I would I were alive again\n  To kiss the fingers of the rain,\n  To drink into my eyes the shine\n  Of every slanting silver line,\n  To catch the freshened, fragrant breeze\n  From drenched and dripping apple-trees.\n  For soon the shower will be done,\n  And then the broad face of the sun\n  Will laugh above the rain-soaked earth\n  Until the world with answering mirth\n  Shakes joyously, and each round drop\n  Rolls, twinkling, from its grass-blade top.\n  How can I bear it; buried here,\n  While overhead the sky grows clear\n  And blue again after the storm?\n  O, multi-colored, multiform,\n  Beloved beauty over me,\n  That I shall never, never see\n  Again!  Spring-silver, autumn-gold,\n  That I shall never more behold!\n  Sleeping your myriad magics through,\n  Close-sepulchred away from you!\n  O God, I cried, give me new birth,\n  And put me back upon the earth!\n  Upset each cloud's gigantic gourd\n  And let the heavy rain, down-poured\n  In one big torrent, set me free,\n  Washing my grave away from me!\n\n  I ceased; and through the breathless hush\n  That answered me, the far-off rush\n  Of herald wings came whispering\n  Like music down the vibrant string\n  Of my ascending prayer, and--crash!\n  Before the wild wind's whistling lash\n  The startled storm-clouds reared on high\n  And plunged in terror down the sky,\n  And the big rain in one black wave\n  Fell from the sky and struck my grave.\n  I know not how such things can be;\n  I only know there came to me\n  A fragrance such as never clings\n  To aught save happy living things;\n  A sound as of some joyous elf\n  Singing sweet songs to please himself,\n  And, through and over everything,\n  A sense of glad awakening.\n  The grass, a-tiptoe at my ear,\n  Whispering to me I could hear;\n  I felt the rain's cool finger-tips\n  Brushed tenderly across my lips,\n  Laid gently on my sealed sight,\n  And all at once the heavy night\n  Fell from my eyes and I could see,--\n  A drenched and dripping apple-tree,\n  A last long line of silver rain,\n  A sky grown clear and blue again.\n  And as I looked a quickening gust\n  Of wind blew up to me and thrust\n  Into my face a miracle\n  Of orchard-breath, and with the smell,--\n  I know not how such things can be!--\n  I breathed my soul back into me.\n  Ah!  Up then from the ground sprang I\n  And hailed the earth with such a cry\n  As is not heard save from a man\n  Who has been dead, and lives again.\n  About the trees my arms I wound;\n  Like one gone mad I hugged the ground;\n  I raised my quivering arms on high;\n  I laughed and laughed into the sky,\n  Till at my throat a strangling sob\n  Caught fiercely, and a great heart-throb\n  Sent instant tears into my eyes;\n  O God, I cried, no dark disguise\n  Can e'er hereafter hide from me\n  Thy radiant identity!\n  Thou canst not move across the grass\n  But my quick eyes will see Thee pass,\n  Nor speak, however silently,\n  But my hushed voice will answer Thee.\n  I know the path that tells Thy way\n  Through the cool eve of every day;\n  God, I can push the grass apart\n  And lay my finger on Thy heart!\n\n  The world stands out on either side\n  No wider than the heart is wide;\n  Above the world is stretched the sky,--\n  No higher than the soul is high.\n  The heart can push the sea and land\n  Farther away on either hand;\n  The soul can split the sky in two,\n  And let the face of God shine through.\n  But East and West will pinch the heart\n  That can not keep them pushed apart;\n  And he whose soul is flat--the sky\n  Will cave in on him by and by.\n\n\n\n\n  Interim\n\n\n  The room is full of you!--As I came in\n  And closed the door behind me, all at once\n  A something in the air, intangible,\n  Yet stiff with meaning, struck my senses sick!--\n\n  Sharp, unfamiliar odors have destroyed\n  Each other room's dear personality.\n  The heavy scent of damp, funereal flowers,--\n  The very essence, hush-distilled, of Death--\n  Has strangled that habitual breath of home\n  Whose expiration leaves all houses dead;\n  And wheresoe'er I look is hideous change.\n  Save here.  Here 'twas as if a weed-choked gate\n  Had opened at my touch, and I had stepped\n  Into some long-forgot, enchanted, strange,\n  Sweet garden of a thousand years ago\n  And suddenly thought, \"I have been here before!\"\n\n  You are not here.  I know that you are gone,\n  And will not ever enter here again.\n  And yet it seems to me, if I should speak,\n  Your silent step must wake across the hall;\n  If I should turn my head, that your sweet eyes\n  Would kiss me from the door.--So short a time\n  To teach my life its transposition to\n  This difficult and unaccustomed key!--\n  The room is as you left it; your last touch--\n  A thoughtless pressure, knowing not itself\n  As saintly--hallows now each simple thing;\n  Hallows and glorifies, and glows between\n  The dust's grey fingers like a shielded light.\n\n  There is your book, just as you laid it down,\n  Face to the table,--I cannot believe\n  That you are gone!--Just then it seemed to me\n  You must be here.  I almost laughed to think\n  How like reality the dream had been;\n  Yet knew before I laughed, and so was still.\n  That book, outspread, just as you laid it down!\n  Perhaps you thought, \"I wonder what comes next,\n  And whether this or this will be the end\";\n  So rose, and left it, thinking to return.\n\n  Perhaps that chair, when you arose and passed\n  Out of the room, rocked silently a while\n  Ere it again was still. When you were gone\n  Forever from the room, perhaps that chair,\n  Stirred by your movement, rocked a little while,\n  Silently, to and fro. . .\n\n  And here are the last words your fingers wrote,\n  Scrawled in broad characters across a page\n  In this brown book I gave you. Here your hand,\n  Guiding your rapid pen, moved up and down.\n  Here with a looping knot you crossed a \"t\",\n  And here another like it, just beyond\n  These two eccentric \"e's\".  You were so small,\n  And wrote so brave a hand!\n                           How strange it seems\n  That of all words these are the words you chose!\n  And yet a simple choice; you did not know\n  You would not write again.  If you had known--\n  But then, it does not matter,--and indeed\n  If you had known there was so little time\n  You would have dropped your pen and come to me\n  And this page would be empty, and some phrase\n  Other than this would hold my wonder now.\n  Yet, since you could not know, and it befell\n  That these are the last words your fingers wrote,\n  There is a dignity some might not see\n  In this, \"I picked the first sweet-pea to-day.\"\n  To-day!  Was there an opening bud beside it\n  You left until to-morrow?--O my love,\n  The things that withered,--and you came not back!\n  That day you filled this circle of my arms\n  That now is empty.  (O my empty life!)\n  That day--that day you picked the first sweet-pea,--\n  And brought it in to show me!  I recall\n  With terrible distinctness how the smell\n  Of your cool gardens drifted in with you.\n  I know, you held it up for me to see\n  And flushed because I looked not at the flower,\n  But at your face; and when behind my look\n  You saw such unmistakable intent\n  You laughed and brushed your flower against my lips.\n  (You were the fairest thing God ever made,\n  I think.)  And then your hands above my heart\n  Drew down its stem into a fastening,\n  And while your head was bent I kissed your hair.\n  I wonder if you knew.  (Beloved hands!\n  Somehow I cannot seem to see them still.\n  Somehow I cannot seem to see the dust\n  In your bright hair.)  What is the need of Heaven\n  When earth can be so sweet?--If only God\n  Had let us love,--and show the world the way!\n  Strange cancellings must ink th' eternal books\n  When love-crossed-out will bring the answer right!\n  That first sweet-pea!  I wonder where it is.\n  It seems to me I laid it down somewhere,\n  And yet,--I am not sure. I am not sure,\n  Even, if it was white or pink; for then\n  'Twas much like any other flower to me,\n  Save that it was the first.  I did not know,\n  Then, that it was the last.  If I had known--\n  But then, it does not matter.  Strange how few,\n  After all's said and done, the things that are\n  Of moment.\n       Few indeed!  When I can make\n  Of ten small words a rope to hang the world!\n  \"I had you and I have you now no more.\"\n  There, there it dangles,--where's the little truth\n  That can for long keep footing under that\n  When its slack syllables tighten to a thought?\n  Here, let me write it down!  I wish to see\n  Just how a thing like that will look on paper!\n\n  \"*I had you and I have you now no more*.\"\n\n  O little words, how can you run so straight\n  Across the page, beneath the weight you bear?\n  How can you fall apart, whom such a theme\n  Has bound together, and hereafter aid\n  In trivial expression, that have been\n  So hideously dignified?--Would God\n  That tearing you apart would tear the thread\n  I strung you on!  Would God--O God, my mind\n  Stretches asunder on this merciless rack\n  Of imagery!  O, let me sleep a while!\n  Would I could sleep, and wake to find me back\n  In that sweet summer afternoon with you.\n  Summer?  'Tis summer still by the calendar!\n  How easily could God, if He so willed,\n  Set back the world a little turn or two!\n  Correct its griefs, and bring its joys again!\n\n  We were so wholly one I had not thought\n  That we could die apart.  I had not thought\n  That I could move,--and you be stiff and still!\n  That I could speak,--and you perforce be dumb!\n  I think our heart-strings were, like warp and woof\n  In some firm fabric, woven in and out;\n  Your golden filaments in fair design\n  Across my duller fibre.  And to-day\n  The shining strip is rent; the exquisite\n  Fine pattern is destroyed; part of your heart\n  Aches in my breast; part of my heart lies chilled\n  In the damp earth with you.  I have been torn\n  In two, and suffer for the rest of me.\n  What is my life to me?  And what am I\n  To life,--a ship whose star has guttered out?\n  A Fear that in the deep night starts awake\n  Perpetually, to find its senses strained\n  Against the taut strings of the quivering air,\n  Awaiting the return of some dread chord?\n\n  Dark, Dark, is all I find for metaphor;\n  All else were contrast,--save that contrast's wall\n  Is down, and all opposed things flow together\n  Into a vast monotony, where night\n  And day, and frost and thaw, and death and life,\n  Are synonyms.  What now--what now to me\n  Are all the jabbering birds and foolish flowers\n  That clutter up the world?  You were my song!\n  Now, let discord scream!  You were my flower!\n  Now let the world grow weeds!  For I shall not\n  Plant things above your grave--(the common balm\n  Of the conventional woe for its own wound!)\n  Amid sensations rendered negative\n  By your elimination stands to-day,\n  Certain, unmixed, the element of grief;\n  I sorrow; and I shall not mock my truth\n  With travesties of suffering, nor seek\n  To effigy its incorporeal bulk\n  In little wry-faced images of woe.\n\n  I cannot call you back; and I desire\n  No utterance of my immaterial voice.\n  I cannot even turn my face this way\n  Or that, and say, \"My face is turned to you\";\n  I know not where you are, I do not know\n  If Heaven hold you or if earth transmute,\n  Body and soul, you into earth again;\n  But this I know:--not for one second's space\n  Shall I insult my sight with visionings\n  Such as the credulous crowd so eager-eyed\n  Beholds, self-conjured, in the empty air.\n  Let the world wail!  Let drip its easy tears!\n  My sorrow shall be dumb!\n\n  --What do I say?\n  God! God!--God pity me!  Am I gone mad\n  That I should spit upon a rosary?\n  Am I become so shrunken?  Would to God\n  I too might feel that frenzied faith whose touch\n  Makes temporal the most enduring grief;\n  Though it must walk a while, as is its wont,\n  With wild lamenting!  Would I too might weep\n  Where weeps the world and hangs its piteous wreaths\n  For its new dead!  Not Truth, but Faith, it is\n  That keeps the world alive.  If all at once\n  Faith were to slacken,--that unconscious faith\n  Which must, I know, yet be the corner-stone\n  Of all believing,--birds now flying fearless\n  Across would drop in terror to the earth;\n  Fishes would drown; and the all-governing reins\n  Would tangle in the frantic hands of God\n  And the worlds gallop headlong to destruction!\n\n  O God, I see it now, and my sick brain\n  Staggers and swoons!  How often over me\n  Flashes this breathlessness of sudden sight\n  In which I see the universe unrolled\n  Before me like a scroll and read thereon\n  Chaos and Doom, where helpless planets whirl\n  Dizzily round and round and round and round,\n  Like tops across a table, gathering speed\n  With every spin, to waver on the edge\n  One instant--looking over--and the next\n  To shudder and lurch forward out of sight--\n\n       *    *    *    *    *\n\n  Ah, I am worn out--I am wearied out--\n  It is too much--I am but flesh and blood,\n  And I must sleep.  Though you were dead again,\n  I am but flesh and blood and I must sleep.\n\n\n\n\n  The Suicide\n\n\n  \"Curse thee, Life, I will live with thee no more!\n  Thou hast mocked me, starved me, beat my body sore!\n  And all for a pledge that was not pledged by me,\n  I have kissed thy crust and eaten sparingly\n  That I might eat again, and met thy sneers\n  With deprecations, and thy blows with tears,--\n  Aye, from thy glutted lash, glad, crawled away,\n  As if spent passion were a holiday!\n  And now I go.  Nor threat, nor easy vow\n  Of tardy kindness can avail thee now\n  With me, whence fear and faith alike are flown;\n  Lonely I came, and I depart alone,\n  And know not where nor unto whom I go;\n  But that thou canst not follow me I know.\"\n\n  Thus I to Life, and ceased; but through my brain\n  My thought ran still, until I spake again:\n\n  \"Ah, but I go not as I came,--no trace\n  Is mine to bear away of that old grace\n  I brought!  I have been heated in thy fires,\n  Bent by thy hands, fashioned to thy desires,\n  Thy mark is on me!  I am not the same\n  Nor ever more shall be, as when I came.\n  Ashes am I of all that once I seemed.\n  In me all's sunk that leapt, and all that dreamed\n  Is wakeful for alarm,--oh, shame to thee,\n  For the ill change that thou hast wrought in me,\n  Who laugh no more nor lift my throat to sing!\n  Ah, Life, I would have been a pleasant thing\n  To have about the house when I was grown\n  If thou hadst left my little joys alone!\n  I asked of thee no favor save this one:\n  That thou wouldst leave me playing in the sun!\n  And this thou didst deny, calling my name\n  Insistently, until I rose and came.\n  I saw the sun no more.--It were not well\n  So long on these unpleasant thoughts to dwell,\n  Need I arise to-morrow and renew\n  Again my hated tasks, but I am through\n  With all things save my thoughts and this one night,\n  So that in truth I seem already quite\n  Free and remote from thee,--I feel no haste\n  And no reluctance to depart; I taste\n  Merely, with thoughtful mien, an unknown draught,\n  That in a little while I shall have quaffed.\"\n\n  Thus I to Life, and ceased, and slightly smiled,\n  Looking at nothing; and my thin dreams filed\n  Before me one by one till once again\n  I set new words unto an old refrain:\n\n  \"Treasures thou hast that never have been mine!\n  Warm lights in many a secret chamber shine\n  Of thy gaunt house, and gusts of song have blown\n  Like blossoms out to me that sat alone!\n  And I have waited well for thee to show\n  If any share were mine,--and now I go!\n  Nothing I leave, and if I naught attain\n  I shall but come into mine own again!\"\n  Thus I to Life, and ceased, and spake no more,\n  But turning, straightway, sought a certain door\n  In the rear wall.  Heavy it was, and low\n  And dark,--a way by which none e'er would go\n  That other exit had, and never knock\n  Was heard thereat,--bearing a curious lock\n  Some chance had shown me fashioned faultily,\n  Whereof Life held content the useless key,\n  And great coarse hinges, thick and rough with rust,\n  Whose sudden voice across a silence must,\n  I knew, be harsh and horrible to hear,--\n  A strange door, ugly like a dwarf.--So near\n  I came I felt upon my feet the chill\n  Of acid wind creeping across the sill.\n  So stood longtime, till over me at last\n  Came weariness, and all things other passed\n  To make it room; the still night drifted deep\n  Like snow about me, and I longed for sleep.\n\n  But, suddenly, marking the morning hour,\n  Bayed the deep-throated bell within the tower!\n  Startled, I raised my head,--and with a shout\n  Laid hold upon the latch,--and was without.\n\n       *    *    *    *    *\n\n  Ah, long-forgotten, well-remembered road,\n  Leading me back unto my old abode,\n  My father's house!  There in the night I came,\n  And found them feasting, and all things the same\n  As they had been before.  A splendour hung\n  Upon the walls, and such sweet songs were sung\n  As, echoing out of very long ago,\n  Had called me from the house of Life, I know.\n  So fair their raiment shone I looked in shame\n  On the unlovely garb in which I came;\n  Then straightway at my hesitancy mocked:\n  \"It is my father's house!\" I said and knocked;\n  And the door opened.  To the shining crowd\n  Tattered and dark I entered, like a cloud,\n  Seeing no face but his; to him I crept,\n  And \"Father!\" I cried, and clasped his knees, and wept.\n  Ah, days of joy that followed!  All alone\n  I wandered through the house.  My own, my own,\n  My own to touch, my own to taste and smell,\n  All I had lacked so long and loved so well!\n  None shook me out of sleep, nor hushed my song,\n  Nor called me in from the sunlight all day long.\n\n  I know not when the wonder came to me\n  Of what my father's business might be,\n  And whither fared and on what errands bent\n  The tall and gracious messengers he sent.\n  Yet one day with no song from dawn till night\n  Wondering, I sat, and watched them out of sight.\n  And the next day I called; and on the third\n  Asked them if I might go,--but no one heard.\n  Then, sick with longing, I arose at last\n  And went unto my father,--in that vast\n  Chamber wherein he for so many years\n  Has sat, surrounded by his charts and spheres.\n  \"Father,\" I said, \"Father, I cannot play\n  The harp that thou didst give me, and all day\n  I sit in idleness, while to and fro\n  About me thy serene, grave servants go;\n  And I am weary of my lonely ease.\n  Better a perilous journey overseas\n  Away from thee, than this, the life I lead,\n  To sit all day in the sunshine like a weed\n  That grows to naught,--I love thee more than they\n  Who serve thee most; yet serve thee in no way.\n  Father, I beg of thee a little task\n  To dignify my days,--'tis all I ask\n  Forever, but forever, this denied,\n  I perish.\"\n            \"Child,\" my father's voice replied,\n  \"All things thy fancy hath desired of me\n  Thou hast received.  I have prepared for thee\n  Within my house a spacious chamber, where\n  Are delicate things to handle and to wear,\n  And all these things are thine.  Dost thou love song?\n  My minstrels shall attend thee all day long.\n  Or sigh for flowers?  My fairest gardens stand\n  Open as fields to thee on every hand.\n  And all thy days this word shall hold the same:\n  No pleasure shalt thou lack that thou shalt name.\n  But as for tasks--\" he smiled, and shook his head;\n  \"Thou hadst thy task, and laidst it by\", he said.\n\n\n\n\n  God's World\n\n\n  O world, I cannot hold thee close enough!\n    Thy winds, thy wide grey skies!\n    Thy mists, that roll and rise!\n  Thy woods, this autumn day, that ache and sag\n  And all but cry with colour!  That gaunt crag\n  To crush!  To lift the lean of that black bluff!\n  World, World, I cannot get thee close enough!\n\n\n  Long have I known a glory in it all,\n            But never knew I this;\n            Here such a passion is\n  As stretcheth me apart,--Lord, I do fear\n  Thou'st made the world too beautiful this year;\n  My soul is all but out of me,--let fall\n  No burning leaf; prithee, let no bird call.\n\n\n\n\n  Afternoon on a Hill\n\n\n  I will be the gladdest thing\n    Under the sun!\n  I will touch a hundred flowers\n    And not pick one.\n\n  I will look at cliffs and clouds\n    With quiet eyes,\n  Watch the wind bow down the grass,\n    And the grass rise.\n\n  And when lights begin to show\n    Up from the town,\n  I will mark which must be mine,\n    And then start down!\n\n\n\n\n  Sorrow\n\n\n  Sorrow like a ceaseless rain\n    Beats upon my heart.\n  People twist and scream in pain,--\n  Dawn will find them still again;\n  This has neither wax nor wane,\n    Neither stop nor start.\n\n  People dress and go to town;\n    I sit in my chair.\n  All my thoughts are slow and brown:\n  Standing up or sitting down\n  Little matters, or what gown\n    Or what shoes I wear.\n\n\n\n\n  Tavern\n\n\n  I'll keep a little tavern\n    Below the high hill's crest,\n  Wherein all grey-eyed people\n    May set them down and rest.\n\n  There shall be plates a-plenty,\n    And mugs to melt the chill\n  Of all the grey-eyed people\n    Who happen up the hill.\n\n  There sound will sleep the traveller,\n    And dream his journey's end,\n\n\n### Summary:\n\n"}

'twas the ship he sailed to seek it in,\nAnd Death is but the pilot come aboard,\nMethinks I see him smile a boy's glad smile\nOn maddened winds and waters, reefs unknown,\nAs thunders in the sail the dread typhoon,\nAnd in the surf the shuddering timbers groan;\nHorror ahead, and Death beside the wheel:\nThen--spreading stillness of the broad lagoon,\nAnd lap of waters round the resting keel.\n\nStrange Isle of Voices! must we ask in vain,\nIn vain beseech and win no answering word,\nSave mocking echoes of our lonely pain\nFrom lonely hill and bird?\nIsland beneath whose unrelenting coast,\nAs though it never in the sun had been,\nThe whole world's treasure lieth sunk and lost,\nUnsunned, unseen.\nFor, either sunk beyond the diver's skill,\nThere, fathoms deep, our gold is all arust,\nOr in that island it is hoarded still.\nYea, some have said, within thy dreadful wall\nThere is a folk that know not death at all,\nThe loved we lost, the lost we love, are there.\nWill no kind voice make answer to our cry,\nGive to our aching hearts some little trust,\nShow how 'tis good to live, but best to die?\nSome voice that knows\nWhither the dead man goes:\nWe hear his music from the other side,\nMaybe a little tapping on the door,\nA something called, a something sighed--\nNo more.\nO for some voice to valiantly declare\nThe best news true!\nThen, Happy Island of the Happy Dead,\nHow gladly would we spread\nImpatient sail for you!\n\nO vanished loveliness of flowers and faces,\nTreasure of hair, and great immortal eyes,\nAre there for these no safe and secret places?\nAnd is it true that beauty never dies?\nSoldiers and saints, haughty and lovely names,\nWomen who set the whole wide world in flames,\nPoets who sang their passion to the skies,\nAnd lovers wild and wise:\nFought they and prayed for some poor flitting gleam,\nWas all they loved and worshipped but a dream?\nIs Love a lie and fame indeed a breath,\nAnd is there no sure thing in life--but death?\nOr may it be, within that guarded shore,\nHe meets Her now whom I shall meet no more\nTill kind Death fold me 'neath his shadowy wing:\nShe whom within my heart I softly tell\nThat he is dead whom once we loved so well,\nHe, the immortal master whom I sing.\n\nImmortal! yea, dare we the word again,\nIf aught remaineth of our mortal day,\nThat which is written--shall it not remain?\nThat which is sung, is it not built for aye?\nFaces must fade, for all their golden looks,\nUnless some poet them eternalise,\nMake live those golden looks in golden books;\nDeath, soon or late, will quench the brightest eyes--\n'Tis only what is written never dies.\nYea, memories that guard like sacred gold\nSome sainted face, they also must grow old,\nPass and forget, and think--or darest thou not!--\nOn all the beauty that is quite forgot.\n\nStrange craft of words, strange magic of the pen,\nWhereby the dead still talk with living men;\nWhereby a sentence, in its trivial scope,\nMay centre all we love and all we hope;\nAnd in a couplet, like a rosebud furled,\nLie all the wistful wonder of the world.\n\nOld are the stars, and yet they still endure,\nOld are the flowers, yet never fail the spring:\nWhy is the song that is so old so new,\nKnown and yet strange each sweet small shape and hue?\nHow may a poet thus for ever sing,\nThus build his climbing music sweet and sure,\nAs builds in stars and flowers the Eternal mind?\nAh, Poet, that is yours to seek and find!\nYea, yours that magisterial skill whereby\nGod put all Heaven in a woman's eye,\nNature's own mighty and mysterious art\nThat knows to pack the whole within the part:\nThe shell that hums the music of the sea,\nThe little word big with Eternity,\nThe cosmic rhythm in microcosmic things--\nOne song the lark and one the planet sings,\nOne kind heart beating warm in bird and tree--\nTo hear it beat, who knew so well as he?\n\nVirgil of prose! far distant is the day\nWhen at the mention of your heartfelt name\nShall shake the head, and men, oblivious, say:\n'We know him not, this master, nor his fame.'\nNot for so swift forgetfulness you wrought,\nDay upon day, with rapt fastidious pen,\nTurning, like precious stones, with anxious thought,\nThis word and that again and yet again,\nSeeking to match its meaning with the world;\nNor to the morning stars gave ears attent,\nThat you, indeed, might ever dare to be\nWith other praise than immortality\nUnworthily content.\n\nNot while a boy still whistles on the earth,\nNot while a single human heart beats true,\nNot while Love lasts, and Honour, and the Brave,\nHas earth a grave,\nO well-beloved, for you!\n\n\n\n\nAN ODE TO SPRING\n\n(TO GRANT AND NELLIE ALLEN)\n\nIs it the Spring?\n  Or are the birds all wrong\nThat play on flute and viol,\n  A thousand strong,\nIn minstrel galleries\n  Of the long deep wood,\nEpiphanies\n  Of bloom and bud.\n\nGrave minstrels those,\n  Of deep responsive chant;\nBut see how yonder goes,\n  Dew-drunk, with giddy slant,\nYon Shelley-lark,\n  And hark!\nHim on the giddy brink\n  Of pearly heaven\nHis fairy anvil clink.\n\nOr watch, in fancy,\n  How the brimming note\nFalls, like a string of pearls,\n  From out his heavenly throat;\nOr like a fountain\n  In Hesperides,\nRaining its silver rain,\n  In gleam and chime,\nOn backs of ivory girls--\n  Twice happy rhyme!\n\nAh, none of these\n  May make it plain,\nNo image we may seek\n Shall match the magic of his gurgling beak.\n\nAnd many a silly thing\n  That hops and cheeps,\nAnd perks his tiny tail,\n  And sideway peeps,\nAnd flitters little wing,\n  Seems in his consequential way\nTo tell of Spring.\n\nThe river warbles soft and runs\n  With fuller curve and sleeker line,\nThough on the winter-blackened hedge\n  Twigs of unbudding iron shine,\nAnd trampled still the river sedge.\n\nAnd O the Sun!\n  I have no friend so generous as this Sun\nThat comes to meet me with his big warm hands.\n  And O the Sky!\nThere is no maid, how true,\n  Is half so chaste\nAs the pure kiss of greening willow wands\n  Against the intense pale blue\nOf this sweet boundless overarching waste.\n\nAnd see!--dear Heaven, but it is the Spring!--\n  See yonder, yonder, by the river there,\nLong glittering pearly fingers flash\n  Upon the warm bright air:\nWhy, 'tis the heavenly palm,\n  The Christian tree,\nWhose budding is a psalm\n  Of natural piety:\nSoft silver notches up the smooth green stem--\n  Ah, Spring must follow them,\nIt is the Spring!\n\nO Spirit of Spring,\n  Whose strange instinctive art\nMakes the bird sing,\n  And brings the bud again;\nO in my heart\n  Take up thy heavenly reign,\nAnd from its deeps\n  Draw out the hidden flower,\nAnd where it sleeps,\n  Throughout the winter long,\nO sweet mysterious power\n  Awake the slothful song!\n\n_February_ 7, 1893.\n\n\n\n\nTREE-WORSHIP\n\n(TO JOHN LANE)\n\nVast and mysterious brother, ere was yet of me\n  So much as men may poise upon a needle's end,\nStill shook with laughter all this monstrous might of thee,\n  And still with haughty crest it called the morning friend.\n\nThy latticed column jetted up the bright blue air,\n  Tall as a mast it was, and stronger than a tower;\nThree hundred winters had beheld thee mighty there,\n  Before my little life had lived one little hour.\n\nWith rocky foot stern-set like iron in the land,\n  With leafy rustling crest the morning sows with pearls,\nHuge as a minster, half in heaven men saw thee stand,\n  Thy rugged girth the waists of fifty Eastern girls.\n\nKnotted and warted, slabbed and armoured like the hide\n  Of tropic elephant; unstormable and steep\nAs some grim fortress with a princess-pearl inside,\n  Where savage guardian faces beard the bastioned keep:\n\nSo hard a rind, old tree, shielding so soft a heart--\n  A woman's heart of tender little nestling leaves;\nNor rind so hard but that a touch so soft can part,\n  And Spring's first baby-bud an easy passage cleaves.\n\nI picture thee within with dainty satin sides,\n  Where all the long day through the sleeping dryad dreams,\nBut when the moon bends low and taps thee thrice she glides,\n  Knowing the fairy knock, to bask within her beams.\n\nAnd all the long night through, for him with eyes and ears,\n  She sways within thine arms and sings a fairy tune,\nTill, startled with the dawn, she softly disappears,\n  And sleeps and dreams again until the rising moon.\n\nBut with the peep of day great bands of heavenly birds\n  Fill all thy branchy chambers with a thousand flutes,\nAnd with the torrid noon stroll up the weary herds,\n  To seek thy friendly shade and doze about thy roots--\n\nTill with the setting sun they turn them once more home;\n  And, ere the moon dawns, for a brief enchanted space,\nWeary with million miles, the sore-spent star-beams come,\n  And moths and bats hold witches' sabbath in the place.\n\nAnd then I picture thee some bloodstained Holyrood,\n  Dread haunted palace of the bat and owl, whence steal,\nShrouded all day, lost murdered spirits of the wood,\n  And fright young happy nests with homeless hoot and squeal.\n\nThen, maybe, dangling from thy gloomy gallows boughs,\n  A human corpse swings, mournful, rattling bones and chains--\nHis eighteenth century flesh hath fattened nineteenth century cows--\n  Ghastly Aeolian harp fingered of winds and rains.\n\nPoor Rizpah comes to reap each newly-fallen bone\n  That once thrilled soft, a little limb, within her womb;\nAnd mark yon alchemist, with zodiac-spangled zone,\n  Wrenching the mandrake root that fattens in the gloom.\n\nSo rounds thy day, from maiden morn to haunted night,\n  From larks and sunlit dreams to owl and gibbering ghost;\nA catacomb of dark, a maze of living light,\n  To the wide sea of air a green and welcome coast.\n\nI seek a god, old tree: accept my worship, thou!\n  All other gods have failed me always in my need;\nI hang my votive song beneath thy temple bough,\n  Unto thy strength I cry--Old monster, be my creed!\n\nGive me to clasp this earth with feeding roots like thine,\n  To mount yon heaven with such star-aspiring head,\nFill full with sap and buds this shrunken life of mine,\n  And from my boughs oh! might such stalwart sons be shed.\n\nWith loving cheek pressed close against thy horny breast,\n  I hear the roar of sap mounting within thy veins;\nTingling with buds, thy great hands open towards the west,\n  To catch the sweetheart winds that bring the sister rains.\n\nO winds that blow from out the fruitful mouth of God,\n  O rains that softly fall from His all-loving eyes,\nYou that bring buds to trees and daisies to the sod--\n  O God's best Angel of the Spring, in me arise.\n\n\n\n\nA BALLAD OF LONDON\n\n(TO H. W. MASSINSHAM)\n\nAh, London! London! our delight,\nGreat flower that opens but at night,\nGreat City of the Midnight Sun,\nWhose day begins when day is done.\n\nLamp after lamp against the sky\nOpens a sudden beaming eye,\nLeaping alight on either hand,\nThe iron lilies of the Strand.\n\nLike dragonflies, the hansoms hover,\nWith jewelled eyes, to catch the lover;\nThe streets are full of lights and loves,\nSoft gowns, and flutter of soiled doves.\n\nThe human moths about the light\nDash and cling close in dazed delight,\nAnd burn and laugh, the world and wife,\nFor this is London, this is life!\n\nUpon thy petals butterflies,\nBut at thy root, some say, there lies\nA world of weeping trodden things,\nPoor worms that have not eyes or wings.\n\nFrom out corruption of their woe\nSprings this bright flower that charms us so,\nMen die and rot deep out of sight\nTo keep this jungle-flower bright.\n\nParis and London, World-Flowers twain\nWherewith the World-Tree blooms again,\nSince Time hath gathered Babylon,\nAnd withered Rome still withers on.\n\nSidon and Tyre were such as ye,\nHow bright they shone upon the Tree!\nBut Time hath gathered, both are gone,\nAnd no man sails to Babylon.\n\nAh, London! London! our delight,\nFor thee, too, the eternal night,\nAnd Circe Paris hath no charm\nTo stay Time's unrelenting arm.\n\nTime and his moths shall eat up all.\nYour chiming towers proud and tall\nHe shall most utterly abase,\nAnd set a desert in their place.\n\n\n\n\nPARIS DAY BY DAY: A FAMILIAR EPISTLE\n\n(TO MRS. HENRY HARLAND[1])\n\nParis, half Angel, half Grisette,\nI would that I were with thee yet,\nWhere the long boulevard at even\nStretches its starry lamps to heaven,\nAnd whispers from a thousand trees\nVague hints of the Hesperides.\n\nOnce more, once more, my heart, to sit\nWith Aline's smile and Harry's wit,\nTo sit and sip the cloudy green,\nWith dreamy hints of speech between;\n\nOr, may be, flashing all intent\nAt call of some stern argument,\nWhen the New Woman fain would be,\nLike the Old Male, her husband, free.\nThe prose-man takes his mighty lyre\nAnd talks like music set on fire!\n\nThe while the merry crowd slips by\nGlittering and glancing to the eye,\nAll happy lovers on their way\nTo make a golden end of day--\nAh! Cafe truly called _La Paix_!\n\nOr at the _pension_ I would be\nWith Transatlantic maidens three,\nThe same, I vow, who once of old\nGuarded with song the trees of gold.\n\nO Lady, lady, _Vis-a-Vis_,\nWhen shall I cease to think of thee,\nOn whose fair head the Golden Fleece\nToo soon, too soon, returns to Greece--\nOh, why to Athens e'er depart?\nCome back, come back, and bring my heart!\n\nAnd she whose gentle silver grace,\nSo wise of speech and kind of face,\nWhose every wise and witty word\nFell shy, half blushing to be heard.\n\nLast, but ah! surely not least dear,\nThat blithe and buxom buccaneer,\nTh' avenging goddess of her sex,\nBorn the base soul of man to vex,\nAnd wring from him those tears and sighs\nTortured from woman's heart and eyes.\nAh! fury, fascinating, fair--\nWhen shall I cease to think of _her_!\n\nParis, half Angel, half Grisette,\nI would that I were with thee yet,\nBut London waits me, like a wife,--\nLondon, the love of my whole life.\n\nTell her not, Paris, mercy me!\nHow I have flirted, dear, with thee.\n\n[1] By kind permission of the Editor of _The Yellow Book_.\n\n\n\n\nALFRED TENNYSON\n\n(WESTMINSTER, OCTOBER 12, 1892)\n\nGreat man of song, whose glorious laurelled head\n  Within the lap of death sleeps well at last,\nDown the dark road, seeking the deathless dead,\n  Thy faithful, fearless, shining soul hath passed.\n\nFame blows his silver trumpet o'er thy sleep,\n  And Love stands broken by thy lonely lyre;\nSo pure the fire God gave this clay to keep,\n  The clay must still seem holy for the fire.\n\nPoor dupes of sense, we deem the close-shut eye,\n  So faithful servant of his golden tongue,\nStill holds the hoarded lights of earth and sky,\n  We deem the mouth still full of sleeping song.\n\nWe mourn as though the great good song he gave\n  Passed with the singer's own informing breath:\nAh, golden book, for thee there is no grave,\n  Thine is a rhyme that shall not taste of death.\n\nGreat wife of his great heart--'tis yours to mourn,\n  Son well-beloved, 'tis yours, who loved him so:\nBut we!--hath death one perfect page out-torn\n  From the great song whereby alone we know\n\nThe splendid spirit imperiously shy,--\n  Husband to you and father--we afar\nHail poet of God, and name as one should cry:\n  'Yonder a king, and yonder lo! a star!'\n\nSo great his song we deem a little while\n  That Song itself with his great voice hath fled,\nSo grand the toga-sweep of his great style,\n  So vast the theme on which his song was fed.\n\nOne sings a flower, and one a face, and one\n  Screens from the world a corner choice and small,\nEach toy its little laureate hath, but none\n  Sings of the whole: yea, only he sang all.\n\nPoor little bards, so shameless in your care\n  To snatch the mighty laurel from his head,\nHave you no fear, dwarfs in the giant's chair,\n  How men shall laugh, remembering the dead?\n\nGreat is advertisement! 'tis almost fate,\n  But, little mushroom-men, of puff-ball fame,\nAh, do you dream to be mistaken great\n  And to be really great are just the same?\n\nAh, fools! he was a laureate ere one leaf\n  Of the great crown had whispered on his brows;\nFame shrilled his song, Love carolled it, and Grief\n  Blessed it with tears within her lonely house.\n\nFame loved him well, because he loved not Fame,\n  But Peace and Love, all other things before,\nA man was he ere yet he was a name,\n  His song was much because his love was more.\n\n\n\n\nPROFESSOR MINTO\n\nNature, that makes Professors all day long,\nAnd, filling idle souls with idle song,\nTurns out small Poets every other minute,\nMade earth for men--but seldom puts men in it.\n\nAh, Minto, thou of that minority\nWert man of men--we had deep need of thee!\nHad Heaven a deeper? Did the heavenly Chair\nOf Earthly Love wait empty for thee there?\n\n_March_ 1, 1893.\n\n\n\n\nON MR. GLADSTONE'S RETIREMENT\n\nThe world grows Lilliput, the great men go;\n  If greatness be, it wears no outer sign;\n  No more the signet of the mighty line\nStamps the great brow for all the world to know.\nShrunken the mould of manhood is, and lo!\n  Fragments and fractions of the old divine,\n  Men pert of brain, planned on a mean design,\nDapper and undistinguished--such we grow.\n\nNo more the leonine heroic head,\n  The ruling arm, great heart, and kingly eye;\nNo more th' alchemic tongue that turned poor themes\n    Of statecraft into golden-glowing dreams;\n  No more a man for man to deify:\nLaurel no more--the heroic age is dead.\n\n\n\n\nOMAR KHAYYAM\n\n(TO THE OMAR KHAYYAM CLUB)\n\nGreat Omar, here to-night we drain a bowl\nUnto thy long-since transmigrated soul,\n  Ours all unworthy in thy place to sit,\nOurs still to read in life's enchanted scroll.\n\nFor us like thee a little hour to stay,\nFor us like thee a little hour of play,\n  A little hour for wine and love and song,\nAnd we too turn the glass and take our way.\n\nSo many years your tomb the roses strew,\nYet not one penny wiser we than you,\nThe doubts that wearied you are with us still,\nAnd, Heaven be thanked!

The last rays of the\nsun, as it sunk behind the golden clouds, gleamed in at the window of a\ncottage, which stood in a pleasant lane, about a quarter of a mile from\nthe village of Ryefield. On each side of the narrow gravel walk that led\nfrom the lane to the cottage-door, was a little plot of cultivated\nground. That on the right hand was planted with cabbages, onions, and\nother useful vegetables; that on the left, with gooseberry and\ncurrant-bushes, excepting one small strip, where stocks, sweet-peas, and\nrose-trees were growing; whose flowers, for they were now in full bloom,\npeeping over the neatly trimmed quick-hedge that fenced the garden from\nthe road, had a gay and pretty appearance. Not a weed was to be found in\nany of the beds; the gooseberry and currant-bushes had evidently been\npruned with much care and attention, and were loaded with fine ripe\nfruit. But the most remarkable thing in the garden was an apricot-tree,\nwhich grew against the wall of the cottage, and which was covered with\napricots of a large size and beautiful colour.\n\nThe cottage itself, though small and thatched with straw, was clean and\ncheerful, the brick floor was strewed with sand, and a white though\ncoarse cloth was spread on the little deal table. On this table were\nplaced tea-things, a loaf of bread, and some watercresses. A cat was\npurring on the hearth, and a kettle was boiling on the fire.\n\nNear the window, in a large arm-chair, sat an old woman, with a Bible on\nher knees. She appeared happy and contented, and her countenance\nexpressed cheerfulness and good temper. After reading for some time with\ngreat attention, she paused to look from the window into the lane, as if\nexpecting to see some one. She listened as if for a footstep; but all\nwas silent. She read again for about ten minutes longer, and then\nclosing the Sacred Volume, rose, and, having laid the Book carefully on\na shelf, opened the door, and went out into the garden, whence she could\nsee farther into the lane, and remained for a considerable time leaning\nover the little wicket gate, in anxious expectation.\n\n\"What can be the reason that Ned is so late?\" she said, half aloud, to\nherself. \"He always hastens home to his poor old grandmother as soon as\nhe has done work. What can make him an hour later than usual? I hope\nnothing has happened to him. But, hush!\" she continued, after a few\nminutes' pause, \"surely I hear him coming now.\"\n\nShe was not mistaken, for in a minute or two Ned appeared, running quite\nfast up the lane, and in a few moments more he was standing by her side,\npanting and breathless.\n\n\"Dear grandmother,\" he exclaimed, as soon as he had recovered breath\nenough to speak, \"I have a great deal of good news to tell you. Farmer\nTomkyns says he will employ me all through the winter, and pay me the\nsame wages that he does now. This is one piece of good news. And the\nother is, that Mr. Stockwell, the greengrocer, will buy all my apricots,\nand give me a good price for them. I am to take them to him next\nmarket-day. I had to wait more than half-an-hour before I could speak to\nhim, and that made me so late. O how beautiful they are!\" continued he,\ngazing with admiration at the tree. \"O grandmother, how happy I am!\"\n\nHis grandmother smiled, and said she was glad to hear this good news.\n\"And now come in and have your tea, child,\" she added; \"for I am sure\nyou must be hungry.\"\n\n\"O grandmother,\" said Ned, as they sat at tea, \"now that Mr. Stockwell\nwill buy the fruit, you will be able to have a cloak to keep you warm\nthis winter. It often used to grieve me, last year, to see you obliged\nto go to church such bitter cold weather, with only that thin old shawl\non. I know you said you could not spare money to get a cloak for\nyourself, because you had spent all you could save in buying me a\njacket. My tree has never borne fruit till this year; and you always\nsaid that when it did, I should do what I pleased with the money its\nfruit would fetch. Now, there is nothing I should like to spend it on\nbetter than in getting a cloak for you.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Ned,\" replied his grandmother; \"it would indeed be a very\ngreat comfort. I do not think I should have suffered so much from\nrheumatism last winter, if I had had warmer clothing. If it was not for\nyour apricot-tree, I must have gone without a cloak this winter also;\nfor, what with our pig dying, and your having no work to do in the\nspring, this has been but a bad year for us.\"\n\n\"The money Mr. Stockwell is going to give me,\" resumed Ned, \"will be\nenough all but sixpence; and I have a new sixpence, you know, in a\nlittle box upstairs, that my aunt gave me last June, when I went to\nspend the day with her; so when I carry him the fruit, I shall take that\nin my pocket, and then when I come home in the evening I can bring the\ncloak with me. O that will be a happy day!\" continued Ned, getting up to\njump and clap his hands for joy.\n\n\"There is another thing I am very glad of,\" said he, sitting down again.\n\"Master is going to turn Tom Andrews away next week.\"\n\n\"You ought not to be glad of that, Ned. Tom is one of a large family;\nand his father being very poor, it must be a great help to have one of\nhis children earning something.\"\n\n\"But he is ill-natured to me, and often plagues me very much. It was\nonly yesterday he broke the best hoe, by knocking stones about with it,\nand then told master it was my doing. Besides, he is idle, and does not\nmind what is said to him, and often gets into mischief.\"\n\n\"And do you think being turned away from Farmer Tomkyns's will help to\ncure these faults?\"\n\n\"No,\" answered Ned; \"I do not suppose it will.\"\n\n\"On the contrary, is it not likely that he will grow more idle, and get\noftener into mischief, when he has no master to look after him, and\nnothing to do all day long but play about the streets?\"\n\n\"Why, yes, that is true. Still, it will serve him right to be turned\naway. I have heard Mr. Harris, our rector, say that those who do wrong\nought to be punished.\"\n\n\"Pray, Ned,\" asked his grandmother, \"can you tell me what is the use of\npunishment?\"\n\n\"The use of punishment!--\" repeated Ned, thoughtfully. \"Let me think.\nThe use of punishment, I believe, is to make people better.\"\n\n\"Right. Now, Ned, you have allowed that Tom's being turned away is not\nlikely to make him better, but worse; so that I am afraid the true\nreason why you rejoice at his disgrace is because you bear resentment\nagainst him, for having been ill-natured to yourself. Think a minute,\nand tell me if this is not the case.\"\n\nNed owned that his grandmother was right; and then observed, \"It is very\ndifficult not to bear ill-will against any one who has done us wrong.\"\n\n\"Yet,\" rejoined his grandmother, \"it is our duty to pardon those who\nhave injured us. St. Paul says, in his Epistle to the Ephesians, 'Be ye\nkind one to another, tender hearted, forgiving one another, even as God\nfor Christ's sake hath forgiven you.' And our blessed Saviour has\ncommanded us to 'love our enemies,' to 'do good to them that hate us,\nand to pray for those that despitefully use us, and persecute us.' If\nyou will look at the fourteenth and fifteenth verses of the sixth\nchapter of St. Matthew, you will see what else our Lord says on the\nsubject.\"\n\nNed took the Bible, and having found the place, read, \"For if ye forgive\nmen their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you: but if\nye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your heavenly Father\nforgive your trespasses.\"\n\n\"Before you go to bed,\" said his grandmother, when he had finished\nreading, \"I wish you to get by heart these three texts, and repeat them\nto me.\"\n\nNed did as he was desired, and then his grandmother kissed him, and bid\nhim good-night.\n\nNed loved his grandmother very much, for she had always been kind to\nhim. His parents had both died when he was very young; and she then\nbrought him home to live with her, and had taken care of him ever since.\nShe taught him to read and write, and cast up sums; to be steady and\nindustrious; and, above all, it was her great care to instil into his\nmind religious principles. She had often told him that the way to profit\nby what we read, as well as by the good advice that may be given us, is\nto think upon it afterwards; and she frequently desired him to make a\npractice of saying over to himself every night whatever verses from the\nBible he had learnt by heart during the day.\n\nThis evening, when Ned repeated his texts, he felt that he had been\nwrong to rejoice at Tom Andrews's disgrace, because he had behaved ill\nto himself; and he prayed God to make Tom see his faults, and leave off\nhis bad ways.\n\nThe next day Ned, as usual, went early to his work. Tom Andrews was\nvery teasing, but Ned tried not to be provoked; and when Tom said\nill-natured things to him, he checked the angry replies he was tempted\nto make. Two days afterwards, when Ned came home to tea, he thought with\npleasure that to-morrow was market-day at the town where Mr. Stockwell\nlived; and he ran in and out twenty times, to look at, and admire, his\nbeautiful apricot-tree. \"I must get up very early indeed to-morrow\nmorning,\" he said to his grandmother, \"that I may gather the apricots,\nand take them to Mr. Stockwell before I go to my work.\" Accordingly the\nnext morning he rose as soon as it was light, and, taking a basket the\ngreengrocer had lent him in his hand, went into the little garden to\nline it with fresh green leaves, before putting the fruit into it.\n\nWhat was his surprise and sorrow when he saw that every one of his\napricots was gone, and the tree itself sawn nearly in two, close to the\nroot!\n\nThrowing down his basket, Ned ran to his grandmother, who was just come\ndown stairs, and had begun to light the fire.\n\nHe could only exclaim, \"O my apricots, my apricots, they are all gone!\nAnd my beautiful tree--\" then covering his face with his hands, he burst\ninto tears.\n\n\"What is the matter, my dear?\" inquired his grandmother.\n\nNed replied by taking her by the hand, and leading her into the garden.\n\n\"Who can have done this?\" he exclaimed, sobbing. \"If they had only\nstolen the apricots, I could have borne it better! But to see my dear\ntree spoiled--It must die--it must be quite killed--only look how it is\ncut!\"\n\n\"I am very sorry for you, my poor boy,\" said his grandmother, kindly.\n\"It is a most vexatious thing.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" cried Ned, \"if I did but know who it was that had done it--\"\n\n\"I would be revenged on them, some how or other,\" he was going to have\nadded; but the texts which he had learned a few days before concerning\nthe forgiveness of injuries, and which he had frequently repeated to\nhimself since, came into his mind, and he stopped short.\n\nOn looking round the garden, to see if they could discover any traces of\nthe thief, Ned and his grandmother saw the prints of a boy's shoe,\nrather bigger than Ned's, in several of the beds, and hanging on the\nquick-hedge were some tattered fragments of a red cotton handkerchief\nchecked with white. \"I know this handkerchief,\" said Ned; \"it is Tom\nAndrews's; I have often seen him with it tied round his neck. It must be\nhe who stole my apricots.\"\n\n\"You cannot be sure that it is Tom who stole your apricots,\" rejoined\nhis grandmother. \"Many other people besides him have red handkerchiefs.\"\n\n\"But I am sure it can be no one but Tom; for only yesterday, when I told\nhim about my apricots, and the money I expected to get for them, he said\nhe wished he knew how to get some, that he might have money too. Oh! if\nI could but get hold of him--\"\n\nAgain he stopped, and thought of our Saviour's words; then, turning to\nhis grandmother, he said, \"Whoever it is that has robbed us of the\nfruit, I forgive him, even if it is Tom Andrews.\"\n\nNed went to work that day with a heavy heart. Tom Andrews was in high\nglee; for his master had said he would give him another week's trial.\nNed told him of the misfortune that had happened to him, and thought\nthat Tom looked rather confused. He also remarked that his companion had\nnot got the red handkerchief on that he usually wore about his neck; and\nhe asked him the reason.\n\n\"I tore it last night, scrambling through a hedge,\" replied Tom\ncarelessly.\n\n\"How came you to be scrambling through a hedge last night?\" inquired\nNed.\n\n\"What makes you ask me that question?\" returned the other, sharply.\n\n\"Because,\" answered Ned, fixing his eyes upon him, \"because the person\nwho stole my apricots left part of a red handkerchief hanging on our\nhedge.\"\n\n\"Do you mean to say, then, that _I_ stole them?\" exclaimed his\ncompanion, in an angry tone. \"I'll teach you to tell this of me.\"\n\nSo saying, he struck Ned a blow on the face with his fist, before Ned\nwas aware what he was going to do.\n\nNed was very much tempted to strike in return; but just as he raised his\narm, something seemed to whisper that he ought not to do so; and,\ndrawing back a few steps, he called after Tom, who was beginning to run\naway, saying,\n\n\"You need not be afraid of me. I am not going to strike you, though you\ndid strike me; because it is wrong to return evil for evil.\"\n\n\"Fine talking, indeed!\" rejoined Tom, tauntingly. \"I know very well the\nreason why you will not strike me again. You dare not, because I am the\nbiggest and strongest. You are afraid of me.\"\n\nNow Ned was no coward. He would have fought in a good cause with a boy\ntwice his size; and he was very much provoked at the words and manner of\nhis companion.\n\nHe had a hard struggle with himself not to return the blow; but he kept\nfirm to the good resolution he had made, and went away.\n\nAs he was returning home very sorrowful, he could not help thinking how\nhappy he had expected to be that evening; and he regretted extremely\nthat his grandmother would have no cloak to keep her warm in the cold\nweather. Still, the recollection that he had patiently borne the blow\nand insulting speeches of Tom, and thus endeavoured to put in practice\nthe good precepts he had been taught, consoled him, and made him feel\nless sad than he would otherwise have been.\n\n\"How did you get that black eye, Ned?\" asked his grandmother, as soon as\nshe saw him. \"I hope you have not been fighting.\"\n\n\"No, grandmother, indeed I have not,\" replied Ned; and he told her how\nit had happened.\n\nHis grandmother said that he was a good boy to have acted as he did, and\nadded, \"It makes me happier to find that you behave well, than twenty\nnew cloaks would.\"\n\nThe next day, at dinner time, when Ned went into the little outhouse\nwhere he and Tom usually ate this meal, he found Tom sitting there\ncrying.\n\n\"What makes you cry, Tom?\" inquired Ned.\n\n\"Because I have no dinner,\" was the reply.\n\n\"How happens that?\" asked Ned.\n\n\"Because, now father's out of work, mother says she can only give us two\nmeals a-day. I only had a little bit of bread this morning; and I shall\nhave nothing else till I go home in the evening, and then she will give\nme a cold potato or two.\"\n\nNed's grandmother had given him that day for his dinner a large slice of\nbread, and a piece of cold bacon. Ned had been working hard, and was\nvery hungry. He could have eaten all the bread and bacon with pleasure,\nand felt certain that if he had got no dinner and Tom had, Tom would not\nhave given him any of his. He recollected that Tom had never in his life\nshown him any kindness; that, a fortnight ago, when Tom had had four\napples given him, he had eaten them all himself, without even offering\nhim part of one; and, above all, he called to mind that Tom was in all\nprobability the person who had robbed him of his apricots, and killed\nhis favourite apricot-tree.\n\nBut he remembered our Saviour's command, \"Do good to them that hate\nyou;\" and though Tom was a bad boy, yet it grieved Ned to see him crying\nwith hunger, whilst he himself had food to eat. So he divided both the\nbread and the bacon into two equal shares, with his knife, and then,\ngoing up to Tom, gave him one portion, and desired him to eat it. Tom\nlooked at Ned in some surprise, and then, taking the food that was\noffered him, ate it in a ravenous manner, without saying a word.\n\n\"He might just have thanked me,\" thought Ned to himself; but he forbore\nto tell Tom so.\n\nNed always read a chapter in the Bible to his grandmother every night\nwhen he came home from work. It happened that this evening the chapter\nfixed on was the twelfth of St. Paul's Epistle to the Romans. He was\nmuch struck by one of the verses in it: \"Therefore if thine enemy\nhunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing thou\nshalt heap coals of fire upon his head.\"\n\n\"Grandmother,\" said Ned, when he had concluded the chapter, \"I\nunderstand the first part of this verse very well, it is plain enough;\nbut what is meant by the words, 'for in so doing thou shalt heap coals\nof fire upon his head?'\"\n\nHis grandmother replied, that this passage had once puzzled her; but\nthat an old lady with whom she had lived when she was a girl, and who\nkindly took great pains in explaining different parts of the Bible that\nwere hard to be understood, had made this quite clear to her.\n\n\"She told me,\" continued his grandmother, \"that the Apostle alludes to\nthe custom of melting gold and other metals by fire; and his meaning is,\nthat as coals of fire melt and soften the metals on which they are\nheaped, so by kindness and gentleness we may melt and soften our enemy,\nand make him love, instead of hating us.\"\n\nNed thanked his grandmother for this explanation, and then was silent\nfor some little time.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" he said to himself, \"if I go on being kind to Tom Andrews, I\nshall at last make him love me, and leave off teasing me and saying\nill-natured things.\"\n\nHe would not tell his grandmother that he had given Tom part of his\ndinner, for fear she should another day give him more; and he knew she\ncould not do this without robbing herself.\n\nTom's father remained out of work for several weeks; and Tom would have\nbeen obliged to go without a dinner most days, if Ned had not regularly\ngiven him half his.\n\nFor some time Tom received his companion's kindness sulkily, and without\nappearing at all grateful; but at last Ned's good-natured conduct\nappeared to touch him, and he said--\n\n\"How kind you are to me, Ned! though I am sure I have done nothing to\ndeserve kindness from you. Father often says he wishes I was more like\nyou; and I do think I should be happier if I was, for you always seem\ncheerful and contented, though you work harder than I do.\"\n\n\"I like working,\" answered Ned; \"nothing makes me so dull as being idle.\nBesides, as grandmother says, people are far more likely to do wrong\nwhen they are not employed. You know the lines in the hymn,--\n\n\n  'For Satan finds some mischief still\n    For idle hands to do,'\"\n\n\nTom looked down and .\n\nNed, who had not meant to give him pain by what he said, added, on\nobserving Tom's confusion--\n\n\"I have so many things I like to do when I go home after work, that I\ndon't deserve praise for not being idle.\"\n\n\"I wish I had anything I liked to do when work is over,\" returned Tom;\n\"but I have nothing to do but play, and I soon get tired of that.\"\n\n\"So do I,\" rejoined Ned. \"I like a game of ball or cricket every now and\nthen as well as anybody; but it is a great waste of time, to say the\nleast of it, to spend all one's spare hours in play; besides, as you\nsay, we get tired, and do not enjoy play if we have too much of it.\"\n\n\"What do you do of an evening, that is so pleasant?\" inquired Tom.\n\n\"Why I keep our little garden in order;--that takes up a good deal of\ntime; and I write a copy, and do a sum or two, and read the Bible to\ngrandmother.\"\n\n\"I should like that very well,\" observed Tom, \"all except reading the\nBible.\"\n\n\"Oh, do not say so!\" exclaimed Ned; \"surely you do not mean it.\"\n\n\"I dare say,\" rejoined Tom, \"that I should like the Bible well enough if\nI could understand it; but it's so hard! _You_ understand it all, I\nsuppose?\"\n\n\"Oh, dear no! that I do not; but grandmother sometimes explains what is\nhard, and tells me a great many pleasing things about the manners of the\ncountry where our Saviour and his Apostles lived. I never am happier\nthan when I read to her, and she talks to me about what I have read.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Tom, \"mother hears me read a chapter now and then, but she\nalways seems to think it a trouble; and so I read as fast as I can, to\nget it the sooner over. Father commonly says, he's too tired to listen.\"\n\nNed said no more on the subject then; but when they had both done work,\nhe asked Tom if he would like to walk home with him, and look at his\ngarden.\n\nTom hesitated at first; there seemed to be something in the idea that\nmade him uncomfortable. But he had been gradually growing fond of Ned,\nand Ned's account of the pleasures and comfort of his home had made him\nwish to go there; so he told his companion that he would go with him.\n\nNed's grandmother received the two boys very kindly, and gave them some\ntea and bread and butter. Having learned from Tom that his parents would\nnot be uneasy at his absence, she asked him to stay with them all the\nevening.\n\nThe next day Tom looked wistfully at Ned, as if he wished to go home\nwith him, but did not like to say anything about it. Ned observed this,\nand told him that his grandmother had said he might come whenever he\nliked.\n\n\"Then I'll go to-night,\" said Tom.\n\nAnd accordingly he went home with Ned that evening, and almost every\nevening afterwards for some time. He helped Ned to work in his garden,\nand took a part in all his other employments. Ned always read the Bible\nafter tea, which Tom at first thought very tiresome; and he would not\nhave stayed, had he not wished for Ned's company afterwards to walk part\nof the way back with him to the village; but soon he became so much\ninterested in what he heard read, as well as by the improving and\ninteresting conversation of Ned's grandmother, that he looked forward to\nthe evening's reading as one of the pleasantest events of the day.\n\nOne afternoon, as the two boys were digging a bed in the garden, Tom\nsaid to his companion--\n\n\"I have long been going to tell you of something that makes me very\nuncomfortable; but I have never yet had courage to do it. I know you\nthink that I stole your apricots, don't you?\"\n\nNed did not immediately reply. His good-nature made him unwilling to own\nthat he _did_ suspect Tom; and he could not tell an untruth, by saying\nthat he did not suspect him.\n\n\"Well,\" continued Tom, \"I am sure you must; and I do not wonder at it.\nNow the truth is, that when you told me about your apricots, I thought\nto myself that I would come when it was dusk, and take two or three of\nthem just to eat, thinking that you would not miss such a small number.\nBut I did not like to go by myself; so I asked Fred Morris if he would\ngo with me. He said, 'O yes; he would go anywhere, or do anything, to\nget some apricots.' He did not know of your tree, he added; or he should\nhave paid it a visit before. I began to be sorry I had told him, and\nmade him promise that he would not take more than three. When it got\ndark, and we were set out, I felt that I was doing very wrong. I wished\nto turn back; but Fred would not let me. He said I need not take any\nfruit myself if I wanted to back out; but that if I did not go with him\nto show him the tree, he would beat me within an inch of my life. So we\ncame to the wicket together; it was fastened, and we clambered over the\nhedge. Fred had a large basket with him, which I had several times asked\nhim about, and tried to make him say what he brought it for. He told me\nthat I should see when the time came. As soon as he got to the tree, he\nbegan gathering the apricots as fast as he could, and putting them into\nhis basket. I tried to hinder him, and said I would shout and wake you;\nbut he declared that, if I did, he would kill me; and you know, Ned, he\nis nearly twice as big as I am, and terribly violent; so all I could do\nwas to hold my tongue, and let him alone. Just as we were going away, he\ncaught up a saw that was lying in the garden, and spoiled the tree with\nit. I do believe he did this just for the love of mischief, or maybe\npartly to spite me, because I had told him not to steal all the\napricots. He would not let me have one for my share; though I do not\nthink I could have eaten it if he had, I was so much frightened, and so\nsurprised at him for stealing all your fruit. He besides ordered me not\nto tell what he had done, and bullied me a great deal about it, till at\nlast I got away from him. I was too much afraid to tell you for a good\nwhile, but I could not bear that you should think I had been so very\nwicked; and at last I made up my mind to tell you exactly how it was.\n\n\"I know that I have been very wrong,\" continued Tom; \"and that if it had\nnot been for me the apricots would not have been stolen. I can't be more\nsorry than I am. And now that you have heard all, Ned, will you forgive\nme, and try not to think as badly of me as I deserve?\"\n\nNed said he was glad to hear Tom had had no more share in the affair;\nand then, holding out his hand to Tom, he assured him of his entire\nforgiveness.\n\n\"Indeed, Tom,\" he added, \"I forgave you in my heart long ago.\"\n\n\"I am sure you did,\" rejoined Tom warmly, \"or you would not have been so\nkind to me. O Ned, you cannot think how unhappy it makes me when I\nrecollect how often I have been teasing and ill-natured to you,\nnotwithstanding your good-nature to me!\"\n\n\"Say no more about that,\" replied Ned; \"you have not been teasing or\nill-natured lately. We shall, I hope, always be good friends for the\nfuture.\"\n\nWhen Tom was gone, Ned related this conversation to his grandmother.\n\n\"I think,\" she observed, when he concluded, \"that all Tom's sin in this\nmatter came from breaking the tenth commandment. If he had not first\ncoveted the apricots, he would not have been tempted to steal them.\nThrough earnestly desiring what did not belong to him, he was led not\nonly to commit a great sin himself, but to be the means of leading a\nfellow-creature into sin also. Fred Morris would not have thought of\nrobbing the apricot-tree had not Tom put it into his head. In the Bible\nwe are frequently charged not to lead our brother into sin; and heavy\npunishments are denounced against him who shall cause another to do\nevil.\"\n\n\"I used to think, grandmother,\" observed Ned, \"that the tenth\ncommandment must be the least important of all; I did not suppose there\ncould be any very great harm in merely wishing for what belongs to\nanother person; but I shall never think so in future.\"\n\nSeveral weeks passed away, and the weather began to grow cold and\nwinterly. Ned could not help sighing when he saw his grandmother\nsuffering from the cold, and recollected that she had no cloak to keep\nher warm, and would have none all the winter.\n\nHe sometimes sighed, too, as he looked at the apricot-tree, whose\nbranches were now dead and withering; and so did Tom. Both the boys\nagreed that it had better be cut down, and taken away entirely.\n\n\"How I wish,\" exclaimed Tom, \"that we had another to put in its place!\"\n\n\"So do I,\" rejoined Ned; \"but apricot-trees, I believe, are very dear to\nbuy. A gardener my father used to work for, and who is now dead, gave me\nthis. I fear there is no chance of our ever getting another.\"\n\n\"How I do wish I was rich!\" cried Tom; \"I would give you an\napricot-tree, and all manner of things besides. I should like to be as\nrich as our Squire best; but it would do to be as rich as Farmer\nTomkyns. Oh, if I had only half as many sheep, and pigs, and cows, and\nhaystacks, as he has, how happy I should be! Don't you wish you had some\nof the Squire's or Farmer Tomkyns's riches, Ned?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Ned, \"I don't; because we ought not to wish for other\npeople's things.\"\n\nHe then told Tom all that he could remember of what his grandmother had\nsaid to him about the sin of coveting what does not belong to us; and\nthat doing so, besides breaking one commandment, is very likely to lead\nto the breaking of others also.\n\n\"But,\" asked Tom, \"how is it possible to help longing sometimes for\nthings we have not got, and yet see other people have?\" \n\n\"We may not,\" said Ned's grandmother, who had come out to call the boys\nin to tea, and had overheard the latter part of their conversation; \"we\nmay not, perhaps\n\n### Summary:\n\n"}

KIDDER\n\n\nFOR THE SUNDAY-SCHOOL UNION OF THE METHODIST EPISCOPAL CHURCH, 200\nMULBERRY-STREET.\n\n\n1831.\n\n\n\n\nTHE GOOD RESOLUTION.\n\n\n\"Why am I so unhappy to-day?\" said Isabella Gardner, as she opened her\neyes on the morning of her fourteenth birth-day. \"Is it because the sun\nis not bright enough, or the flowers are not sweet enough?\" she added,\nas she looked on the glorious sunshine that lay upon the rose-bushes\nsurrounding her window.\n\nIsabella arose, and dressed herself, and tried to drive away her\nuncomfortable feelings, by thinking of the pleasures of the afternoon,\nwhen some of her young friends were to assemble to keep her birth-day.\nBut she could not do it; and, sad and restless, she walked in her\nfather's garden, and seated herself on a little bench beneath a shady\ntree. Everything around was pleasant; the flowers seemed to send up\ntheir gratitude to Heaven in sweetness, and the little birds in songs of\njoy. All spoke peace and love, and Isabella could find nothing there\nlike discontent or sorrow. The cause of her present troubled feelings\nwas to be found within.\n\nIsabella Gardner was in the habit of indulging in a fretful and peevish\ntemper. She was often \"hasty in her spirit to be angry;\" forgetting that\nthe wise Solomon says, \"Anger resteth in the bosom of fools;\" and that a\ngreater than Solomon had commanded her to forgive, as she would be\nforgiven.\n\nHer disrespect and ill-humor toward her parents had caused her many\nunhappy days and sleepless nights; and often had the day closed on\nfaults unrepented of, and sins unforgiven. It was but the afternoon\nbefore that she had spoken in a high angry tone to her eldest sister,\nMary, and parted in displeasure from her brother Edward, because he\nwould not leave his studies to go into the garden with her. Thus had the\n\"sun gone down upon her wrath;\" and we cannot be surprised that when it\nrose in the morning she was unhappy.\n\nIsabella had a generous temper; and after she had been unkind or unjust,\nshe was frequently sorry, and determined to be so no more; but her\nregret was forgotten as soon as she was again tempted; and at the age\nof thirteen she had gained no victory over the sinful habit of indulging\nin an angry temper.\n\nIsabella had kind and indulgent parents;--parents who looked with\nthankfulness upon the virtues, and with sorrow upon the faults, of their\nchildren, and prayed that the former might be strengthened, and the\nlatter corrected. Mrs. Gardner had long seen with deep anxiety the\ngrowing defect in Isabella's temper, and it was now brought more\npainfully home to her feelings, as she reflected how much an added year\nincreased the responsibility of her child.\n\nShe had risen early, and had been long engaged in prayer to Him who can\nalone regulate the unruly dispositions, wills, and passions of sinful\nmen. She prayed for knowledge of her duty to her child, and for\nstrength to perform it: she prayed for Isabella, that God would convince\nher of the error of her way; that his Holy Spirit might renew her in the\nspirit of her mind, that she might become a child and follower of the\nLord Jesus Christ.\n\nLong and anxiously the pious mother continued her supplications at the\nthrone of grace; and after taking her Bible, and reading the blessed\nassurance, \"I can do all things through Christ strengthening me,\" she\nwent into the garden to meet Isabella. She found her there, sitting as\nwe have described, alone and sorrowful. \"What is the matter, Isabella,\"\nsaid Mrs. Gardner, in a kind tone: \"why are you so sad on the morning of\nyour birth-day?\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"I don't know, mother,\" replied Isabella; \"I believe it is because\nnobody loves me.\"\n\n\"Isabella,\" said Mrs. Gardner, \"I am afraid nobody will love you long if\nyou go on as you have done lately, giving way to angry feelings whenever\nanything opposes your wishes; and, what is much worse, you will offend\nyour heavenly Father, if you thus continue to break his holy commands.\"\n\n\"I can't help being displeased, mother, when people show me that they\ndon't like me, and try to vex me.\"\n\n\"Seldom does any one vex us on purpose, Isabella. It is the bad state of\nour own hearts that makes us think we are not liked; and, besides, Jesus\nChrist has forbidden us to be angry even when there are real faults. He\ntells us to forgive others, as he has forgiven us; and do you think you\nhave obeyed him?\"\n\n\"No, mother; but people must be angry when they are treated unfairly;\nand the girls at school are often very unkind and unjust to me; and I am\nsure I ought to show them that I don't like it.\"\n\n\"Such is not the gospel rule, Isabella; and that alone should be your\nguide. There you are directed to love those who treat you unkindly, to\ndo good to those that hate you, and to 'pray for those who despitefully\nuse you.' The recollection of your own need of forgiveness from God,\nought to make you patient toward the faults of others.\"\n\n\"Very often, mother, when I try to do my best, I am misunderstood, and\nreproved; and then I am sure even the best persons would be displeased.\"\n\n\"Not if they are disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ, Isabella. Was he\nnot holy and undefiled, pure, spotless, and without sin? and was he not\npersecuted, falsely accused, and scourged? reviled and rejected by men,\nbetrayed by one disciple, and forsaken by all the rest? Yet no word of\nevil passion was ever heard from him. He opened not his mouth, nor would\nhe suffer another to resent any of the insults offered to him. 'The\ndisciple is not above his Master;' and if we profess to follow Jesus\nChrist, we must learn to bear all things, and try 'to be perfect, as our\nFather in heaven is perfect.'\n\n\"Forgiveness of injuries is a high duty, and patiently to bear injustice\nis one of the greatest Christian excellences. God alone can give us the\nright temper of mind, but we must ourselves try to attain it. Perhaps\nyou may recollect what Peter says about suffering patiently for\nwell-doing. To be sure, those to whom he was preaching were suffering in\na great cause; but the conquest of our faults is a great cause to us;\nand we may all apply his words to our own cases. He was preaching to the\nChristians at Pontus, who were enduring persecution in the cause of\nChrist,--'For what glory is it, if, when ye be buffeted for your faults,\nye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer for it,\nye take it patiently, this is acceptable with God.'\" 1 Pet. ii, 20.\n\nIsabella, as usual, acknowledged her error, and said she would try to\ncorrect it.\n\n\"Do you know, Isabella,\" said Mrs. Gardner, \"that you have promised me\nthis a great many times before?\"\n\n\"Yes, mother.\"\n\n\"And do you know that, by thus repeatedly breaking your promises, you\nadd to the sins already committed?\"\n\n\"Yes, mother.\"\n\n\"And do you know, my child, the reason why you cannot keep your\npromises?\"\n\n\"No, mother; I am sure I try to keep them; but before I think I get\nangry.\"\n\n\"We are all weak and sinful creatures,\" said Mrs. Gardner; \"and without\nhelp from God we can do no good thing. Even the apostle Paul found that\nwhen he would do good, evil was present with him: so that the best\npersons require aid from above, to enable them to keep in the right\npath. You must be convinced of your own weakness, Isabella, before you\nwill feel the need of this assistance; and I should think your failures\nin your efforts to regulate your temper would be enough of it.\n\n\"This is the commencement of your new year. On this day you begin\nanother term of duty. Think of all your faults; think particularly of\nthat which now troubles you so much: then go to God, and humbly confess\nto him your wickedness; seek the influence of the Holy Spirit; promise\nfrom this day to try and govern your temper, and promise it in his\npresence. Ask God to help you to keep this resolution; pray that you may\nbe gentle, kind, and forgiving; humble, and willing to be reproved; and\nthat the beginning of your new year may be the beginning of a new life\nwith you.\n\n\"I now leave you to think of these things, and commit you to Him who\ncan alone make you perfect in every good work, with the earnest prayer\nthat he may cleanse and purify your heart, and lead you into the path of\nlife.\"\n\nIsabella turned to her mother, and large tears rolled down her cheeks as\nshe said, \"Mother, I feel the truth of what you say; I feel that I have\nbeen an ungrateful child; I have neglected my duty to you, to my father,\nsister, brothers, and friends; and I now see, for the first time, how\ngreatly I have been offending God. From him I will first seek\nforgiveness, through the atonement of Christ, and before him I will make\na solemn resolution to try, from this day, to subdue my sinful temper. I\nsay, I will promise to try; I dare not promise to do it: I fear I shall\nfall back many times; and perhaps before this day closes I shall have\nto repent of angry words and wicked feelings.\"\n\nMy young readers, if any of you are conscious of having the same fault\nthat Isabella determined to endeavor to correct, make with her now a\nresolution to pray, and strive against it, and go to your heavenly\nFather, and ask his assistance. Plead earnestly in the name of Christ\nfor the gift of the Holy Spirit.\n\nMrs. Gardner heard with gratitude the determination of her child, and\nleft her with an affectionate wish that her birth-day might pass\nhappily. When Isabella returned to her chamber she found upon her table\na large Bible. It was a birth-day gift from her parents, and beneath\nIsabella's name were written the words which stand on the title-page of\nthis book,--\"He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he\nthat ruleth his spirit, than he that taketh a city.\" Prov. xvi, 32.\n\nIsabella had two brothers, Edward and George: they were both younger\nthan herself. Mary, her only sister, was seventeen years old, and was a\nlovely example of gentleness and piety. She was not so quick as\nIsabella; but she had \"the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit,\" which\nis far more beautiful in the sight of God than the most brilliant\nworldly accomplishments. Her faults were controlled by Christian\nprinciple and self-denial; and an affectionate interest in the happiness\nof others marked her conduct.\n\nOn the morning of Isabella's birthday, Mary was busily employed in\narranging fresh flowers in the little parlor, and in trying to make\neverything look pleasant for her sister. The recollection of Isabella's\nunkindness to her the day before, while it grieved her kind heart, only\nmade her the more anxious to add to her happiness.\n\nThis was like many other summer days. Though it opened in sunshine, it\nclosed in clouds. At about twelve o'clock the bright light was darkened,\nand soon the heavy rain began to fall.\n\n\"How cross Isabella will be this afternoon!\" said Edward to his sister\nMary. \"I am sure I don't want to see her; she will be so angry because\nit rains.\"\n\n\"That is a very unkind remark, Edward,\" replied Mary, \"and shows a\nwrong state of feeling. I have not heard Isabella speak an angry word\nto-day; and instead of wishing to be out of her way, you ought to try to\ndo all that you can to make up to her for the disappointment she will\nfeel at not seeing her young friends.\"\n\n\"You are right, sister Mary,\" said Edward: \"in judging Isabella I was\ncommitting the same sin myself; and I thank you for correcting me. I\nwill try to make my sister happy; but I do hope that as she grows older\nshe will become more amiable, and do to others as she would have them do\nto her.\"\n\nAt this moment Isabella entered the room. There was no blue sky to be\nseen, nor any prospect of fair weather.\n\n\"I am sorry that your friends will not be able to come this afternoon,\nIsabella,\" said Mary; \"but we will all try to make the evening of your\nbirth-day pass pleasantly; and when our father comes home, I am sure he\nwill read to us in any book you wish.\"\n\nIsabella thanked her sister, and said she thought she deserved the\ndisappointment.\n\nAfter tea Mr. Gardner read a very interesting book to his children. They\nlistened with pleasure, and had a happy evening; and when they knelt in\nfamily devotion, Isabella deeply felt her father's petition, that as his\nchildren grew in years, they might, like their divine Master, \"grow in\nfavor with God and man.\" She went to bed that night with a cheerful\nheart, rejoicing that she had been able to keep her resolution for one\nday. \"I give God thanks,\" said she, \"that his grace has been sufficient\nfor this purpose.\"\n\nOne afternoon Isabella asked her sister Mary to go with her to see their\ncousins, who lived about half a mile from their father's house. Mary\ntold her that she would be glad to go with her on any other day, but\nthat she was engaged that afternoon, to visit her Sunday-school\nchildren. Mary had been a Sunday-school teacher but a short time, and\nshe was deeply interested in the sacred work. Isabella had set her heart\nupon going to see her cousins, and doubted not that Mary would have been\nready to go with her. She was disappointed; and, forgetting herself,\nshe told Mary that she thought she was very unkind, and that she had\nbetter oblige her sister, than go and see children that did not care\nanything about her. Isabella spoke angrily, and looked displeased. One\nmoment after she remembered her resolution; but she was then too proud\nto confess her fault.\n\nMary made no reply, but soon went out upon her errand of love. The faces\nof the little children brightened with pleasure as she entered their\ndoors. \"Dear Miss Mary,\" said one little blue-eyed girl, \"I have learned\nmy verse in the Bible every morning, as you said I must; and to-morrow I\nshall say to you seven verses out of the second chapter of Matthew,\nabout the birth of Jesus Christ in Bethlehem, of Judea.\"\n\n\"And I,\" said her little sister, \"have learned my hymn, about 'little\nchildren, love each other;' and I have tried to love brother John, and\nto be kind to sister Susan, as you said was right.\"\n\n\"Does no one but I say that you must love your brothers and sisters,\nNancy?\" said Mary.\n\n\"O yes,\" said Nancy; \"our Lord Jesus Christ says so; and he says we\ncannot be his children unless we love one another. I think of that\nsometimes, but sister Susan thinks of it much oftener than I do; and\nwhen John and I get angry in our play, or speak cross to any one at\nschool, she will come, and say so sweetly, 'Little children, love each\nother.'\"\n\nMary told Nancy to remember her hymn at all times, and to be early at\nSunday school the next morning, to say it to her.\n\nMary found one of her scholars sick,--a little girl, named Sarah, who on\nthe Sunday before was as bright and as well as any child in school. Now\nher hands were burning with fever, and her large dark eyes were dim with\ndisease. Once they brightened a little when Mary spoke to her of her\nclass, but she soon turned over her little head, and sunk into an uneasy\nsleep. Her Testament was by her bedside, and her mother said that her\nlast effort, before she was taken ill, was to learn her Sunday lesson.\nMary watched by her all the afternoon: she lifted her aching head, and\nspread under it the cool pillows: she bathed her burning temples, and\ngently fanned her; and when, she gave the medicine, she silently prayed\nthat the means used for her recovery might be blessed. Sarah did not\nspeak, but when she opened her eyes she looked pleased that Mary was\nbeside her. She remained with the little sufferer until her brother came\nfor her in the evening, and promised to return the next day.\n\nIsabella had gone to her room before Mary got home. She did not like to\nmeet her; for the unpleasant feelings had not left her bosom, though she\nsincerely regretted her impatience. Pride now prevented her\nacknowledging her fault. When alone, she took her Bible, and sat down to\nread our Saviour's sermon on the mount. As the sacred precepts, one\nafter another, met her eye, she felt serious and humble. When she came\nto the verse, \"If thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there\nrememberest that thy brother hath aught against thee; leave there thy\ngift before the altar, and go thy way: first be reconciled to thy\nbrother, and then come and offer thy gift;\" she felt that Jesus Christ\nhad spoken these words directly to her. She had often read them before,\nbut never until this moment had they reached her heart.\n\n\"What gift have I to lay upon God's altar?\" she said to herself: \"prayer\nis my only offering; one that I am now about to present. Will God accept\nit while I am angry with my sister? O no! I will go this moment to her,\nand confess my fault, and ask her forgiveness. I will first be\nreconciled, and then come and offer my gift.\"\n\nShe went to Mary's room, and putting her arms around her neck, she said,\n\"Dear sister, I cannot ask God to forgive me my trespasses this night\nuntil I have told you how sorry I am that I treated you so unkindly this\nafternoon. You are a good, affectionate sister to me, and I am very\nungrateful. Will you forgive me? I will try to check my impatient\nfeelings in future, and I hope to try in better strength than my own.\"\n\n\"I am quite ready to forgive you,\" said Mary, affectionately: \"the\noffense to me is but a trifle; it is not that I regret. It is the sin we\ncommit against God, when we give way to improper feelings of any kind,\nwe should mourn over. He has commanded us to be patient and forgiving;\nand it makes me sad to think how often we grieve his Holy Spirit by\ndoing what we know is wrong.\"\n\n\"It is a source of daily sorrow to me,\" replied Isabella, \"that I cannot\ncultivate the temper of mind which is pleasing to God and man.\"\n\n\"I have rejoiced lately, dear Isabella, to see you bear many little\ndisappointments patiently; and until yesterday I have scarcely heard a\nhasty word from you for some time. I hope you will persevere, and that\nwe shall both of us grow better as we grow older.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Isabella, \"I have endeavored lately to subdue my evil\ntemper, which is the source of so much trouble to me, I had hoped that I\nhad in some degree succeeded, for many a time when I have felt an angry\npassion rising, I have tried to lift up my heart to God, and to say,\n'Lord, give me strength to resist this temptation;' but to-day I have\ngone very far back, and how can I be forgiven for thus breaking the\nsolemn resolution I made on my birth-day?\"\n\n\"Do not say so, Isabella. Humbly confess your fault before God: he will\nforgive you according to his promise through Christ Jesus, and encourage\nyou in your renewed efforts. God seeth not as man seeth: he knows how\nfrail and weak we are, and he sees every penitent tear, and rejoices\nover every effort we make to overcome besetting sins. Our Lord Jesus\nChrist should be our example of forbearance. No angry words were ever\nheard from him, and he is not willing to hear them from those who call\nthemselves his followers. Let us pray, my dear sister, 'that the same\nmind may be in us that was also in Christ Jesus.'\"\n\n\"I hear kind instructive words from you, my dear sister, and from my\nparents, teachers, and other friends, and I hope they will not be lost\nupon me. The Bible is much dearer to me now than it once was, and I find\nthere simple directions for every duty. Formerly when I read my\nSaviour's words, if I applied them at all, it was to somebody else\nrather than myself; but now I begin to feel that I need his blessed\ncounsels more than anybody.\"\n\n\"I am thankful, Isabella, to hear you speak so of the Bible. May it be a\nlamp unto the feet and a light unto the path, of us both; then our\nfootsteps will not slip, and we shall be faithful children, sisters, and\nfriends. Jesus Christ came to this world to save us from the power as\nwell as the punishment of sin; and his gospel must purify our hearts,\nand correct our daily faults, or it will do us no good.\"\n\nIsabella listened attentively to her sister's words. She felt their\nvalue, for she saw how faithfully Mary practiced what she taught.\n\n\"Good night, dear sister,\" said Isabella: \"may the humbling recollection\nof to-day's failure strengthen me in my efforts to keep my resolution.\"\n\nAs week after week passed by, Isabella Gardner met new difficulties to\noppose her resolution; but though often cast down, she gained strength\nevery day.\n\nHer trials at her day-school were very great, for her school-fellows did\nnot know how she was endeavoring to correct her great fault; and they\nwould often avoid her company in their walks and amusements, knowing how\nshe formerly made them unhappy by her caprices. She bore all this\npatiently, and would leave her companions immediately when anything was\nsaid or done that displeased her; and by going away by herself she was\nprevented from making a hasty reply, and had time to reflect and gather\nstrength for future trials.\n\nIt was hard for Isabella to \"cease to do evil,\" and harder still for her\nto \"learn to do well;\" and it would fill a much larger book than this,\nwere I to tell you of all the difficulties she met with in trying to\n\"put on the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit.\"\n\nBut God was near. He saw her efforts and her failures, and he saw that\nhis correcting hand must be stretched forth to finish the good work\nwhich he had begun. He sent sickness upon her, and the lately blooming\nIsabella was laid low upon the bed of pain. It was then she was called\nupon to \"let patience have its perfect work.\"\n\nWhen Isabella heard her physician say that she would probably be ill for\na long time, she thought of her resolution, and feared that she would be\nunable to keep it when there was so much pain to bear, and so much\nmedicine to be taken. Then the solemn thought came that death might be\nvery near, and that she might have but a little time left to correct her\nfault; and she determined to pray for patience, and to be particularly\nwatchful over herself.\n\n\"I have indulged my old habit of fretfulness a good deal to-day,\nmother,\" she said, as Mrs. Gardner sat down by her side, after making\neverything ready for the night. \"I fear I shall never correct it; but I\ndid not think of this sick bed when I made my resolution.\"\n\n\"Has not God promised to be 'about your bed, and about your path,' my\ndear child?\" said Mrs. Gardner.\n\n\"Yes, mother; and could I but remember his presence, I should not so\noften grieve you by my impatience.\"\n\n\"You must not talk any more tonight, Isabella,\" said her mother\naffectionately; \"but try to go to sleep, and remember that God is always\nnear you, and that his Holy Spirit is more grieved than even your mother\nby any disobedience to his commands. I love you, and forgive you. Now go\nto sleep, and may you awake refreshed in body and soul.\"\n\nMary nursed her sister night and day, and never left her except when\nMrs. Gardner insisted upon her going away to rest herself. Isabella was\noften impatient toward her, but Mary quietly went on treating her with\nmore and more tenderness. She scarcely spoke, but humbly and silently\nwent on doing everything a sister's love could suggest.\n\n\"I wish you would speak cross to me sometimes,\" said Isabella to her\none day, \"and then I should not feel so sorry after I had been unkind\nto you; but you are so patient and good, that it makes me quite ashamed\nof my fretfulness.\"\n\n\"I will do anything for you but that, Isabella,\" said Mary; \"but it is\nmy constant prayer that my Saviour may grant me the temper of mind that\nbecometh his disciple, and that I may 'sin not with my lips' against\nhim.\"\n\nIsabella became rapidly worse, and the sorrowful countenance of her\nfather, and the anxious tenderness of her mother, showed how dear their\nerring child was to their hearts.\n\nEdward would come home early from school to know how his sister was, and\nto see if there was anything he could do for her; and the merry voice of\nlittle George was still, and no one heard the sound of his ball or top.\n\nIt was a house of sadness, but of composure,--a house of Christian\nsorrow! Trouble had entered it; but its inmates felt that the trouble\ncame from a Father's hand, and that they should have no more than He who\nknew them best, and loved them best, saw was for their good. They felt\ntheir Saviour's presence, and rested upon his words, \"My grace is\nsufficient for thee.\"\n\nBut this sickness was not unto death: God raised Isabella from her bed\nof pain to glorify him by the holy obedience of her life. To the eye of\nman there was much yet to be done; but her heart was humbled, and her\npride subdued; and He who knew all her weakness, saw that she would\npersevere, and that his chastisement had answered the purpose for which\nit had been sent.\n\nAs Isabella began to recover, the confinement to her room, and her\nextreme weakness, were rather more difficult to bear than her sickness.\nShe was, however, mild and very thoughtful, and she would sit sometimes\nfor an hour in the easy chair, with her face covered with her hands.\n\nOne evening she asked her mother if she had seen her show a wrong spirit\nduring the day.\n\n\"I have not,\" said Mrs. Gardner.\n\n\"I am glad of it,\" said Isabella: \"I have been trying to be faithful to\nmyself, and I rejoice that one day has passed at the close of which my\nmother can give me a smile of approbation. I have been looking back upon\nthis long sickness, and I fear I have not improved as I ought: I must\nbegin in earnest now, relying upon divine assistance.\"\n\nIt was a happy morning in Mr. Gardner's family when Isabella once more\ntook her usual seat at the breakfast table. She was pale and thin: the\nglow of health had left her cheeks; but there was an expression there\nthat showed the better health of the soul. The grateful child joined the\nfamily group at breakfast with a prayer that she might never again\ndisturb its harmony.\n\nBut little time had passed before her school companions found that she\nwas \"renewed in the spirit of her mind.\" They found her ready to forgive\nthose who injured her, willing to oblige others, and to be pleased\nherself. They soon began to love her much; for her bright, active mind,\nmade her a delightful companion; and it was not long before Isabella\nGardner was one of the most pleasing and best-esteemed girls in school.\n\nThe beautiful summer had passed, and the solemn autumn. The green fields\nhad given their rich crops to the farmers, making glad their hearts with\nan abundance of good things. In short, winter had come, and was nearly\ngone.\n\nAt the close of a cold day the family of Mr. Gardner were sitting by\ntheir comfortable fire. \"I have been thinking,\" said little George, as\nhe looked into the bright fire, \"how good sister Isabella has grown\nlately. She has not spoken a cross word to me since I can remember; and\ncousin Emily Gray says she would rather come to see her than anybody,\nnow that she is so kind and obliging.\"\n\nMr. Gardner tried, by a serious look and shake of the head, to make\nlittle George understand that he did not like his remarks; but George\ndid not see him, and went on to say that he should like to know how\nIsabella had managed to grow so good.\n\n\"I see your kindness, dear father,\" said Isabella, \"in wishing George to\nbe silent lest he should hurt my feelings; but you need not shake your\nhead at him, for I am quite willing that he should say what he thinks. I\nhave noticed how carefully you and mother have avoided speaking of my\nfaults; but I have known by your silent kindness that you have seen and\napproved of my efforts to overcome them. I have done but little; but I\nhope by perseverance to become more worthy to be your child.\n\n\"You say, George, that I have grown better, and wonder what has made me\nso. I will tell you, my dear brother. My mother's counsels and prayers\nfirst directed me to the source of all strength,--to God, and his holy\nword. I had neglected her wishes, and showed disrespect to her\nauthority; and in sorrow, but in much love, she committed me to the care\nof my heavenly Parent. She led me to Jesus, who was meek and lowly in\nheart. From him I have sought dayly, hourly help, and to him let all the\npraise be given, if I have succeeded at all in subduing my unruly\ntemper. My long sickness, last autumn, brought me to feel my great\nweakness and entire dependence upon God, and gave me time for\nreflection. The patient kindness of my friends humbled me also; for I\nfelt how little I deserved it; and I resolved anew, that if my life was\nspared, I would be a better child in future. But I have much yet to do,\nand the constant effort that I am obliged to make, to conquer this one\nfault, is enough to keep me humble.\"\n\n\"I don't quite understand all that you have said, Isabella,\" replied\nGeorge; \"but I know it is much like what father and mother have often\ntold me, that when I don't know exactly how to do right, I must go to\nGod, and he will always direct me.\"\n\n\"I can scarcely tell you, George, how much happier I am now than I used\nto be. I wish I could tell you and every friend I have. My disrespect to\nmy father and mother caused me many a bitter tear, while my unkindness\nto my brothers and sisters made my dayly life unhappy; and after my\nangry disputes with my school-fellows, I was left in a troubled state of\nmind, vexed with myself and them. Now, with all my strivings and\nfailures, I have much peace; and I believe every one will have it just\nin proportion as he or she obeys the commandment of the Lord Jesus\nChrist, 'Love one another.'\"\n\nMr. Gardner embraced his child, and when again they knelt in evening\ndevotion, he prayed that love to God and man might reign in the bosom of\neach of his family, that when they were called from this world of trial\nand temptation, they might all meet in those blessed regions where all\nis love, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Why am I so happy this morning?\" said Isabella Gardner, as she arose\nfrom her bed, just one year after the day on which this little history\nof her trials commenced: \"because, through the grace of God, I have, in\nsome degree, subdued my sinful and unruly temper.\"\n\n\n\n\n  YOUTHFUL TEMPTATIONS.\n\n  Many a snare and temptation, young friend,\n    Will often obtrude in your way,\n  And constantly every footstep attend,\n    And threaten to lead you astray.\n\n  Perhaps you'll be tempted to hazard a lie,\n    Some trivial fault to conceal;\n  But remember that God, the all-seeing, is nigh\n\n### Summary:\n\n"}

I\ndetermined that my visit to England should bring me face to face with\nthe people; that I should converse with the artizan in his workshop, and\nlifting the lowly door-latches of the poor, should become intimately\nacquainted with their life--with their manners, and it might be, with\ntheir hopes and sorrows.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTUESDAY, JULY 21st, 1846.--After a quiet cosy breakfast, served up on a\nlittle round table for myself alone, I sat down to test the\npracticability of the plan I had formed at home for my peregrinations in\nEngland:--_viz._, to write until one, P.M., then to take my staff and\ntravel on, eight or ten miles, to another convenient stopping-place for\nthe night. As much depended upon the success of the experiment, I was\ndetermined to carry the point against the predictions of my friends. So\nat it I went, _con amore_. The house was as quiet as if a profound\nSabbath was resting upon it, and the windows of my airy chamber looked\nthrough the foliage of grave elms down upon a green valley. I got on\nswimmingly; and after a frugal dinner at the little round table, I\nbuckled on my knapsack with a feeling of self-gratulation in view of the\nliterary part of my day's work. Having paid my bill, and given the lady\na copy of my corn-meal receipts, I resumed my walk toward W----.\n\nI was suddenly diverted from my contemplation of this magnificent\nscenery, by a fall of heavy rain drops, as the prelude of an impending\nshower. Seeing a gate open, and hearing a familiar clicking behind the\nhedge, I stepped through into a little blacksmith's shop, about as large\nan American smoke-house for curing bacon. The first object that my eyes\nrested on, was a full-grown man nine years of age, and nearly three feet\nhigh, perched upon a stone of half that height, to raise his breast to\nthe level of his father's anvil, at which he was at work, with all the\nvigor of his little short arms, making nails. I say, a _full-grown_ man;\nfor I fear he can never grow any larger, physically or mentally. As I\nput my hand on his shoulders in a familiar way, to make myself at home\nwith him, and to remove the timidity with which my sudden appearance\nseemed to inspire him, by a pleasant word or two of greeting, his flesh\nfelt case-hardened into all the induration of toiling manhood, and as\nunsusceptible of growth as the anvil block. Fixed manhood had set in\nupon him in the greenness of his youth; and there he was, by his\nfather's side, a stinted, premature _man_ with his childhood cut off;\nwith no space to grow in between the cradle and the anvil-block; chased,\nas soon as he could stand on his little legs, from the hearth-stone to\nthe forge-stone, by iron necessity, that would not let him stop long\nenough to pick up a letter of the English alphabet on the way. O, Lord\nJohn Russell! think of this. Of this Englishman's son, placed by his\nmother, scarcely weaned, on a high, cold stone, barefooted, before the\nanvil; there to harden, sear, and blister his young hands by heating and\nhammering ragged nailrods, for the sustenance those breasts can no\nlonger supply! Lord John! look at those nails, as they lie hissing on\nthe block. Know you their meaning, use and language? Please your\nlordship, let me tell you--I have made nails many a day and many a\nnight--_they are iron exclamation points_, which this unlettered,\ndwarfed boy is unconsciously arraying against you, against the British\ngovernment, and the government of British literature, for cutting him\noff without a letter of the English alphabet, when printing is done by\nsteam; for incarcerating him for no sin on his parents' side, but\npoverty, in a dark, six-by-eight prison of hard labor, a _youthless_\nbeing--think of it!--an infant hardened, almost in its mother's arms,\ninto a man, by toil that bows the sturdiest of the world's laborers who\ncome to manhood through the intervening years of childhood!\n\nThe boy's father was at work with his back toward me, when I entered. At\nmy first word of salutation to the lad, he turned around and accosted me\na little bashfully, as if unaccustomed to the sight of strangers in that\nplace, or reluctant to let them into the scene and secret of his\npoverty. I sat down upon one end of his nail-bench, and told him I was\nan American blacksmith by trade, and that I had come in to see how he\ngot on in the world; whether he was earning pretty good wages at his\nbusiness, so that he could live comfortably, and send his children to\nschool. As I said this, I glanced inquiringly toward the boy, who was\nlooking steadily at me from his stone stool by the anvil. Two or three\nlittle crock-faced girls, from two to five years of age, had stolen in\ntimidly, and a couple of young, frightened eyes were peering over the\ndoor-sill at me. The poor Englishman--he was as much an Englishman as\nthe Duke of Wellington--looked at his bushy-headed, barefooted children,\nand said softly, with a melancholy shake of the head, that the times\nwere rather hard with him. It troubled his heart, and many hours of the\nnight he had been kept awake by the thought of it, that he could not\nsend his children to school, nor teach them himself to read. They were\ngood children, he said, with a moist yearning in his eyes; they were all\nthe wealth he had, and he loved them the more, the harder he had to work\nfor them. The poorest part of the poverty that was on him, was that he\ncould not give his children the letters. They were good children, for\nall the crock of the shop was on their faces, and their fingers were\nbent like eagle's claws with handling nails. He had been a poor man all\nhis days, and he knew his children would be poor all their days, and\npoorer than he, if the nail business should continue to grow worse. If\nhe could only give them the letters, it would make them the like of\nrich; for then they could read the Testament. He could read the\nTestament a little, for he had learned the letters by the forge-light.\nIt was a good book, was the Testament; and he was sure it was made for\nnailers and such like. It helped him wonderfully when the loaf was small\non his table, He had but little time to read it when the sun was up, and\nit took him loner to read a little, for he learned the letters when he\nwas old. But he laid it beside his dish at dinner time, and fed his\nheart with it, while his children were eating the bread that fell to his\nshare. And when he had spelt out a line of the shortest words, he read\nthem aloud, and his eldest boy--the one on the block there--could say\nseveral whole verses he had learned in this way. It was a great comfort\nto him, to think that James could take into his heart so many verses of\nthe Testament which he could not read. He intended to teach all his\nchildren in this way. It was all he could do for them; and this he had\nto do at meal-times; for all the other hours he had to be at the anvil.\nThe nailing business was growing harder, he was growing old, and his\nfamily large. _He had to work from four o'clock in the morning till ten\no'clock at night, to earn eighteen-pence._ His wages averaged only about\n_seven shillings a week_; and there were five of them in the family to\nlive on what they could earn. It was hard to make up the loss of an\nhour. Not one of their hands, however little, could be spared. Jemmy was\ngoing on nine years of age, and a helpful lad he was; and the poor man\nlooked at him doatingly. Jemmy could work off a thousand nails a day, of\nthe smallest size. The rent of their little shop, tenement and garden,\nwas five pounds a year; and a few pennies earned by the youngest of them\nwere of great account.\n\nBut, continued the blacksmith, speaking cheerily, I am not the one that\nought to complain. Many is the man that has a harder lot of it than I,\namong the nailers along this hill and in the valley. My neighbor in the\nnext door could tell you something about labor you never have heard the\nlike of in your country. He is an older man than I, and there are seven\nof them in his family; and, for all that, he has no boy like Jemmy here\nto help him. Some of his little girls are sickly, and their mother is\nnot over strong, and it all comes on him. He is an oldish man, as I was\nsaying, yet he not only works eighteen hours every day at his forge, but\n_every Friday in the year he works all night long_, and never lays off\nhis clothes till late of Saturday night. A good neighbor is John\nStubbins, and the only man just in our neighborhood who can read the\nnewspaper. It is not often he gets a newspaper; for it is not the like\nof us that can have newspapers and bread too at the same time in our\nhouses. But now and then he begs an old one, partly torn, at the\nbaker's, and reads it to us of a Sunday night. So once in two or three\nweeks, we hear something of what is going on in the world--something\nabout Corn Laws, and the Duke of Wellington, and Oregon, and India, and\nIreland, and other parts of England. We heard tell a while ago that the\npoor people would not have to make so many nails for a loaf of bread\nmuch longer, because Sir Robert Peel and some other men were going to\ntake off the port-locks and other taxes, and let us buy bread of them\nthat could sell it the cheapest. When we heard this talked of, without\nknowing the truth of it, John Stubbins took a penny and went to the\nWhite Hart and bought a drink of beer, and then the landlady let him\nlook into the newspaper which she keeps for her customers. When he came\nback, he told us a good deal of what was going on, and said he was sure\nthe times would be better one of these days.\n\nHere he was interrupted by John Stubbins himself, who, hearing some\nstrange voices mingling in earnest conversation in the other end of the\nbuilding, came round to see who was there. With the entrance of this\nJohn Stubbins, I must turn over another leaf of my journal.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\nSECOND VISIT TO THE LITTLE NAILER.\n\nThe interest created in the United States by the above account of my\nfirst meeting with Josiah, encouraged me to propose that the children of\nAmerica should, by a subscription of a half dime each, contribute as\nmuch money as would clothe and educate him for a year. The proposition\nmet with a cordial response, and one hundred dollars were soon collected\nfor this purpose.\n\nAt the time I first threw out the proposition in regard to the education\nof the little Nailer, I hardly believed that they could so abolish space\nand dry up the ocean intervening between them and such a young sufferer,\nas they have done. Bless your hearts, children, I reckoned you would\nhave a merry time of it about Christmas, and have your pockets filled\nwith all sorts of nice things, that would come by way of affectionate\nremembrance from grand-papa down to the fourth cousin; and you would\nbring to mind lots of boys and girls that had no one to give them a\npicture-book as large as a cent, and who couldn't read it if they had\none. I thought this would be a good time to put in a word for \"The\nLittle Nailer;\" and so I threw out the thought, very hopefully, that you\nshould all contribute something from your Christmas presents and make\nthe little fellow a Christmas gift of a year's schooling. I suggested\nthis idea between doubt and hope. I did not know how it would strike\nyou. I did not know but some of you might think that the great ocean was\ntoo wide to be crossed by your little charities; that others might say,\n\"He is only an _English_ boy--he doesn't belong to our family\ncircle--let him alone,\" And so I waited anxiously to hear from you; for\nI was sure you would talk it over among yourselves in the \"School-room,\"\nand on the way home, and by the fireside. Well, after waiting a few\nweeks, the English steamer came in from Boston, and brought me a letter\nfrom Ezekiel; and the happiest thing in it was, that the boys and girls\nof \"Our School Room\" had made no more of the Atlantic Ocean than if it\nhad been a mud-puddle, which they could step across to give a helping\nhand to a lad who was down and couldn't get up alone. It made my heart\nget up in my mouth and try to talk instead of my tongue, when I read to\nsome of my friends here what you had done for the little Nailer; when I\ntold them to read for themselves and see that your sympathies knew\nnothing about any geography, any more than if the science of natural\ndivisions had never been discovered, or if oceans, seas, rivers or\nmountains, or any such terms as _American, English_ or _African,_ were\nnot to be found in the Dictionary. The letter stated that ONE HUNDRED\nAND SIXTY half-dimes had already come in, from children all over the\ncountry, to pay the schoolmaster for teaching the little English nailer\nto read in the Testament, and to write a legible hand. Nor was this\nall.--Ezekiel said that there was no telling how many more half-dimes\nwould come in; for not only had the children of our own \"School-Room\"\ntaken up the matter, but those of other school-rooms, especially away\ndown in Maine, were determined to have some share in fitting out the\nnailer-boy with an education sufficient to make a man of him, if he will\nuse it aright. I saw it clear that the little fellow was to be put to\nschool; that his hammer was to lie silent on the anvil for the space of\none cold winter; and that the young folks in America would foot the\nbill. And I was determined that this should be a Christmas gift to him,\nthat he and his young American benefactors might enjoy it together. So\ntwo days before Christmas, I started from Birmingham on foot to carry\nthe present to him.\n\nIt was a bright, frosty morning, and, after a walk of twelve miles, I\ncame in sight of the little brick cottage of the nailer by the wayside.\nI approached it with mingled emotions of solicitude. Perhaps it had been\nvacated by the poor man and his family, and some other nailer had taken\nhis place. Perhaps the hand that spares neither rich nor poor had been\nthere, and I should miss the boy at the anvil. I stopped once or twice\nto listen. The windows were open, but all was still. There was no\nclicking of hammers, nor blowing of bellows, to indicate that the nailer\nfamily were still its occupants. I began to fear that they were gone,\nand my imagination ran rapidly over a hundred casualties and changes\nwhich might have come upon them. The same gate was open that invited me\nto enter last summer; and as I passed through it, I met a woman who said\nthe nailer was at dinner in the family apartment of the building. She\nwent in before me, and the next moment I was in the midst of the circle\nof my old acquaintance, who had just risen from the table and were\nsitting around the fire. My sudden appearance in their midst seemed to\ncause as much pleasure as surprise. The father arose and welcomed me\nwith the heartfelt expressions of good-will. Little Josiah, the hero of\nmy story, came forward timidly with a sunny token of recognition\nbrightening up his black, sharp eyes. The mother, a tidy, interesting\nlooking woman in a clean, white cap, added her welcome; and I sat down\nwith them, with Josiah standing between my knees, and told them my\nstory--how some children in America had interested themselves in their\nboy--how they had thought of him on their way to school, and talked of\nhim on their way home, and in the parlor, and the kitchen and the\ncottage;--how they had contributed their pennies, which they had saved\nor earned, to send Josiah to school to learn to read the Testament; and\nhow I had come to bring them, and to ask if the boy could be spared from\nthe anvil. I glanced around upon the group of children, whose eager eyes\nindicated that they partially comprehended my errand, and then at a\ncouple of sides of bacon suspended over my head. The nailer's eyes\nfollowed my own, and as they reciprocally rested on the bacon, he\ncommenced his reply from that end of the subject. He said it was true\nthat many were worse off than he, and many were the comforts he had,\nthat thousands of the poor knew nothing of. Here he glanced\naffectionately at his children; but my eyes brought him back to the\nbacon, and so he went on, apparently under a new impression of his\nresources of comfort. He said he had to sell some of his goods to buy\nthe pig when very small, and had \"_luggled_\" along with some difficulty\nto feed and fatten him into a respectable size. Yes, he was a pretty\nclever pig; nor was that all--the nailing business had become better,\nby a half-penny a thousand, than when I was with them in the summer;\nand Josiah could now earn ninepence a day. He wanted to send all his\nchildren to school; if they could not read, they would be poor, even if\nthey should come to own parks and carriages, he could not bear to see\nthem growing up with no books in their hands. He worked long at the\nanvil as it was; and he was willing to work longer and harder to pay the\nschoolmaster for teaching his children to read. Josiah was now ten years\nold; he had been a faithful boy; he had made nails ever since he could\nhold a hammer; and it was for this that he desired the more to send him\nto school. It had troubled him much all along that the boy was working\nso long and so well at the anvil, without having any of his wages to pay\nthe schoolmaster for teaching him something that would make him rich in\nhis poverty when he came to be a man; and he had tried to make up this\nto him in a little way, by reading to him easy verses from the\nTestament, many of which he had learned by heart. Besides this, he had\nbought a little picture-reading-book, since I was with them last, and\nJosiah could master many easy words in it; for he had learned almost all\nthe letters. But he knew this was a slow way of getting on, although he\nfeared it was the best he could do for him. He knew not how he could\nmanage to spare him for the winter. He had no other boy; there was a\nbaby in the cradle only a fortnight old, which made him five children\nunder ten years of age, to be fed, warmed and clothed through the\nwinter months. Here he fell into a calculation of this kind--he could\nnow earn nine shillings, or about two dollars and twenty cents, a week.\nHis coal cost him three shillings a week, and his house-rent two;\nleaving him but _four_ shillings a week for a family of seven persons to\nlive upon. Josiah's clothes were well nigh gone; they were indeed\nragged; there was nothing left to sew patches to; and all he had in the\nworld was on him, except a smock frock which he put on over them on the\nSabbath.\n\nThese considerations gave a thoughtful tone to the nailer's voice as\nthey came upon his mind, and a thoughtful air came over the family group\nwhen he had finished, and they all looked straitly into the fire as much\nas to say, \"It cannot be done.\" So I began at the bacon to soften down\nthese obstacles--there were nearly 150 pounds of it, besides a spare-rib\nhanging from another joist--and suggested how much better off they were\nthan ten thousands of poor people in the world. Could they ever spare\nJosiah better than during this winter? He would learn faster now than\nwhen he was older, and when they could not spare him so well. Nor was\nthis all; if they could get on without him for a few months, he might\nnot only learn to read without spelling, but he could teach his three\nlittle sisters to read during the winter nights, and the baby, too, as\nsoon as it could talk; so that sending him to school now, would be like\nsending all his children to the same school. Yes, it might be more than\nthis. Let him go for a few months, and when he came back to the anvil,\nhe might work all day, and in the evening he might get together all the\nnailer children that lived within a mile, and teach them how to read and\nwrite. There was the little Wesleyan chapel within a rod of their own\ndoor, lying useless except on Sundays. It would be just the place for an\nevening school for fifty or even a hundred little children, whose\nparents were too poor to send them to the day-schools of the town. And\nwouldn't they like to look in and see Josiah with his primer in hand\nteaching their neighbors' children to read in this way; with his clean\nsmock-frock on, setting copies in the writing-books of the little\nnailers? Josiah, who was standing between my knees, looking sharply into\nthe fire with his picture book in his hand, turned suddenly around at\nthis idea and fixed his eyes inquiringly upon my own. The thought\nvibrated through all the fine-strung sympathies of parental affection.\nThe mother leaned forward to part away the black hair from the boy's\nforehead, and said softly to his father, that she would take the lad's\nplace at the anvil, if they should want his wages while at school. This\nwas the crisis of my errand; and, in my imagination, I tried to catch\nthe eyes of the children in \"Our School Room\" in America, as I went on\nto say, that they would not be willing to have Josiah go to school in\nhis old worn out clothes, to be laughed at or shunned by well-dressed\nschool-mates; nor that he should stay at home for want of decent and\ncomfortable clothes. I knew what they would say, if they were with me;\nand so I offered to fit him out at the tailor's shop with a good\ncomfortable suit, as a part of the Christmas present from his young\nfriends on the other side of the ocean. The little ones were too timid\nto crow, but they looked as if they would when I was gone; and the\nnailer and his wife almost cried for joy at what the children of a\nfar-off land had done for their son. For myself, I only regretted that I\ncould not share at the moment with those young friends all the pleasure\nI felt in carrying out their wish and deed of beneficence. I hope it is\nnot the last time that I shall be associated with them in these little\nadventures of benevolence.\n\nPerhaps I have made too long a story of my second visit to the nailer's\ncottage. I will merely add, that it was agreed that I should proceed\ninto the town, a distance of a mile and a half, to make arrangements for\nthe boy's schooling, and be joined there by him and his father. So,\nbidding adieu to the remainder of the family, I continued my walk into\nthe town, of Bromsgrove, and soon found a kind-hearted school teacher\nwho agreed to take the lad and do his best to forward his education.\nHaving met several gentlemen in the course of my inquiries, they became\ninterested in the case, and went with me to the inn, where the lad and\nhis father were waiting for me. Thence we all proceeded to a clothing\nshop, where the little nailer was soon fitted with a warm and decent\nsuit. One of the company, a Baptist minister, to whose congregation the\nSchoolmaster belonged, promised to call in and see the boy occasionally,\nand to let me know how he gets on. I hope Josiah will soon be able to\nspeak for himself to the children in \"Our School Room.\" On Monday after\nChristmas, he made his first entry into any school-room, for the object\nof learning to read.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\nA BUDGET FROM THE LITTLE NAILER.\n\nThey have come! the long expected letters from \"Jemmy Stubbing,\" or the\nNailer Boy. I am sure they will be a treat to all the children that meet\nin our School-room. I hope all the benches will be full whilst Josiah's\nletters are read. And what a nice thing it was in the children in\nAmerica, to take that little fellow out of the cinders and soot of the\nblacksmith's shop, and send him to school for two years!\n\nNow many a little boy and girl of our school-room circle has contributed\nhalf a dime towards Josiah's education. I would ask that little boy or\ngirl what he or she would sell out all right and title to the pleasure\nand consequence of that act for? What would you take in money down for\nyour share in the work of expanding that little fellow's mind, and\nfilling it with such new ideas as he expresses in his letters? What a\nnew world he has lived in since he returned from school to his little\nwayside smithy, the roof of which can hardly be seen over the hedge!\nThink of it--but you cannot think of it as it is, unless you could see\nthat nailer's shop and cottage. But think of what he was, when you took\nhim from the anvil and sent him to school. Then he could not tell a\nletter of the alphabet, and never would have read a verse in the Bible,\nif it had not been for your half dimes. Now see with what delight he\nsearches the scriptures, and marks and commits to memory choice verses\nin that Holy Book. He has taught his father to read it too, and is\nteaching his sisters, and the children of the neighbors to read it, and\nall good books. A great many young boys and girls in England have heard\nwhat you did for him, and some of them are beginning to write to him,\nand he answers them, and gives them good advice. The last steamer from\nEngland brought us a nice lot of letters from him, some directed to you,\nsome to me, and one or two to others, I will read them to you in the\norder in which they are written.\n\n\n\n\n        BROMSGROVE LICKEY, Dec. 4, 1849.\n\n  My Dear Sir:\n\n  I thought that when I wrote to you again I\n  should have a few subscribers for the Citizen. I\n  will tell you the reason why I have not got them;\n  they are most all primitive methodists. They have\n  been trying to scheme them a chapel for this last\n  twelve months. They are having tea parties and\n  missionary meetings every two or three weeks, so\n  they have put me off a little longer. I had a good\n  deal on my mind through reading the Citizen. I\n  opened my bible at the forty-first chapter of Isaiah\n  and at the sixth and seventh verses. There I read\n  the following words: 'They helped everyone his\n  neighbor, and every one said to his brother, be of\n  good courage; so the carpenter encouraged the\n  goldsmith, and he that smootheth with the hammer\n  him that smote the anvil, saying, it is ready for the\n  sodering, and he fastened it with nails.' I thought\n  about Mr. Burritt's sparks. He has got a few in\n  England and France and America. I thought about\n  the Russians, if they would but examine this chapter\n  as well as I have, I think they would make away\n  with their arms, for the Lord says, them that war\n  against thee, they shall be as nothing and as a thing\n  of nought. How dare they go to war against their\n  Maker. I dare not. I have another word or two to\n  say to my young friends in America. The boys\n  and girls in England, they are forced to work very\n  hard all the week till about middle day on the Saturday,\n  and then they get a little time to play while\n  their parents go and sell their work. They frequently\n  come for me but I am very often forced to\n  deny them. I tell them that I have some reading\n  and writing to do. Reading and writing must be\n  seen to. If that apostle Paul had neglected his\n  reading and writing, that jailor would have never,\n  perhaps, seen need to have cried out, 'what must I\n  do to be saved,' or if Mr. Burritt had neglected his\n  reading and writing very likely I should never have\n  been able to read or write. Though you are in\n  America and I am in England if we put our heads\n  to work we dont know what we may do some day.\n  It does me good to read that there are so many ladies\n  engaged in the work. I have been asked several\n  times what was the price of the Citizen, but I have\n  not found that out yet. I dont know how you count\n  your money. I dont know how much a cent is.\n  The first three newspapers that I had, I paid five\n  pence each for; but now I get them for twopence\n  each. I keep at my old employment. I did not know\n  that there was any other country besides England\n  till I had the Citizen. While I am hammering away\n  with my two hammers my mind is flying all over\n  America and Africa and South Carolina and California\n  and Francisco and France and Ireland Scotland\n  and Wales, and then it comes back to Devonshire,\n  then to Mrs. Prideaux, and then to them ladies at\n  Bristol, and then to Mr. Fry at London, and what a\n  good man he is in the cause.\n\n  I remain your humble servant wish to be a fellow\n  laborer, heart and hand.\n\n                                     JOSIAH BANNER.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n        BROMSGROVE LICKEY, Dec. 28th, 1849.\n\n  MY DEAR SIR:\n\n  I have received your letter with two sovereigns\n  on Dec. 26. I dare say my young friends will look\n  for something very good from me, but nothing very\n  interesting for them at this time. I will tell you\n  the reason. The last week before Christmas I was\n  working late and early all the week, and at the\n  end of the week my foot and hand did ache very\n  much. In that week I received a letter of young\n  Mr. Fry, a little school boy, and a beautiful letter\n  it was. I have read it many a time to the boys and\n  girls and I had to write him one back again that\n  week, and a few days before I had to write one to\n  Mr. Coulton, Superintendent of the Sunday school\n  at Norwood. For this two or three last years, I have\n  made a practice in going a carol singing on Christmas\n  day in the morning and of course they looked\n  for me again. So I started out at five o'clock and\n  came home at nine, and then I went to school. I\n  have never missed going to school on a Sunday for\n  this last three years. I always like to be there to\n  teach or to be teached. Now I have got this present\n  in my hand, it leads me to the Scriptures; and at\n  the fifty eighth chapter of Isaiah and at the second\n  verse: \"Now they seek me daily and delight to\n  know my ways as\n\n### Summary:\n\n"}

I.\n\n\nCHARLES'S PROGRESS IN LEARNING.\n\nYou have heard a great deal about Charles in the Seeds of Useful\nKnowledge; perhaps you would like to hear a little more about him; for,\nas he was never tired of learning good things, I might fill many books,\nif I were to speak of every thing that his papa and mamma taught him.\nBut I dare say all the boys and girls who read this, have kind parents\nor friends who teach them, as well as Charles's papa and mamma taught\nhim; so I will only mention such things as they may not perhaps yet have\nheard.\n\nBut first of all, I must tell you what Charles has been doing, since you\nheard of him last. He was now a year older than he was then, and he was\nalso wiser, for he could write pretty well, and read without spelling\nthe long words; he knew the multiplication table, and the pence table\ntoo; and could do sums in multiplication without a mistake, when he took\npains; but sometimes, when he was careless, or in a hurry, the sums were\nwrong: however, I am happy to say that did not happen very often.\nBesides all these things, Charles learned grammar, and geography, and\ncould decline many Latin nouns; which was very well for a little boy not\nquite seven years old. But of all his lessons he liked geography best,\nhe liked to find out places in the maps, and to know whereabouts the\ndifferent countries were that he heard people talk of; and then his papa\nwas often kind to tell him amusing stories about the inhabitants of\nthose countries, and he also told him what things are brought from them:\nfor instance, Charles knew that tea grows in China, which is in Asia;\nand sugar in the West-Indies; that the rose-wood that his mamma's chairs\nand card tables were made of, grew in a country called Brazil in South\nAmerica; and that the raisins in the plum-pudding on Christmas day, were\ndried grapes, and came from Spain.\n\n\"Papa,\" said Charles one night, when he was, as usual, telling his papa\nwhat he had done in the course of the day,--\"I wish I might learn more\ngeography, instead of any grammar; I like it so much better: I like\ngeography very much, but I do not like grammar at all.\"\n\n\"What is your objection to grammar, Charles?\" said his papa.\n\n\"Oh, why--there is nothing amusing in it.\"\n\n\"And do you not think there is some other reason for learning, besides\nbeing amused?\"\n\n\"Yes; I think we learn that we may grow wise; but I don't want to leave\noff learning, papa; I only want to learn something else, instead of\ngrammar?\"\n\nMr. Barber laughed, and told Charles, that no other kind of knowledge\nwould be of much use to him without grammar, since nothing else would\nteach him to speak or write like a gentleman.\n\n\"Don't I speak like a gentleman now, papa?\"\n\n\"You speak pretty well for a little boy, my dear; but you often make\nmistakes, which we think nothing of now, because we know that when you\nhave learnt a little more grammar, you will know better; but if you were\nto make such mistakes when you are a man, you would be thought an\nignorant person, and not be treated with respect.\"\n\n\"Can you tell me of any mistakes I make now papa?\"\n\n[Illustration: LITTLE CHARLES LEARNING GEOGRAPHY.]\n\n\"Oh yes, I think I could very soon tell you of a great many. Just now,\nwhen you were standing at the window, I heard you say,--'There goes two\nwhite horses!' now that was a very great blunder, Charles.\"\n\n\"Was it, papa;--why?\"\n\n\"Because it showed that you did not know the difference between singular\nand plural.\"\n\n\"But I do know the difference--singular means one thing, and plural\nmeans more than one.\"\n\n\"Exactly, so now try to find out the blunder.\"\n\nCharles repeated the words two or three times, \"there goes two white\nhorses;\" but he could not find out what was wrong, and after puzzling\nfor a long while, he was obliged to give it up, and his papa\nsaid,--\"Suppose you had been talking about those horses before you saw\nthem go by, should you have said, 'there they goes?'\" \"No,\" said Charles.\n\n\"I should have said--'there they go.'\"\n\n\"And why should you have said so?\"\n\n\"Because it is not right to say--'there they goes'; nobody says so, but\nvery ignorant people indeed; I heard the butcher's boy say so one day;\nbut then, you know, he is a poor ignorant boy and I dare say has never\nlearnt any thing.\"\n\n\"How did you know that he was an ignorant boy, Charles?\"\n\n\"I knew it by his speaking wrong, papa.\"\n\n\"Then you see it was true what I told you that if you speak wrong,\npeople will directly think you are an ignorant person, as you thought\nthe butcher's boy.\"\n\n\"But I should never say, 'there they goes,'\" said Charles, \"I know\nbetter than that.\"\n\n\"Ah, Charles,\" said his papa, \"you must learn a little more grammar, and\nthen you will know that you made exactly the same blunder as the\nbutcher's boy, when you said, 'there _goes_ two white horses,' you\nshould have said, 'there _go_ two white horses.'\"\n\n\"Should I? I did not know that,\" said Charles.\n\n\"Which shews how necessary it is, that you should learn grammar, my\nboy, and then you will know that go is plural, and goes is singular, so\nthat if you are speaking of more than one horse, it is proper to say go,\nbecause we say, 'they go;' but if you are speaking of only one, it is\nproper to say goes, because we should say, 'he goes.'\"\n\n\"Thank you, papa, I think I shall remember that, and I will not wish to\nleave off grammar, for I see that geography would not teach me to speak\nproperly; and I should not like to be thought an ignorant man when I\ngrow up.\"\n\n\"I hope not, my dear, and I also hope there is no danger of such a\nmisfortune, for you have a great many years to learn in; and if you make\ngood use of them, you will know a great deal by the time you are\ntwenty.\"\n\n\"So I shall,\" said Charles, \"I will learn as much as I can every day.\"\n\n\"A very good resolution,\" said his papa; \"education is one of the best\nthings in the world. I will tell you an entertaining story on this very\nsubject.\"\n\n\"Do, papa, I should like to hear it very much; I am so fond of stories.\"\n\n\"But this is a true one, Charles, which makes it all the better. You\nhave seen in your map of America, a country called Peru?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Charles; \"I saw it this morning, when I was saying my\ngeography lesson to mamma; I had to say all the countries in South\nAmerica, and Peru was one of them.\"\n\n\"Well, this country was once governed by a king who was called an Inca,\nand his name was Atabalipa; but although he was a king, he knew neither\nhow to read nor write, for reading and writing were arts that were not\nknown in America at that time.\"\n\n\"What are arts, papa?\"\n\n\"Arts are those things which men have taught themselves to do by their\nown skill and invention; making tables and chairs, is an art; Printing\nis an art, and a very clever art it is; building is an art; and reading\nand writing are arts; but at the time I am speaking of, there were very\nfew arts known in America, for it was mostly inhabited by savages; and\neven in Peru, where they were not savages, they were quite ignorant;\nthey had no books, and would not have known how to read them if they\nhad, and they thought they were the only people in the world besides the\nsavages.\"\n\n\"Then, I dare say, they thought themselves very clever fellows,\" said\nCharles, \"for all they could not read or write; for you know, papa, if\nthey thought there was nobody in the world but them and the savages,\nthey would not know there were any people cleverer than themselves.\"\n\n\"No, I have no doubt they were quite satisfied with themselves, my dear,\nand not without reason, for they had taught themselves many useful\nthings; but at last they found out that there were people in the world\nwho were cleverer than they were as you shall hear. There was a Spanish\nsoldier, named Pizarro, who happened to hear that there was a great deal\nof gold and silver to be found in Peru; so he thought he would go there,\nand try if he could not make himself rich. Pizarro was a fierce, cruel\nman, but he had been brought up in total ignorance; for his mother was a\nvery poor woman, and could not afford to send him to school, therefore\nhe had never learned to read or write. However he could fight, and so he\ntook a number of other soldiers with him, and went to Peru, where the\npeople were so surprised at the sight of him and his men, who were not\nlike any men they had seen before, that they were afraid; therefore the\nSpaniards very easily conquered them, and robbed them of their gold, and\nat last took the Inca prisoner, and kept him confined in a small room,\nwhere he would have been very unhappy; but that he was very much amused,\nby observing how many things the Spaniards knew that he had never before\nheard of.\n\n\"He was astonished to see that they could tell the hour of the day by\ntheir watches, and thought the Europeans must be very wonderful people\nindeed, to make such clever things; but what pleased him more than all,\nwas the art of writing. He could not imagine how one person could know\nwhat another meant by looking at a few black marks, and he thought that\nmen who could do this, must be far superior to the Peruvians, and\ntherefore felt a respect even for the common soldiers who guarded him;\nfor he saw that they had more knowledge than he had, although a king.\n\n\"Now Pizarro was the general of the soldiers, and of course the greatest\nman among them; and he had also become very rich by conquering the\nPeruvians, and plundering their towns, that is, taking away all the gold\nand silver he found: and Atabalipa supposed that, as he was the chief of\nthe Spaniards, he must be the cleverest of them too; but one day he\nhappened to find out by accident, that Pizarro could neither read nor\nwrite, and this discovery made him think so meanly of his conqueror,\nthat from that moment he treated him with great contempt, saying that\nPizarro, though a general, could not be a person of any consequence in\nhis own country; since his common soldiers were better taught than\nhimself.\"\n\n\"Thank you, papa,\" said Charles, \"that is just such a story as I like,\nand I see that it is of no use to be rich and great, if we are not wise\nalso.\"\n\n[Illustration: THE AFRICAN TORN FROM HIS HOME BY WHITE-MAN.]\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. II.\n\n\nBLACK SLAVES.\n\nCharles used to go every fine day after his lessons were finished, to\nplay in the square gardens; and as all the other boys whose parents\nlived in the square went there too, he had several friends, and amongst\nthem one a little older than himself, named Peter Ross, whom he liked\nbetter than any of the rest.\n\nPeter was not an English boy, he was a West-Indian: his father and\nmother lived in Jamaica, but they had sent him to England to be\neducated, so he lived with his uncle in Euston-square, and went every\nday to the London University school. Charles was very fond of talking\nto Peter, because Peter told about the slaves that worked on his\nfather's plantations, for his father was a sugar planter, and had a\nlarge estate in Jamaica, so he was obliged to keep a great many <DW64>\nslaves, for all the plantations in the West-Indies, are cultivated by\n<DW64>s.\n\n\"I wish I had a slave,\" said Charles to his papa one evening, after he\nhad been playing with Peter. \"Do you know, papa, when Peter was at home\nin the West-Indies, he had a slave of his own, a black boy, to wait upon\nhim, and do every thing he wanted; and Peter was his master, and he was\nnot older, then, than I am. What a nice thing it must be to have a slave\nof one's own; I should get him to carry my kite, and my hoop and stick,\nwhen I don't want to bowl it, and mend my toys when I break them, and do\na great many things for me. He could move my rocking horse, and that\ngreat wooden box where I keep my bats and balls, for it is too heavy for\nme to lift myself, and I often want it moved: really a slave would be\nvery useful to me, papa.\"\n\nMr. Barker could not help laughing at Charles's idea of the usefulness\nof a slave, and asked him if he knew exactly what slaves were.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Charles; \"they are black people.\"\n\n\"A great many slaves are black, certainly,\" said his papa, \"but is not\nbeing black, that makes a man a slave, and there have been many\nunfortunate white people sold for slaves, as well as the poor blacks.\"\n\n\"Sold!\" said Charles, \"what, do they sell people, I never heard of that\nbefore.\"\n\n\"Then I will tell you now, my dear, and I think you will never again\nwish to have a slave. When America was first discovered, which is about\nthree hundred and fifty years ago, there were many gold mines found in\nthe West-Indies, all the mountains contained a vast quantity of gold,\nbut it was very hard work to dig for it, and the natives of the country,\nwho were savages, were not strong, and had never been used to work; so\nthat the Spaniards who had discovered the country, could not get as much\ngold as they wished, although they were cruel enough to force the poor\nsavages to work in the mines, and chained them together; that they might\nnot run away; poor creatures! they were much to be pitied, and numbers\nof them died every day, for they had not strength to bear such hard\nlabour. So when the Spaniards found that the Indians could not do as\nmuch work as they wanted done, they employed sailors to go to Africa and\nbring them a number of black men from that country; for they knew the\nAfricans were strong, and that they could make them work as hard as they\npleased.\"\n\n\"But why did the Africans go, papa?\" said Charles, whose eyes were full\nof tears at this sad tale. \"Why did they not send the sailors away\nagain, and say they would not go with them?\"\n\n\"They most likely would have done so,\" replied his papa; \"if they had\nknown how they would be treated; but the sailors said they would take\nthem to a fine country, where they would get plenty of food without any\ntrouble, and live much better than they did in their own country; so the\nsimple <DW64>s believed them, and went on board their ships; but they\nsoon found out how wrong they had been to trust these wicked men; for\nwhen they came to the place where they expected to be so happy, they\nwere all sold as if they had been beasts, instead of men, and sent to\nwork in the mines; where they led a very miserable life indeed, for the\ncruel masters who had bought them, did not care what they suffered, so\nlong as they got plenty of gold.\n\n\"This was the beginning of what is called the slave trade, and a\ndreadful trade it has been ever since; for when the captains of ships\nfound how much money the Spaniards would give for <DW64>s, they went\nagain to Africa; and when the black men refused to go with them, they\ntook them by force, and carried them on board the ships, where they\ntied them together, so that it was impossible for them to escape. You\nwould think it a very hard case, Charles, if you were walking by the sea\nshore, and two or three men were to come and carry you away by force to\na distant land, and sell you to somebody who would make you work hard\nfor him all the rest of your life, and consider you as much his\nproperty, as if he had bought a horse or a dog.\"\n\n\"But they would have no right to sell me,\" said Charles, \"I do not\nbelong to them.\"\n\n\"Neither do those poor Africans belong to the men who sell them; they\nhave as much right to be free and happy, as you or I have.\"\n\n\"Then how is it, papa, that Peter's father has slaves? he is an\nEnglishman.\"\n\n\"Yes, Charles, I am sorry to say, that Englishmen, as well as Spaniards,\nhave traded in slaves, for when some of the West-India islands came into\nthe possession of the English, they found the <DW64>s so useful, and\nmade so much money by their labour, that they forgot how unjust it was\nto keep them in slavery. However, I am happy to say, that a law is now\nin operation which will soon set all the slaves free. In a very short\ntime, the <DW64>s will be at liberty like other working men; and the\nmasters, instead of buying them, must hire them like servants, and pay\nthem wages; and they will be able to leave their master if he does not\ntreat them well, and get another place, as our servants do.\"\n\n\"Ah, how glad I am,\" said Charles, \"that will be a good thing for the\npoor blacks. I do not wish to have a slave now, papa; I would not have\none for the world. But Peter's father's slaves do not work in the gold\nmines, they make sugar: why is that?\"\n\n\"Because there are no gold mines now in the West-Indies worth working,\"\nsaid Mr. Barker; \"the Spaniards took care to get all the gold there was,\nbut people still make large fortunes there, by growing sugar; and there\nare still gold mines in other parts of America, where <DW64> slaves\nwork.\"\n\n\"How does sugar grow?\" enquired Charles.\n\n\"It is made from the juice of reeds, called sugar canes,\" said his\npapa.--\"A plantation of sugar canes is very pretty, they grow very high,\nand are of a beautiful gold colour, streaked with red; and at the top of\nthis yellow cane are long green leaves, which hang down round it: but\nthis is not all, for out of the midst of these leaves, there grows a\nlong stem, like a thin silver wand; and at the top of it, is something\nthat looks like a plume of white feathers, edged with lilac.\"\n\n\"Oh, how beautiful!\" exclaimed Charles:--\"I should like to go to the\nWest-Indies, if it was only to see a sugar plantation; but how do they\nget the sugar, papa?\"\n\n\"When the canes are ripe, Charles, the <DW64>s cut them down, and tie\nthem up in bundles, and carry them to a mill, where the juice is pressed\nout.\n\n\"This juice is boiled several times in large coppers, and the coarse\nparts separated from the fine, which at last dries into sugar. It is all\nbrown at first, or what you call moist sugar; but by mixing different\nthings with it, and boiling it again in a particular manner, they can\nmake lump sugar, and sugar candy; and this is done by the black slaves,\nwho have been dragged away from their own country to be sold to the\nplanters: so you see Charles, that even so simple a thing as a lump of\nsugar, is the cause of a vast deal of cruelty and injustice.\"\n\n[Illustration: Man (Drawing).]\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. III.\n\n\nA VISIT TO THE THEATRE.\n\nCharles had never seen a play; but his papa and mamma had always\npromised him that when he was seven years old, they would take him to\nCovent-Garden Theatre, and as that time had now nearly come, he did not\nforget to remind them of their promise. His birth-day was the fifteenth\nof January, which was lucky, because they always perform pantomimes in\nthe Christmas holidays, and he was very desirous of seeing harlequin and\ncolumbine, and the clown, as he had heard a great deal about them from\nhis young friends in the square, who had been to see them. As the day\napproached, Charles could think of nothing but the play, and said he\nthought it would be the happiest day of his life; but his mamma told him\nshe hoped he would have much greater cause to be happy many days of his\nlife, than going to a theatre; however Charles did not think there could\nbe any greater cause for happiness, and his mamma said, it was as well\nfor him to think so: The night before his birth-day, he went to bed in\nhigh spirits, saying he was sure he should not be able to sleep all\nnight; but that was a mistake, for he went to sleep almost directly; and\ndid not wake till the morning.\n\n[Illustration: LITTLE CHARLES SEEING A CHRISTMAS PANTOMIME.]\n\nAs soon as he was dressed, he ran down stairs to breakfast, with a\nsmiling face. \"Here is the day come at last!\" he said, \"I am so glad\nmamma, I wish it was night; I am seven years old to-day.\"\n\n\"Yes, my dear,\" said his mamma, \"and I wish you many happy returns of\nthe day.\"\n\n\"Thank you, mamma, but I have a great favour to ask you.\"\n\n\"What is it? Charles.\"\n\n\"I am afraid you will not do it.\"\n\n\"If it is any thing very unreasonable, perhaps I shall not,\" said his\nmamma; \"but if it is not very unreasonable, I think, as it is your\nbirth-day, I may venture to promise that I will do it.\"\n\n\"Then this is it,\" said Charles; \"Peter has never been to the play in\nhis life, and he said yesterday, he should like to go with me; so I wish\nyou would take him with us; he would be so pleased.\"\n\n\"Well then, we will take him with us,\" said Mrs. Barker; \"and I am glad\nto find that you think of other people's pleasure, as well as your own;\nit shows that you are not selfish.\"\n\nA message was then sent to Peter's uncle, who readily gave his consent,\nwhich made Charles happier than he was before.\n\nAt six o'clock Peter came; and very much delighted he looked, as well\nhe might, for he had not expected so great a pleasure; and then both the\nboys watched at the window for Mr. Barker, who had not yet come home;\nbut he soon came, when they all got into a coach, and away they drove.\n\nThe play was to be Macbeth, which Charles said was very fortunate,\nbecause he had read about him in 'Tales of a Grandfather,' but Peter had\nnever read 'Tales of Grandfather,' nor any history of Scotland, so he\ndid not know who Macbeth was, therefore Mr. Barker was kind enough to\ntell him the whole story as they went along; that he might be able to\nunderstand what he was going to see. Perhaps some other little boys\nwould like to hear it too, so I will tell it.\n\n\"There was once a king of Scotland, named Duncan, who was a good man,\nand much beloved by his subjects. This king had a cousin named Macbeth,\nwho being the bravest general in Scotland, was employed by Duncan to\nfight all his battles for him, when he was too old to fight them\nhimself; but Macbeth, although a brave man, was not a good man, and\nbesides that, he had a very wicked wife, who wanted to be a queen, and\ntherefore she tried to persuade her husband to kill Duncan, that he\nmight be made king in his stead.\n\n\"At this time the Danes, who came from Denmark, invaded Scotland; that\nis, they came there to fight the Scots, and try to conquer the country:\nbut they were disappointed, for Macbeth went with a large army to the\nplace where they had landed, and having killed a great number of them in\na battle, he forced the rest to return to Denmark.\n\n\"When Duncan heard that Macbeth had gained this victory, and driven his\nenemies out of Scotland, he was so much pleased, that he went, with his\ntwo sons, to pay him a visit at his castle; but he little thought, poor\nold man, what was going to happen, for in the middle of the night, when\nhe was fast asleep, Macbeth went softly into his room, and killed him\nwith a dagger. So in the morning, when it became known that the king was\nmurdered, Macbeth pretended to be very much surprised and grieved at it,\nand although the people all thought he had done it himself, they were\nafraid to say so; and he was made king of Scotland. But wickedness is\nsure to be punished, as you shall hear; for the two young Princes,\nMalcolm and Donald Bane, as soon as they heard their father was dead,\nescaped from the castle, fearing that if they staid they might be killed\ntoo.\n\n\"Now happened that at that very time there was in England a very good\nking, called Edward the Confessor, who was an enemy to all bad men;\ntherefore the Scottish princes determined to go to his court, and tell\nhim what Macbeth had done; for they did not doubt that when he heard of\nit, he would render them some assistance; and they were not mistaken.\nThe English king declared that he would revenge the death of Duncan,\nand place Malcolm on the throne; so he sent a large army into Scotland,\nto fight for the young prince, and Macbeth was killed in a battle, which\ngave great joy to the people, who were very glad to have Malcolm for\ntheir king. All this happened nearly eight hundred years ago, and\nMalcolm, who is called in the history of Scotland, Malcolm Canmore, was\none of the best kings that ever reigned over that country.\"\n\nBy the time Mr. Barker had finished this story they had arrived at the\ntheatre, and were just seated in the front row of a box, as the curtain\ndrew up. The two boys liked the play very much, although it made them\nrather dull; but they were merry enough when the pantomime began, for it\nwas full of fun, from beginning to end, and Charles could not help\nexclaiming every now and then, \"Oh, what capital fun!\"\n\nHe was very much astonished at the wonderful tricks performed by\nharlequin with his magic sword, for to those who have never seen a\npantomime before, it must be rather surprising to see a wheelbarrow\nturned into a steam carriage, and an umbrella into an arm chair. But\nwhat amused Charles and Peter more than all the rest, was a large pie\nwhich was brought in and placed on a table, where the king and queen,\nwith several lords and ladies were sitting at dinner, all seemingly very\nanxious to taste of this pie. But the moment it was cut, a whistling\nnoise was heard, and a number of little birds hopped out of the pie, and\nflew away, leaving the dish quite empty, to the great amusement of all\nthe boys and girls in the theatre, who laughed very loud indeed.\n\nBut pleasure cannot last for ever. The pantomime was soon over, and as\nCharles went home, he said he should like to go to the play every night,\nall the rest of his life--\"Ah, Charles,\"--said his papa, \"we are all apt\nto like what is new to us, but you will find out, my boy, that people\nget tired even of pleasure, if they have too much of it.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. IV.\n\n\nCONVERSATION ON HISTORY.\n\nOn the morning after the play, Charles was thinking about the king of\nScotland, and he asked his mamma why there was no king of Scotland now,\nas there used to be, and she told him that England and Scotland were now\nconsidered only as one kingdom, and called Great Britain.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Charles, \"I know that the queen of England is queen of\nScotland too; but I want to know how it came to be so; because you see,\nmamma, that when Duncan was king of Scotland, there was a king of\nEngland as well.\"\n\n\"Yes, my dear,\" and for five hundred years after Duncan was murdered,\nthere were kings of Scotland and England also; but when Queen Elizabeth\ndied, her nearest relation happened to be the king of Scotland, James\nthe sixth; he was her cousin, and as she left neither brothers nor\nsisters, nor children, James became king of England as well as of his\nown country; and since that time there has been but one king to govern\nboth kingdoms.\"\n\n\"Thank you, mamma,\" said Charles, \"I could not think how it was before;\nbut do you think it is best to have one king or two?\"\n\n\"I think it is best to have but one, because, if you look at your map,\nyou will see that England and Scotland together make one large island;\nand while they were separate kingdoms, they were frequently at war with\neach other.\"\n\n\"What did they go to war for, mamma?\"\n\n\"I believe, Charles, the true cause generally was, that the English king\nthought he should like to have the whole island for himself; but what\nmade the matter worse was, that as the people who were fighting against\neach other, all lived in the same island, it was almost as bad as a\ncivil war.\"\n\n\"What is a civil war, mamma?\"\n\n\"It is when the people of any country cannot agree among themselves, and\nso make war upon each other: there have been civil wars in all countries\nat different times; they are the most dreadful of all wars, because\nrelations and friends are often fighting in battle against each other.\"\n\n\"Oh, what a shocking thing!\" said Charles; \"But why do they do it mamma?\nI cannot think why people should fight battles with one another.\"\n\n\"I will try to explain it, my dear: There is at present a civil war in\nSpain, because when the last king died, some of the people said that his\ndaughter should be queen, and others said his brother should be king; so\nthe daughter was placed on the throne and crowned; but the brother,\nwhose name is Don Carlos, is very angry at this, because he thinks he\nhas the greatest right to the crown; so he has persuaded all who are on\nhis side, to go to war with all who are in favour of the queen,\ntherefore the Spaniards are now fighting against each other.\"\n\n\"Which do you think will win?\" said Charles.\n\n\"I cannot possibly say, my dear. But I wish to show you, Charles, the\nterrible consequences of a civil war. It may happen that fathers and\nsons are of different opinions, and that one fights for the queen, and\nthe other for the king; and then it is possible that in battle the son\nmay kill his father, or the father his son.\"\n\n\"Oh, that would be shocking!\" said Charles.\n\n\"And yet it has sometimes happened,\" said his mamma; \"there have been\nbrothers too, who have fought against each other, and many persons who\nwere friends before, have become the bitterest enemies.\"\n\n\"Was there ever a civil war in England, mamma?\"\n\n\"Yes, my dear, more than once. The last was because many people thought\nthey should like to have no king at all; I am going to buy you a little\nhistory of England, and then you will read about it.\"\n\n\"I shall like to read about it,\" said Charles, \"but what did the people\ndo when\n\n### Summary:\n\n"}

S. ARTHUR.\n\n\n\"There is a word, my son, a very little word, in the English language,\nthe right use of which it is all important that you should learn,\" Mr.\nHowland said to his son Thomas, who was about leaving the paternal roof\nfor a residence in a neighboring city, never again, perchance, to make\none of the little circle that had so long gathered in the family\nhomestead.\n\n\"And what word is that, father?\" Thomas asked.\n\n\"It is the little word _No_, my son.\"\n\n\"And why does so much importance attach to that word, father?\"\n\n\"Perhaps I can make you understand the reason much better if I relate an\nincident that occurred when I was a boy. I remember it as distinctly as\nif it had taken place but yesterday, although thirty years have since\npassed. There was a neighbor of my father's, who was very fond of\ngunning and fishing. On several occasions I had accompanied him, and had\nenjoyed myself very much. One day my father said to me,\n\n\"'William, I do not wish you to go into the woods or on the water again\nwith Mr. Jones.'\n\n\"'Why not, father?' I asked, for I had become so fond of going with him,\nthat to be denied the pleasure was a real privation.\n\n\"'I have good reasons for not wishing you to go, William,' my father\nreplied, 'but do not want to give them now. I hope it is all-sufficient\nfor you, that your father desires you not to accompany Mr. Jones again.'\n\n\"I could not understand why my father laid upon me this prohibition;\nand, as I desired very much to go, I did not feel satisfied in my\nobedience. On the next day, as I was walking along the road, I met Mr.\nJones with his fishing rod on his shoulder, and his basket in his hand.\n\n\"'Ah, William! you are the very one that I wish to see,' said Mr. Jones\nsmiling. 'I am going out this morning, and want company. We shall have a\nbeautiful day.'\n\n\"'But my father told me yesterday,' I replied, 'that he did not wish me\nto go out with you.'\n\n\"'And why not, pray?' asked Mr. Jones.\n\n\"'I am sure that I do not know,' I said, 'but indeed, I should like to\ngo very much.'\n\n\"'O, never mind; come along,' he said, 'Your father will never know it.'\n\n\"'Yes, but I am afraid that he will,' I replied, thinking more of my\nfather's displeasure than of the evil of disobedience.\n\n\"'There is no danger at all of that. We will be home again long before\ndinner-time.'\n\n\"I hesitated, and he urged; and finally, I moved the way that he was\ngoing, and had proceeded a few hundred yards, when I stopped, and said:\n\n\"'I don't like to go, Mr. Jones.'\n\n\"'Nonsense, William! There is no harm in fishing, I am sure. I have\noften been out with your father, myself.'\n\n\"Much as I felt inclined to go, still I hesitated; for I could not fully\nmake up my mind to disobey my father.--At length he said--\n\n\"'I can't wait here for you, William. Come along, or go back. Say yes or\nno.'\n\n\"This was the decisive moment. I was to make up my mind, and fix my\ndetermination in one way or the other. I was to say _yes_ or NO.\"\n\n\"'Come, I can't stay here all day,' Mr. Jones remarked, rather harshly,\nseeing that I hesitated. At the same moment the image of my father rose\ndistinctly before my mind, and I saw his eyes fixed steadily and\nreprovingly upon me. With one desperate resolution I uttered the word,\n'No!' and then turning, ran away as fast as my feet would carry me. I\ncannot tell you how relieved I felt when I was far beyond the reach of\ntemptation.\n\n\"On the next morning, when I came down to breakfast, I was startled and\nsurprised to learn that Mr. Jones had been drowned on the day before.\nInstead of returning in a few hours, as he had stated to me that he\nwould, he remained out all the day. A sudden storm arose; his boat was\ncapsized, and he drowned. I shuddered when I heard this sad and fatal\naccident related.--That little word NO, had, in all probability, saved\nmy life.\"\n\n\"'I will now tell you, William,' my father said, turning to me, 'why I\ndid not wish you to go with Mr. Jones.--Of late, he had taken to\ndrinking; and I had learned within a few days, that whenever he went out\non a fishing or gunning excursion he took his bottle of spirits with\nhim, and usually returned a good deal intoxicated. I could not trust you\nwith such a man. I did not think it necessary to state this to you, for\nI was sure that I had only to express my wish that you would not\naccompany him, to insure your implicit obedience.'\n\n\"I felt keenly rebuked at this, and resolved never again to permit even\nthe thought of disobedience to find a place in my mind. From that time,\nI have felt the value of the word NO, and have generally, ever since,\nbeen able to use it on all right occasions.--It has saved me from many\ntroubles. Often and often in life have I been urged to do things that my\njudgment told me were wrong: on such occasions I always remembered my\nfirst temptation, and resolutely said--\n\n\"'NO!'\n\n\"And now, my son,\" continued Mr. Howland, do you understand the\nimportance of the word _No_?\"\n\n\"I think I do, father,\" Thomas replied. \"But is there not danger of my\nusing it too often and thus becoming selfish in all my feelings, and\nconsequently unwilling to render benefits to others?\"\n\n\"Certainly there is, Thomas. The legitimate use of this word is to\nresist evil. To refuse to do a good action is wrong.\" \"If any one asks\nme, then, to do him a favor or kindness, I should not, on any account,\nsay, no.\"\n\n\"That will depend, Thomas, in what manner you are to render him a\nkindness. If you can do so without really injuring yourself or others,\nthen it is a duty which you owe to all men, to be kind, and render\nfavors.\"\n\n\"But the difficulty, I feel, will be for me to discriminate. When I am\nurged to do something by one whom I esteem, my regard for him, or my\ndesire to render him an obligation, will be so strong as to obscure my\njudgment.\"\n\n\"A consciousness of this weakness in your character, Thomas, should put\nyou upon your guard.\"\n\n\"That is very true, father. But I cannot help fearing myself. Still, I\nshall never forget what you have said, and I will try my best to act\nfrom a conviction of right.\"\n\n\"Do so, my son. And ever bear in mind, that a wrong action is _always_\nfollowed by pain of mind, and too frequently by evil consequences. If\nyou would avoid these, ever act from a consciousness that you are doing\nright, without regard to others. If another asks you, from a selfish\ndesire to benefit or gratify himself, to do that which your judgment\ntells you is wrong, surely you should have no hesitation in refusing.\"\n\nThe precept of his father, enforced when they were about parting, and at\na time when his affections for that father were active and intense,\nlingered in the mind of Thomas Howland. He saw and felt its force, and\nresolved to act in obedience to it, if ever tempted to do wrong.\n\nOn leaving the paternal roof, he went to a neighboring town, and entered\nthe store of a merchant, where were several young men nearly of his own\nage, that is, between eighteen and twenty. With one of these, named\nBoyd, he soon formed an intimate acquaintance. But, unfortunately, the\nmoral character of this young man was far from being pure, or his\nprinciples from resting upon the firm basis of truth and honor.\n\nHis growing influence over Thomas Howland was apparent in inducing him\nto stay away from church on the sabbath-day, and pass the time that had\nheretofore been spent in the place of worship, in roaming about the\nwharves of the city, or in excursions into the country. This influence\nwas slightly resisted, Thomas being ashamed or reluctant to use the\nword \"_No_,\" on what seemed to all the young men around him a matter of\nso little importance. Still, his own heart condemned him, for he felt\nthat it would pain his father and mother exceedingly if they knew that\nhe neglected to attend church at least once on the sabbath-day; and he\nwas, besides, self-convicted of wrong in what seemed to him a violation\nof the precept, _Remember the sabbath-day_, &c. as he had been taught to\nregard that precept. But once having given way, he felt almost powerless\nto resist the influence that now bore upon him.\n\nThe next violation of what seemed to him a right course for a young man\nto pursue, was in suffering himself to be persuaded to visit frequently\nthe theatre; although his father had expressly desired that he would\navoid a place where lurked for the young and inexperienced so many\ndangers. He was next easily persuaded to visit a favorite eating-house,\nin which many hours were spent during the evenings of each week, with\nBoyd and others, in eating, drinking, and smoking.\n\nSometimes dominos and backgammon were introduced, and at length were\nplayed for a slight stake. To participate in this Thomas refused, on\nthe plea that he did not know enough of the games to risk anything. He\nhad not the moral courage to declare that he considered it wrong to\ngamble.\n\nAll these departures from what he had been taught by his father to\nconsider a right course, were attended by much uneasiness and pain of\nmind.--But he had yielded to the tempter, and he could not find the\npower within him to resist his influence successfully.\n\nIt happened about six months after his introduction to such an entirely\nnew course of life that he was invited one evening by his companion\nBoyd, to call on a friend with him. He had, on that day, received from\nhis father forty dollars, with which to buy him a new suit of clothes\nand a few other necessary articles. He went, of course, and was\nintroduced to a very affable, gentlemanly young man, in his room at one\nof the hotels. In a few minutes, wine and cigars were ordered, and the\nthree spent an hour or so, in drinking, smoking, and chit-chat of no\nelevating or refined character.\n\n\"Come, let us have a game of cards,\" the friend at last remarked, during\na pause in the conversation; at the same time going to his trunk and\nproducing a pack of cards.\n\n\"No objection,\" responded Boyd.\n\n\"You'll take a hand, of course?\" the new friend said, looking at Thomas\nHowland.\n\nBut Thomas said that he knew nothing of cards.\n\n\"O that's no matter! You can learn in two minutes,\" responded the friend\nof Boyd.\n\nYoung Howland felt reluctant, but he could not resist the influence that\nwas around him, and so he consented to finger the cards with the rest.\nAs they gathered around the table, a half-dollar was laid down by each\nof the young men, who looked towards Thomas as they did so.\n\n\"I cannot play for money,\" he said, coloring; for he felt really\nashamed to acknowledge his scruples.\n\n\"And why not?\" asked the friend of Boyd, looking him steadily in the\nface.\n\n\"Because I think it wrong,\" stammered out Howland, coloring still more\ndeeply.\n\n\"Nonsense! Isn't your money your own? And pray what harm is there in\nyour doing with your own as you please?\" urged the tempter.\n\n\"But I do not know enough of the game to risk my money.\"\n\n\"You don't think we would take advantage of your ignorance?\" Boyd said.\n\"The stake is only to give interest to the game. I would not give a\ncopper for a game of cards without a stake. Come, put down your\nhalf-dollar, and we'll promise to pay you back all you loose, if you\nwish it, until you acquire some skill.\"\n\nBut Thomas felt reluctant, and hesitated. Nevertheless, he was debating\nthe matter in his mind seriously, and every moment that reluctance was\ngrowing weaker.\n\n\"Will you play?\" Boyd asked in a decided tone, breaking in upon his\ndebate.\n\n\"I had rather not,\" Thomas replied, attempting to smile, so as to\nconciliate his false friends.\n\n\"You're afraid of your money,\" said Boyd, in a half-sneering tone.\n\n\"It is not that, Boyd.\"\n\n\"Then what is it, pray?\"\n\n\"I am afraid it is not right.\"\n\nThis was answered by a loud laugh from his two friends, which touched\nThomas a good deal, and made him feel more ashamed of the scruples that\nheld him back from entering into the temptation.\n\n\"Come down with your stake, Howland,\" Boyd said, after he had finished\nhis laugh.\n\nThe hand of Thomas was in his pocket, and his fingers had grasped the\nsilver coin, yet still he hesitated.\n\n\"Will you play, or not?\" the friend of Boyd now said, with something of\nimpatience in his tone. \"Say yes, or no.\"\n\nFor a moment the mind of Thomas became confused--then the perception\ncame upon him as clear as a sunbeam, that it was wrong to gamble. He\nremembered, too, vividly his father's parting injunction.\n\n\"_No_,\" he said, firmly and decidedly.\n\nBoth of his companions looked disappointed and angry.\n\n\"What did you bring him for?\" he heard Boyd's companion say to him in\nan under tone, while a frown darkened upon his brow.\n\nThe reply did not reach his ear, but he felt that his company was no\nlonger pleasant, and rising, he bade them a formal good-evening, and\nhurriedly retired. That little word _no_ had saved him. The scheme was,\nto win from him his forty dollars, and then involve him in \"debts of\nhonor,\" as they are falsely called, which would compel him to draw upon\nhis father for more money, or abstract it from his employer, a system\nwhich had been pursued by Boyd, and which was discovered only a week\nsubsequent, when the young man was discharged in disgrace. It then came\nout, that he had been for months in secret association with a gambler,\nand that the two shared together the spoils and peculations.\n\nThis incident roused Thomas Howland to a distinct consciousness of the\ndanger that lurked in his path, as a young man, in a large city. He\nfelt, as he had not felt while simply listening to his father's precept,\nthe value of the word _no_; and resolved that hereafter he would utter\nthat little word, and that, too, decidedly, whenever urged to do what\nhis judgment did not approve.\n\n\"I will be free!\" he said, pacing his chamber backward and forward. \"I\nwill be free, hereafter! No one shall persuade me or drive me to do what\nI feel to be wrong.\"\n\nThat conclusion was his safeguard ever after. When tempted, and he was\ntempted frequently, his \"_No_\" decided the matter at once. There was a\npower in it that was all-sufficient in resisting evil. \n\n\n\n\nWILLY AND THE BEGGAR GIRL.\n\n\n  \"An apple, dear mother!\"\n    Cried Willy one day,\n  Coming in, with his cheeks\n    Glowing bright, from his play.\n  \"I want a nice apple,\n    A large one, and red.\"\n  \"For whom do you want it?\"\n    His kind mother said.\n  \n  \"You know a big apple\n    I gave you at noon;\n  And now for another,\n    My boy, it's too soon.\"\n  \"There's a poor little girl\n    At the door, mother dear,\"\n  Said Will, while within\n    His mild eye shone a tear.\n  \n  \"She says, since last evening\n    She's eaten no bread;\n  Her feet are all naked\n    And bare is her head.\n  Like me, she's no mother\n    To love her, I'm sure,\n  Or she'd not look so hungry,\n    And ragged, and poor.\n  \n  \"Let me give her an apple;\n    She wants one, I know;\n  A nice, large, red apple--\n    O! do not say no.\"\n  First a kiss to the lips\n    Of her generous boy,\n  Mamma gave with a feeling\n    Of exquisite joy--\n  \n  For goodness, whene'er\n    In a child it is seen,\n  Gives joy to the heart\n    Of a mother, I ween--\n  And then led her out, where,\n    Still stood by the door,\n  A poor little beggar-girl,\n    Ragged all o'er.\n  \n  \"Please ma'am, I am hungry,\"\n    The little thing said,\n  \"Will you give me to eat\n    A small piece of bread?\"\n  \"Yes, child, you shall have it;\n    But who sends you out\n  From dwelling to dwelling\n    To wander about?\"\n  \n  A pair of mild eyes\n    To the lady were raised;\n  \"My mother's been sick\n    For a great many days\n  So sick she don't know me.\"\n    Sobs stifled the rest\n  And heaved with young sorrow\n    That innocent breast.\n  \n  Just then from the store-room--\n    Where wee Willy run,\n  As his mother to question\n    The poor child begun--\n  Came forth the sweet boy,\n    With a large loaf of bread,\n  Held tight in his tiny hands\n    High o'er his head.\n  \n  \"Here's bread, and a plenty!\n    Eat, little girl, eat!\"\n  He cried, as he laid\n    The great loaf at her feet.\n  The mother smiled gently,\n    Then, quick through the door\n  Drew the sad little stranger,\n    So hungry and poor.\n  \n  With words kindly spoken\n    She gave her nice food,\n  And clothed her with garments\n    All clean, warm and good.\n  This done, she was leading\n    Her out, when she heard\n  Willy coming down stairs,\n    Like a fluttering bird.\n  \n  A newly bought leghorn,\n    With green bow and band.\n  And an old, worn out beaver\n    He held in his hand.\n  \"Here! give her my new hat,\"\n    He cried; \"I can wear\n  My black one all summer--\n    It's good--you won't care--\n  \n  \"Say! will you, dear mother?\"\n    First out through the door,\n  She passed the girl kindly;\n    Then quick from the floor\n  Caught up the dear fellow,\n    Kissed and kissed him again,\n  While her glad tears fell freely\n    O'er his sweet face like rain.\n\n\n\n\nTHE GOOD SON.\n\n\nLittle Martin went to a peasant and endeavored to procure employment, by\nwhich he might be able to earn some money.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the peasant, \"I will take you for a herds-boy, and if you\nare industrious, will give you your board and ten dollars for the whole\nsummer.\"\n\n\"I will be very industrious,\" said Martin, \"but I beg you to pay me my\nwages every week, for I have a poor father at home to whom I wish to\ncarry all I earn.\"\n\nThe peasant, who was pleased beyond measure at this filial love, not\nonly willingly consented, but also raised his wages much higher. Every\nSaturday the son carefully carried his money, and as much bread and\nbutter as he could spare from his own mouth, to his father.\n\n  Children, love and gratitude\n  Always please the wise and good,\n  But contempt and hate from all,\n  On the thankless child will fall.\n\n\n\n\nTHE SICK MOTHER.\n\n\nA mother once lay very sick, and suffered great and constant pain. Her\nchildren were all very sad and melancholy, and the large ones often\nkneeled down together, and prayed that God would restore their mother to\nhealth once more.\n\nThe youngest child would stand all day by the bed of her mother, and\nwith tearful eyes, anxiously inquire when she would be well and get up\nagain. One day this little child observed a glass filled with some dark\nfluid standing by the sick bed, and asked, \"Mother, what is this?\" The\nmother answered, \"My dear child, it is something very bitter; but I must\ndrink it, that I may get well again.\" \"Mother,\" said the good child, \"if\nit is so bitter, I will drink it for you; then you will be well again.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nAnd the sick mother, in all her pains, had the comfort and consolation\nof seeing how dearly all her children loved her.\n\n  Parents, joy and comfort find\n  In a child that is good and kind;\n  But their hearts are very sad,\n  When the child they love is bad.\n\n\n\n\n\nCORNELIA'S PRAYER.\n\n\nCornelia was the joy and pride of her parents, for she was a slender,\ngraceful little creature, darting about like a young fawn, and her\ncheeks were as fresh and blooming as the young rose when it first opens\nto receive the dew. Added to this, she was blessed with a temper as\nsweet and serene as a spring morning when it dawns upon the blooming\nvalleys, announcing a fair and delightful day.\n\nCornelia had never in her life known what it is to experience trouble\nand anxiety, for her youth had been all brightness and sunshine. But\nsuch freedom from all trials does not generally continue for a long time\nuninterrupted. And so it was with Cornelia. She was one day very much\ndelighted at being shown a little brother with which her mother had\npresented her, but her joy was soon clouded by the severe illness of\nthat mother. She lay many long days without noticing or appearing to\nknow her little Cornelia, for her fever was strong, and her senses were\ncontinually wandering.\n\nCornelia was almost heart-broken at this, and they could scarcely\npersuade her to leave the bedside of her dear mother, for a single\nmoment. She would entreat and implore until she won their consent that\nshe should remain in the sick room; and then all night long would the\naffectionate little girl watch by her mother's bed, and attentively\nstudy her every want, wetting her parched lips and moving around her\nwith the lightest and most anxious footsteps.\n\nOn the seventh day of her sickness the fever approached its crisis and\nthere was deep silence in the little chamber, and stifled weeping, for\nevery one thought that death was near.\n\nBut with the night came long absent slumber, and revived the almost\ndying mother, and seemed to give her back to life. What a season for\nCornelia! Through the whole night she sat by the bed listening to her\nnow soft and regular breathing, while hope and fear were struggling\ntogether in her bosom. When daylight appeared the mother opened her\neyes, and turning them upon the anxious Cornelia, knew her. \"I am\nbetter, my child,\" said she in a clear, but feeble voice, \"I am better,\nand shall get well!\" They then gave her drink and nourishment, and she\nwent to sleep again.\n\nWhat joy was this for the affectionate little girl! Her heart was too\nfull for utterance, and she stole softly out of the chamber, and skipped\nout into the field, and ascended a hill near by, just as the sun was\ndawning. Here she stood her hands clasped together, and her bosom\nswelling with many contending emotions of pain and hope. Presently the\nsun arose and streamed over her face, and Cornelia thought of the new\nlife of her mother after her reviving sleep, and the anguish of her own\nfeelings. But she could not long shut up the flood of feeling within her\nown heart, and she knelt down upon blooming flowers with which the hill\nwas covered, and bowing her face to the fragrant sod, her tears were\nmingled with the dew of heaven.\n\nAfter a few minutes silence, she lifted up her head, and rising from the\nground, returned to her home, and the chamber of her mother. Never\nbefore had there been so sweet and calm a loveliness on the face of\nCornelia. It was a reflection of the peace and tranquility of her soul,\nfor she had held communion with her God! \n\n\n\n\nFORGIVENESS.\n\n\nA friend with whom I was conversing a few weeks since, told me of a\nbeautiful example of this Christian grace, even in a little child. It\nhas often dwelt in my memory since, and perhaps some of my little\nreaders may be induced to cultivate the same spirit, if I repeat it to\nthem.\n\nLittle Sarah was a sweet child of six summers. Gentle and affectionate\nin disposition, she soon won a large portion of that love which few\nhearts can withhold from the happy spirit of infancy. It has been\nsaid, \"Childhood is ever lovely,\" and I would add, childhood is ever\nloved. Sarah was an attentive and careful reader of the word of God, at\na very early age. There it was that she found the Divine promise,\n\"Forgive, and thou shalt be forgiven.\" And she not only read this\nprecept, but showed by her life of gentle forgiveness, that she had\nengraven it upon her heart.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nShe attended a small school which was kept near her home; and I am sorry\nthat all who were her schoolmates had not the same kind spirit. There\nwere some who were very rude and unkind and Sarah soon found many\ntrials to encounter. Often would the gentle child return to her sweet\nhome in tears to forget her sorrow in a mother's love. Yet every harsh\nand ungentle tone was forgiven by her, for she knew that forgiveness was\nof Heaven.\n\nOne day when her mother had given her some plums she observed that Sarah\ndid not eat them, but put them all into her little workbag to carry them\nto school.\n\n\"Why do you do so?\" said she; \"you do not eat the plums which I have\ngiven you.\"\n\n\"No, mother,\" said Sarah \"I will carry them to the little children who\ndo not love me. Perhaps they will love me better if I am kind to them.\"\n\nHere was the true secret of human love. The power of kindness--there is\nnone other that will reach every heart. There is none other that can\ninfluence them for good. It can lead the sinner from his evil way, for\nnone are too sinful to love, and where love is, there is power. We are\nall frail and erring beings, whose hourly prayer should be for pardon,\nand shall we not forgive? \n\n\n\n\nTHE GUILTY CONSCIENCE.\n\n\nA mother one day returned home very sorrowful, and lamented bitterly to\nher husband that she had heard that one of their sons had beaten a poor\nchild.\n\n\"This,\" said she, \"must have certainly been done by our naughty Caspar,\nbut he will deny it if I put the question to him.\"\n\n\"I will answer for it,\" said the prudent father, \"that I will put the\nquestion to him in a way in which he cannot answer with a lie; and\nthereby come at the truth.\"\n\nThey soon after went to the supper table, and Caspar was very still and\nquiet: he ate little, and spoke still less. He seldom looked at his\nparents, who were very grave and serious, and then only with stolen\nglances.\n\nThe sons soon after went to bed.--They all slept in separate beds, but\nin the same room.\n\nAbout half an hour after, when they were gone to sleep, their father\nentered the chamber, and took pains to make a great noise in shutting\nthe door. Caspar instantly sprang out of bed, and full of fear cried\nout, \"What is it? What is the matter?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" answered the father, \"I was only wishing to see who among you\nwas asleep.\" The two other brothers were sleeping softly and sweetly,\nand did not awake until they were aroused by Caspar's cry. The father\nthen went out again.\n\nThe next day the father called Caspar to him, and, before his mother and\nall the children, said to him, \"You beat a poor child, yesterday, did\nyou?\" Caspar, who thought that it had all come out, began to excuse\nhimself.--\"He struck me too, and--\" His father would not suffer him to\nproceed any farther. \"Caspar!\" said he \"why do you make us so much\ntrouble and sorrow? Yesterday, we heard that one of our sons had beaten\na poor child, but we did not then know who had done it. But when I saw\nyou eating in so much fear and trouble, and still more, when you could\nnot sleep from uneasiness and your _guilty conscience_ drove you from\nyour bed as soon as I opened the door, I was convinced that you were the\nguilty one. See, how miserable wickedness can make us. You have been\nsufficiently punished by your anxiety and fear, but you must now\nendeavor to do some good to the poor child, and make at\n\n### Summary:\n\n"}

There is my doll and its cradle, you know,\nand your baby-house and furniture, how much money they cost! No, I do\nnot think aunt intends to give us anything else.\"\n\n\"But I am quite sure she will,\" replied Louisa; \"for I was going past\nmamma's dressing-room this morning, when the door was a little way\nopen, and I heard aunt Harding say, 'I should like to give the dear\ngirls something really useful, which they may value as they grow\nolder.' I did not hear anymore, because mamma has always told us it is\nnot right to listen, and so I came away as fast as I could.\"\n\n\"Well, I wonder what the present will be?\" said Emma, now quite\nconvinced.\n\n\"What should you think of two handsome work-boxes--or, perhaps, as I\nam the eldest, of a work-box for yourself, and writing-desk for me?\"\n\n\"That would be charming!\" said Emma; \"and I would let you use my\nwork-box, and you could lend me your writing-desk sometimes.\"\n\n\"I will not make any promises,\" said Louisa; \"you know you are very\ncareless, and I should not like my nice new desk to be stained with\nink, or, perhaps, scratched with the point of a pin.\"\n\n\"But mamma says I am growing more careful,\" said her sister; \"and I do\nnot think I am so heedless about other people's things, though I often\nspoil my own.\"\n\n\"Remember my wax doll,\" said Louisa, \"which you left in the garden\nthrough that heavy shower of rain, so that I could never play with it\nagain.\"\n\n\"O, that was such a very long time ago!\" said Emma, looking a little\nvexed.\n\n\"Perhaps it will not be a writing-desk nor a work-box that aunt\nHarding will give us,\" said Louisa; \"there are many other things which\nwe should like. I wish she would ask us to choose.\"\n\n\"So do I,\" added Emma; \"but there is nothing that I should like better\nthan a work-box.\"\n\nLouisa thought of many other things which she should be glad to have;\nfor she was apt to indulge in a foolish habit of wishing for what she\nwas not likely to possess. It is a bad thing to give way to this\nfailing; for by doing so we may often make ourselves unhappy, without\nany good or real cause. People who do so should think of the words of\nSt. Paul: \"I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be\ncontent.\" Philip. iv, 11. And children, who have kind parents or\nfriends to provide for all their wants, should learn that it is very\nsinful to let the thoughts be often dwelling upon things that they\ncannot have, and do not really need. Pray for a grateful heart, that\nyou may rejoice in the blessings that surround you, and be thankful to\nyour heavenly Father, who gives you all things richly to enjoy.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\n\nTHE PRESENTS.\n\nMrs. Harding, the aunt of these little girls, had been paying a\nfarewell visit to their mamma, before going with Mr. Harding to India,\nwhere it was likely that they would remain for some years. She had\nkindly given many little presents to her nieces during her stay with\nthem; but they were such as Louisa and Emma would cease to value when\nthey became old enough to \"put away childish things;\" and being a\nperson of piety and judgment, she wished her last gift to be one which\nmight be worthy of their regard in youth and in age, and through all\nthe changes of life. It did not take any long time to determine what\nthis parting gift should be.\n\nThe evening before she went away, she called Louisa and Emma into the\nroom. They both looked round upon the table and chests of drawers, but\nno sign of a present was to be seen; no parcel neatly wrapped up in\nbrown paper, nor anything like a work-box or a desk. But, to do them\njustice, the thought of what they might receive was not then uppermost\nin their mind; for their heart was full of grief at the prospect of\nparting with their aunt, whom they dearly loved, and who was going so\nvery far away.\n\n\"Sit down beside me, dear children,\" said their aunt Harding, \"and let\nus have a little talk together, quietly by ourselves. I wish to give\nyou a few parting words of advice. I am sure that you will not forget\nme when I am gone; and when you think of me, I hope that the good\nthings which I have tried to teach you will also come into your mind.\"\n\nBoth Louisa and Emma said, again and again, that they could never\nforget her, and they promised to remember her advice.\n\n\"Your mamma will often write to me concerning you,\" said aunt Harding,\n\"and I cannot express the joy that it will afford me to hear that you\nare learning to hate sin more and more, and to live like children of\nour Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. I shall be glad to find that you\nare improving in your studies, and I hope that every letter will bring\nme an account of your progress in useful knowledge; but I shall be far\nmore anxious to hear of your being good and dutiful to your parents;\nand, above all, I shall long to know if you seek in earnest for the\npardon of your sins, through the blood of Christ, and whether there is\nany proof in your conduct that your evil hearts have been changed by\nthe grace of the Holy Spirit.\"\n\n\"If mamma sends you a good account of us,\" said Louisa, \"please to\nremember, aunt, that you promised to write to us when that was the\ncase. And you will write to me first, because I am the eldest, you\nknow.\"\n\n\"Since you claim to be thought of first,\" replied her aunt, \"because\nyou are a year older then your sister, I hope you intend to take the\nlead by setting before her a good example, that it may be well for her\nto imitate you in every respect.\"\n\nLouisa blushed, and was silent. \"We will try our very best, dear\naunt,\" said Emma, \"that mamma may send you good news, and then you\nwill write to us both. And, perhaps, before you come back, we shall be\ngrown such good girls, that you will not be able to find fault with\neither of us.\"\n\n\"I am afraid that is not very likely,\" said Louisa; \"for it seems as\nif we could not help being naughty sometimes. I am sure I have often\nsaid to myself, 'Mamma shall not have to reprove me once to-day,' and\nyet, directly after, something has been amiss.\"\n\n\"O! that is quite true,\" said Emma, with a sigh.\n\n\"The reason is this,\" their aunt replied; \"you were born with an evil\nnature, which loves sin and leads you to do wrong, so that you cannot\nbe good and dutiful of yourselves. When you have made such resolves,\nit has been in your own strength, without your having asked for help\nfrom God; and this being the case, it was not possible that you should\nkeep from sin. The only way to lead a holy life is to put no trust in\nourselves, to have a constant sense of our need of divine grace, and\nto pray earnestly that it may be given to us for Christ's sake.\"\n\n\"But you talk of my return,\" added she, \"as if it were certain that we\nshould meet again; yet how many things may happen to prevent it!\nNothing can be more uncertain than the future, though young people are\napt to think that all will fall out just as they wish. I may not live\nto come back; or if I should be spared to do so, who can tell that you\nwill be here to meet me? Long before that time you may be laid low in\nthe narrow grave. 'For what is your life? It is even a vapor, that\nappeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away.' James iv, 14.\"\n\nBefore their aunt Harding had done speaking, both the children were in\ntears; for the thought that they might never see her again was more\nthan they could bear. Seeing that their hearts were softened to\nreceive the word of instruction, she went on to talk to them in a kind\nand earnest manner on the great importance of preparing for another\nworld, showing them their awful state without the Saviour, and urging\nthem to seek him at once by faith and prayer; then, further to impress\nher advice upon their minds, she unlocked a little cabinet which stood\nnear her, and taking out two handsome Bibles,[A] gave one to each of\nher nieces, telling them that as it was the best present she could\ngive them, so she hoped they would value it, not only for her sake,\nbut because it was the word of God, and taught the way of eternal\nlife. After this, she desired them to kneel down with her, while she\noffered a fervent prayer that God would bless them, and that they\nmight be led by the Holy Spirit into the fold of Christ, who died to\ntake away their sins. And she also prayed, that if they should never\nmore see each other in this world, they and all whom they loved might\nmeet again and be happy for ever in heaven.\n\n[Footnote A: See frontispiece.]\n\nNow I will not say that when the sisters were alone together, and\nlooked at their handsome Bibles, a thought of the work-box and the\nwriting-desk never crossed their minds; but it is certain that there\nwas not a word said upon the subject, and each seemed to be greatly\npleased with her present, admiring the rich purple binding, and\nopening the book with care, to look at the name which had been nicely\nwritten by their aunt on one of the blank leaves at the beginning. In\nLouisa's Bible, just under her name, was the text, \"Open thou mine\neyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law,\" Psa. cxix,\n18; and in Emma's, in the same place, was written, \"I love them that\nlove me; and those that seek me early shall find me.\" Prov. viii, 17.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\n\nUSE OF THE KEEPSAKES.\n\nThe next day was a sorrowful one, both to the friends who went away,\nand to those who were left behind. The children could talk of little\nelse than their uncle and aunt Harding. They asked their mother many\nquestions about the journey they had begun, and the country to which\nthey were going. When Louisa and Emma saw that their mamma was very\nsad, and not so ready as usual to join in their talk, they did not\ntease her, as some thoughtless children would have done, but each\nchose for herself a pleasant and quiet employment. Louisa began to\narrange the furniture in her baby-house, and Emma brought a piece of\nbrown silk from her drawer of treasures, and set about making a cover\nfor her new Bible.\n\n\"Why, Emma, what are you about?\" cried Louisa, after watching her\nsister for a moment; \"surely you are not going to use that beautiful\nbook?\"\n\n\"Yes, I am,\" said Emma, quietly; \"I mean to read a little in it every\nday. Ah! I see that you think it will soon be torn and soiled; but I\nassure you I intend to be very careful; and look, what a nice cover\nthis will make!\"\n\n\"I am afraid,\" said Louisa, laughing, \"you will never be careful as\nlong as you live. To think of so soon beginning to use that handsome\nbook! I have made up my mind to read a chapter every day, but not out\nof my new Bible. I think the old one, that lies in the school-room,\nwill do just as well.\"\n\n\"So it would,\" returned Emma; \"and I thought of that myself last\nnight, when aunt Harding told us how much she wished us to be good,\nand to love the Scriptures: but then the school-room Bible is not\nalways in its place, and that might sometimes hinder me from reading\nat all. Now I shall keep this book in my little drawer in our room,\nwhere I can find it in a minute.\"\n\n\"You must please yourself, I suppose,\" said Louisa; \"but I will ask\nmamma whether it is better to use aunt Harding's Bible or the old\none.\"\n\nMrs. Western heard what her little girl had to say, but did not give\njust the answer that Louisa expected. \"You are right,\" she said, \"in\nsupposing that it does not signify whether you read in an old Bible or\na new one. It is from the divine blessing upon what we read, and not\nfrom the book itself, that we must look for benefit to our souls. If\nyou pray for this blessing with all your heart, you will find the way\nof salvation as plainly declared in the worn-out school-room Bible as\nin your aunt Harding's keepsake, with its purple binding and shining\ngilt leaves. But yet I approve of Emma's wish to use her new Bible\nfrom this time, and advise you to follow her example. For though it\nought to be our great delight to read the Scriptures, yet we have such\nsinful hearts, so ready to put off doing what is right for any poor\nexcuse, that even such a little thing as having to look for the Bible,\nwhen it happens to be mislaid, will be likely to prevent you from\nreading it so constantly as you intend.\"\n\nTo this Louisa made no reply. She had wrapped up her beautiful book in\nsilver paper, and laid it carefully in a box, under lock and key, and\nshe did not mean to disturb it, except perhaps now and then for a few\nmoments, that it might be looked at and admired. As for Emma, she went\non fitting the brown silk cover as neatly as she could; and hoping\nthat, if she prayed for the divine blessing, as her mother and aunt\nhad told her, she might learn from her precious Bible the way to be\ngood and happy.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\n\nTWO CHARACTERS.\n\nIt is time that I should tell you the age of these two little girls.\nLouisa was just turned of ten, and Emma was one year younger. I have\nno doubt that although you know so little about them, you already like\nEmma better than her sister; and the reason of this is plain. No one\ncould be long with Louisa without finding out that she was a selfish\nchild; while Emma, though she had many faults, of which carelessness\nwas the chief, was of a kind, good-natured disposition, always ready\nto oblige. Louisa, too, was often willful, and would not give up her\nown way; while Emma was humble-minded, knowing that she had much to\nlearn, and thankful to be taught. Both of these children were sinners,\nlike all who are born into this sinful world: but Louisa cared little\nabout the concerns of her soul; while Emma had begun to pray in secret\nfor pardon through Christ her Saviour, and for the new heart which is\nthe gift of his Holy Spirit.\n\nReader, you too are a sinner, and by nature far from God. Do you ever\nconsider what is your present state? Have you been brought near to him\nby the blood of Christ, the new and living way? You may have heard of\nthese things before, but without giving heed to the salvation of your\nown soul, or seeking to prepare for the world to come. If this has\nbeen the case, pause now, and ask yourself whither you are going, and\nwhat must be the end, if you do not repent and turn from sin. There\nare many awful texts in the Bible concerning those who trifle with the\noffers of divine mercy, and harden their hearts against the Saviour's\ngracious call. O! pray that you may not be one of this unhappy number.\nSeek the Lord while he may be found, before the day of grace is past.\nGod has said that his \"Spirit shall not always strive with man,\" Gen.\nvi, 3; and if you will not repent to-day, to-morrow may be too late.\n\nEmma's Bible was nicely covered, and laid in her own little drawer;\nand every morning she read a chapter before she went down stairs. She\nprayed that God would teach her by his Holy Spirit to understand what\nshe read; and though her prayers were very simple, and she scarcely\nknew what words to use, yet she felt sure that he would hear her,\nbecause he has promised to do so, for the sake of his dear Son. And by\ndegrees, as she began to love her Bible more and more, she learned a\nhabit of going to their little room alone, once in each day, to read a\nfew verses in private, and to offer a short prayer to her \"Father who\nseeth in secret.\" Matt, vi, 6. She found a great blessing in this; and\nit often happened that the thought of a text of Scripture which she\nhad been reading in her room alone would come into her mind when she\nwas afterward tempted to say or do something wrong, and thus help to\nkeep her from sin.\n\nIt was not so with Louisa. The Bible was often wanted in the\nschoolroom--for the children had a governess who came to teach them\nevery day; and Louisa soon found it too much trouble to take the book\nup stairs at night, and to carry it down again the next morning.\nBesides this, she did not always rise from her bed in time to read a\nchapter, so that it was often put off till after breakfast, and then\nit commonly happened that she had other things to do, and did not read\nit at all. Emma would sometimes gently remind her that her Bible\nreading had been forgotten; but this made Louisa so cross that she\nleft off doing so at last. The truth was, that this poor child had no\nreal love for the Scriptures; and as she did not seek for grace to\nhelp her, the good resolves that she had made passed away quickly from\nher mind.\n\nThe difference between the sisters was seen in their outward conduct;\nfor Emma's reading of the Bible would have been in vain if the effects\nhad not been shown in her temper and daily life. I do not mean to say\nthat she never went wrong; for Emma had still an evil nature, and a\nsinful heart, often leading her to forget the commands of God. But she\nwas truly sorry when this had been the case, and would ask to be\nforgiven with many tears; and she also prayed for divine grace, that\nshe might try to be more watchful for the time to come. Louisa, on the\nother hand, thought too highly of herself to be easily convinced of a\nfault; and as she seldom received reproof in an humble and proper\nmanner, she made but little progress toward improvement.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\n\nLETTERS FROM INDIA.\n\nSome months passed before there came a letter from Mrs. Harding; for\nIndia, as you know, is many thousands of miles from here, and it takes\na long time for a ship to sail over the wide sea which lies between.\nBut great was the joy of the children and their mother when at last\nthe good tidings came that, through the mercy of God, their friends\nhad reached that distant country, safe and well. Louisa danced and\nclapped her hands; and Emma felt very happy, sitting beside her\nmother, and looking up in her face, while she read the letter through\ntears of pleasure.\n\nMrs. Harding had written a few lines to the children, which their\nmother read aloud to them, and then allowed them to look at for\nthemselves. The words were these: \"I often think of you, dear Louisa\nand Emma, and pray for divine blessings upon you both; and I hope to\nhear that you are giving yourselves to the Saviour, who died upon the\ncross for you. You know the love of Jesus for the young; his kindness\nto them when he was upon earth; and the tender way in which he still\ninvites them to come to him. Go, then, to Christ without delay: ask\nhim to be your friend, and you will be happy for evermore.\"\n\nA few weeks after this letter had been received, Mrs. Western's\nbirthday arrived, when it was usual for her children to have a holiday\nand a little treat. On the morning of this day, as Emma was running up\nstairs, her mamma called to her from her dressing-room, and desired\nher to come in, and to shut the door. Emma did as she was bid; and\nthen Mrs. Western, with a smile on her face, told her to look round,\nand try if she could discover anything in the room that she had not\nseen before.\n\nAlmost before her mother had done speaking, the little girl fixed her\neyes upon a handsome work-box, standing upon the table with the lid\nopen, and showing a lining of pale blue silk, edged with silver; while\nwithin were scissors and thimble, an abundance of needles and cotton,\neverything, in short, that Emma had long been wishing for in vain.\n\n\"It is yours, my dear,\" said her mamma; \"it is a present from your\naunt Harding, who, in her letter, requested me to choose for you on my\nbirthday something that you would like, if your conduct should have\nbeen such as to deserve a token of our approval. I am happy to see\nthat you strive to amend your faults, and I trust that you will still\ngo on trying to improve.\"\n\n\"O, mamma, how beautiful! and how kind in aunt Harding! Indeed I will\ntry to deserve it.\" And the little girl went close to the box, and\nlooked at its contents, but without venturing to touch them; then\ngently closing the lid, she stood gazing upon it with silent delight.\n\n\"But, mamma,\" said Emma, looking up with a sudden thought, and casting\nher eyes round the room as if in search of something which was not to\nbe seen, \"where is Louisa's present? She would like a writing-desk, I\nknow; for the old work-box which she has had so long is not yet worn\nout, because she is so very careful.\"\n\n\"I am sorry to say,\" returned Mrs. Western, \"that Louisa is not\ndeserving of any present, and therefore it would have been wrong to\nprovide one for her.\"\n\nAt hearing this, Emma changed color, and looked almost ready to cry.\n\"Dear mamma,\" said she, \"do pray have pity on poor Louisa. I cannot\nbear to show her my beautiful box, if she is not to have a present\ntoo. She would be so much grieved.\"\n\n\"My dear,\" said Mrs. Western, \"do you not perceive that it would be\nunjust and contrary to your aunt's wish, if, while Louisa gives way to\nher faults, I were to treat her as though she were seeking to overcome\nthem? It is quite as painful to me as to yourself to make this needful\ndifference between you; but in all our actions we must think of what\nis _right_, and not of what it would be _pleasant_ to do. When I see\nany sign of improvement in your sister, I shall gladly provide her\nwith a writing-desk; but not till then.\"\n\nEmma paused for a moment; her eyes filled with tears, and the color\nrose to her face. \"Then mamma,\" said she, \"I will wait, if you please,\nfor my work-box, until you think proper to give Louisa her desk.\nPlease to put it away in some safe place, and I will not say anything\nabout it. I can do very well without the box a little while longer,\nyou know.\"\n\nWhen Mrs. Western found that Emma was willing to deny herself a\npleasure rather than give pain to her sister, she consented to her\nwish, because she desired to encourage kind and tender feelings\nbetween them; and she knew it would be easy to find some other way of\nshowing Louisa that her friends were grieved and displeased by her\nconduct. So the work-box was safely put away for the present; though\nEmma had her hopes that the time would soon come when, with the\npromised writing-desk, it might be again brought forward.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\n\nTROUBLE BETWEEN SISTERS.\n\nI have told you that Emma was not without her faults; and whether she\nwas a little lifted up by her mother's approval, so that she became\nless watchful over herself, and felt less her need of the grace of\nGod, I cannot say: but so it was, that on the very same evening of\ntheir mother's birthday, the sisters had a quarrel, which would\ncertainly have been worse, if Mrs. Western had not been sitting by.\nLouisa was the first to blame; but, on the other hand, Emma did not\nbehave like a meek and Christian child.\n\nIt was about Louisa's old work-box that this quarrel took place. Emma\nwished to have the use of it for a short time, as Louisa did not want\nit herself: but Louisa, as you have seen, was not very willing to\nlend; and some sharp and unkind words passed between them, such as\nchildren too often use when they give way to angry and sinful\npassions. No doubt the thought of her own work-box was in Emma's mind\nwhen she said, \"You are selfish and ill-natured, Louisa, and do not\ndeserve that people should give up any pleasure for you.\"\n\nWhile she was speaking, she saw her mother's eyes turned toward her\nwith a look of surprise and sorrow; and at the same moment the words\nof Scripture, \"Be kindly affectioned one toward another,\" came into\nher mind. She blushed and looked down while Mrs. Western reproved them\nboth, and told them of the grief which, she felt on account of their\nsinful conduct, reminding them also of the example of the meek and\nlowly Jesus, who has commanded us to live in love. Emma was soon\nbrought to tears, and went out of the room to weep alone, and ask\nforgiveness, for her Saviour's sake, from the holy God whom she had\ndispleased by her sin: but Louisa, as usual, was inclined to be\nsullen, and did not think that she had been at all in the wrong. Upon\nthis, her mother pointed out to her the unkindness of refusing so\nsmall a favor to her sister; and in the hope of bringing her to a\nsense of her fault, she told her what had passed in the morning, and\nmade known to her the whole affair of the work-box. Louisa was so much\nstruck by this proof of Emma's love, that her heart was quite\nsoftened, and she not only owned that she had done amiss, but ran to\nseek her sister, and asked her to forget their quarrel and be friends.\n\nEmma was very glad to agree to this, and was also ready to take her\nshare of blame, saying that she had been very wrong in speaking so\nunkindly, and she hoped never to be so naughty again. It was pleasant\nafter this, to see Louisa's desire that her sister should use the old\nwork-box, and what care Emma showed in keeping all its contents nicely\nin their place.\n\nThe loss of the birthday present had a great effect upon Louisa, so\nthat she became more watchful over her temper and conduct. In a few\nmonths she had improved so much, that though she was still far from\nbeing all that could be wished, yet her mother thought she might\nsafely buy her the writing-desk, according to the desire of her aunt\nHarding. Emma had still waited for her work-box with hope and\npatience; and you may imagine the joy of both when they at last\nreceived these long wished-for gifts. And as Emma was now not so\ncareless as formerly, and Louisa had grown more kind, the work-box and\nthe writing-desk were often lent in exchange; while the sisters soon\nfound out the truth of what their mother told them, that such little\nfrequent acts of mutual kindness do more to increase love than those\ngreater deeds which children sometimes talk about, but seldom have the\npower to perform.\n\nThe second packet from aunt Harding was received with not less joy\nthan the first; for there was in it a letter for Louisa and Emma; and\nthat she might show no favor to one above the other, she had directed\nit to both. Louisa, however, claimed and was allowed the privilege of\nbreaking the seal. I wish you could have seen their happy faces, as\nEmma leaned upon her sister's shoulder to read the welcome letter\nwhich had been sent to them from a country so distant, and by a friend\nwhom they loved so well.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\n\nAUNT HARDING'S LETTER.\n\nWould you like to know what aunt Harding Wrote to her nieces? Here\nthen is the letter, word for word:--\n\n\n\"MY DEAR CHILDREN, LOUISA AND EMMA,--It is with great pleasure that I\nread in your mamma's letter the account of your improvement, and I am\nglad to fulfill the promise which I made of writing to you when that\nshould be the case. I hope that you will go on trying to grow better\nand better; and for this end you should pray daily for the grace of\nGod to help you every moment of your lives. Without his grace the evil\ndesires of your sinful hearts will lead you from the right way; and as\none sin always brings on others, you would, if left to yourselves,\nwander further and further from that which is good, until you lost all\nlove for your Saviour and his commands.\n\n\"I often think of you, and wish that you could see the poor little\nHindoo children, who have never heard of the true God, but are taught\nby their heathen parents to kneel down, and pray to idols of wood and\nstone. There is a river in this country, the river Ganges, which the\npeople believe to be a goddess, and they think that its waters can\nwash away their sins. Mothers often bring their little infants and\nbathe them in this river, because they believe it will make them holy.\nDo you not pity these poor people, whose souls are perishing for want\nof knowledge? Do you not wish that some one would go among them, and\ntell them about Jesus the Son of God, who gave himself to die for\nsinners, and whose blood alone can wash away sin? If so, you will be\nglad to know that there are some good men here who have left their own\ndear home and friends to live in this heathen country, and to teach\nthe poor Hindoos the true and only way to heaven. Christians in other\nplaces, who love the Saviour, and wish that the heathen should learn\nto love him too, give money to send these good men here, and to pay\nfor Bibles, and for other books which have been written on purpose to\nshow how sinners may be saved. All may help to do this who will spare\na little money from their own wishes and wants. _You_ may help, if you\nlove the Saviour enough to deny yourselves some little pleasure now\nand then. I think you would resolve to do so, if you could go with me\nsometimes to the missionary school, and see the little children\nsitting in rows, learning to read about Jesus, and hear them asking\nfor more books to take home, that they may tell the tidings of\nsalvation to their heathen parents. O yes! I am sure you would want to\nhelp them then; for you would remember that heathen children, like\nyourselves, have souls which must live for ever and ever; and you\nwould long that they should come to the knowledge of the Saviour, who\ndied for them as well as for you.\n\n\"It is now time that I should finish this long letter; so farewell,\ndear Louisa and Emma. Your uncle sends his love to you. We often talk\nof you, and pray that you may be the children of God, through faith in\nhis dear Son. Your ever affectionate,\n\n\"AUNT HARDING.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\n\nUSE OF MONEY.\n\nEmma found a great deal to think about in this letter, and it led to\nfrequent talk with her mother about the heathen, for whom she began to\nfeel much concern. When she heard how Christian people were trying to\nhelp them, and had read some accounts which her mother lent to her,\ntelling of the happy change that, through the blessing of God, had\nbeen brought about in many cases by the preaching of the gospel,\n\n### Summary:\n\n"}

Jacobs\n\n\n\nTHE BOATSWAIN'S MATE\n\n[Illustration: \"The Boatswain's Mate\"]\n\nMr. George Benn, retired boat-swain, sighed noisily, and with a\ndespondent gesture, turned to the door and stood with the handle in his\nhand; Mrs. Waters, sitting behind the tiny bar in a tall Windsor-chair,\neyed him with some heat.\n\n\"My feelings'll never change,\" said the boatswain.\n\n\"Nor mine either,\" said the landlady, sharply.  \"It's a strange thing,\nMr. Benn, but you always ask me to marry you after the third mug.\"\n\n\"It's only to get my courage up,\" pleaded the boatswain.  \"Next time I'll\ndo it afore I 'ave a drop; that'll prove to you I'm in earnest.\"\n\nHe stepped outside and closed the door before the landlady could make a\nselection from the many retorts that crowded to her lips.\n\nAfter the cool bar, with its smell of damp saw-dust, the road seemed hot\nand dusty; but the boatswain, a prey to gloom natural to a man whose hand\nhas been refused five times in a fortnight, walked on unheeding.  His\nsteps lagged, but his brain was active.\n\nHe walked for two miles deep in thought, and then coming to a shady bank\ntook a seat upon an inviting piece of turf and lit his pipe.  The heat\nand the drowsy hum of bees made him nod; his pipe hung from the corner of\nhis mouth, and his eyes closed.\n\nHe opened them at the sound of approaching footsteps, and, feeling in his\npocket for matches, gazed lazily at the intruder.  He saw a tall man\ncarrying a small bundle over his shoulder, and in the erect carriage, the\nkeen eyes, and bronzed face had little difficulty in detecting the old\nsoldier.\n\nThe stranger stopped as he reached the seated boatswain and eyed him\npleasantly.\n\n\"Got a pipe o' baccy, mate?\" he inquired.\n\nThe boatswain handed him the small metal box in which he kept that\nluxury.\n\n\"Lobster, ain't you?\" he said, affably.\n\nThe tall man nodded.  \"Was,\" he replied.  \"Now I'm my own commander-in-\nchief.\"\n\n\"Padding it?\" suggested the boatswain, taking the box from him and\nrefilling his pipe.\n\nThe other nodded, and with the air of one disposed to conversation\ndropped his bundle in the ditch and took a seat beside him.  \"I've got\nplenty of time,\" he remarked.\n\nMr. Benn nodded, and for a while smoked on in silence.  A dim idea which\nhad been in his mind for some time began to clarify.  He stole a glance\nat his companion--a man of about thirty-eight, clear eyes, with humorous\nwrinkles at the corners, a heavy moustache, and a cheerful expression\nmore than tinged with recklessness.\n\n\"Ain't over and above fond o' work?\" suggested the boatswain, when he had\nfinished his inspection.\n\n\"I love it,\" said the other, blowing a cloud of smoke in the air, \"but we\ncan't have all we want in this world; it wouldn't be good for us.\"\n\nThe boatswain thought of Mrs. Waters, and sighed.  Then he rattled his\npocket.\n\n\"Would arf a quid be any good to you?\" he inquired.\n\n\"Look here,\" began the soldier; \"just because I asked you for a pipe o'\nbaccy--\"\n\n\"No offence,\" said the other, quickly.  \"I mean if you earned it?\"\n\nThe soldier nodded and took his pipe from his mouth.  \"Gardening and\nwindows?\" he hazarded, with a shrug of his shoulders.\n\nThe boatswain shook his head.\n\n\"Scrubbing, p'r'aps?\" said the soldier, with a sigh of resignation.\n\"Last house I scrubbed out I did it so thoroughly they accused me of\npouching the soap.  Hang 'em!\"\n\n\"And you didn't?\" queried the boatswain, eyeing him keenly.\n\nThe soldier rose and, knocking the ashes out of his pipe, gazed at him\ndarkly.  \"I can't give it back to you,\" he said, slowly, \"because I've\nsmoked some of it, and I can't pay you for it because I've only got\ntwopence, and that I want for myself.  So long, matey, and next time\na poor wretch asks you for a pipe, be civil.\"\n\n\"I never see such a man for taking offence in all my born days,\"\nexpostulated the boat-swain.  \"I 'ad my reasons for that remark, mate.\nGood reasons they was.\"\n\nThe soldier grunted and, stooping, picked up his bundle.\n\n\"I spoke of arf a sovereign just now,\" continued the boatswain,\nimpressively, \"and when I tell you that I offer it to you to do a bit o'\nburgling, you'll see 'ow necessary it is for me to be certain of your\nhonesty.\"\n\n\"_Burgling?_\" gasped the astonished soldier.  \"_Honesty?_  'Struth; are\nyou drunk or am I?\"\n\n\"Meaning,\" said the boatswain, waving the imputation away with his hand,\n\"for you to pretend to be a burglar.\"\n\n\"We're both drunk, that's what it is,\" said the other, resignedly.\n\nThe boatswain fidgeted.  \"If you don't agree, mum's the word and no 'arm\ndone,\" he said, holding out his hand.\n\n\"Mum's the word,\" said the soldier, taking it.  \"My name's Ned Travers,\nand, barring cells for a spree now and again, there's nothing against it.\nMind that.\"\n\n\"Might 'appen to anybody,\" said Mr. Benn, soothingly.  \"You fill your\npipe and don't go chucking good tobacco away agin.\"\n\nMr. Travers took the offered box and, with economy born of adversity,\nstooped and filled up first with the plug he had thrown away.  Then he\nresumed his seat and, leaning back luxuriously, bade the other \"fire\naway.\"\n\n\"I ain't got it all ship-shape and proper yet,\" said Mr. Benn, slowly,\n\"but it's in my mind's eye.  It's been there off and on like for some\ntime.\"\n\nHe lit his pipe again and gazed fixedly at the opposite hedge.  \"Two\nmiles from here, where I live,\" he said, after several vigorous puffs,\n\"there's a little public-'ouse called the Beehive, kept by a lady wot\nI've got my eye on.\"\n\nThe soldier sat up.\n\n\"She won't 'ave me,\" said the boatswain, with an air of mild surprise.\n\nThe soldier leaned back again.\n\n\"She's a lone widder,\" continued Mr. Benn, shaking his head, \"and the\nBeehive is in a lonely place.  It's right through the village, and the\nnearest house is arf a mile off.\"\n\n\"Silly place for a pub,\" commented Mr. Travers.\n\n\"I've been telling her 'ow unsafe it is,\" said the boatswain.  \"I've been\ntelling her that she wants a man to protect her, and she only laughs at\nme.  She don't believe it; d'ye see?  Likewise I'm a small man--small,\nbut stiff.  She likes tall men.\"\n\n\"Most women do,\" said Mr. Travers, sitting upright and instinctively\ntwisting his moustache.  \"When I was in the ranks--\"\n\n\"My idea is,\" continued the boatswain, slightly raising his voice, \"to\nkill two birds with one stone--prove to her that she does want being\nprotected, and that I'm the man to protect her.  D'ye take my meaning,\nmate?\"\n\nThe soldier reached out a hand and felt the other's biceps.  \"Like a lump\no' wood,\" he said, approvingly.\n\n\"My opinion is,\" said the boatswain, with a faint smirk, \"that she loves\nme without knowing it.\"\n\n\"They often do,\" said Mr. Travers, with a grave shake of his head.\n\n\"Consequently I don't want 'er to be disappointed,\" said the other.\n\n\"It does you credit,\" remarked Mr. Travers.\n\n\"I've got a good head,\" said Mr. Benn, \"else I shouldn't 'ave got my\nrating as boatswain as soon as I did; and I've been turning it over in my\nmind, over and over agin, till my brain-pan fair aches with it.  Now, if\nyou do what I want you to to-night and it comes off all right, damme I'll\nmake it a quid.\"\n\n\"Go on, Vanderbilt,\" said Mr. Travers; \"I'm listening.\"\n\nThe boatswain gazed at him fixedly.  \"You meet me 'ere in this spot at\neleven o'clock to-night,\" he said, solemnly; \"and I'll take you to her\n'ouse and put you through a little winder I know of.  You goes upstairs\nand alarms her, and she screams for help.  I'm watching the house,\nfaithful-like, and hear 'er scream.  I dashes in at the winder, knocks\nyou down, and rescues her.  D'ye see?\"\n\n\"I hear,\" corrected Mr. Travers, coldly.\n\n\"She clings to me,\" continued the boat-swain, with a rapt expression of\nface, \"in her gratitood, and, proud of my strength and pluck, she marries\nme.\"\n\n\"An' I get a five years' honeymoon,\" said the soldier.\n\nThe boatswain shook his head and patted the other's shoulder.  \"In the\nexcitement of the moment you spring up and escape,\" he said, with a\nkindly smile.  \"I've thought it all out.  You can run much faster than I\ncan; any-ways, you will.  The nearest 'ouse is arf a mile off, as I said,\nand her servant is staying till to-morrow at 'er mother's, ten miles\naway.\"\n\nMr. Travers rose to his feet and stretched himself.  \"Time I was\ntoddling,\" he said, with a yawn.  \"Thanks for amusing me, mate.\"\n\n\"You won't do it?\" said the boatswain, eyeing him with much concern.\n\n\"I'm hanged if I do,\" said the soldier, emphatically.  \"Accidents will\nhappen, and then where should I be?\"\n\n\"If they did,\" said the boatswain, \"I'd own up and clear you.\"\n\n\"You might,\" said Mr. Travers, \"and then again you mightn't.  So long,\nmate.\"\n\n\"I--I'll make it two quid,\" said the boat-swain, trembling with\neagerness.  \"I've took a fancy to you; you're just the man for the job.\"\n\nThe soldier, adjusting his bundle, glanced at him over his shoulder.\n\"Thankee,\" he said, with mock gratitude.\n\n\"Look 'ere,\" said the boatswain, springing up and catching him by the\nsleeve; \"I'll give it to you in writing.  Come, you ain't faint-hearted?\nWhy, a bluejacket 'ud do it for the fun o' the thing.  If I give it to\nyou in writing, and there should be an accident, it's worse for me than\nit is for you, ain't it?\"\n\nMr. Travers hesitated and, pushing his cap back, scratched his head.\n\n\"I gives you the two quid afore you go into the house,\" continued the\nboatswain, hastily following up the impression he had made.  \"I'd give\n'em to you now if I'd got 'em with me.  That's my confidence in you; I\nlikes the look of you.  Soldier or sailor, when there is a man's work to\nbe done, give 'em to me afore anybody.\"\n\n[Illustration: \"'I gives you the two quid afore you go into the house,'\ncontinued the boatswain.\"]\n\nThe soldier seated himself again and let his bundle fall to the ground.\n\"Go on,\" he said, slowly.  \"Write it out fair and square and sign it, and\nI'm your man.\"\n\nThe boatswain clapped him on the shoulder and produced a bundle of papers\nfrom his pocket.  \"There's letters there with my name and address on\n'em,\" he said.  \"It's all fair, square, and above-board.  When you've\ncast your eyes over them I'll give you the writing.\"\n\nMr. Travers took them and, re-lighting his pipe, smoked in silence, with\nvarious side glances at his companion as that enthusiast sucked his\npencil and sat twisting in the agonies of composition.  The document\nfinished--after several failures had been retrieved and burnt by the\ncareful Mr. Travers--the boat-swain heaved a sigh of relief, and handing\nit over to him, leaned back with a complacent air while he read it.\n\n\"Seems all right,\" said the soldier, folding it up and putting it in his\nwaistcoat-pocket.  \"I'll be here at eleven to-night.\"\n\n\"Eleven it is,\" said the boatswain, briskly, \"and, between pals--here's\narf a dollar to go on with.\"\n\nHe patted him on the shoulder again, and with a caution to keep out of\nsight as much as possible till night walked slowly home.  His step was\nlight, but he carried a face in which care and exultation were strangely\nmingled.\n\nBy ten o'clock that night care was in the ascendant, and by eleven, when\nhe discerned the red glow of Mr. Travers's pipe set as a beacon against a\ndark background of hedge, the boatswain was ready to curse his inventive\npowers.  Mr. Travers greeted him cheerily and, honestly attributing the\nfact to good food and a couple of pints of beer he had had since the\nboatswain left him, said that he was ready for anything.\n\nMr. Benn grunted and led the way in silence.  There was no moon, but the\nnight was clear, and Mr. Travers, after one or two light-hearted attempts\nat conversation, abandoned the effort and fell to whistling softly\ninstead.\n\nExcept for one lighted window the village slept in darkness, but the\nboatswain, who had been walking with the stealth of a Red Indian on the\nwar-path, breathed more freely after they had left it behind.  A renewal\nof his antics a little farther on apprised Mr. Travers that they were\napproaching their destination, and a minute or two later they came to a\nsmall inn standing just off the road.  \"All shut up and Mrs. Waters abed,\nbless her,\" whispered the boatswain, after walking care-fully round the\nhouse.  \"How do you feel?\"\n\n\"I'm all right,\" said Mr. Travers.  \"I feel as if I'd been burgling all\nmy life.  How do you feel?\"\n\n\"Narvous,\" said Mr. Benn, pausing under a small window at the rear of the\nhouse.  \"This is the one.\"\n\nMr. Travers stepped back a few paces and gazed up at the house.  All was\nstill.  For a few moments he stood listening and then re-joined the\nboatswain.\n\n\"Good-bye, mate,\" he said, hoisting himself on to the sill.  \"Death or\nvictory.\"\n\nThe boatswain whispered and thrust a couple of sovereigns into his hand.\n\"Take your time; there's no hurry,\" he muttered.  \"I want to pull myself\ntogether.  Frighten 'er enough, but not too much.  When she screams I'll\ncome in.\"\n\nMr. Travers slipped inside and then thrust his head out of the window.\n\"Won't she think it funny you should be so handy?\" he inquired.\n\n\"No; it's my faithful 'art,\" said the boat-swain, \"keeping watch over her\nevery night, that's the ticket.  She won't know no better.\"\n\nMr. Travers grinned, and removing his boots passed them out to the other.\n\"We don't want her to hear me till I'm upstairs,\" he whispered.  \"Put 'em\noutside, handy for me to pick up.\"\n\nThe boatswain obeyed, and Mr. Travers--who was by no means a good hand at\ndarning socks--shivered as he trod lightly over a stone floor.  Then,\nfollowing the instructions of Mr. Benn, he made his way to the stairs and\nmounted noiselessly.\n\nBut for a slight stumble half-way up his progress was very creditable for\nan amateur.  He paused and listened and, all being silent, made his way\nto the landing and stopped out-side a door.  Despite himself his heart\nwas beating faster than usual.\n\nHe pushed the door open slowly and started as it creaked.  Nothing\nhappening he pushed again, and standing just inside saw, by a small ewer\nsilhouetted against the casement, that he was in a bedroom.  He listened\nfor the sound of breathing, but in vain.\n\n\"Quiet sleeper,\" he reflected; \"or perhaps it is an empty room.  Now, I\nwonder whether--\"\n\nThe sound of an opening door made him start violently, and he stood\nstill, scarcely breathing, with his ears on the alert.  A light shone on\nthe landing, and peeping round the door he saw a woman coming along the\ncorridor--a younger and better-looking woman than he had expected to\nsee.  In one hand she held aloft a candle, in the other she bore a\ndouble-barrelled gun.  Mr. Travers withdrew into the room and, as the\nlight came nearer, slipped into a big cupboard by the side of the\nfireplace and, standing bolt upright, waited.  The light came into the\nroom.\n\n\"Must have been my fancy,\" said a pleasant voice.\n\n\"Bless her,\" smiled Mr. Travers.\n\nHis trained ear recognized the sound of cocking triggers.  The next\nmoment a heavy body bumped against the door of the cupboard and the key\nturned in the lock.\n\n\"Got you!\" said the voice, triumphantly.  \"Keep still; if you try and\nbreak out I shall shoot you.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Mr. Travers, hastily; \"I won't move.\"\n\n\"Better not,\" said the voice.  \"Mind, I've got a gun pointing straight at\nyou.\"\n\n\"Point it downwards, there's a good girl,\" said Mr. Travers, earnestly;\n\"and take your finger off the trigger.  If anything happened to me you'd\nnever forgive yourself.\"\n\n\"It's all right so long as you don't move,\" said the voice; \"and I'm not\na girl,\" it added, sternly.\n\n\"Yes, you are,\" said the prisoner.  \"I saw you.  I thought it was an\nangel at first.  I saw your little bare feet and--\"\n\nA faint scream interrupted him.\n\n\"You'll catch cold,\" urged Mr. Travers.\n\n\"Don't you trouble about me,\" said the voice, tartly.\n\n\"I won't give any trouble,\" said Mr. Travers, who began to think it was\ntime for the boatswain to appear on the scene.  \"Why don't you call for\nhelp?  I'll go like a lamb.\"\n\n\"I don't want your advice,\" was the reply.  \"I know what to do.  Now,\ndon't you try and break out.  I'm going to fire one barrel out of the\nwindow, but I've got the other one for you if you move.\"\n\n\"My dear girl,\" protested the horrified Mr. Travers, \"you'll alarm the\nneighbourhood.\"\n\n\"Just what I want to do,\" said the voice.  \"Keep still, mind.\"\n\nMr. Travers hesitated.  The game was up, and it was clear that in any\ncase the stratagem of the ingenious Mr. Benn would have to be disclosed.\n\n\"Stop!\" he said, earnestly.  \"Don't do anything rash.  I'm not a burglar;\nI'm doing this for a friend of yours--Mr. Benn.\"\n\n\"What?\" said an amazed voice.\n\n\"True as I stand here,\" asseverated Mr. Travers.  \"Here, here's my\ninstructions.  I'll put 'em under the door, and if you go to the back\nwindow you'll see him in the garden waiting.\"\n\nHe rustled the paper under the door, and it was at once snatched from his\nfingers.  He regained an upright position and stood listening to the\nstartled and indignant exclamations of his gaoler as she read the\nboatswain's permit:\n\n     \"_This is to give notice that I, George Benn, being of sound mind\n     and body, have told Ned Travers to pretend to be a burglar at Mrs.\n     Waters's.  He ain't a burglar, and I shall be outside all the time.\n     It's all above-board and ship-shape.\n\n     \"(Signed) George Benn_\"\n\n\"Sound mind--above-board--ship-shape,\" repeated a dazed voice.  \"Where is\nhe?\"\n\n\"Out at the back,\" replied Mr. Travers.  \"If you go to the window you can\nsee him.  Now, do put something round your shoulders, there's a good\ngirl.\"\n\nThere was no reply, but a board creaked.  He waited for what seemed a\nlong time, and then the board creaked again.\n\n\"Did you see him?\" he inquired.\n\n\"I did,\" was the sharp reply.  \"You both ought to be ashamed of\nyourselves.  You ought to be punished.\"\n\n\"There is a clothes-peg sticking into the back of my head,\" remarked Mr.\nTravers.  \"What are you going to do?\"\n\nThere was no reply.\n\n\"What are you going to do?\" repeated Mr. Travers, somewhat uneasily.\n\"You look too nice to do anything hard; leastways, so far as I can judge\nthrough this crack.\"\n\nThere was a smothered exclamation, and then sounds of somebody moving\nhastily about the room and the swish of clothing hastily donned.\n\n\"You ought to have done it before,\" commented the thoughtful Mr. Travers.\n\"It's enough to give you your death of cold.\"\n\n\"Mind your business,\" said the voice, sharply.  \"Now, if I let you out,\nwill you promise to do exactly as I tell you?\"\n\n\"Honour bright,\" said Mr. Travers, fervently.\n\n\"I'm going to give Mr. Benn a lesson he won't forget,\" proceeded the\nother, grimly.  \"I'm going to fire off this gun, and then run down and\ntell him I've killed you.\"\n\n\"Eh?\"  said the amazed Mr. Travers.  \"Oh, Lord!\"\n\n\"H'sh!  Stop that laughing,\" commanded the voice.  \"He'll hear you.  Be\nquiet!\"\n\nThe key turned in the lock, and Mr. Travers, stepping forth, clapped his\nhand over his mouth and endeavoured to obey.  Mrs. Waters, stepping back\nwith the gun ready, scrutinized him closely.\n\n\"Come on to the landing,\" said Mr. Travers, eagerly.  \"We don't want\nanybody else to hear.  Fire into this.\"\n\nHe snatched a patchwork rug from the floor and stuck it up against the\nbalusters.  \"You stay here,\" said Mrs. Waters.  He nodded.\n\nShe pointed the gun at the hearth-rug, the walls shook with the\nexplosion, and, with a shriek that set Mr. Travers's teeth on edge, she\nrushed downstairs and, drawing back the bolts of the back door, tottered\noutside and into the arms of the agitated boatswain.\n\n\"Oh! oh! oh!\" she cried.\n\n\"What--what's the matter?\" gasped the boatswain.\n\nThe widow struggled in his arms.  \"A burglar,\" she said, in a tense\nwhisper.  \"But it's all right; I've killed him.\"\n\n\"Kill--\" stuttered the other.  \"Kill----_Killed him?_\"\n\nMrs. Waters nodded and released herself, \"First shot,\" she said, with a\nsatisfied air.\n\nThe boatswain wrung his hands.  \"Good heavens!\" he said, moving slowly\ntowards the door.  \"Poor fellow!\"\n\n\"Come back,\" said the widow, tugging at his coat.\n\n\"I was--was going to see--whether I could do anything for 'im,\" quavered\nthe boatswain.  \"Poor fellow!\"\n\n\"You stay where you are,\" commanded Mrs. Waters.  \"I don't want any\nwitnesses.  I don't want this house to have a bad name.  I'm going to\nkeep it quiet.\"\n\n\"Quiet?\" said the shaking boatswain.  \"How?\"\n\n\"First thing to do,\" said the widow, thoughtfully, \"is to get rid of the\nbody.  I'll bury him in the garden, I think.  There's a very good bit of\nground behind those potatoes.  You'll find the spade in the tool-house.\"\n\nThe horrified Mr. Benn stood stock-still regarding her.\n\n\"While you're digging the grave,\" continued Mrs. 'Waters, calmly, \"I'll\ngo in and clean up the mess.\"\n\nThe boatswain reeled and then fumbled with trembling fingers at his\ncollar.\n\nLike a man in a dream he stood watching as she ran to the tool-house and\nreturned with a spade and pick; like a man in a dream he followed her on\nto the garden.\n\n\"Be careful,\" she said, sharply; \"you're treading down my potatoes.\"\n\nThe boatswain stopped dead and stared at her.  Apparently unconscious of\nhis gaze, she began to pace out the measurements and then, placing the\ntools in his hands, urged him to lose no time.\n\n\"I'll bring him down when you're gone,\" she said, looking towards the\nhouse.\n\nThe boatswain wiped his damp brow with the back of his hand.  \"How are\nyou going to get it downstairs?\" he breathed.\n\n\"Drag it,\" said Mrs. Waters, briefly.\n\n\"Suppose he isn't dead?\" said the boat-swain, with a gleam of hope.\n\n\"Fiddlesticks!\" said Mrs. Waters.  \"Do you think I don't know?  Now,\ndon't waste time talking; and mind you dig it deep.  I'll put a few\ncabbages on top afterwards--I've got more than I want.\"\n\nShe re-entered the house and ran lightly upstairs.  The candle was still\nalight and the gun was leaning against the bed-post; but the visitor had\ndisappeared.  Conscious of an odd feeling of disappointment, she looked\nround the empty room.\n\n\"Come and look at him,\" entreated a voice, and she turned and beheld the\namused countenance of her late prisoner at the door.\n\n\"I've been watching from the back window,\" he said, nodding.  \"You're a\nwonder; that's what you are.  Come and look at him.\"\n\nMrs. Waters followed, and leaning out of the window watched with simple\npleasure the efforts of the amateur sexton.  Mr. Benn was digging like\none possessed, only pausing at intervals to straighten his back and to\ncast a fearsome glance around him.  The only thing that marred her\npleasure was the behaviour of Mr. Travers, who was struggling for a place\nwith all the fervour of a citizen at the Lord Mayor's show.\n\n\"Get back,\" she said, in a fierce whisper.  \"He'll see you.\"\n\nMr. Travers with obvious reluctance obeyed, just as the victim looked up.\n\n\"Is that you, Mrs. Waters?\" inquired the boatswain, fearfully.\n\n\"Yes, of course it is,\" snapped the widow.  \"Who else should it be, do\nyou think?  Go on!  What are you stopping for?\"\n\nMr. Benn's breathing as he bent to his task again was distinctly audible.\nThe head of Mr. Travers ranged itself once more alongside the widow's.\nFor a long time they watched in silence.\n\n\"Won't you come down here, Mrs. Waters?\" called the boatswain, looking up\nso suddenly that Mr. Travers's head bumped painfully against the side of\nthe window.  \"It's a bit creepy, all alone.\"\n\n\"I'm all right,\" said Mrs. Waters.\n\n\"I keep fancying there's something dodging behind them currant bushes,\"\npursued the unfortunate Mr. Benn, hoarsely.  \"How you can stay there\nalone I can't think.  I thought I saw something looking over your\nshoulder just now.  Fancy if it came creeping up behind and caught hold\nof you!  The widow gave a sudden faint scream.\n\n\"If you do that again\" she said, turning fiercely on Mr. Travers.\n\n\"He put it into my head,\" said the culprit, humbly; \"I should never have\nthought of such a thing by myself.  I'm one of the quietest and\nbest-behaved----\"\n\n\"Make haste, Mr. Benn,\" said the widow, turning to the window again;\n\"I've got a lot to do when you've finished.\"\n\nThe boatswain groaned and fell to digging again, and Mrs. Waters, after\nwatching a little while longer, gave Mr. Travers some pointed\ninstructions about the window and went down to the garden again.\n\n\"That will do, I think,\" she said, stepping into the hole and regarding\nit critically.  \"Now you'd better go straight off home, and, mind, not a\nword to a soul about this.\"\n\nShe put her hand on his shoulder, and noticing with pleasure that he\nshuddered at her touch led the way to the gate.  The boat-swain paused\nfor a moment, as though about to speak, and then, apparently thinking\nbetter of it, bade her good-bye in a hoarse voice and walked feebly up\nthe road.  Mrs. Waters stood watching until his steps died away in the\ndistance, and then, returning to the garden, took up the spade and stood\nregarding with some dismay the mountainous result of his industry.  Mr.\nTravers, who was standing just inside the back door, joined her.\n\n\"Let me,\" he said, gallantly.\n\nThe day was breaking as he finished his task.  The clean, sweet air and\nthe exercise had given him an appetite to which the smell of cooking\nbacon and hot coffee that proceeded from the house had set a sharper\nedge.  He took his coat from a bush and put it on.  Mrs. Waters appeared\nat the door.\n\n\"You had better come in and have some breakfast before you go,\" she said,\nbrusquely; \"there's no more sleep for me now.\"\n\nMr. Travers obeyed with alacrity, and after a satisfying wash in the\nscullery came into the big kitchen with his face shining and took a seat\nat the table.  The cloth was neatly laid, and Mrs. Waters, fresh and\ncool, with a smile upon her pleasant face, sat behind the tray.  She\nlooked at her guest curiously, Mr. Travers's spirits being somewhat\nhigher than the state of his wardrobe appeared to justify.\n\n\"Why don't you get some settled work?\" she inquired, with gentle\nseverity, as he imparted snatches of his history between bites.\n\n\"Easier said than done,\" said Mr. Travers, serenely.  \"But don't you run\naway with the idea that I'm a beggar, because I'm not.  I pay my way,\nsuch as it is.  And, by-the-bye, I s'pose I haven't earned that two\npounds Benn gave me?\"\n\n\n\n### Summary:\n\n"}

But perhaps it may be possible to unsay\nsome of the things which have been said, and which, though they were at\none time new, have never at any time been strictly true.\n\nThe character of Washington, emerging splendid from the dust and tumult\nof those great conflicts in which he played the leading part, has passed\nsuccessively into three media of obscuration, from each of which his\nfigure, like the sun shining through vapors, has received some disguise\nof shape and color. First came the mist of mythology, in which we\ndiscerned the new St. George, serene, impeccable, moving through an\norchard of ever-blooming cherry-trees, gracefully vanquishing dragons\nwith a touch, and shedding fragrance and radiance around him. Out of\nthat mythological mist we groped our way, to find ourselves beneath the\nrolling clouds of oratory, above which the head of the hero was\npinnacled in remote grandeur, like a sphinx poised upon a volcanic peak,\nisolated and mysterious. That altitudinous figure still dominates the\ncloudy landscapes of the after-dinner orator; but the frigid, academic\nmind has turned away from it, and looking through the fog of criticism\nhas descried another Washington, not really an American, not amazingly a\nhero, but a very decent English country gentleman, honorable,\ncourageous, good, shrewd, slow, and above all immensely lucky.\n\nNow here are two of the things often said about Washington which need,\nif I mistake not, to be unsaid: first, that he was a solitary and\ninexplicable phenomenon of greatness; and second, that he was not an\nAmerican.\n\nSolitude, indeed, is the last quality that an intelligent student of his\ncareer would ascribe to him. Dignified and reserved he was, undoubtedly;\nand as this manner was natural to him, he won more true friends by\nusing it than if he had disguised himself in a forced familiarity and\nworn his heart upon his sleeve. But from first to last he was a man who\ndid his work in the bonds of companionship, who trusted his comrades in\nthe great enterprise even though they were not his intimates, and who\nneither sought nor occupied a lonely eminence of unshared glory. He was\nnot of the jealous race of those who\n\n    \"Bear, like the Turk, no brother near the throne\";\n\nnor of the temper of George III., who chose his ministers for their\nvacuous compliancy. Washington was surrounded by men of similar though\nnot of equal strength--Franklin, Hamilton, Knox, Greene, the Adamses,\nJefferson, Madison. He stands in history not as a lonely pinnacle like\nMount Shasta, elevated above the plain\n\n    \"By drastic lift of pent volcanic fires\";\n\nbut as the central summit of a mountain range, with all his noble\nfellowship of kindred peaks about him, enhancing his unquestioned\nsupremacy by their glorious neighborhood and their great support.\n\nAmong these men whose union in purpose and action made the strength and\nstability of the republic, Washington was first, not only in the\nlargeness of his nature, the loftiness of his desires, and the vigor of\nhis will, but also in that representative quality which makes a man able\nto stand as the true hero of a great people. He had an instinctive power\nto divine, amid the confusions of rival interests and the cries of\nfactional strife, the new aims and hopes, the vital needs and\naspirations, which were the common inspiration of the people's cause\nand the creative forces of the American nation. The power to understand\nthis, the faith to believe in it, and the unselfish courage to live for\nit, was the central factor of Washington's life, the heart and fountain\nof his splendid Americanism.\n\nIt was denied during his lifetime, for a little while, by those who\nenvied his greatness, resented his leadership, and sought to shake him\nfrom his lofty place. But he stood serene and imperturbable, while that\ndenial, like many another blast of evil-scented wind, passed into\nnothingness, even before the disappearance of the party strife out of\nwhose fermentation it had arisen. By the unanimous judgment of his\ncountrymen for two generations after his death he was hailed as _Pater\nPatriae_; and the age which conferred that title was too ingenuous to\nsuppose that the father could be of a different race from his own\noffspring.\n\nBut the modern doubt is more subtle, more curious, more refined in its\nmethods. It does not spring, as the old denial did, from a partisan\nhatred, which would seek to discredit Washington by an accusation of\nundue partiality for England, and thus to break his hold upon the love\nof the people. It arises, rather, like a creeping exhalation, from a\nmodern theory of what true Americanism really is: a theory which goes\nback, indeed, for its inspiration to Dr. Johnson's somewhat crudely\nexpressed opinion that \"the Americans were a race whom no other mortals\ncould wish to resemble\"; but which, in its later form, takes counsel\nwith those British connoisseurs who demand of their typical American\nnot depravity of morals but deprivation of manners, not vice of heart\nbut vulgarity of speech, not badness but bumptiousness, and at least\nenough of eccentricity to make him amusing to cultivated people.\n\nNot a few of our native professors and critics are inclined to accept\nsome features of this view, perhaps in mere reaction from the unamusing\ncharacter of their own existence. They are not quite ready to subscribe\nto Mr. Kipling's statement that the real American is\n\n    \"Unkempt, disreputable, vast,\"\n\nI remember reading somewhere that Tennyson had an idea that Longfellow,\nwhen he met him, would put his feet upon the table. And it is precisely\nbecause Longfellow kept his feet in their proper place, in society as\nwell as in verse, that some critics, nowadays, would have us believe\nthat he was not a truly American poet.\n\nTraces of this curious theory of Americanism in its application to\nWashington may now be found in many places. You shall hear historians\ndescribe him as a transplanted English commoner, a second edition of\nJohn Hampden. You shall read, in a famous poem, of Lincoln as\n\n    \"New birth of our new soil, the _first_ American.\"\n\nHe knew it, I say: and by what divination? By a test more searching than\nany mere peculiarity of manners, dress, or speech; by a touchstone able\nto divide the gold of essential character from the alloy of superficial\ncharacteristics; by a standard which disregarded alike Franklin's fur\ncap and Putnam's old felt hat, Morgan's leather leggings and\nWitherspoon's black silk gown and John Adams's lace ruffles, to\nrecognize and approve, beneath these various garbs, the vital sign of\nAmerica woven into the very souls of the men who belonged to her by a\nspiritual birthright.\n\nFor what is true Americanism, and where does it reside? Not on the\ntongue, nor in the clothes, nor among the transient social forms,\nrefined or rude, which mottle the surface of human life. The log cabin\nhas no monopoly of it, nor is it an immovable fixture of the stately\npillared mansion. Its home is not on the frontier nor in the populous\ncity, not among the trees of the wild forest nor the cultured groves of\nAcademe. Its dwelling is in the heart. It speaks a score of dialects but\none language, follows a hundred paths to the same goal, performs a\nthousand kinds of service in loyalty to the same ideal which is its\nlife. True Americanism is this:\n\nTo believe that the inalienable rights of man to life, liberty, and the\npursuit of happiness are given by God.\n\nTo believe that any form of power that tramples on these rights is\nunjust.\n\nTo believe that taxation without representation is tyranny, that\ngovernment must rest upon the consent of the governed, and that the\npeople should choose their own rulers.\n\nTo believe that freedom must be safeguarded by law and order, and that\nthe end of freedom is fair play for all.\n\nTo believe not in a forced equality of conditions and estates, but in a\ntrue equalization of burdens, privileges, and opportunities.\n\nTo believe that the selfish interests of persons, classes, and sections\nmust be subordinated to the welfare of the commonwealth.\n\nTo believe that union is as much a human necessity as liberty is a\ndivine gift.\n\nTo believe, not that all people are good, but that the way to make them\nbetter is to trust the whole people.\n\nTo believe that a free state should offer an asylum to the oppressed,\nand an example of virtue, sobriety, and fair dealing to all nations.\n\nTo believe that for the existence and perpetuity of such a state a man\nshould be willing to give his whole service, in property, in labor, and\nin life.\n\nThat is Americanism; an ideal embodying itself in a people; a creed\nheated white hot in the furnace of conviction and hammered into shape on\nthe anvil of life; a vision commanding men to follow it whithersoever it\nmay lead them. And it was the subordination of the personal self to that\nideal, that creed, that vision, which gave eminence and glory to\nWashington and the men who stood with him.\n\nThis is the truth that emerges, crystalline and luminous, from the\nconflicts and confusions of the Revolution. The men who were able to\nsurrender themselves and all their interests to the pure and loyal\nservice of their ideal were the men who made good, the victors crowned\nwith glory and honor. The men who would not make that surrender, who\nsought selfish ends, who were controlled by personal ambition and the\nlove of gain, who were willing to stoop to crooked means to advance\ntheir own fortunes, were the failures, the lost leaders, and, in some\ncases, the men whose names are embalmed in their own infamy. The\nultimate secret of greatness is neither physical nor intellectual, but\nmoral. It is the capacity to lose self in the service of something\ngreater. It is the faith to recognize, the will to obey, and the\nstrength to follow, a star.\n\nWashington, no doubt, was pre-eminent among his contemporaries in\nnatural endowments. Less brilliant in his mental gifts than some, less\neloquent and accomplished than others, he had a rare balance of large\npowers which justified Lowell's phrase of \"an imperial man.\" His\nathletic vigor and skill, his steadiness of nerve restraining an\nintensity of passion, his undaunted courage which refused no necessary\nrisks and his prudence which took no unnecessary ones, the quiet\nsureness with which he grasped large ideas and the pressing energy with\nwhich he executed small details, the breadth of his intelligence, the\ndepth of his convictions, his power to apply great thoughts and\nprinciples to every-day affairs, and his singular superiority to current\nprejudices and illusions--these were gifts in combination which would\nhave made him distinguished in any company, in any age.\n\nBut what was it that won and kept a free field for the exercise of these\ngifts? What was it that secured for them a long, unbroken opportunity of\ndevelopment in the activities of leadership, until they reached the\nsummit of their perfection? It was a moral quality. It was the evident\nmagnanimity of the man, which assured the people that he was no\nself-seeker who would betray their interests for his own glory or rob\nthem for his own gain. It was the supreme magnanimity of the man, which\nmade the best spirits of the time trust him implicitly, in war and\npeace, as one who would never forget his duty or his integrity in the\nsense of his own greatness.\n\nFrom the first, Washington appears not as a man aiming at prominence or\npower, but rather as one under obligation to serve a cause. Necessity\nwas laid upon him, and he met it willingly. After Washington's\nmarvellous escape from death in his first campaign for the defence of\nthe colonies, the Rev. Samuel Davies, fourth president of Princeton\nCollege, spoke of him in a sermon as \"that heroic youth, Colonel\nWashington, whom I can but hope Providence has hitherto preserved in so\nsignal a manner for some important service to his country.\" It was a\nprophetic voice, and Washington was not disobedient to the message.\nChosen to command the Army of the Revolution in 1775, he confessed to\nhis wife his deep reluctance to surrender the joys of home, acknowledged\npublicly his feeling that he was not equal to the great trust committed\nto him, and then, accepting it as thrown upon him \"by a kind of\ndestiny,\" he gave himself body and soul to its fulfilment refusing all\npay beyond the mere discharge of his expenses, of which he kept a strict\naccount, and asking no other reward than the success of the cause which\nhe served.\n\n\"Ah, but he was a rich man,\" cries the carping critic; \"he could afford\nto do it.\" How many rich men to-day avail themselves of their\nopportunity to indulge in this kind of extravagance, toiling\ntremendously without a salary, neglecting their own estate for the\npublic benefit, seeing their property diminished without complaint, and\ncoming into serious financial embarrassment, even within sight of\nbankruptcy, as Washington did, merely for the gratification of a desire\nto serve the people? This is indeed a very singular and noble form of\nluxury. But the wealth which makes it possible neither accounts for its\nexistence nor detracts from its glory. It is the fruit of a manhood\nsuperior alike to riches and to poverty, willing to risk all, and to use\nall, for the common good.\n\nWas it in any sense a misfortune for the people of America, even the\npoorest among them, that there was a man able to advance sixty-four\nthousand dollars out of his own purse, with no other security but his\nown faith in their cause, to pay his daily expenses while he was leading\ntheir armies? This unsecured loan was one of the very things, I doubt\nnot, that helped to inspire general confidence. Even so the prophet\nJeremiah purchased a field in Anathoth, in the days when Judah was\ncaptive unto Babylon, paying down the money, seventeen shekels of\nsilver, as a token of his faith that the land would some day be\ndelivered from the enemy and restored to peaceful and orderly\nhabitation.\n\nWashington's substantial pledge of property to the cause of liberty was\nrepaid by a grateful country at the close of the war. But not a dollar\nof payment for the tremendous toil of body and mind, not a dollar for\nwork \"overtime,\" for indirect damages to his estate, for commissions on\nthe benefits which he secured for the general enterprise, for the use of\nhis name or the value of his counsel, would he receive.\n\nA few years later, when his large sagacity perceived that the\ndevelopment of internal commerce was one of the first needs of the new\ncountry, at a time when he held no public office, he became president of\na company for the extension of navigation on the rivers James and\nPotomac. The Legislature of Virginia proposed to give him a hundred and\nfifty shares of stock. Washington refused this, or any other kind of\npay, saying that he could serve the people better in the enterprise if\nhe were known to have no selfish interest in it. He was not the kind of\na man to reconcile himself to a gratuity (which is the Latinized word\nfor a \"tip\" offered to a person not in livery), and if the modern\nmethods of \"coming in on the ground-floor\" and \"taking a rake-off\" had\nbeen explained and suggested to him, I suspect that he would have\ndescribed them in language more notable for its force than for its\nelegance.\n\nIt is true, of course, that the fortune which he so willingly imperilled\nand impaired recouped itself again after peace was established, and his\nindustry and wisdom made him once more a rich man for those days. But\nwhat injustice was there in that? It is both natural and right that men\nwho have risked their all to secure for the country at large what they\ncould have secured for themselves by other means, should share in the\ngeneral prosperity attendant upon the success of their efforts and\nsacrifices for the common good.\n\nI am sick of the shallow judgment that ranks the worth of a man by his\npoverty or by his wealth at death. Many a selfish speculator dies poor.\nMany an unselfish patriot dies prosperous. It is not the possession of\nthe dollar that cankers the soul, it is the worship of it. The true test\nof a man is this: Has he labored for his own interest, or for the\ngeneral welfare? Has he earned his money fairly or unfairly? Does he use\nit greedily or generously? What does it mean to him, a personal\nadvantage over his fellow-men, or a personal opportunity of serving\nthem?\n\nThere are a hundred other points in Washington's career in which the\nsame supremacy of character, magnanimity focussed on service to an\nideal, is revealed in conduct. I see it in the wisdom with which he, a\nson of the South, chose most of his generals from the North, that he\nmight secure immediate efficiency and unity in the army. I see it in the\ngenerosity with which he praised the achievements of his associates,\ndisregarding jealous rivalries, and ever willing to share the credit of\nvictory as he was to bear the burden of defeat. I see it in the patience\nwith which he suffered his fame to be imperilled for the moment by\nreverses and retreats, if only he might the more surely guard the frail\nhope of ultimate victory for his country. I see it in the quiet dignity\nwith which he faced the Conway Cabal, not anxious to defend his own\nreputation and secure his own power, but nobly resolute to save the army\nfrom being crippled and the cause of liberty from being wrecked. I see\nit in the splendid self-forgetfulness which cleansed his mind of all\ntemptation to take personal revenge upon those who had sought to injure\nhim in that base intrigue. I read it in his letter of consolation and\nencouragement to the wretched Gates after the defeat at Camden. I hear\nthe prolonged reechoing music of it in his letter to General Knox in\n1798, in regard to military appointments, declaring his wish to \"avoid\nfeuds with those who are embarked in the same general enterprise with\nmyself.\"\n\nListen to the same spirit as it speaks in his circular address to the\ngovernors of the different States, urging them to \"forget their local\nprejudices and policies; to make those mutual concessions which are\nrequisite to the general prosperity, and in some instances to sacrifice\ntheir individual advantages to the interest of the community.\" Watch\nhow it guides him unerringly through the critical period of American\nhistory which lies between the success of the Revolution and the\nestablishment of the nation, enabling him to avoid the pitfalls of\nsectional and partisan strife, and to use his great influence with the\npeople in leading them out of the confusion of a weak confederacy into\nthe strength of an indissoluble union of sovereign States.\n\nSee how he once more sets aside his personal preferences for a quiet\ncountry life, and risks his already secure popularity, together with his\nreputation for consistency, by obeying the voice which calls him to be a\ncandidate for the Presidency. See how he chooses for the cabinet and for\nthe Supreme Court, not an exclusive group of personal friends, but men\nwho can be trusted to serve the great cause of Union with fidelity and\npower--Jefferson, Randolph, Hamilton, Knox, John Jay, Wilson, Cushing,\nRutledge. See how patiently and indomitably he gives himself to the toil\nof office, deriving from his exalted station no gain \"beyond the lustre\nwhich may be reflected from its connection with a power of promoting\nhuman felicity.\" See how he retires, at last, to the longed-for joys of\nprivate life, confessing that his career has not been without errors of\njudgment, beseeching the Almighty that they may bring no harm to his\ncountry, and asking no other reward for his labors than to partake, \"in\nthe midst of my fellow-citizens, the benign influence of good laws under\na free government, the ever favorite object of my heart.\"\n\nOh, sweet and stately words, revealing, through their calm reserve, the\ninmost secret of a life that did not flare with transient enthusiasm but\nglowed with unquenchable devotion to a cause! \"The ever favorite object\nof my heart\"--how quietly, how simply he discloses the source and origin\nof a sublime consecration, a lifelong heroism! Thus speaks the victor in\ncalm retrospect of the long battle. But if you would know the depth and\nthe intensity of the divine fire that burned within his breast you must\ngo back to the dark and icy days of Valley Forge, and hear him cry in\npassion unrestrained: \"If I know my own mind, I could offer myself a\nliving sacrifice to the butchering enemy, provided that would contribute\nto the people's ease. I would be a living offering to the savage fury\nand die by inches to save the people.\"\n\n\"_The ever favorite object of my heart_!\" I strike this note again and\nagain, insisting upon it, harping upon it; for it is the key-note of the\nmusic. It is the capacity to find such an object in the success of the\npeople's cause, to follow it unselfishly, to serve it loyally, that\ndistinguishes the men who stood with Washington and who deserve to share\nhis fame. I read the annals of the Revolution, and I find everywhere\nthis secret and searching test dividing the strong from the weak, the\nnoble from the base, the heirs of glory from the captives of oblivion\nand the inheritors of shame. It was the unwillingness to sink and forget\nself in the service of something greater that made the failures and\nwrecks of those tempestuous times, through which the single-hearted and\nthe devoted pressed on to victory and honor.\n\nTurn back to the battle of Saratoga. There were two Americans on that\nfield who suffered under a great personal disappointment: Philip\nSchuyler, who was unjustly supplanted in command of the army by General\nGates; and Benedict Arnold, who was deprived by envy of his due share in\nthe glory of winning the battle. Schuyler forgot his own injury in\nloyalty to the cause, offered to serve Gates in any capacity, and went\nstraight on to the end of his noble life giving all that he had to his\ncountry. But in Arnold's heart the favorite object was not his country,\nbut his own ambition, and the wound which his pride received at Saratoga\nrankled and festered and spread its poison through his whole nature,\nuntil he went forth from the camp, \"a leper white as snow.\"\n\nWhat was it that made Charles Lee, as fearless a man as ever lived, play\nthe part of a coward in order to hide his treason at the battle of\nMonmouth? It was the inward eating corruption of that selfish vanity\nwhich caused him to desire the defeat of an army whose command he had\nwished but failed to attain. He had offered his sword to America for his\nown glory, and when that was denied him, he withdrew the offering, and\ndied, as he had lived, to himself.\n\nWhat was it that tarnished the fame of Gates and Wilkinson and Burr and\nConway? What made their lives, and those of men like them, futile and\ninefficient compared with other men whose natural gifts were less? It\nwas the taint of dominant selfishness that ran through their careers,\nnow hiding itself, now breaking out in some act of malignity or\ntreachery. Of the common interest they were reckless, provided they\nmight advance their own. Disappointed in that \"ever favorite object of\ntheir hearts,\" they did not hesitate to imperil the cause in whose\nservice they were enlisted.\n\nTurn to other cases, in which a charitable judgment will impute no\npositive betrayal of trusts, but a defect of vision to recognize the\nclaim of the higher ideal. Tory or Revolutionist a man might be,\naccording to his temperament and conviction; but where a man begins\nwith protests against tyranny and ends with subservience to it, we look\nfor the cause. What was it that separated Joseph Galloway from Francis\nHopkinson? It was Galloway's opinion that, while the struggle for\nindependence might be justifiable, it could not be successful, and the\ntemptation of a larger immediate reward under the British crown than\ncould ever be given by the American Congress in which he had once\nserved. What was it that divided the Rev. Jacob Duche from the Rev.\nJohn Witherspoon? It was Duche's fear that the cause for which he had\nprayed so eloquently in the first Continental Congress was doomed after\nthe capture of Philadelphia, and his unwillingness to go down with that\ncause instead of enjoying the comfortable fruits of his native wit and\neloquence in an easy London chaplaincy. What was it that cut William\nFranklin off from his professedly prudent and worldly wise old father,\nBenjamin? It was the luxurious and benumbing charm of the royal\ngovernorship of New Jersey.\n\n\"Professedly prudent\" is the phrase that I have chosen to apply to\nBenjamin Franklin. For the one thing that is clear, as we turn to look\nat him and the other men who stood with Washington, is that, whatever\ntheir philosophical professions may have been, they were not controlled\nby prudence. They were really imprudent, and at heart willing to take\nall risks of poverty and death in a struggle whose cause was just though\nits issue was dubious. If it be rashness to commit honor and life and\nproperty to a great adventure for the general good, then these men were\nrash to the verge of recklessness. They refused no peril, they withheld\nno sacrifice, in the following of their ideal.\n\nI hear John Dickinson saying: \"It is not our duty to leave wealth to our\nchildren, but it is our duty to leave liberty to them. We have counted\nthe cost of this contest, and we find nothing so dreadful as voluntary\nslavery.\" I see Samuel Adams, impoverished, living upon a pittance,\nhardly able to provide a decent coat for his back, rejecting with scorn\nthe offer of a profitable office, wealth, a title even, to win him from\nhis allegiance to the cause of America. I see Robert Morris, the wealthy\nmerchant, opening his purse and pledging his credit to support the\nRevolution, and later devoting all his fortune and his energy to restore\nand establish the financial honor of the Republic, with the memorable\nwords, \"The United States may command all that I have, except my\nintegrity.\" I hear the proud John Adams saying to his wife, \"I have\naccepted a seat in the House of Representatives, and thereby have\nconsented to my own ruin, to your ruin, and the ruin of our children\";\nand I hear her reply, with the tears running down her face, \"Well, I am\nwilling in this cause to run all risks with you, and be ruined with you,\nif you are ruined,\" I see Benjamin Franklin, in the Congress of 1776,\nalready past his seventieth year, prosperous, famous, by far the most\ncelebrated man in America, accepting without demur the difficult and\ndangerous mission to France, and whispering to his friend, Dr. Rush, \"I\nam old and good for nothing, but as the store-keepers say of their\nremnants of cloth, 'I am but a fag-end, and you may have me for what\nyou please.'\"\n\nHere is a man who will illustrate and prove, perhaps better than any\nother of those who stood with Washington, the point at which I am\naiming. There was none of the glamour of romance about old Ben Franklin.\nHe was shrewd, canny, humorous. The chivalric Southerners disliked his\nphilosophy, and the solemn New-Englanders mistrusted his jokes. He made\nno extravagant claims for his own motives, and some of his ways were not\ndistinctly ideal. He was full of prudential proverbs, and claimed to be\na follower of the theory of enlightened self-interest. But there was not\na faculty of his wise old head which he did not put at the service of\nhis country, nor was there a pulse of his slow and steady heart which\ndid not beat loyal to the cause of freedom.\n\nHe forfeited profitable office and sure preferment under the crown, for\nhard work, uncertain pay, and certain peril in behalf of the colonies.\nHe followed the inexorable logic, step by step, which led him from the\nnatural rights of his countrymen to their liberty, from their liberty\nto their independence. He endured with a grim humor the revilings of\nthose whom he called \"malevolent critics and bug-writers.\" He broke with\nhis old and dear associates in England, writing to one of them,\n\n    \"You and I were long friends; you are now my enemy and I am Yours,\n    B. Franklin.\"\n\nHe never flinched or faltered at any sacrifice of personal ease or\ninterest to the demands of his country. His patient, skilful, laborious\nefforts in France did as much for the final victory of the American\ncause as any soldier's sword. He yielded his own opinions in regard to\nthe method of making the treaty of peace with England, and thereby\nimperilled for a time his own prestige. He served as president of\nPennsylvania three times, devoting all his salary to public\nbenefactions. His influence in the Constitutional Convention was\nsteadfast on the side of union and harmony, though in many things he\ndiffered from the prevailing party. His voice was among those who hailed\nWashington as the only possible candidate for the Presidency. His last\npublic act was a petition to Congress for the abolition of slavery. At\nhis death the government had not yet settled his accounts in its\nservice, and his country was left apparently his debtor; which, in a\nsense still larger and deeper, she must remain as long as liberty\nendures and union triumphs in the Republic.\n\nIs not this, after all, the root of the whole matter? Is not this the\nthing that is vitally and essentially true of all those great men,\nclustering about Washington, whose fame we honor and revere with his?\nThey all left the community, the commonwealth, the race, in debt to\nthem. This was their purpose and the ever-favorite object of their\nhearts. They were deliberate and joyful creditors. Renouncing the maxim\nof worldly wisdom which bids men \"get all you can and keep all you get,\"\nthey resolved rather to give all they had to advance the common cause,\nto use every benefit conferred upon them in the service of the general\nwelfare, to bestow upon the world more than they received from it, and\nto leave a fair and unblotted account of business done with life which\nshould show a clear balance in their favor.\n\nThus, in brief outline, and in words which seem poor and inadequate, I\nhave ventured to interpret anew the story of Washington and the men who\nstood with him: not as a stirring ballad of battle and danger, in which\nthe knights ride valiantly, and are renowned for their mighty strokes at\nthe enemy in arms; not as a philosophic epic, in which the development\nof a great national idea is displayed, and the struggle of opposing\npolicies is traced to its conclusion; but as a drama of the eternal\nconflict in the soul of man between self-interest in its Protean forms,\nand loyalty to the right, service to a cause, allegiance to an ideal.\n\nThose great actors who played in it have passed away, but the same drama\nstill holds the stage. The drop-curtain falls between the acts; the\nscenery shifts; the music alters; but the crisis and its issues are\nunchanged, and the parts which you and I play are assigned to us by our\nown choice of \"the ever favorite object of our hearts.\"\n\nMen tell us that the age of ideals is past, and that we are now come to\nthe age of expediency, of polite indifference to moral standards, of\ncareful attention to the bearing of different policies upon our own\npersonal interests. Men tell us that the rights of man are a poetic\nfiction, that democracy has nothing in it to command our allegiance\nunless it promotes our individual comfort and prosperity, and that the\nwhole duty of a citizen is to vote with his party and get an office for\nhimself, or for some one who will look\n\n### Summary:\n\n"}
