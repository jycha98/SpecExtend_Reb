The palace of LEONTES\n\nEnter CAMILLO and ARCHIDAMUS\n\n  ARCHIDAMUS. If you shall chance, Camillo, to visit Bohemia, on\nthe\n    like occasion whereon my services are now on foot, you shall\nsee,\n    as I have said, great difference betwixt our Bohemia and your\n    Sicilia.\n  CAMILLO. I think this coming summer the King of Sicilia means\nto\n    pay Bohemia the visitation which he justly owes him.\n  ARCHIDAMUS. Wherein our entertainment shall shame us we will be\n    justified in our loves; for indeed-\n  CAMILLO. Beseech you-\n  ARCHIDAMUS. Verily, I speak it in the freedom of my knowledge:\nwe\n    cannot with such magnificence, in so rare- I know not what to\n    say. We will give you sleepy drinks, that your senses,\n    unintelligent of our insufficience, may, though they cannot\n    praise us, as little accuse us.\n  CAMILLO. You pay a great deal too dear for what's given freely.\n  ARCHIDAMUS. Believe me, I speak as my understanding instructs\nme\n    and as mine honesty puts it to utterance.\n  CAMILLO. Sicilia cannot show himself overkind to Bohemia. They\nwere\n    train'd together in their childhoods; and there rooted\nbetwixt\n    them then such an affection which cannot choose but branch\nnow.\n    Since their more mature dignities and royal necessities made\n    separation of their society, their encounters, though not\n    personal, have been royally attorneyed with interchange of\ngifts,\n    letters, loving embassies; that they have seem'd to be\ntogether,\n    though absent; shook hands, as over a vast; and embrac'd as\nit\n    were from the ends of opposed winds. The heavens continue\ntheir\n    loves!\n  ARCHIDAMUS. I think there is not in the world either malice or\n    matter to alter it. You have an unspeakable comfort of your\nyoung\n    Prince Mamillius; it is a gentleman of the greatest promise\nthat\n    ever came into my note.\n  CAMILLO. I very well agree with you in the hopes of him. It is\na\n    gallant child; one that indeed physics the subject, makes old\n    hearts fresh; they that went on crutches ere he was born\ndesire\n    yet their life to see him a man.\n  ARCHIDAMUS. Would they else be content to die?\n  CAMILLO. Yes; if there were no other excuse why they should\ndesire\n    to live.\n  ARCHIDAMUS. If the King had no son, they would desire to live\non\n    crutches till he had one.\n                                                          Exeunt\n\n\n\n\n\nSicilia. The palace of LEONTES\n\nEnter LEONTES, POLIXENES, HERMIONE, MAMILLIUS, CAMILLO, and\nATTENDANTS\n\n  POLIXENES. Nine changes of the wat'ry star hath been\n    The shepherd's note since we have left our throne\n    Without a burden. Time as long again\n    Would be fill'd up, my brother, with our thanks;\n    And yet we should for perpetuity\n    Go hence in debt. And therefore, like a cipher,\n    Yet standing in rich place, I multiply\n    With one 'We thank you' many thousands moe\n    That go before it.\n  LEONTES. Stay your thanks a while,\n    And pay them when you part.\n  POLIXENES. Sir, that's to-morrow.\n    I am question'd by my fears of what may chance\n    Or breed upon our absence, that may blow\n    No sneaping winds at home, to make us say\n    'This is put forth too truly.' Besides, I have stay'd\n    To tire your royalty.\n  LEONTES. We are tougher, brother,\n    Than you can put us to't.\n  POLIXENES. No longer stay.\n  LEONTES. One sev'night longer.\n  POLIXENES. Very sooth, to-morrow.\n  LEONTES. We'll part the time between's then; and in that\n    I'll no gainsaying.\n  POLIXENES. Press me not, beseech you, so.\n    There is no tongue that moves, none, none i' th' world,\n    So soon as yours could win me. So it should now,\n    Were there necessity in your request, although\n    'Twere needful I denied it. My affairs\n    Do even drag me homeward; which to hinder\n    Were in your love a whip to me; my stay\n    To you a charge and trouble. To save both,\n    Farewell, our brother.\n  LEONTES. Tongue-tied, our Queen? Speak you.\n  HERMIONE. I had thought, sir, to have held my peace until\n    You had drawn oaths from him not to stay. You, sir,\n    Charge him too coldly. Tell him you are sure\n    All in Bohemia's well- this satisfaction\n    The by-gone day proclaim'd. Say this to him,\n    He's beat from his best ward.\n  LEONTES. Well said, Hermione.\n  HERMIONE. To tell he longs to see his son were strong;\n    But let him say so then, and let him go;\n    But let him swear so, and he shall not stay;\n    We'll thwack him hence with distaffs.\n    [To POLIXENES]  Yet of your royal presence I'll\n    adventure the borrow of a week. When at Bohemia\n    You take my lord, I'll give him my commission\n    To let him there a month behind the gest\n    Prefix'd for's parting.- Yet, good deed, Leontes,\n    I love thee not a jar o' th' clock behind\n    What lady she her lord.- You'll stay?\n  POLIXENES. No, madam.\n  HERMIONE. Nay, but you will?\n  POLIXENES. I may not, verily.\n  HERMIONE. Verily!\n    You put me off with limber vows; but I,\n    Though you would seek t' unsphere the stars with oaths,\n    Should yet say 'Sir, no going.' Verily,\n    You shall not go; a lady's 'verily' is\n    As potent as a lord's. Will go yet?\n    Force me to keep you as a prisoner,\n    Not like a guest; so you shall pay your fees\n    When you depart, and save your thanks. How say you?\n    My prisoner or my guest? By your dread 'verily,'\n    One of them you shall be.\n  POLIXENES. Your guest, then, madam:\n    To be your prisoner should import offending;\n    Which is for me less easy to commit\n    Than you to punish.\n  HERMIONE. Not your gaoler then,\n    But your kind. hostess. Come, I'll question you\n    Of my lord's tricks and yours when you were boys.\n    You were pretty lordings then!\n  POLIXENES. We were, fair Queen,\n    Two lads that thought there was no more behind\n    But such a day to-morrow as to-day,\n    And to be boy eternal.\n  HERMIONE. Was not my lord\n    The verier wag o' th' two?\n  POLIXENES. We were as twinn'd lambs that did frisk i' th' sun\n    And bleat the one at th' other. What we chang'd\n    Was innocence for innocence; we knew not\n    The doctrine of ill-doing, nor dream'd\n    That any did. Had we pursu'd that life,\n    And our weak spirits ne'er been higher rear'd\n    With stronger blood, we should have answer'd heaven\n    Boldly 'Not guilty,' the imposition clear'd\n    Hereditary ours.\n  HERMIONE. By this we gather\n    You have tripp'd since.\n  POLIXENES. O my most sacred lady,\n    Temptations have since then been born to 's, for\n    In those unfledg'd days was my wife a girl;\n    Your precious self had then not cross'd the eyes\n    Of my young playfellow.\n  HERMIONE. Grace to boot!\n    Of this make no conclusion, lest you say\n    Your queen and I are devils. Yet, go on;\n    Th' offences we have made you do we'll answer,\n    If you first sinn'd with us, and that with us\n    You did continue fault, and that you slipp'd not\n    With any but with us.\n  LEONTES. Is he won yet?\n  HERMIONE. He'll stay, my lord.\n  LEONTES. At my request he would not.\n    Hermione, my dearest, thou never spok'st\n    To better purpose.\n  HERMIONE. Never?\n  LEONTES. Never but once.\n  HERMIONE. What! Have I twice said well? When was't before?\n    I prithee tell me; cram's with praise, and make's\n    As fat as tame things. One good deed dying tongueless\n    Slaughters a thousand waiting upon that.\n    Our praises are our wages; you may ride's\n    With one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere\n    With spur we heat an acre. But to th' goal:\n    My last good deed was to entreat his stay;\n    What was my first? It has an elder sister,\n    Or I mistake you. O, would her name were Grace!\n    But once before I spoke to th' purpose- When?\n    Nay, let me have't; I long.\n  LEONTES. Why, that was when\n    Three crabbed months had sour'd themselves to death,\n    Ere I could make thee open thy white hand\n    And clap thyself my love; then didst thou utter\n    'I am yours for ever.'\n  HERMIONE. 'Tis Grace indeed.\n    Why, lo you now, I have spoke to th' purpose twice:\n    The one for ever earn'd a royal husband;\n    Th' other for some while a friend.\n                                  [Giving her hand to POLIXENES]\n  LEONTES.  [Aside]  Too hot, too hot!\n    To mingle friendship far is mingling bloods.\n    I have tremor cordis on me; my heart dances,\n    But not for joy, not joy. This entertainment\n    May a free face put on; derive a liberty\n    From heartiness, from bounty, fertile bosom,\n    And well become the agent. 'T may, I grant;\n    But to be paddling palms and pinching fingers,\n    As now they are, and making practis'd smiles\n    As in a looking-glass; and then to sigh, as 'twere\n    The mort o' th' deer. O, that is entertainment\n    My bosom likes not, nor my brows! Mamillius,\n    Art thou my boy?\n  MAMILLIUS. Ay, my good lord.\n  LEONTES. I' fecks!\n    Why, that's my bawcock. What! hast smutch'd thy nose?\n    They say it is a copy out of mine. Come, Captain,\n    We must be neat- not neat, but cleanly, Captain.\n    And yet the steer, the heifer, and the calf,\n    Are all call'd neat.- Still virginalling\n    Upon his palm?- How now, you wanton calf,\n    Art thou my calf?\n  MAMILLIUS. Yes, if you will, my lord.\n  LEONTES. Thou want'st a rough pash and the shoots that I have,\n    To be full like me; yet they say we are\n    Almost as like as eggs. Women say so,\n    That will say anything. But were they false\n    As o'er-dy'd blacks, as wind, as waters- false\n    As dice are to be wish'd by one that fixes\n    No bourn 'twixt his and mine; yet were it true\n    To say this boy were like me. Come, sir page,\n    Look on me with your welkin eye. Sweet villain!\n    Most dear'st! my collop! Can thy dam?- may't be?\n    Affection! thy intention stabs the centre.\n    Thou dost make possible things not so held,\n    Communicat'st with dreams- how can this be?-\n    With what's unreal thou coactive art,\n    And fellow'st nothing. Then 'tis very credent\n    Thou mayst co-join with something; and thou dost-\n    And that beyond commission; and I find it,\n    And that to the infection of my brains\n    And hard'ning of my brows.\n  POLIXENES. What means Sicilia?\n  HERMIONE. He something seems unsettled.\n  POLIXENES. How, my lord!\n    What cheer? How is't with you, best brother?\n  HERMIONE. You look\n    As if you held a brow of much distraction.\n    Are you mov'd, my lord?\n  LEONTES. No, in good earnest.\n    How sometimes nature will betray its folly,\n    Its tenderness, and make itself a pastime\n    To harder bosoms! Looking on the lines\n    Of my boy's face, methoughts I did recoil\n    Twenty-three years; and saw myself unbreech'd,\n    In my green velvet coat; my dagger muzzl'd,\n    Lest it should bite its master and so prove,\n    As ornaments oft do, too dangerous.\n    How like, methought, I then was to this kernel,\n    This squash, this gentleman. Mine honest friend,\n    Will you take eggs for money?\n  MAMILLIUS. No, my lord, I'll fight.\n  LEONTES. You will? Why, happy man be's dole! My brother,\n    Are you so fond of your young prince as we\n    Do seem to be of ours?\n  POLIXENES. If at home, sir,\n    He's all my exercise, my mirth, my matter;\n    Now my sworn friend, and then mine enemy;\n    My parasite, my soldier, statesman, all.\n    He makes a July's day short as December,\n    And with his varying childness cures in me\n    Thoughts that would thick my blood.\n  LEONTES. So stands this squire\n    Offic'd with me. We two will walk, my lord,\n    And leave you to your graver steps. Hermione,\n    How thou lov'st us show in our brother's welcome;\n    Let what is dear in Sicily be cheap;\n    Next to thyself and my young rover, he's\n    Apparent to my heart.\n  HERMIONE. If you would seek us,\n    We are yours i' th' garden. Shall's attend you there?\n  LEONTES. To your own bents dispose you; you'll be found,\n    Be you beneath the sky.  [Aside]  I am angling now,\n    Though you perceive me not how I give line.\n    Go to, go to!\n    How she holds up the neb, the bill to him!\n    And arms her with the boldness of a wife\n    To her allowing husband!\n\n                      Exeunt POLIXENES, HERMIONE, and ATTENDANTS\n\n    Gone already!\n    Inch-thick, knee-deep, o'er head and ears a fork'd one!\n    Go, play, boy, play; thy mother plays, and I\n    Play too; but so disgrac'd a part, whose issue\n    Will hiss me to my grave. Contempt and clamour\n    Will be my knell. Go, play, boy, play. There have been,\n    Or I am much deceiv'd, cuckolds ere now;\n    And many a man there is, even at this present,\n    Now while I speak this, holds his wife by th' arm\n    That little thinks she has been sluic'd in's absence,\n    And his pond fish'd by his next neighbour, by\n    Sir Smile, his neighbour. Nay, there's comfort in't,\n    Whiles other men have gates and those gates open'd,\n    As mine, against their will. Should all despair\n    That hath revolted wives, the tenth of mankind\n    Would hang themselves. Physic for't there's none;\n    It is a bawdy planet, that will strike\n    Where 'tis predominant; and 'tis pow'rfull, think it,\n    From east, west, north, and south. Be it concluded,\n    No barricado for a belly. Know't,\n    It will let in and out the enemy\n    With bag and baggage. Many thousand on's\n    Have the disease, and feel't not. How now, boy!\n  MAMILLIUS. I am like you, they say.\n  LEONTES. Why, that's some comfort.\n    What! Camillo there?\n  CAMILLO. Ay, my good lord.\n  LEONTES. Go play, Mamillius; thou'rt an honest man.\n                                                  Exit MAMILLIUS\n    Camillo, this great sir will yet stay longer.\n  CAMILLO. You had much ado to make his anchor hold;\n    When you cast out, it still came home.\n  LEONTES. Didst note it?\n  CAMILLO. He would not stay at your petitions; made\n    His business more material.\n  LEONTES. Didst perceive it?\n    [Aside]  They're here with me already; whisp'ring, rounding,\n    'Sicilia is a so-forth.' 'Tis far gone\n    When I shall gust it last.- How came't, Camillo,\n    That he did stay?\n  CAMILLO. At the good Queen's entreaty.\n  LEONTES. 'At the Queen's' be't. 'Good' should be pertinent;\n    But so it is, it is not. Was this taken\n    By any understanding pate but thine?\n    For thy conceit is soaking, will draw in\n    More than the common blocks. Not noted, is't,\n    But of the finer natures, by some severals\n    Of head-piece extraordinary? Lower messes\n    Perchance are to this business purblind? Say.\n  CAMILLO. Business, my lord? I think most understand\n    Bohemia stays here longer.\n  LEONTES. Ha?\n  CAMILLO. Stays here longer.\n  LEONTES. Ay, but why?\n  CAMILLO. To satisfy your Highness, and the entreaties\n    Of our most gracious mistress.\n  LEONTES. Satisfy\n    Th' entreaties of your mistress! Satisfy!\n    Let that suffice. I have trusted thee, Camillo,\n    With all the nearest things to my heart, as well\n    My chamber-councils, wherein, priest-like, thou\n    Hast cleans'd my bosom- I from thee departed\n    Thy penitent reform'd; but we have been\n    Deceiv'd in thy integrity, deceiv'd\n    In that which seems so.\n  CAMILLO. Be it forbid, my lord!\n  LEONTES. To bide upon't: thou art not honest; or,\n    If thou inclin'st that way, thou art a coward,\n    Which hoxes honesty behind, restraining\n    From course requir'd; or else thou must be counted\n    A servant grafted in my serious trust,\n    And therein negligent; or else a fool\n    That seest a game play'd home, the rich stake drawn,\n    And tak'st it all for jest.\n  CAMILLO. My gracious lord,\n    I may be negligent, foolish, and fearful:\n    In every one of these no man is free\n    But that his negligence, his folly, fear,\n    Among the infinite doings of the world,\n    Sometime puts forth. In your affairs, my lord,\n    If ever I were wilfull-negligent,\n    It was my folly; if industriously\n    I play'd the fool, it was my negligence,\n    Not weighing well the end; if ever fearful\n    To do a thing where I the issue doubted,\n    Whereof the execution did cry out\n    Against the non-performance, 'twas a fear\n    Which oft infects the wisest. These, my lord,\n    Are such allow'd infirmities that honesty\n    Is never free of. But, beseech your Grace,\n    Be plainer with me; let me know my trespass\n    By its own visage; if I then deny it,\n    'Tis none of mine.\n  LEONTES. Ha' not you seen, Camillo-\n    But that's past doubt; you have, or your eye-glass\n    Is thicker than a cuckold's horn- or heard-\n    For to a vision so apparent rumour\n    Cannot be mute- or thought- for cogitation\n    Resides not in that man that does not think-\n    My wife is slippery? If thou wilt confess-\n    Or else be impudently negative,\n    To have nor eyes nor ears nor thought- then say\n    My wife's a hobby-horse, deserves a name\n    As rank as any flax-wench that puts to\n    Before her troth-plight. Say't and justify't.\n  CAMILLO. I would not be a stander-by to hear\n    My sovereign mistress clouded so, without\n    My present vengeance taken. Shrew my heart!\n    You never spoke what did become you less\n    Than this; which to reiterate were sin\n    As deep as that, though true.\n  LEONTES. Is whispering nothing?\n    Is leaning cheek to cheek? Is meeting noses?\n    Kissing with inside lip? Stopping the career\n    Of laughter with a sigh?- a note infallible\n    Of breaking honesty. Horsing foot on foot?\n    Skulking in corners? Wishing clocks more swift;\n    Hours, minutes; noon, midnight? And all eyes\n    Blind with the pin and web but theirs, theirs only,\n    That would unseen be wicked- is this nothing?\n    Why, then the world and all that's in't is nothing;\n    The covering sky is nothing; Bohemia nothing;\n    My is nothing; nor nothing have these nothings,\n    If this be nothing.\n  CAMILLO. Good my lord, be cur'd\n    Of this diseas'd opinion, and betimes;\n    For 'tis most dangerous.\n  LEONTES. Say it be, 'tis true.\n  CAMILLO. No, no, my lord.\n  LEONTES. It is; you lie, you lie.\n    I say thou liest, Camillo, and I hate thee;\n    Pronounce thee a gross lout, a mindless slave,\n    Or else a hovering temporizer that\n    Canst with thine eyes at once see good and evil,\n    Inclining to them both. Were my wife's liver\n    Infected as her life, she would not live\n    The running of one glass.\n  CAMILLO. Who does her?\n  LEONTES. Why, he that wears her like her medal, hanging\n    About his neck, Bohemia; who- if I\n    Had servants true about me that bare eyes\n    To see alike mine honour as their profits,\n    Their own particular thrifts, they would do that\n    Which should undo more doing. Ay, and thou,\n    His cupbearer- whom I from meaner form\n    Have bench'd and rear'd to worship; who mayst see,\n    Plainly as heaven sees earth and earth sees heaven,\n    How I am gall'd- mightst bespice a cup\n    To give mine enemy a lasting wink;\n    Which draught to me were cordial.\n  CAMILLO. Sir, my lord,\n    I could do this; and that with no rash potion,\n    But with a ling'ring dram that should not work\n    Maliciously like poison. But I cannot\n    Believe this crack to be in my dread mistress,\n    So sovereignly being honourable.\n    I have lov'd thee-\n  LEONTES. Make that thy question, and go rot!\n    Dost think I am so muddy, so unsettled,\n    To appoint myself in this vexation; sully\n    The purity and whiteness of my sheets-\n    Which to preserve is sleep, which being spotted\n    Is goads, thorns, nettles, tails of wasps;\n    Give scandal to the blood o' th' Prince, my son-\n    Who I do think is mine, and love as mine-\n    Without ripe moving to 't? Would I do this?\n    Could man so blench?\n  CAMILLO. I must believe you, sir.\n    I do; and will fetch off Bohemia for't;\n    Provided that, when he's remov'd, your Highness\n    Will take again your queen as yours at first,\n    Even for your son's sake; and thereby for sealing\n    The injury of tongues in courts and kingdoms\n    Known and allied to yours.\n  LEONTES. Thou dost advise me\n    Even so as I mine own course have set down.\n    I'll give no blemish to her honour, none.\n  CAMILLO. My lord,\n    Go then; and with a countenance as clear\n    As friendship wears at feasts, keep with Bohemia\n    And with your queen. I am his cupbearer;\n    If from me he have wholesome beverage,\n    Account me not your servant.\n  LEONTES. This is all:\n    Do't, and thou hast the one half of my heart;\n    Do't not, thou split'st thine own.\n  CAMILLO. I'll do't, my lord.\n  LEONTES. I will seem friendly, as thou hast advis'd me.   Exit\n  CAMILLO. O miserable lady! But, for me,\n    What case stand I in? I must be the poisoner\n    Of good Polixenes; and my ground to do't\n    Is the obedience to a master; one\n    Who, in rebellion with himself, will have\n    All that are his so too. To do this deed,\n    Promotion follows. If I could find example\n    Of thousands that had struck anointed kings\n    And flourish'd after, I'd not do't; but since\n    Nor brass, nor stone, nor parchment, bears not one,\n    Let villainy itself forswear't. I must\n    Forsake the court. To do't, or no, is certain\n    To me a break-neck. Happy star reign now!\n    Here comes Bohemia.\n\n                     Enter POLIXENES\n\n  POLIXENES. This is strange. Methinks\n    My favour here begins to warp. Not speak?\n    Good day, Camillo.\n  CAMILLO. Hail, most royal sir!\n  POLIXENES. What is the news i' th' court?\n  CAMILLO. None rare, my lord.\n  POLIXENES. The King hath on him such a countenance\n    As he had lost some province, and a region\n    Lov'd as he loves himself; even now I met him\n    With customary compliment, when he,\n    Wafting his eyes to th' contrary and falling\n    A lip of much contempt, speeds from me;\n    So leaves me to consider what is breeding\n    That changes thus his manners.\n  CAMILLO. I dare not know, my lord.\n  POLIXENES. How, dare not! Do not. Do you know, and dare not\n    Be intelligent to me? 'Tis thereabouts;\n    For, to yourself, what you do know, you must,\n    And cannot say you dare not. Good Camillo,\n    Your chang'd complexions are to me a mirror\n    Which shows me mine chang'd too; for I must be\n    A party in this alteration, finding\n    Myself thus alter'd with't.\n  CAMILLO. There is a sickness\n    Which puts some of us in distemper; but\n    I cannot name the disease; and it is caught\n    Of you that yet are well.\n  POLIXENES. How! caught of me?\n    Make me not sighted like the basilisk;\n    I have look'd on thousands who have sped the better\n    By my regard, but kill'd none so. Camillo-\n    As you are certainly a gentleman; thereto\n    Clerk-like experienc'd, which no less adorns\n    Our gentry than our parents' noble names,\n    In whose success we are gentle- I beseech you,\n    If you know aught which does behove my knowledge\n    Thereof to be inform'd, imprison't not\n    In ignorant concealment.\n  CAMILLO. I may not answer.\n  POLIXENES. A sickness caught of me, and yet I well?\n    I must be answer'd. Dost thou hear, Camillo?\n    I conjure thee, by all the parts of man\n    Which honour does acknowledge, whereof the least\n    Is not this suit of mine, that thou declare\n    What incidency thou dost guess of harm\n    Is creeping toward me; how far off, how near;\n    Which way to be prevented, if to be;\n    If not, how best to bear it.\n  CAMILLO. Sir, I will tell you;\n    Since I am charg'd in honour, and by him\n    That I think honourable. Therefore mark my counsel,\n    Which must be ev'n as swiftly followed as\n    I mean to utter it, or both yourself and me\n    Cry lost, and so goodnight.\n  POLIXENES. On, good Camillo.\n  CAMILLO. I am appointed him to murder you.\n  POLIXENES. By whom, Camillo?\n  CAMILLO. By the King.\n  POLIXENES. For what?\n  CAMILLO. He thinks, nay, with all confidence he swears,\n    As he had seen 't or been an instrument\n    To vice you to't, that you have touch'd his queen\n    Forbiddenly.\n  POLIXENES. O, then my best blood turn\n    To an infected jelly, and my name\n    Be yok'd with his that did betray the Best!\n    Turn then my freshest reputation to\n    A savour that may strike the dullest nostril\n    Where I arrive, and my approach be shunn'd,\n    Nay, hated too, worse than the great'st infection\n    That e'er was heard or read!\n  CAMILLO. Swear his thought over\n    By each particular star in heaven and\n    By all their influences, you may as well\n    Forbid the sea for to obey the moon\n    As or by oath remove or counsel shake\n    The fabric of his folly, whose foundation\n    Is pil'd upon his faith and will continue\n    The standing of his body.\n  POLIXENES. How should this grow?\n  CAMILLO. I know not; but I am sure 'tis safer to\n    Avoid what's grown than question how 'tis born.\n    If therefore you dare trust my honesty,\n    That lies enclosed in this trunk which you\n    Shall bear along impawn'd, away to-night.\n    Your followers I will whisper to the business;\n    And will, by twos and threes, at several posterns,\n    Clear them o' th' city. For myself, I'll put\n    My fortunes to your service, which are here\n    By this discovery lost. Be not uncertain,\n    For, by the honour of my parents, I\n    Have utt'red truth; which if you seek to prove,\n    I dare not stand by; nor shall you be safer\n    Than one condemn'd by the King's own mouth, thereon\n    His execution sworn.\n  POLIXENES. I do believe thee:\n    I saw his heart in's face. Give me thy hand;\n    Be pilot to me, and thy places shall\n    Still neighbour mine. My ships are ready, and\n    My people did expect my hence departure\n    Two days ago. This jealousy\n    Is for a precious creature; as she's rare,\n    Must it be great; and, as his person's mighty,\n    Must it be violent; and as he does conceive\n\n### Summary:\n\n", "answer": "Scene One is a short conversation between Archidamus, a Bohemian courtier, and Camillo, a Sicilian courtier and trusted friend of Leontes, King of Sicilia. Archidamus praises the generous hospitality he has been treated to in Sicilia, apologizing for any inadequacies Camillo might experience should he travel to Bohemia. Camillo talks about the friendship between Leontes and Polixenes, King of Bohemia. The two rulers were raised together since boyhood, although now their responsibilities as kings keep them apart. Both courtiers agree that Prince Mamillius of Sicilia shows great promise. Scene ii: Enter Leontes, Hermione, Mamillius, Polixenes, Camillo, and Attendants. Polixenes proclaims his intent to return home. He has been staying as a guest in the court of Leontes for nine months, and he fears that troubles may start at home if he stays away much longer. Leontes tries, without any success, to convince Polixenes to stay a short while longer. At Leontes' request, Hermione, Leontes' queen, tries to convince Polixenes to stay. She is eloquent and persuasive, and Polixenes gives in. She then asks to hear more stories from the kings' boyhood days together. Polixenes paints a picture of innocence and pure friendship in days before the two men knew anything of women. Hermione is extremely affectionate to Polixenes, treating him with great love because he is her husband's best and oldest friend. In asides to the audience, Leontes reveals that he is insanely jealous of Polixenes and Hermione. He is convinced that they are secretly committing adultery, although he has no hard evidence on which to base his suspicions. In full view of the others, he asks his young son Mamillius questions loaded with double meanings about whether or not the child is his boy. When Hermione and Polixenes ask if Leontes is feeling well, he replies that he is only unsettled because Mamillius reminds him of himself in the days of his own childhood. Leontes asks if Polixenes' son back in Bohemia is as dear as Mamillius, and Polixenes speaks of the great love he has for his own boy. Hermione, Polixenes, and the Attendants exit, leaving Leontes to continue his strange, angry conversation with his uncomprehending son. Mamillius exits, and Leontes, in an aside, speaks of how the tryst between Polixenes and Hermione must be obvious to everyone. He questions Camillo, who is clearly unaware of the king's suspicions. The king, convinced that Camillo is either stupid or playing dumb, grows increasingly irate. When he finally tells Camillo of what he suspects, the advisor is horrified and does not believe it. Leontes' grows increasingly furious, and Camillo, seeing the king's conviction, seems to give in. At Leontes' expressed desire to see Polixenes dead of poison, he offers to carry out the task. His condition is that Leontes' keep the queen in her present status, and do nothing to stain her honor. The king agrees, and Camillo affirms again that he will poison Polixenes. The king leaves, and Camillo reveals to the audience that he is horrified by the task set before him. He is a loyal courtier, but he believes Polixenes and Hermione are innocent. He resolves not to do it. Polixenes enters, disturbed by his most recent brush with Leontes. He asks Camillo about the change in the king's manner, and Camillo initially refuses to give a straightforward answer. When Polixenes continues to entreat Camillo, worried that his safety might be at risk, Camillo tells him the truth. He agrees to help Polixenes, using his authority as Leontes' most trusted advisor to ensure a safe escape for Polixenes and all of his men. Camillo says that he will serve at Polixenes' court, since in helping Polixenes he can no longer stay in Sicilia. Polixenes' ship has been ready for departure for days, and Polixenes assures Camillo that he will remember this service."}

The palace of LEONTES\n\nEnter CAMILLO and ARCHIDAMUS\n\n  ARCHIDAMUS. If you shall chance, Camillo, to visit Bohemia, on\nthe\n    like occasion whereon my services are now on foot, you shall\nsee,\n    as I have said, great difference betwixt our Bohemia and your\n    Sicilia.\n  CAMILLO. I think this coming summer the King of Sicilia means\nto\n    pay Bohemia the visitation which he justly owes him.\n  ARCHIDAMUS. Wherein our entertainment shall shame us we will be\n    justified in our loves; for indeed-\n  CAMILLO. Beseech you-\n  ARCHIDAMUS. Verily, I speak it in the freedom of my knowledge:\nwe\n    cannot with such magnificence, in so rare- I know not what to\n    say. We will give you sleepy drinks, that your senses,\n    unintelligent of our insufficience, may, though they cannot\n    praise us, as little accuse us.\n  CAMILLO. You pay a great deal too dear for what's given freely.\n  ARCHIDAMUS. Believe me, I speak as my understanding instructs\nme\n    and as mine honesty puts it to utterance.\n  CAMILLO. Sicilia cannot show himself overkind to Bohemia. They\nwere\n    train'd together in their childhoods; and there rooted\nbetwixt\n    them then such an affection which cannot choose but branch\nnow.\n    Since their more mature dignities and royal necessities made\n    separation of their society, their encounters, though not\n    personal, have been royally attorneyed with interchange of\ngifts,\n    letters, loving embassies; that they have seem'd to be\ntogether,\n    though absent; shook hands, as over a vast; and embrac'd as\nit\n    were from the ends of opposed winds. The heavens continue\ntheir\n    loves!\n  ARCHIDAMUS. I think there is not in the world either malice or\n    matter to alter it. You have an unspeakable comfort of your\nyoung\n    Prince Mamillius; it is a gentleman of the greatest promise\nthat\n    ever came into my note.\n  CAMILLO. I very well agree with you in the hopes of him. It is\na\n    gallant child; one that indeed physics the subject, makes old\n    hearts fresh; they that went on crutches ere he was born\ndesire\n    yet their life to see him a man.\n  ARCHIDAMUS. Would they else be content to die?\n  CAMILLO. Yes; if there were no other excuse why they should\ndesire\n    to live.\n  ARCHIDAMUS. If the King had no son, they would desire to live\non\n    crutches till he had one.\n                                                          Exeunt\n\n\n\n\n\nSicilia.

Nine changes of the wat'ry star hath been\n    The shepherd's note since we have left our throne\n    Without a burden. Time as long again\n    Would be fill'd up, my brother, with our thanks;\n    And yet we should for perpetuity\n    Go hence in debt. And therefore, like a cipher,\n    Yet standing in rich place, I multiply\n    With one 'We thank you' many thousands moe\n    That go before it.\n  LEONTES. Stay your thanks a while,\n    And pay them when you part.\n  POLIXENES. Sir, that's to-morrow.\n    I am question'd by my fears of what may chance\n    Or breed upon our absence, that may blow\n    No sneaping winds at home, to make us say\n    'This is put forth too truly.' Besides, I have stay'd\n    To tire your royalty.\n  LEONTES. We are tougher, brother,\n    Than you can put us to't.\n  POLIXENES. No longer stay.\n  LEONTES. One sev'night longer.\n  POLIXENES. Very sooth, to-morrow.\n  LEONTES. We'll part the time between's then; and in that\n    I'll no gainsaying.\n  POLIXENES. Press me not, beseech you, so.\n    There is no tongue that moves, none, none i' th' world,\n    So soon as yours could win me. So it should now,\n    Were there necessity in your request, although\n    'Twere needful I denied it. My affairs\n    Do even drag me homeward; which to hinder\n    Were in your love a whip to me; my stay\n    To you a charge and trouble. To save both,\n    Farewell, our brother.\n  LEONTES. Tongue-tied, our Queen? Speak you.\n  HERMIONE. I had thought, sir, to have held my peace until\n    You had drawn oaths from him not to stay. You, sir,\n    Charge him too coldly. Tell him you are sure\n    All in Bohemia's well- this satisfaction\n    The by-gone day proclaim'd. Say this to him,\n    He's beat from his best ward.\n  LEONTES. Well said, Hermione.\n  HERMIONE. To tell he longs to see his son were strong;\n    But let him say so then, and let him go;\n    But let him swear so, and he shall not stay;\n    We'll thwack him hence with distaffs.\n    [To POLIXENES]  Yet of your royal presence I'll\n    adventure the borrow of a week. When at Bohemia\n    You take my lord, I'll give him my commission\n    To let him there a month behind the gest\n    Prefix'd for's parting.- Yet, good deed, Leontes,\n    I love thee not a jar o' th' clock behind\n    What lady she her lord.- You'll stay?\n  POLIXENES. No, madam.\n  HERMIONE. Nay, but you will?\n  POLIXENES. I may not, verily.\n  HERMIONE. Verily!\n    You put me off with limber vows; but I,\n    Though you would seek t' unsphere the stars with oaths,\n    Should yet say 'Sir, no going.' Verily,\n    You shall not go; a lady's 'verily' is\n    As potent as a lord's. Will go yet?\n    Force me to keep you as a prisoner,\n    Not like a guest; so you shall pay your fees\n    When you depart, and save your thanks. How say you?\n    My prisoner or my guest? By your dread 'verily,'\n    One of them you shall be.\n  POLIXENES. Your guest, then, madam:\n    To be your prisoner should import offending;\n    Which is for me less easy to commit\n    Than you to punish.\n  HERMIONE. Not your gaoler then,\n    But your kind. hostess. Come, I'll question you\n    Of my lord's tricks and yours when you were boys.\n    You were pretty lordings then!\n  POLIXENES. We were, fair Queen,\n    Two lads that thought there was no more behind\n    But such a day to-morrow as to-day,\n    And to be boy eternal.\n  HERMIONE. Was not my lord\n    The verier wag o' th' two?\n  POLIXENES. We were as twinn'd lambs that did frisk i' th' sun\n    And bleat the one at th' other. What we chang'd\n    Was innocence for innocence; we knew not\n    The doctrine of ill-doing, nor dream'd\n    That any did. Had we pursu'd that life,\n    And our weak spirits ne'er been higher rear'd\n    With stronger blood, we should have answer'd heaven\n    Boldly 'Not guilty,' the imposition clear'd\n    Hereditary ours.\n  HERMIONE. By this we gather\n    You have tripp'd since.\n  POLIXENES. O my most sacred lady,\n    Temptations have since then been born to 's, for\n    In those unfledg'd days was my wife a girl;\n    Your precious self had then not cross'd the eyes\n    Of my young playfellow.\n  HERMIONE. Grace to boot!\n    Of this make no conclusion, lest you say\n    Your queen and I are devils. Yet, go on;\n    Th' offences we have made you do we'll answer,\n    If you first sinn'd with us, and that with us\n    You did continue fault, and that you slipp'd not\n    With any but with us.\n  LEONTES. Is he won yet?\n  HERMIONE. He'll stay, my lord.\n  LEONTES. At my request he would not.\n    Hermione, my dearest, thou never spok'st\n    To better purpose.\n  HERMIONE. Never?\n  LEONTES. Never but once.\n  HERMIONE. What! Have I twice said well? When was't before?\n    I prithee tell me; cram's with praise, and make's\n    As fat as tame things. One good deed dying tongueless\n    Slaughters a thousand waiting upon that.\n    Our praises are our wages; you may ride's\n    With one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere\n    With spur we heat an acre. But to th' goal:\n    My last good deed was to entreat his stay;\n    What was my first? It has an elder sister,\n    Or I mistake you. O, would her name were Grace!\n    But once before I spoke to th' purpose- When?\n    Nay, let me have't; I long.\n  LEONTES. Why, that was when\n    Three crabbed months had sour'd themselves to death,\n    Ere I could make thee open thy white hand\n    And clap thyself my love; then didst thou utter\n    'I am yours for ever.'\n  HERMIONE. 'Tis Grace indeed.\n    Why, lo you now, I have spoke to th' purpose twice:\n    The one for ever earn'd a royal husband;\n    Th' other for some while a friend.\n                                  [Giving her hand to POLIXENES]\n  LEONTES.  [Aside]  Too hot, too hot!\n    To mingle friendship far is mingling bloods.\n    I have tremor cordis on me; my heart dances,\n    But not for joy, not joy. This entertainment\n    May a free face put on; derive a liberty\n    From heartiness, from bounty, fertile bosom,\n    And well become the agent. 'T may, I grant;\n    But to be paddling palms and pinching fingers,\n    As now they are, and making practis'd smiles\n    As in a looking-glass; and then to sigh, as 'twere\n    The mort o' th' deer. O, that is entertainment\n    My bosom likes not, nor my brows! Mamillius,\n    Art thou my boy?\n  MAMILLIUS. Ay, my good lord.\n  LEONTES. I' fecks!\n    Why, that's my bawcock. What! hast smutch'd thy nose?\n    They say it is a copy out of mine. Come, Captain,\n    We must be neat- not neat, but cleanly, Captain.\n    And yet the steer, the heifer, and the calf,\n    Are all call'd neat.- Still virginalling\n    Upon his palm?- How now, you wanton calf,\n    Art thou my calf?\n  MAMILLIUS. Yes, if you will, my lord.\n  LEONTES. Thou want'st a rough pash and the shoots that I have,\n    To be full like me; yet they say we are\n    Almost as like as eggs. Women say so,\n    That will say anything. But were they false\n    As o'er-dy'd blacks, as wind, as waters- false\n    As dice are to be wish'd by one that fixes\n    No bourn 'twixt his and mine; yet were it true\n    To say this boy were like me. Come, sir page,\n    Look on me with your welkin eye. Sweet villain!\n    Most dear'st! my collop! Can thy dam?- may't be?\n    Affection! thy intention stabs the centre.\n    Thou dost make possible things not so held,\n    Communicat'st with dreams- how can this be?-\n    With what's unreal thou coactive art,\n    And fellow'st nothing. Then 'tis very credent\n    Thou mayst co-join with something; and thou dost-\n    And that beyond commission; and I find it,\n    And that to the infection of my brains\n    And hard'ning of my brows.\n  POLIXENES. What means Sicilia?\n  HERMIONE. He something seems unsettled.\n  POLIXENES. How, my lord!\n    What cheer? How is't with you, best brother?\n  HERMIONE. You look\n    As if you held a brow of much distraction.\n    Are you mov'd, my lord?\n  LEONTES. No, in good earnest.\n    How sometimes nature will betray its folly,\n    Its tenderness, and make itself a pastime\n    To harder bosoms! Looking on the lines\n    Of my boy's face, methoughts I did recoil\n    Twenty-three years; and saw myself unbreech'd,\n    In my green velvet coat; my dagger muzzl'd,\n    Lest it should bite its master and so prove,\n    As ornaments oft do, too dangerous.\n    How like, methought, I then was to this kernel,\n    This squash, this gentleman. Mine honest friend,\n    Will you take eggs for money?\n  MAMILLIUS. No, my lord, I'll fight.\n  LEONTES. You will? Why, happy man be's dole! My brother,\n    Are you so fond of your young prince as we\n    Do seem to be of ours?\n  POLIXENES. If at home, sir,\n    He's all my exercise, my mirth, my matter;\n    Now my sworn friend, and then mine enemy;\n    My parasite, my soldier, statesman, all.\n    He makes a July's day short as December,\n    And with his varying childness cures in me\n    Thoughts that would thick my blood.\n  LEONTES. So stands this squire\n    Offic'd with me. We two will walk, my lord,\n    And leave you to your graver steps. Hermione,\n    How thou lov'st us show in our brother's welcome;\n    Let what is dear in Sicily be cheap;\n    Next to thyself and my young rover, he's\n    Apparent to my heart.\n  HERMIONE. If you would seek us,\n    We are yours i' th' garden. Shall's attend you there?\n  LEONTES. To your own bents dispose you; you'll be found,\n    Be you beneath the sky.  [Aside]  I am angling now,\n    Though you perceive me not how I give line.\n    Go to, go to!\n    How she holds up the neb, the bill to him!\n    And arms her with the boldness of a wife\n    To her allowing husband!\n\n                      Exeunt POLIXENES, HERMIONE, and ATTENDANTS\n\n    Gone already!\n    Inch-thick, knee-deep, o'er head and ears a fork'd one!\n    Go, play, boy, play; thy mother plays, and I\n    Play too; but so disgrac'd a part, whose issue\n    Will hiss me to my grave. Contempt and clamour\n    Will be my knell. Go, play, boy, play. There have been,\n    Or I am much deceiv'd, cuckolds ere now;\n    And many a man there is, even at this present,\n    Now while I speak this, holds his wife by th' arm\n    That little thinks she has been sluic'd in's absence,\n    And his pond fish'd by his next neighbour, by\n    Sir Smile, his neighbour. Nay, there's comfort in't,\n    Whiles other men have gates and those gates open'd,\n    As mine, against their will. Should all despair\n    That hath revolted wives, the tenth of mankind\n    Would hang themselves. Physic for't there's none;\n    It is a bawdy planet, that will strike\n    Where 'tis predominant; and 'tis pow'rfull, think it,\n    From east, west, north, and south. Be it concluded,\n    No barricado for a belly. Know't,\n    It will let in and out the enemy\n    With bag and baggage. Many thousand on's\n    Have the disease, and feel't not. How now, boy!\n  MAMILLIUS. I am like you, they say.\n  LEONTES. Why, that's some comfort.\n    What! Camillo there?\n  CAMILLO. Ay, my good lord.\n  LEONTES. Go play, Mamillius; thou'rt an honest man.\n                                                  Exit MAMILLIUS\n    Camillo, this great sir will yet stay longer.\n  CAMILLO. You had much ado to make his anchor hold;\n    When you cast out, it still came home.\n  LEONTES. Didst note it?\n  CAMILLO. He would not stay at your petitions; made\n    His business more material.\n  LEONTES. Didst perceive it?\n    [Aside]  They're here with me already; whisp'ring, rounding,\n    'Sicilia is a so-forth.' 'Tis far gone\n    When I shall gust it last.- How came't, Camillo,\n    That he did stay?\n  CAMILLO. At the good Queen's entreaty.\n  LEONTES. 'At the Queen's' be't. 'Good' should be pertinent;\n    But so it is, it is not. Was this taken\n    By any understanding pate but thine?\n    For thy conceit is soaking, will draw in\n    More than the common blocks. Not noted, is't,\n    But of the finer natures, by some severals\n    Of head-piece extraordinary? Lower messes\n    Perchance are to this business purblind? Say.\n  CAMILLO. Business, my lord? I think most understand\n    Bohemia stays here longer.\n  LEONTES. Ha?\n  CAMILLO. Stays here longer.\n  LEONTES. Ay, but why?\n  CAMILLO. To satisfy your Highness, and the entreaties\n    Of our most gracious mistress.\n  LEONTES. Satisfy\n    Th' entreaties of your mistress! Satisfy!\n    Let that suffice. I have trusted thee, Camillo,\n    With all the nearest things to my heart, as well\n    My chamber-councils, wherein, priest-like, thou\n    Hast cleans'd my bosom- I from thee departed\n    Thy penitent reform'd; but we have been\n    Deceiv'd in thy integrity, deceiv'd\n    In that which seems so.\n  CAMILLO. Be it forbid, my lord!\n  LEONTES. To bide upon't: thou art not honest; or,\n    If thou inclin'st that way, thou art a coward,\n    Which hoxes honesty behind, restraining\n    From course requir'd; or else thou must be counted\n    A servant grafted in my serious trust,\n    And therein negligent; or else a fool\n    That seest a game play'd home, the rich stake drawn,\n    And tak'st it all for jest.\n  CAMILLO. My gracious lord,\n    I may be negligent, foolish, and fearful:\n    In every one of these no man is free\n    But that his negligence, his folly, fear,\n    Among the infinite doings of the world,\n    Sometime puts forth. In your affairs, my lord,\n    If ever I were wilfull-negligent,\n    It was my folly; if industriously\n    I play'd the fool, it was my negligence,\n    Not weighing well the end; if ever fearful\n    To do a thing where I the issue doubted,\n    Whereof the execution did cry out\n    Against the non-performance, 'twas a fear\n    Which oft infects the wisest. These, my lord,\n    Are such allow'd infirmities that honesty\n    Is never free of. But, beseech your Grace,\n    Be plainer with me; let me know my trespass\n    By its own visage; if I then deny it,\n    'Tis none of mine.\n  LEONTES. Ha' not you seen, Camillo-\n    But that's past doubt; you have, or your eye-glass\n    Is thicker than a cuckold's horn- or heard-\n    For to a vision so apparent rumour\n    Cannot be mute- or thought- for cogitation\n    Resides not in that man that does not think-\n    My wife is slippery? If thou wilt confess-\n    Or else be impudently negative,\n    To have nor eyes nor ears nor thought- then say\n    My wife's a hobby-horse, deserves a name\n    As rank as any flax-wench that puts to\n    Before her troth-plight. Say't and justify't.\n  CAMILLO. I would not be a stander-by to hear\n    My sovereign mistress clouded so, without\n    My present vengeance taken. Shrew my heart!\n    You never spoke what did become you less\n    Than this; which to reiterate were sin\n    As deep as that, though true.\n  LEONTES. Is whispering nothing?\n    Is leaning cheek to cheek? Is meeting noses?\n    Kissing with inside lip? Stopping the career\n    Of laughter with a sigh?- a note infallible\n    Of breaking honesty. Horsing foot on foot?\n    Skulking in corners? Wishing clocks more swift;\n    Hours, minutes; noon, midnight? And all eyes\n    Blind with the pin and web but theirs, theirs only,\n    That would unseen be wicked- is this nothing?\n    Why, then the world and all that's in't is nothing;\n    The covering sky is nothing; Bohemia nothing;\n    My is nothing; nor nothing have these nothings,\n    If this be nothing.\n  CAMILLO. Good my lord, be cur'd\n    Of this diseas'd opinion, and betimes;\n    For 'tis most dangerous.\n  LEONTES. Say it be, 'tis true.\n  CAMILLO. No, no, my lord.\n  LEONTES. It is; you lie, you lie.\n    I say thou liest, Camillo, and I hate thee;\n    Pronounce thee a gross lout, a mindless slave,\n    Or else a hovering temporizer that\n    Canst with thine eyes at once see good and evil,\n    Inclining to them both. Were my wife's liver\n    Infected as her life, she would not live\n    The running of one glass.\n  CAMILLO. Who does her?\n  LEONTES. Why, he that wears her like her medal, hanging\n    About his neck, Bohemia; who- if I\n    Had servants true about me that bare eyes\n    To see alike mine honour as their profits,\n    Their own particular thrifts, they would do that\n    Which should undo more doing. Ay, and thou,\n    His cupbearer- whom I from meaner form\n    Have bench'd and rear'd to worship; who mayst see,\n    Plainly as heaven sees earth and earth sees heaven,\n    How I am gall'd- mightst bespice a cup\n    To give mine enemy a lasting wink;\n    Which draught to me were cordial.\n  CAMILLO. Sir, my lord,\n    I could do this; and that with no rash potion,\n    But with a ling'ring dram that should not work\n    Maliciously like poison. But I cannot\n    Believe this crack to be in my dread mistress,\n    So sovereignly being honourable.\n    I have lov'd thee-\n  LEONTES. Make that thy question, and go rot!\n    Dost think I am so muddy, so unsettled,\n    To appoint myself in this vexation; sully\n    The purity and whiteness of my sheets-\n    Which to preserve is sleep, which being spotted\n    Is goads, thorns, nettles, tails of wasps;\n    Give scandal to the blood o' th' Prince, my son-\n    Who I do think is mine, and love as mine-\n    Without ripe moving to 't? Would I do this?\n    Could man so blench?\n  CAMILLO. I must believe you, sir.\n    I do; and will fetch off Bohemia for't;\n    Provided that, when he's remov'd, your Highness\n    Will take again your queen as yours at first,\n    Even for your son's sake; and thereby for sealing\n    The injury of tongues in courts and kingdoms\n    Known and allied to yours.\n  LEONTES. Thou dost advise me\n    Even so as I mine own course have set down.\n    I'll give no blemish to her honour, none.\n  CAMILLO. My lord,\n    Go then; and with a countenance as clear\n    As friendship wears at feasts, keep with Bohemia\n    And with your queen. I am his cupbearer;\n    If from me he have wholesome beverage,\n    Account me not your servant.\n  LEONTES. This is all:\n    Do't, and thou hast the one half of my heart;\n    Do't not, thou split'st thine own.\n  CAMILLO. I'll do't, my lord.\n  LEONTES. I will seem friendly, as thou hast advis'd me.   Exit\n  CAMILLO. O miserable lady! But, for me,\n    What case stand I in? I must be the poisoner\n    Of good Polixenes; and my ground to do't\n    Is the obedience to a master; one\n    Who, in rebellion with himself, will have\n    All that are his so too. To do this deed,\n    Promotion follows. If I could find example\n    Of thousands that had struck anointed kings\n    And flourish'd after, I'd not do't; but since\n    Nor brass, nor stone, nor parchment, bears not one,\n    Let villainy itself forswear't. I must\n    Forsake the court. To do't, or no, is certain\n    To me a break-neck. Happy star reign now!\n    Here comes Bohemia.\n\n                     Enter POLIXENES\n\n  POLIXENES. This is strange. Methinks\n    My favour here begins to warp. Not speak?\n    Good day, Camillo.\n  CAMILLO. Hail, most royal sir!\n  POLIXENES. What is the news i' th' court?\n  CAMILLO. None rare, my lord.\n  POLIXENES. The King hath on him such a countenance\n    As he had lost some province, and a region\n    Lov'd as he loves himself; even now I met him\n    With customary compliment, when he,\n    Wafting his eyes to th' contrary and falling\n    A lip of much contempt, speeds from me;\n    So leaves me to consider what is breeding\n    That changes thus his manners.\n  CAMILLO. I dare not know, my lord.\n  POLIXENES. How, dare not! Do not. Do you know, and dare not\n    Be intelligent to me? 'Tis thereabouts;\n    For, to yourself, what you do know, you must,\n    And cannot say you dare not. Good Camillo,\n    Your chang'd complexions are to me a mirror\n    Which shows me mine chang'd too; for I must be\n    A party in this alteration, finding\n    Myself thus alter'd with't.\n  CAMILLO. There is a sickness\n    Which puts some of us in distemper; but\n    I cannot name the disease; and it is caught\n    Of you that yet are well.\n  POLIXENES. How! caught of me?\n    Make me not sighted like the basilisk;\n    I have look'd on thousands who have sped the better\n    By my regard, but kill'd none so. Camillo-\n    As you are certainly a gentleman; thereto\n    Clerk-like experienc'd, which no less adorns\n    Our gentry than our parents' noble names,\n    In whose success we are gentle- I beseech you,\n    If you know aught which does behove my knowledge\n    Thereof to be inform'd, imprison't not\n    In ignorant concealment.\n  CAMILLO. I may not answer.\n  POLIXENES. A sickness caught of me, and yet I well?\n    I must be answer'd. Dost thou hear, Camillo?\n    I conjure thee, by all the parts of man\n    Which honour does acknowledge, whereof the least\n    Is not this suit of mine, that thou declare\n    What incidency thou dost guess of harm\n    Is creeping toward me; how far off, how near;\n    Which way to be prevented, if to be;\n    If not, how best to bear it.\n  CAMILLO. Sir, I will tell you;\n    Since I am charg'd in honour, and by him\n    That I think honourable. Therefore mark my counsel,\n    Which must be ev'n as swiftly followed as\n    I mean to utter it, or both yourself and me\n    Cry lost, and so goodnight.\n  POLIXENES. On, good Camillo.\n  CAMILLO. I am appointed him to murder you.\n  POLIXENES. By whom, Camillo?\n  CAMILLO. By the King.\n  POLIXENES. For what?\n  CAMILLO. He thinks, nay, with all confidence he swears,\n    As he had seen 't or been an instrument\n    To vice you to't, that you have touch'd his queen\n    Forbiddenly.\n  POLIXENES. O, then my best blood turn\n    To an infected jelly, and my name\n    Be yok'd with his that did betray the Best!\n    Turn then my freshest reputation to\n    A savour that may strike the dullest nostril\n    Where I arrive, and my approach be shunn'd,\n    Nay, hated too, worse than the great'st infection\n    That e'er was heard or read!\n  CAMILLO. Swear his thought over\n    By each particular star in heaven and\n    By all their influences, you may as well\n    Forbid the sea for to obey the moon\n    As or by oath remove or counsel shake\n    The fabric of his folly, whose foundation\n    Is pil'd upon his faith and will continue\n    The standing of his body.\n  POLIXENES. How should this grow?\n  CAMILLO. I know not; but I am sure 'tis safer to\n    Avoid what's grown than question how 'tis born.\n    If therefore you dare trust my honesty,\n    That lies enclosed in this trunk which you\n    Shall bear along impawn'd, away to-night.\n    Your followers I will whisper to the business;\n    And will, by twos and threes, at several posterns,\n    Clear them o' th' city. For myself, I'll put\n    My fortunes to your service, which are here\n    By this discovery lost. Be not uncertain,\n    For, by the honour of my parents, I\n    Have utt'red truth; which if you seek to prove,\n    I dare not stand by; nor shall you be safer\n    Than one condemn'd by the King's own mouth, thereon\n    His execution sworn.\n  POLIXENES. I do believe thee:\n    I saw his heart in's face. Give me thy hand;\n    Be pilot to me, and thy places shall\n    Still neighbour mine. My ships are ready, and\n    My people did expect my hence departure\n    Two days ago. This jealousy\n    Is for a precious creature; as she's rare,\n    Must it be great; and, as his person's mighty,\n    Must it be violent; and as he does conceive\n\n### Summary:\n\n", "answer": "In the kingdom of Sicilia, King Leontes is being visited by his childhood friend, King Polixenes of Bohemia. One of Leontes's lords, Camillo, discusses the striking differences between the two kingdoms with a Bohemian nobleman, Archidamus. The conversation then turns to the great and enduring friendship between the two kings, and the beauty and promise of Leontes's young son,Mamillius. These two lords go out, and Leontes comes in, along with his wife Hermione , Mamillius, and Polixenes, who is making ready to depart for home. Leontes pleads with him to stay a little longer in Sicilia, but his friend refuses, declaring that he has been away from Bohemia for nine months, which is long enough. Hermione then takes up the argument, and Polixenes yields to her entreaties, promising to stay for a little longer. He tells the Sicilian queen how wonderful his childhood with Leontes was--how \"we were, fair queen / Two lads that thought there was no more behind / But such a day tomorrow as today / And to be boy eternal\". Leontes, meanwhile, tells Hermione that she has never spoken to better effect than in convincing Polixenes to stay--save for once, when she agreed to marry him. But as his wife and his friend walk together, apart from him, he feels stirrings of jealousy, and tells the audience that he suspects them of being lovers. He turns to his son and notes that the boy resembles him, and this reassures him that Mamillius is, in fact, his son and not someone else's; his suspicion of his wife remains, however, and grows quickly, until he is certain that she is sleeping with Polixenes. He sends the two of them to walk in the garden together, promising to join them later, and then calls Camillo over, asking if he has noticed anything peculiar about Polixenes's behavior lately. Camillo says that he has not, and Leontes accuses him of being negligent, and then declares that Hermione and Polixenes have made him a cuckold--that is, a betrayed husband. Camillo, appalled, refuses to believe it, but his king insists that it is true, and orders the lord to act as cupbearer to Polixenes--and then poison him at the first opportunity. Camillo promises to obey, but his conscience is greatly troubled, and when Leontes has gone and Polixenes reappears, the Bohemian king realizes that something is amiss. Saying that Leontes just gave him a peculiar and threatening look, he demands to know what is going on, and Camillo, after a moment of anguish, tells him of the Sicilian king's suspicions and desire to have him poisoned. He begs protection of Polixenes, who accepts him as a servant, and they decide to flee the country immediately by sneaking out of the castle and taking ship for Bohemia. Camillo promises to use his authority in Sicilia to help their escape, and the two men slip away together."}

The King's Friend.\n\n\nFouquet was waiting with anxiety; he had already sent away many of his\nservants and friends, who, anticipating the usual hour of his ordinary\nreceptions, had called at his door to inquire after him. Preserving\nthe utmost silence respecting the danger which hung suspended by a hair\nabove his head, he only asked them, as he did every one, indeed, who\ncame to the door, where Aramis was. When he saw D'Artagnan return,\nand when he perceived the bishop of Vannes behind him, he could hardly\nrestrain his delight; it was fully equal to his previous uneasiness. The\nmere sight of Aramis was a complete compensation to the surintendant for\nthe unhappiness he had undergone in his arrest. The prelate was silent\nand grave; D'Artagnan completely bewildered by such an accumulation of\nevents.\n\n\"Well, captain, so you have brought M. d'Herblay to me.\"\n\n\"And something better still, monseigneur.\"\n\n\"What is that?\"\n\n\"Liberty.\"\n\n\"I am free!\"\n\n\"Yes; by the king's order.\"\n\nFouquet resumed his usual serenity, that he might interrogate Aramis\nwith a look.\n\n\"Oh! yes, you can thank M. l'eveque de Vannes,\" pursued D'Artagnan, \"for\nit is indeed to him that you owe the change that has taken place in the\nking.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Fouquet, more humiliated at the service than grateful at its\nsuccess.\n\n\"But you,\" continued D'Artagnan, addressing Aramis--\"you, who have\nbecome M. Fouquet's protector and patron, can you not do something for\nme?\"\n\n\"Anything in the wide world you like, my friend,\" replied the bishop, in\nhis calmest tones.\n\n\"One thing only, then, and I shall be perfectly satisfied. How on earth\ndid you manage to become the favorite of the king, you who have never\nspoken to him more than twice in your life?\"\n\n\"From a friend such as you are,\" said Aramis, \"I cannot conceal\nanything.\"\n\n\"Ah! very good, tell me, then.\"\n\n\"Very well. You think that I have seen the king only twice, whilst the\nfact is I have seen him more than a hundred times; only we have kept it\nvery secret, that is all.\" And without trying to remove the color which\nat this revelation made D'Artagnan's face flush scarlet, Aramis\nturned towards M. Fouquet, who was as much surprised as the musketeer.\n\"Monseigneur,\" he resumed, \"the king desires me to inform you that he\nis more than ever your friend, and that your beautiful _fete_, so\ngenerously offered by you on his behalf, has touched him to the very\nheart.\"\n\nAnd thereupon he saluted M. Fouquet with so much reverence of manner,\nthat the latter, incapable of understanding a man whose diplomacy was\nof so prodigious a character, remained incapable of uttering a single\nsyllable, and equally incapable of thought or movement. D'Artagnan\nfancied he perceived that these two men had something to say to\neach other, and he was about to yield to that feeling of instinctive\npoliteness which in such a case hurries a man towards the door, when\nhe feels his presence is an inconvenience for others; but his eager\ncuriosity, spurred on by so many mysteries, counseled him to remain.\n\nAramis thereupon turned towards him, and said, in a quiet tone, \"You\nwill not forget, my friend, the king's order respecting those whom\nhe intends to receive this morning on rising.\" These words were clear\nenough, and the musketeer understood them; he therefore bowed to\nFouquet, and then to Aramis,--to the latter with a slight admixture of\nironical respect,--and disappeared.\n\nNo sooner had he left, than Fouquet, whose impatience had hardly been\nable to wait for that moment, darted towards the door to close it, and\nthen returning to the bishop, he said, \"My dear D'Herblay, I think it\nnow high time you should explain all that has passed, for, in plain and\nhonest truth, I do not understand anything.\"\n\n\"We will explain all that to you,\" said Aramis, sitting down, and making\nFouquet sit down also. \"Where shall I begin?\"\n\n\"With this first of all. Why does the king set me at liberty?\"\n\n\"You ought rather to ask me what his reason was for having you\narrested.\"\n\n\"Since my arrest, I have had time to think over it, and my idea is\nthat it arises out of some slight feeling of jealousy. My _fete_ put M.\nColbert out of temper, and M. Colbert discovered some cause of complaint\nagainst me; Belle-Isle, for instance.\"\n\n\"No; there is no question at all just now of Belle-Isle.\"\n\n\"What is it, then?\"\n\n\"Do you remember those receipts for thirteen millions which M. de\nMazarin contrived to steal from you?\"\n\n\"Yes, of course!\"\n\n\"Well, you are pronounced a public robber.\"\n\n\"Good heavens!\"\n\n\"Oh! that is not all. Do you also remember that letter you wrote to La\nValliere?\"\n\n\"Alas! yes.\"\n\n\"And that proclaims you a traitor and a suborner.\"\n\n\"Why should he have pardoned me, then?\"\n\n\"We have not yet arrived at that part of our argument. I wish you to be\nquite convinced of the fact itself. Observe this well: the king knows\nyou to be guilty of an appropriation of public funds. Oh! of course _I_\nknow that you have done nothing of the kind; but, at all events, the\nking has seen the receipts, and he can do no other than believe you are\nincriminated.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon, I do not see--\"\n\n\"You will see presently, though. The king, moreover, having read your\nlove-letter to La Valliere, and the offers you there made her, cannot\nretain any doubt of your intentions with regard to that young lady; you\nwill admit that, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Certainly. Pray conclude.\"\n\n\"In the fewest words. The king, we may henceforth assume, is your\npowerful, implacable, and eternal enemy.\"\n\n\"Agreed. But am I, then, so powerful, that he has not dared to sacrifice\nme, notwithstanding his hatred, with all the means which my weakness, or\nmy misfortunes, may have given him as a hold upon me?\"\n\n\"It is clear, beyond all doubt,\" pursued Aramis, coldly, \"that the king\nhas quarreled with you--irreconcilably.\"\n\n\"But, since he has absolved me--\"\n\n\"Do you believe it likely?\" asked the bishop, with a searching look.\n\n\"Without believing in his sincerity, I believe it in the accomplished\nfact.\"\n\nAramis slightly shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"But why, then, should Louis XIV. have commissioned you to tell me what\nyou have just stated?\"\n\n\"The king charged me with no message for you.\"\n\n\"With nothing!\" said the superintendent, stupefied. \"But, that order--\"\n\n\"Oh! yes. You are quite right. There _is_ an order, certainly;\" and\nthese words were pronounced by Aramis in so strange a tone, that Fouquet\ncould not resist starting.\n\n\"You are concealing something from me, I see. What is it?\"\n\nAramis softly rubbed his white fingers over his chin, but said nothing.\n\n\"Does the king exile me?\"\n\n\"Do not act as if you were playing at the game children play at when\nthey have to try and guess where a thing has been hidden, and are\ninformed, by a bell being rung, when they are approaching near to it, or\ngoing away from it.\"\n\n\"Speak, then.\"\n\n\"Guess.\"\n\n\"You alarm me.\"\n\n\"Bah! that is because you have not guessed, then.\"\n\n\"What did the king say to you? In the name of our friendship, do not\ndeceive me.\"\n\n\"The king has not said one word to me.\"\n\n\"You are killing me with impatience, D'Herblay. Am I still\nsuperintendent?\"\n\n\"As long as you like.\"\n\n\"But what extraordinary empire have you so suddenly acquired over his\nmajesty's mind?\"\n\n\"Ah! that's the point.\"\n\n\"He does your bidding?\"\n\n\"I believe so.\"\n\n\"It is hardly credible.\"\n\n\"So any one would say.\"\n\n\"D'Herblay, by our alliance, by our friendship, by everything you hold\ndearest in the world, speak openly, I implore you. By what means have\nyou succeeded in overcoming Louis XIV.'s prejudices, for he did not like\nyou, I am certain.\"\n\n\"The king will like me _now_,\" said Aramis, laying stress upon the last\nword.\n\n\"You have something particular, then, between you?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"A secret, perhaps?\"\n\n\"A secret.\"\n\n\"A secret of such a nature as to change his majesty's interests?\"\n\n\"You are, indeed, a man of superior intelligence, monseigneur, and\nhave made a particularly accurate guess. I have, in fact, discovered a\nsecret, of a nature to change the interests of the king of France.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Fouquet, with the reserve of a man who does not wish to ask\nany more questions.\n\n\"And you shall judge of it yourself,\" pursued Aramis; \"and you shall\ntell me if I am mistaken with regard to the importance of this secret.\"\n\n\"I am listening, since you are good enough to unbosom yourself to me;\nonly do not forget that I have asked you about nothing which it may be\nindiscreet in you to communicate.\"\n\nAramis seemed, for a moment, as if he were collecting himself.\n\n\"Do not speak!\" said Fouquet: \"there is still time enough.\"\n\n\"Do you remember,\" said the bishop, casting down his eyes, \"the birth of\nLouis XIV.?\"\n\n\"As if it were yesterday.\"\n\n\"Have you ever heard anything particular respecting his birth?\"\n\n\"Nothing; except that the king was not really the son of Louis XIII.\"\n\n\"That does not matter to us, or the kingdom either; he is the son of his\nfather, says the French law, whose father is recognized by law.\"\n\n\"True; but it is a grave matter, when the quality of races is called\ninto question.\"\n\n\"A merely secondary question, after all. So that, in fact, you have\nnever learned or heard anything in particular?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\n\"That is where my secret begins. The queen, you must know, instead of\nbeing delivered of a son, was delivered of twins.\"\n\nFouquet looked up suddenly as he replied:\n\n\"And the second is dead?\"\n\n\"You will see. These twins seemed likely to be regarded as the pride of\ntheir mother, and the hope of France; but the weak nature of the king,\nhis superstitious feelings, made him apprehend a series of conflicts\nbetween two children whose rights were equal; so he put out of the\nway--he suppressed--one of the twins.\"\n\n\"Suppressed, do you say?\"\n\n\"Have patience. Both the children grew up; the one on the throne, whose\nminister you are--the other, who is my friend, in gloom and isolation.\"\n\n\"Good heavens! What are you saying, Monsieur d'Herblay? And what is this\npoor prince doing?\"\n\n\"Ask me, rather, what has he done.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes.\"\n\n\"He was brought up in the country, and then thrown into a fortress which\ngoes by the name of the Bastile.\"\n\n\"Is it possible?\" cried the surintendant, clasping his hands.\n\n\"The one was the most fortunate of men: the other the most unhappy and\nmiserable of all living beings.\"\n\n\"Does his mother not know this?\"\n\n\"Anne of Austria knows it all.\"\n\n\"And the king?\"\n\n\"Knows absolutely nothing.\"\n\n\"So much the better,\" said Fouquet.\n\nThis remark seemed to make a great impression on Aramis; he looked at\nFouquet with the most anxious expression of countenance.\n\n\"I beg your pardon; I interrupted you,\" said Fouquet.\n\n\"I was saying,\" resumed Aramis, \"that this poor prince was the\nunhappiest of human beings, when Heaven, whose thoughts are over all His\ncreatures, undertook to come to his assistance.\"\n\n\"Oh! in what way? Tell me.\"\n\n\"You will see. The reigning king--I say the reigning king--you can guess\nvery well why?\"\n\n\"No. Why?\"\n\n\"Because _both_ of them, being legitimate princes, ought to have been\nkings. Is not that your opinion?\"\n\n\"It is, certainly.\"\n\n\"Unreservedly?\"\n\n\"Most unreservedly; twins are one person in two bodies.\"\n\n\"I am pleased that a legist of your learning and authority should\nhave pronounced such an opinion. It is agreed, then, that each of them\npossessed equal rights, is it not?\"\n\n\"Incontestably! but, gracious heavens, what an extraordinary\ncircumstance!\"\n\n\"We are not at the end of it yet.--Patience.\"\n\n\"Oh! I shall find 'patience' enough.\"\n\n\"Heaven wished to raise up for that oppressed child an avenger, or\na supporter, or vindicator, if you prefer it. It happened that the\nreigning king, the usurper--you are quite of my opinion, I believe, that\nit is an act of usurpation quietly to enjoy, and selfishly to assume the\nright over, an inheritance to which a man has only half a right?\"\n\n\"Yes, usurpation is the word.\"\n\n\"In that case, I continue. It was Heaven's will that the usurper should\npossess, in the person of his first minister, a man of great talent, of\nlarge and generous nature.\"\n\n\"Well, well,\" said Fouquet, \"I understand you; you have relied upon me\nto repair the wrong which has been done to this unhappy brother of Louis\nXIV. You have thought well; I will help you. I thank you, D'Herblay, I\nthank you.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, it is not that at all; you have not allowed me to finish,\" said\nAramis, perfectly unmoved.\n\n\"I will not say another word, then.\"\n\n\"M. Fouquet, I was observing, the minister of the reigning sovereign,\nwas suddenly taken into the greatest aversion, and menaced with the\nruin of his fortune, loss of liberty, loss of life even, by intrigue and\npersonal hatred, to which the king gave too readily an attentive ear.\nBut Heaven permits (still, however, out of consideration for the unhappy\nprince who had been sacrificed) that M. Fouquet should in his turn have\na devoted friend who knew this state secret, and felt that he possessed\nstrength and courage enough to divulge this secret, after having had the\nstrength to carry it locked up in his own heart for twenty years.\n\n\"Go no farther,\" said Fouquet, full of generous feelings. \"I understand\nyou, and can guess everything now. You went to see the king when the\nintelligence of my arrest reached you; you implored him, he refused to\nlisten to you; then you threatened him with that secret, threatened to\nreveal it, and Louis XIV., alarmed at the risk of its betrayal, granted\nto the terror of your indiscretion what he refused to your generous\nintercession. I understand, I understand; you have the king in your\npower; I understand.\"\n\n\"You understand _nothing_--as yet,\" replied Aramis, \"and again you\ninterrupt me. Then, too, allow me to observe that you pay no attention\nto logical reasoning, and seem to forget what you ought most to\nremember.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"You know upon what I laid the greatest stress at the beginning of our\nconversation?\"\n\n\"Yes, his majesty's hate, invincible hate for me; yes, but what feeling\nof hate could resist the threat of such a revelation?\"\n\n\"Such a revelation, do you say? that is the very point where your logic\nfails you. What! do you suppose that if I had made such a revelation to\nthe king, I should have been alive now?\"\n\n\"It is not ten minutes ago that you were with the king.\"\n\n\"That may be. He might not have had the time to get me killed outright,\nbut he would have had the time to get me gagged and thrown in a dungeon.\nCome, come, show a little consistency in your reasoning, _mordieu!_\"\n\nAnd by the mere use of this word, which was so thoroughly his old\nmusketeer's expression, forgotten by one who never seemed to forget\nanything, Fouquet could not but understand to what a pitch of exaltation\nthe calm, impenetrable bishop of Vannes had wrought himself. He\nshuddered.\n\n\"And then,\" replied the latter, after having mastered his feelings,\n\"should I be the man I really am, should I be the true friend you\nbelieve me, if I were to expose you, whom the king already hates so\nbitterly, to a feeling more than ever to be dreaded in that young man?\nTo have robbed him, is nothing; to have addressed the woman he loves, is\nnot much; but to hold in your keeping both his crown and his honor, why,\nhe would pluck out your heart with his own hands.\"\n\n\"You have not allowed him to penetrate your secret, then?\"\n\n\"I would sooner, far sooner, have swallowed at one draught all the\npoisons that Mithridates drank in twenty years, in order to try and\navoid death, than have betrayed my secret to the king.\"\n\n\"What have you done, then?\"\n\n\"Ah! now we are coming to the point, monseigneur. I think I shall not\nfail to excite in you a little interest. You are listening, I hope.\"\n\n\"How can you ask me if I am listening? Go on.\"\n\nAramis walked softly all round the room, satisfied himself that they\nwere alone, and that all was silent, and then returned and placed\nhimself close to the armchair in which Fouquet was seated, awaiting with\nthe deepest anxiety the revelation he had to make.\n\n\"I forgot to tell you,\" resumed Aramis, addressing himself to Fouquet,\nwho listened to him with the most absorbed attention--\"I forgot to\nmention a most remarkable circumstance respecting these twins, namely,\nthat God had formed them so startlingly, so miraculously, like each\nother, that it would be utterly impossible to distinguish the one from\nthe other. Their own mother would not be able to distinguish them.\"\n\n\"Is it possible?\" exclaimed Fouquet.\n\n\"The same noble character in their features, the same carriage, the same\nstature, the same voice.\"\n\n\"But their thoughts? degree of intelligence? their knowledge of human\nlife?\"\n\n\"There is inequality there, I admit, monseigneur. Yes; for the prisoner\nof the Bastile is, most incontestably, superior in every way to his\nbrother; and if, from his prison, this unhappy victim were to pass to\nthe throne, France would not, from the earliest period of its history,\nperhaps, have had a master more powerful in genius and nobility of\ncharacter.\"\n\nFouquet buried his face in his hands, as if he were overwhelmed by the\nweight of this immense secret. Aramis approached him.\n\n\"There is a further inequality,\" he said, continuing his work of\ntemptation, \"an inequality which concerns yourself, monseigneur, between\nthe twins, both sons of Louis XIII., namely, the last comer does not\nknow M. Colbert.\"\n\nFouquet raised his head immediately--his features were pale and\ndistorted. The bolt had hit its mark--not his heart, but his mind and\ncomprehension.\n\n\"I understand you,\" he said to Aramis; \"you are proposing a conspiracy\nto me?\"\n\n\"Something like it.\"\n\n\"One of those attempts which, as you said at the beginning of this\nconversation, alters the fate of empires?\"\n\n\"And of superintendents, too; yes, monseigneur.\"\n\n\"In a word, you propose that I should agree to the substitution of the\nson of Louis XIII., who is now a prisoner in the Bastile, for the son of\nLouis XIII., who is at this moment asleep in the Chamber of Morpheus?\"\n\nAramis smiled with the sinister expression of the sinister thought which\nwas passing through his brain. \"Exactly,\" he said.\n\n\"Have you thought,\" continued Fouquet, becoming animated with that\nstrength of talent which in a few seconds originates, and matures the\nconception of a plan, and with that largeness of view which foresees all\nconsequences, and embraces every result at a glance--\"have you thought\nthat we must assemble the nobility, the clergy, and the third estate\nof the realm; that we shall have to depose the reigning sovereign, to\ndisturb by so frightful a scandal the tomb of their dead father, to\nsacrifice the life, the honor of a woman, Anne of Austria, the life and\npeace of mind and heart of another woman, Maria Theresa; and suppose\nthat it were all done, if we were to succeed in doing it--\"\n\n\"I do not understand you,\" continued Aramis, coldly. \"There is not a\nsingle syllable of sense in all you have just said.\"\n\n\"What!\" said the superintendent, surprised, \"a man like you refuse to\nview the practical bearing of the case! Do you confine yourself to the\nchildish delight of a political illusion, and neglect the chances of its\nbeing carried into execution; in other words, the reality itself, is it\npossible?\"\n\n\"My friend,\" said Aramis, emphasizing the word with a kind of disdainful\nfamiliarity, \"what does Heaven do in order to substitute one king for\nanother?\"\n\n\"Heaven!\" exclaimed Fouquet--\"Heaven gives directions to its agent,\nwho seizes upon the doomed victim, hurries him away, and seats the\ntriumphant rival on the empty throne. But you forget that this agent is\ncalled death. Oh! Monsieur d'Herblay, in Heaven's name, tell me if you\nhave had the idea--\"\n\n\"There is no question of that, monseigneur; you are going beyond the\nobject in view. Who spoke of Louis XIV.'s death? who spoke of adopting\nthe example which Heaven sets in following out the strict execution\nof its decrees? No, I wish you to understand that Heaven effects its\npurposes without confusion or disturbance, without exciting comment\nor remark, without difficulty or exertion; and that men, inspired by\nHeaven, succeed like Heaven itself, in all their undertakings, in all\nthey attempt, in all they do.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I mean, my _friend_,\" returned Aramis, with the same intonation on the\nword friend that he had applied to it the first time--\"I mean that\nif there has been any confusion, scandal, and even effort in the\nsubstitution of the prisoner for the king, I defy you to prove it.\"\n\n\"What!\" cried Fouquet, whiter than the handkerchief with which he wiped\nhis temples, \"what do you say?\"\n\n\"Go to the king's apartment,\" continued Aramis, tranquilly, \"and you who\nknow the mystery, I defy even you to perceive that the prisoner of the\nBastile is lying in his brother's bed.\"\n\n\"But the king,\" stammered Fouquet, seized with horror at the\nintelligence.\n\n\"What king?\" said Aramis, in his gentlest tone; \"the one who hates you,\nor the one who likes you?\"\n\n\"The king--of--_yesterday_.\"\n\n\"The king of yesterday! be quite easy on that score; he has gone to take\nthe place in the Bastile which his victim occupied for so many years.\"\n\n\"Great God! And who took him there?\"\n\n\"I.\"\n\n\"You?\"\n\n\"Yes, and in the simplest way. I carried him away last night. While he\nwas descending into midnight, the other was ascending into day. I do\nnot think there has been any disturbance whatever. A flash of lightning\nwithout thunder awakens nobody.\"\n\nFouquet uttered a thick, smothered cry, as if he had been struck by some\ninvisible blow, and clasping his head between his clenched hands, he\nmurmured: \"You did that?\"\n\n\"Cleverly enough, too; what do you think of it?\"\n\n\"You dethroned the king? imprisoned him, too?\"\n\n\"Yes, that has been done.\"\n\n\"And such an action was committed _here_, at Vaux?\"\n\n\"Yes, here, at Vaux, in the Chamber of Morpheus. It would almost seem\nthat it had been built in anticipation of such an act.\"\n\n\"And at what time did it occur?\"\n\n\"Last night, between twelve and one o'clock.\"\n\nFouquet made a movement as if he were on the point of springing upon\nAramis; he restrained himself. \"At Vaux; under my roof!\" he said, in a\nhalf-strangled voice.\n\n\"I believe so! for it is still your house, and it is likely to continue\nso, since M. Colbert cannot rob you of it now.\"\n\n\"It was under my roof, then, monsieur, that you committed this crime?\"\n\n\"This crime?\" said Aramis, stupefied.\n\n\"This abominable crime!\" pursued Fouquet, becoming more and more\nexcited; \"this crime more execrable than an assassination! this crime\nwhich dishonors my name forever, and entails upon me the horror of\nposterity.\"\n\n\"You are not in your senses, monsieur,\" replied Aramis, in an irresolute\ntone of voice; \"you are speaking too loudly; take care!\"\n\n\"I will call out so loudly, that the whole world shall hear me.\"\n\n\"Monsieur Fouquet, take care!\"\n\nFouquet turned round towards the prelate, whom he looked at full in the\nface. \"You have dishonored me,\" he said, \"in committing so foul an\nact of treason, so heinous a crime upon my guest, upon one who was\npeacefully reposing beneath my roof. Oh! woe, woe is me!\"\n\n\"Woe to the man, rather, who beneath your roof meditated the ruin of\nyour fortune, your life. Do you forget that?\"\n\n\"He was my guest, my sovereign.\"\n\nAramis rose, his eyes literally bloodshot, his mouth trembling\nconvulsively. \"Have I a man out of his senses to deal with?\" he said.\n\n\"You have an honorable man to deal with.\"\n\n\"You are mad.\"\n\n\"A man who will prevent you consummating your crime.\"\n\n\"You are mad, I say.\"\n\n\"A man who would sooner, oh! far sooner, die; who would kill you even,\nrather than allow you to complete his dishonor.\"\n\nAnd Fouquet snatched up his sword, which D'Artagnan had placed at the\nhead of his bed, and clenched it resolutely in his hand. Aramis frowned,\nand thrust his hand into his breast as if in search of a weapon. This\nmovement did not escape Fouquet, who, full of nobleness and pride in\nhis magnanimity, threw his sword to a distance from him, and approached\nAramis so close as to touch his shoulder with his disarmed hand.\n\"Monsieur,\" he said, \"I would sooner die here on the spot than survive\nthis terrible disgrace; and if you have any pity left for me, I entreat\nyou to take my life.\"\n\nAramis remained silent and motionless.\n\n\"You do not reply?\" said Fouquet.\n\nAramis raised his head gently, and a glimmer of hope might be seen\nonce more to animate his eyes. \"Reflect, monseigneur,\" he said, \"upon\neverything we have to expect. As the matter now stands, the king is\nstill alive, and his imprisonment saves your life.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Fouquet, \"you may have been acting on my behalf, but I\nwill not, do not, accept your services. But, first of all, I do not wish\nyour ruin. You will leave this house.\"\n\nAramis stifled the exclamation which almost escaped his broken heart.\n\n\"I am hospitable towards all who are dwellers beneath my roof,\"\ncontinued Fouquet, with an air of inexpressible majesty; \"you will not\nbe more fatally lost than he whose ruin you have consummated.\"\n\n\"You will be so,\" said Aramis, in a hoarse, prophetic voice, \"you will\nbe so, believe me.\"\n\n\"I accept the augury, Monsieur d'Herblay; but nothing shall prevent me,\nnothing shall stop me. You will leave Vaux--you must leave France; I\ngive you four hours to place yourself out of the king's reach.\"\n\n\"Four hours?\" said Aramis, scornfully and incredulously.\n\n\"Upon the word of Fouquet, no one shall follow you before the expiration\nof that time. You will therefore have four hours' advance of those whom\nthe king may wish to dispatch after you.\"\n\n\"Four hours!\" repeated Aramis, in a thick, smothered voice.\n\n\"It is more than you will need to get on board a vessel and flee to\nBelle-Isle, which I give you as a place of refuge.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" murmured Aramis.\n\n\"Belle-Isle is as much mine for you, as Vaux is mine for the king.\nGo, D'Herblay, go! as long as I live, not a hair of your head shall be\ninjured.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Aramis, with a cold irony of manner.\n\n\"Go at once, then, and give me your hand, before we both hasten away;\nyou to save your life, I to save my honor.\"\n\nAramis withdrew from his breast the hand he had concealed there; it was\nstained with his blood. He had dug his nails into his flesh, as if in\npunishment for having nursed so many projects, more vain, insensate, and\nfleeting than the life of the man himself. Fouquet was horror-stricken,\nand then his heart smote him with pity. He threw open his arms as if to\nembrace him.\n\n\"I had no arms,\" murmured Aramis, as wild and terrible in his wrath as\nthe shade of Dido. And then, without touching Fouquet's hand, he turned\nhis head aside, and stepped back a pace or two. His last word was an\nimprecation, his last gesture a curse, which his blood-stained hand\nseemed to invoke, as it sprinkled on Fouquet's face a few drops of blood\nwhich flowed from his breast. And both of them darted out of the room\nby the secret staircase which led down to the inner courtyard. Fouquet\nordered his best horses, while Aramis paused at the foot of the\nstaircase which led to Porthos's apartment. He reflected profoundly\nand for some time, while Fouquet's carriage left the courtyard at full\ngallop.\n\n\"Shall I go alone?\" said Aramis to himself, \"or warn the prince? Oh!\nfury! Warn the prince, and then--do what? Take him with me? To carry\nthis accusing witness about with me everywhere? War, too, would\nfollow--civil war, implacable in its nature! And without any resource\nsave myself--it is impossible! What could he do without me? Oh!\nwithout me he will be utterly destroyed. Yet who knows--let destiny\nbe fulfilled--condemned he was, let him remain so then! Good or evil\nSpirit--gloomy and scornful Power, whom men call the genius of humanity,\nthou art a power more restlessly uncertain, more baselessly useless,\nthan wild mountain wind! Chance, thou term'st thyself, but thou art\nnothing; thou inflamest everything with thy breath, crumblest mountains\nat thy approach, and suddenly art thyself destroyed at the presence of\nthe Cross of dead wood behind which stand another Power invisible like\nthyself--whom thou deniest, perhaps, but whose avenging hand is on thee,\nand hurls thee in the dust dishonored and unnamed! Lost!--I am lost!\nWhat can be done? Flee to Belle-Isle? Yes, and leave Porthos behind me,\nto talk and relate the whole affair to every one! Porthos, too, who will\nhave to suffer for what he has done. I will not let poor Porthos suffer.\nHe seems like one of the members of my own frame; and his grief or\nmisfortune would be mine as well. Porthos shall leave with me, and shall\nfollow my destiny. It must be so.\"\n\nAnd Aramis, apprehensive of meeting any one to whom his hurried\nmovements might appear suspicious, ascended the staircase without being\nperceived. Porthos, so recently returned from Paris, was already\n\n### Summary:\n\n", "answer": "Fouquet is anxious as he receives D'Artagnan and Aramis. He learns he is free, and that he has Aramis to thank. Fouquet is more humiliated than grateful. D'Artagnan asks Aramis if he can ask a question. D'Artagnan asks how Aramis became so close with the King, when he's only ever talked to him twice before. Aramis becomes very secretive and tells D'Artagnan that he's actually hung out with the King hundreds of times. They've just kept in a secret. D'Artagnan buys it. And now he's embarrassed. Aramis tells Fouquet that the King has really enjoyed the party. It's clear the two men have catching up to do. D'Artagnan can tell he's not wanted, but sticks around anyway. Aramis not-so-subtly tells the Musketeer to leave; he obliges. Aramis fills Fouquet in on the charges against him - the millions missing from the treasury, and the attempts to woo the King's mistress. Fouquet expresses his happiness that the King has clearly gotten over these issues. After some hemming and hawing, Aramis confesses everything to Fouquet. When Fouquet finally sees the light, he asks with horror and wonders what has happened to the King. Fouquet refuses to see Aramis's actions as divine favor. He is aghast that Aramis has dared to perpetrate this crime under his roof. He is so enraged he almost fights Aramis. Rejecting Aramis's actions and explanations, Fouquet tells Aramis to get out of Vaux, and to get out of France. He tells Aramis that he has four hours to get out of the King's reach. Fouquet is an honorable man, so he tells Aramis that he and Porthos can go to his fortress called Belle-Isle. No one can touch them there without Fouquet's permission. Fouquet gives two of his best horses to Aramis. As Aramis descends a secret staircase, he wonders what to do with either Porthos or Philippe. He decides to leave the Philippe to his own devices, but to take Porthos. After instructing Porthos that they are on a mission, the two men mount their horses right in front of D'Artagnan, who holds the stirrups and bids them farewell. D'Artagnan muses that in another time it would be said the two men were clearly trying to escape pursuit."}

The Fellow of No Delicacy\n\n\nIf Sydney Carton ever shone anywhere, he certainly never shone in the\nhouse of Doctor Manette. He had been there often, during a whole year,\nand had always been the same moody and morose lounger there. When he\ncared to talk, he talked well; but, the cloud of caring for nothing,\nwhich overshadowed him with such a fatal darkness, was very rarely\npierced by the light within him.\n\nAnd yet he did care something for the streets that environed that house,\nand for the senseless stones that made their pavements. Many a night\nhe vaguely and unhappily wandered there, when wine had brought no\ntransitory gladness to him; many a dreary daybreak revealed his solitary\nfigure lingering there, and still lingering there when the first beams\nof the sun brought into strong relief, removed beauties of architecture\nin spires of churches and lofty buildings, as perhaps the quiet time\nbrought some sense of better things, else forgotten and unattainable,\ninto his mind. Of late, the neglected bed in the Temple Court had known\nhim more scantily than ever; and often when he had thrown himself upon\nit no longer than a few minutes, he had got up again, and haunted that\nneighbourhood.\n\nOn a day in August, when Mr. Stryver (after notifying to his jackal\nthat \"he had thought better of that marrying matter\") had carried his\ndelicacy into Devonshire, and when the sight and scent of flowers in the\nCity streets had some waifs of goodness in them for the worst, of health\nfor the sickliest, and of youth for the oldest, Sydney's feet still trod\nthose stones. From being irresolute and purposeless, his feet became\nanimated by an intention, and, in the working out of that intention,\nthey took him to the Doctor's door.\n\nHe was shown up-stairs, and found Lucie at her work, alone. She had\nnever been quite at her ease with him, and received him with some little\nembarrassment as he seated himself near her table. But, looking up at\nhis face in the interchange of the first few common-places, she observed\na change in it.\n\n\"I fear you are not well, Mr. Carton!\"\n\n\"No. But the life I lead, Miss Manette, is not conducive to health. What\nis to be expected of, or by, such profligates?\"\n\n\"Is it not--forgive me; I have begun the question on my lips--a pity to\nlive no better life?\"\n\n\"God knows it is a shame!\"\n\n\"Then why not change it?\"\n\nLooking gently at him again, she was surprised and saddened to see that\nthere were tears in his eyes. There were tears in his voice too, as he\nanswered:\n\n\"It is too late for that. I shall never be better than I am. I shall\nsink lower, and be worse.\"\n\nHe leaned an elbow on her table, and covered his eyes with his hand. The\ntable trembled in the silence that followed.\n\nShe had never seen him softened, and was much distressed. He knew her to\nbe so, without looking at her, and said:\n\n\"Pray forgive me, Miss Manette. I break down before the knowledge of\nwhat I want to say to you. Will you hear me?\"\n\n\"If it will do you any good, Mr. Carton, if it would make you happier,\nit would make me very glad!\"\n\n\"God bless you for your sweet compassion!\"\n\nHe unshaded his face after a little while, and spoke steadily.\n\n\"Don't be afraid to hear me. Don't shrink from anything I say. I am like\none who died young. All my life might have been.\"\n\n\"No, Mr. Carton. I am sure that the best part of it might still be; I am\nsure that you might be much, much worthier of yourself.\"\n\n\"Say of you, Miss Manette, and although I know better--although in the\nmystery of my own wretched heart I know better--I shall never forget\nit!\"\n\nShe was pale and trembling. He came to her relief with a fixed despair\nof himself which made the interview unlike any other that could have\nbeen holden.\n\n\"If it had been possible, Miss Manette, that you could have returned the\nlove of the man you see before yourself--flung away, wasted, drunken,\npoor creature of misuse as you know him to be--he would have been\nconscious this day and hour, in spite of his happiness, that he would\nbring you to misery, bring you to sorrow and repentance, blight you,\ndisgrace you, pull you down with him. I know very well that you can have\nno tenderness for me; I ask for none; I am even thankful that it cannot\nbe.\"\n\n\"Without it, can I not save you, Mr. Carton? Can I not recall\nyou--forgive me again!--to a better course? Can I in no way repay your\nconfidence? I know this is a confidence,\" she modestly said, after a\nlittle hesitation, and in earnest tears, \"I know you would say this to\nno one else. Can I turn it to no good account for yourself, Mr. Carton?\"\n\nHe shook his head.\n\n\"To none. No, Miss Manette, to none. If you will hear me through a very\nlittle more, all you can ever do for me is done. I wish you to know that\nyou have been the last dream of my soul. In my degradation I have not\nbeen so degraded but that the sight of you with your father, and of this\nhome made such a home by you, has stirred old shadows that I thought had\ndied out of me. Since I knew you, I have been troubled by a remorse that\nI thought would never reproach me again, and have heard whispers from\nold voices impelling me upward, that I thought were silent for ever. I\nhave had unformed ideas of striving afresh, beginning anew, shaking off\nsloth and sensuality, and fighting out the abandoned fight. A dream, all\na dream, that ends in nothing, and leaves the sleeper where he lay down,\nbut I wish you to know that you inspired it.\"\n\n\"Will nothing of it remain? O Mr. Carton, think again! Try again!\"\n\n\"No, Miss Manette; all through it, I have known myself to be quite\nundeserving. And yet I have had the weakness, and have still the\nweakness, to wish you to know with what a sudden mastery you kindled me,\nheap of ashes that I am, into fire--a fire, however, inseparable in\nits nature from myself, quickening nothing, lighting nothing, doing no\nservice, idly burning away.\"\n\n\"Since it is my misfortune, Mr. Carton, to have made you more unhappy\nthan you were before you knew me--\"\n\n\"Don't say that, Miss Manette, for you would have reclaimed me, if\nanything could. You will not be the cause of my becoming worse.\"\n\n\"Since the state of your mind that you describe, is, at all events,\nattributable to some influence of mine--this is what I mean, if I can\nmake it plain--can I use no influence to serve you? Have I no power for\ngood, with you, at all?\"\n\n\"The utmost good that I am capable of now, Miss Manette, I have come\nhere to realise. Let me carry through the rest of my misdirected life,\nthe remembrance that I opened my heart to you, last of all the world;\nand that there was something left in me at this time which you could\ndeplore and pity.\"\n\n\"Which I entreated you to believe, again and again, most fervently, with\nall my heart, was capable of better things, Mr. Carton!\"\n\n\"Entreat me to believe it no more, Miss Manette. I have proved myself,\nand I know better. I distress you; I draw fast to an end. Will you let\nme believe, when I recall this day, that the last confidence of my life\nwas reposed in your pure and innocent breast, and that it lies there\nalone, and will be shared by no one?\"\n\n\"If that will be a consolation to you, yes.\"\n\n\"Not even by the dearest one ever to be known to you?\"\n\n\"Mr. Carton,\" she answered, after an agitated pause, \"the secret is\nyours, not mine; and I promise to respect it.\"\n\n\"Thank you. And again, God bless you.\"\n\nHe put her hand to his lips, and moved towards the door.\n\n\"Be under no apprehension, Miss Manette, of my ever resuming this\nconversation by so much as a passing word. I will never refer to it\nagain. If I were dead, that could not be surer than it is henceforth. In\nthe hour of my death, I shall hold sacred the one good remembrance--and\nshall thank and bless you for it--that my last avowal of myself was made\nto you, and that my name, and faults, and miseries were gently carried\nin your heart. May it otherwise be light and happy!\"\n\nHe was so unlike what he had ever shown himself to be, and it was so\nsad to think how much he had thrown away, and how much he every day kept\ndown and perverted, that Lucie Manette wept mournfully for him as he\nstood looking back at her.\n\n\"Be comforted!\" he said, \"I am not worth such feeling, Miss Manette. An\nhour or two hence, and the low companions and low habits that I scorn\nbut yield to, will render me less worth such tears as those, than any\nwretch who creeps along the streets. Be comforted! But, within myself, I\nshall always be, towards you, what I am now, though outwardly I shall be\nwhat you have heretofore seen me. The last supplication but one I make\nto you, is, that you will believe this of me.\"\n\n\"I will, Mr. Carton.\"\n\n\"My last supplication of all, is this; and with it, I will relieve\nyou of a visitor with whom I well know you have nothing in unison, and\nbetween whom and you there is an impassable space. It is useless to say\nit, I know, but it rises out of my soul. For you, and for any dear to\nyou, I would do anything. If my career were of that better kind that\nthere was any opportunity or capacity of sacrifice in it, I would\nembrace any sacrifice for you and for those dear to you. Try to hold\nme in your mind, at some quiet times, as ardent and sincere in this one\nthing. The time will come, the time will not be long in coming, when new\nties will be formed about you--ties that will bind you yet more tenderly\nand strongly to the home you so adorn--the dearest ties that will ever\ngrace and gladden you. O Miss Manette, when the little picture of a\nhappy father's face looks up in yours, when you see your own bright\nbeauty springing up anew at your feet, think now and then that there is\na man who would give his life, to keep a life you love beside you!\"\n\nHe said, \"Farewell!\" said a last \"God bless you!\" and left her.\n\n\n\n\n\nXIV. The Honest Tradesman\n\n\nTo the eyes of Mr. Jeremiah Cruncher, sitting on his stool in\nFleet-street with his grisly urchin beside him, a vast number and\nvariety of objects in movement were every day presented. Who could sit\nupon anything in Fleet-street during the busy hours of the day, and\nnot be dazed and deafened by two immense processions, one ever tending\nwestward with the sun, the other ever tending eastward from the sun,\nboth ever tending to the plains beyond the range of red and purple where\nthe sun goes down!\n\nWith his straw in his mouth, Mr. Cruncher sat watching the two streams,\nlike the heathen rustic who has for several centuries been on duty\nwatching one stream--saving that Jerry had no expectation of their ever\nrunning dry. Nor would it have been an expectation of a hopeful kind,\nsince a small part of his income was derived from the pilotage of timid\nwomen (mostly of a full habit and past the middle term of life) from\nTellson's side of the tides to the opposite shore. Brief as such\ncompanionship was in every separate instance, Mr. Cruncher never failed\nto become so interested in the lady as to express a strong desire to\nhave the honour of drinking her very good health. And it was from\nthe gifts bestowed upon him towards the execution of this benevolent\npurpose, that he recruited his finances, as just now observed.\n\nTime was, when a poet sat upon a stool in a public place, and mused in\nthe sight of men. Mr. Cruncher, sitting on a stool in a public place,\nbut not being a poet, mused as little as possible, and looked about him.\n\nIt fell out that he was thus engaged in a season when crowds were\nfew, and belated women few, and when his affairs in general were so\nunprosperous as to awaken a strong suspicion in his breast that Mrs.\nCruncher must have been \"flopping\" in some pointed manner, when an\nunusual concourse pouring down Fleet-street westward, attracted his\nattention. Looking that way, Mr. Cruncher made out that some kind of\nfuneral was coming along, and that there was popular objection to this\nfuneral, which engendered uproar.\n\n\"Young Jerry,\" said Mr. Cruncher, turning to his offspring, \"it's a\nburyin'.\"\n\n\"Hooroar, father!\" cried Young Jerry.\n\nThe young gentleman uttered this exultant sound with mysterious\nsignificance. The elder gentleman took the cry so ill, that he watched\nhis opportunity, and smote the young gentleman on the ear.\n\n\"What d'ye mean? What are you hooroaring at? What do you want to conwey\nto your own father, you young Rip? This boy is a getting too many for\n_me_!\" said Mr. Cruncher, surveying him. \"Him and his hooroars! Don't\nlet me hear no more of you, or you shall feel some more of me. D'ye\nhear?\"\n\n\"I warn't doing no harm,\" Young Jerry protested, rubbing his cheek.\n\n\"Drop it then,\" said Mr. Cruncher; \"I won't have none of _your_ no\nharms. Get a top of that there seat, and look at the crowd.\"\n\nHis son obeyed, and the crowd approached; they were bawling and hissing\nround a dingy hearse and dingy mourning coach, in which mourning coach\nthere was only one mourner, dressed in the dingy trappings that were\nconsidered essential to the dignity of the position. The position\nappeared by no means to please him, however, with an increasing rabble\nsurrounding the coach, deriding him, making grimaces at him, and\nincessantly groaning and calling out: \"Yah! Spies! Tst! Yaha! Spies!\"\nwith many compliments too numerous and forcible to repeat.\n\nFunerals had at all times a remarkable attraction for Mr. Cruncher; he\nalways pricked up his senses, and became excited, when a funeral passed\nTellson's. Naturally, therefore, a funeral with this uncommon attendance\nexcited him greatly, and he asked of the first man who ran against him:\n\n\"What is it, brother? What's it about?\"\n\n\"_I_ don't know,\" said the man. \"Spies! Yaha! Tst! Spies!\"\n\nHe asked another man. \"Who is it?\"\n\n\"_I_ don't know,\" returned the man, clapping his hands to his mouth\nnevertheless, and vociferating in a surprising heat and with the\ngreatest ardour, \"Spies! Yaha! Tst, tst! Spi--ies!\"\n\nAt length, a person better informed on the merits of the case, tumbled\nagainst him, and from this person he learned that the funeral was the\nfuneral of one Roger Cly.\n\n\"Was he a spy?\" asked Mr. Cruncher.\n\n\"Old Bailey spy,\" returned his informant. \"Yaha! Tst! Yah! Old Bailey\nSpi--i--ies!\"\n\n\"Why, to be sure!\" exclaimed Jerry, recalling the Trial at which he had\nassisted. \"I've seen him. Dead, is he?\"\n\n\"Dead as mutton,\" returned the other, \"and can't be too dead. Have 'em\nout, there! Spies! Pull 'em out, there! Spies!\"\n\nThe idea was so acceptable in the prevalent absence of any idea,\nthat the crowd caught it up with eagerness, and loudly repeating the\nsuggestion to have 'em out, and to pull 'em out, mobbed the two vehicles\nso closely that they came to a stop. On the crowd's opening the coach\ndoors, the one mourner scuffled out by himself and was in their hands\nfor a moment; but he was so alert, and made such good use of his time,\nthat in another moment he was scouring away up a bye-street, after\nshedding his cloak, hat, long hatband, white pocket-handkerchief, and\nother symbolical tears.\n\nThese, the people tore to pieces and scattered far and wide with great\nenjoyment, while the tradesmen hurriedly shut up their shops; for a\ncrowd in those times stopped at nothing, and was a monster much dreaded.\nThey had already got the length of opening the hearse to take the coffin\nout, when some brighter genius proposed instead, its being escorted to\nits destination amidst general rejoicing. Practical suggestions being\nmuch needed, this suggestion, too, was received with acclamation, and\nthe coach was immediately filled with eight inside and a dozen out,\nwhile as many people got on the roof of the hearse as could by any\nexercise of ingenuity stick upon it. Among the first of these volunteers\nwas Jerry Cruncher himself, who modestly concealed his spiky head from\nthe observation of Tellson's, in the further corner of the mourning\ncoach.\n\nThe officiating undertakers made some protest against these changes in\nthe ceremonies; but, the river being alarmingly near, and several voices\nremarking on the efficacy of cold immersion in bringing refractory\nmembers of the profession to reason, the protest was faint and brief.\nThe remodelled procession started, with a chimney-sweep driving the\nhearse--advised by the regular driver, who was perched beside him, under\nclose inspection, for the purpose--and with a pieman, also attended\nby his cabinet minister, driving the mourning coach. A bear-leader, a\npopular street character of the time, was impressed as an additional\nornament, before the cavalcade had gone far down the Strand; and his\nbear, who was black and very mangy, gave quite an Undertaking air to\nthat part of the procession in which he walked.\n\nThus, with beer-drinking, pipe-smoking, song-roaring, and infinite\ncaricaturing of woe, the disorderly procession went its way, recruiting\nat every step, and all the shops shutting up before it. Its destination\nwas the old church of Saint Pancras, far off in the fields. It got there\nin course of time; insisted on pouring into the burial-ground; finally,\naccomplished the interment of the deceased Roger Cly in its own way, and\nhighly to its own satisfaction.\n\nThe dead man disposed of, and the crowd being under the necessity of\nproviding some other entertainment for itself, another brighter\ngenius (or perhaps the same) conceived the humour of impeaching casual\npassers-by, as Old Bailey spies, and wreaking vengeance on them. Chase\nwas given to some scores of inoffensive persons who had never been near\nthe Old Bailey in their lives, in the realisation of this fancy, and\nthey were roughly hustled and maltreated. The transition to the sport of\nwindow-breaking, and thence to the plundering of public-houses, was easy\nand natural. At last, after several hours, when sundry summer-houses had\nbeen pulled down, and some area-railings had been torn up, to arm\nthe more belligerent spirits, a rumour got about that the Guards were\ncoming. Before this rumour, the crowd gradually melted away, and perhaps\nthe Guards came, and perhaps they never came, and this was the usual\nprogress of a mob.\n\nMr. Cruncher did not assist at the closing sports, but had remained\nbehind in the churchyard, to confer and condole with the undertakers.\nThe place had a soothing influence on him. He procured a pipe from a\nneighbouring public-house, and smoked it, looking in at the railings and\nmaturely considering the spot.\n\n\"Jerry,\" said Mr. Cruncher, apostrophising himself in his usual way,\n\"you see that there Cly that day, and you see with your own eyes that he\nwas a young 'un and a straight made 'un.\"\n\nHaving smoked his pipe out, and ruminated a little longer, he turned\nhimself about, that he might appear, before the hour of closing, on his\nstation at Tellson's. Whether his meditations on mortality had touched\nhis liver, or whether his general health had been previously at all\namiss, or whether he desired to show a little attention to an eminent\nman, is not so much to the purpose, as that he made a short call upon\nhis medical adviser--a distinguished surgeon--on his way back.\n\nYoung Jerry relieved his father with dutiful interest, and reported No\njob in his absence. The bank closed, the ancient clerks came out, the\nusual watch was set, and Mr. Cruncher and his son went home to tea.\n\n\"Now, I tell you where it is!\" said Mr. Cruncher to his wife, on\nentering. \"If, as a honest tradesman, my wenturs goes wrong to-night, I\nshall make sure that you've been praying again me, and I shall work you\nfor it just the same as if I seen you do it.\"\n\nThe dejected Mrs. Cruncher shook her head.\n\n\"Why, you're at it afore my face!\" said Mr. Cruncher, with signs of\nangry apprehension.\n\n\"I am saying nothing.\"\n\n\"Well, then; don't meditate nothing. You might as well flop as meditate.\nYou may as well go again me one way as another. Drop it altogether.\"\n\n\"Yes, Jerry.\"\n\n\"Yes, Jerry,\" repeated Mr. Cruncher sitting down to tea. \"Ah! It _is_\nyes, Jerry. That's about it. You may say yes, Jerry.\"\n\nMr. Cruncher had no particular meaning in these sulky corroborations,\nbut made use of them, as people not unfrequently do, to express general\nironical dissatisfaction.\n\n\"You and your yes, Jerry,\" said Mr. Cruncher, taking a bite out of his\nbread-and-butter, and seeming to help it down with a large invisible\noyster out of his saucer. \"Ah! I think so. I believe you.\"\n\n\"You are going out to-night?\" asked his decent wife, when he took\nanother bite.\n\n\"Yes, I am.\"\n\n\"May I go with you, father?\" asked his son, briskly.\n\n\"No, you mayn't. I'm a going--as your mother knows--a fishing. That's\nwhere I'm going to. Going a fishing.\"\n\n\"Your fishing-rod gets rayther rusty; don't it, father?\"\n\n\"Never you mind.\"\n\n\"Shall you bring any fish home, father?\"\n\n\"If I don't, you'll have short commons, to-morrow,\" returned that\ngentleman, shaking his head; \"that's questions enough for you; I ain't a\ngoing out, till you've been long abed.\"\n\nHe devoted himself during the remainder of the evening to keeping a\nmost vigilant watch on Mrs. Cruncher, and sullenly holding her in\nconversation that she might be prevented from meditating any petitions\nto his disadvantage. With this view, he urged his son to hold her in\nconversation also, and led the unfortunate woman a hard life by dwelling\non any causes of complaint he could bring against her, rather than\nhe would leave her for a moment to her own reflections. The devoutest\nperson could have rendered no greater homage to the efficacy of an\nhonest prayer than he did in this distrust of his wife. It was as if a\nprofessed unbeliever in ghosts should be frightened by a ghost story.\n\n\"And mind you!\" said Mr. Cruncher. \"No games to-morrow! If I, as a\nhonest tradesman, succeed in providing a jinte of meat or two, none\nof your not touching of it, and sticking to bread. If I, as a honest\ntradesman, am able to provide a little beer, none of your declaring\non water. When you go to Rome, do as Rome does. Rome will be a ugly\ncustomer to you, if you don't. _I_'m your Rome, you know.\"\n\nThen he began grumbling again:\n\n\"With your flying into the face of your own wittles and drink! I don't\nknow how scarce you mayn't make the wittles and drink here, by your\nflopping tricks and your unfeeling conduct. Look at your boy: he _is_\nyour'n, ain't he? He's as thin as a lath. Do you call yourself a mother,\nand not know that a mother's first duty is to blow her boy out?\"\n\nThis touched Young Jerry on a tender place; who adjured his mother to\nperform her first duty, and, whatever else she did or neglected, above\nall things to lay especial stress on the discharge of that maternal\nfunction so affectingly and delicately indicated by his other parent.\n\nThus the evening wore away with the Cruncher family, until Young Jerry\nwas ordered to bed, and his mother, laid under similar injunctions,\nobeyed them. Mr. Cruncher beguiled the earlier watches of the night with\nsolitary pipes, and did not start upon his excursion until nearly one\no'clock. Towards that small and ghostly hour, he rose up from his chair,\ntook a key out of his pocket, opened a locked cupboard, and brought\nforth a sack, a crowbar of convenient size, a rope and chain, and other\nfishing tackle of that nature. Disposing these articles about him\nin skilful manner, he bestowed a parting defiance on Mrs. Cruncher,\nextinguished the light, and went out.\n\nYoung Jerry, who had only made a feint of undressing when he went to\nbed, was not long after his father. Under cover of the darkness he\nfollowed out of the room, followed down the stairs, followed down the\ncourt, followed out into the streets. He was in no uneasiness concerning\nhis getting into the house again, for it was full of lodgers, and the\ndoor stood ajar all night.\n\nImpelled by a laudable ambition to study the art and mystery of his\nfather's honest calling, Young Jerry, keeping as close to house fronts,\nwalls, and doorways, as his eyes were close to one another, held his\nhonoured parent in view. The honoured parent steering Northward, had not\ngone far, when he was joined by another disciple of Izaak Walton, and\nthe two trudged on together.\n\nWithin half an hour from the first starting, they were beyond the\nwinking lamps, and the more than winking watchmen, and were out upon a\nlonely road. Another fisherman was picked up here--and that so silently,\nthat if Young Jerry had been superstitious, he might have supposed the\nsecond follower of the gentle craft to have, all of a sudden, split\nhimself into two.\n\nThe three went on, and Young Jerry went on, until the three stopped\nunder a bank overhanging the road. Upon the top of the bank was a low\nbrick wall, surmounted by an iron railing. In the shadow of bank and\nwall the three turned out of the road, and up a blind lane, of which\nthe wall--there, risen to some eight or ten feet high--formed one side.\nCrouching down in a corner, peeping up the lane, the next object that\nYoung Jerry saw, was the form of his honoured parent, pretty well\ndefined against a watery and clouded moon, nimbly scaling an iron gate.\nHe was soon over, and then the second fisherman got over, and then the\nthird. They all dropped softly on the ground within the gate, and lay\nthere a little--listening perhaps. Then, they moved away on their hands\nand knees.\n\nIt was now Young Jerry's turn to approach the gate: which he did,\nholding his breath. Crouching down again in a corner there, and looking\nin, he made out the three fishermen creeping through some rank grass!\nand all the gravestones in the churchyard--it was a large churchyard\nthat they were in--looking on like ghosts in white, while the church\ntower itself looked on like the ghost of a monstrous giant. They did not\ncreep far, before they stopped and stood upright. And then they began to\nfish.\n\nThey fished with a spade, at first. Presently the honoured parent\nappeared to be adjusting some instrument like a great corkscrew.\nWhatever tools they worked with, they worked hard, until the awful\nstriking of the church clock so terrified Young Jerry, that he made off,\nwith his hair as stiff as his father's.\n\nBut, his long-cherished desire to know more about these matters, not\nonly stopped him in his running away, but lured him back again. They\nwere still fishing perseveringly, when he peeped in at the gate for\nthe second time; but, now they seemed to have got a bite. There was a\nscrewing and complaining sound down below, and their bent figures were\nstrained, as if by a weight. By slow degrees the weight broke away the\nearth upon it, and came to the surface. Young Jerry very well knew what\nit would be; but, when he saw it, and saw his honoured parent about to\nwrench it open, he was so frightened, being new to the sight, that he\nmade off again, and never stopped until he had run a mile or more.\n\nHe would not have stopped then, for anything less necessary than breath,\nit being a spectral sort of race that he ran, and one highly desirable\nto get to the end of. He had a strong idea that the coffin he had seen\nwas running after him; and, pictured as hopping on behind him, bolt\nupright, upon its narrow end, always on the point of overtaking him\nand hopping on at his side--perhaps taking his arm--it was a pursuer to\nshun. It was an inconsistent and ubiquitous fiend too, for, while it\nwas making the whole night behind him dreadful, he darted out into the\nroadway to avoid dark alleys, fearful of its coming hopping out of them\nlike a dropsical boy's kite without tail and wings. It hid in doorways\ntoo, rubbing its horrible shoulders against doors, and drawing them up\nto its ears, as if it were laughing. It got into shadows on the road,\nand lay cunningly on its back to trip him up. All this time it was\nincessantly hopping on behind and gaining on him, so that when the boy\ngot to his own door he had reason for being half dead. And even then\nit would not leave him, but followed him upstairs with a bump on every\nstair, scrambled into bed with him, and bumped down, dead and heavy, on\nhis breast when he fell asleep.\n\nFrom his oppressed slumber, Young Jerry in his closet was awakened after\ndaybreak and before sunrise, by the presence of his father in the\nfamily room. Something had gone wrong with him; at least, so Young Jerry\ninferred, from the circumstance of his holding Mrs. Cruncher by the\nears, and knocking the back of her head against the head-board of the\nbed.\n\n\"I told you I would,\" said Mr. Cruncher, \"and I did.\"\n\n\"Jerry, Jerry, Jerry!\" his wife implored.\n\n\"You oppose yourself to the profit of the business,\" said Jerry, \"and me\nand my partners suffer. You was to honour and obey; why the devil don't\nyou?\"\n\n\"I try to be a good wife, Jerry,\" the poor woman protested, with tears.\n\n\"Is it being a good wife to oppose your husband's business? Is it\nhonouring your husband to dishonour his business? Is it obeying your\nhusband to disobey him on the wital subject of his business?\"\n\n\"You hadn't taken to the dreadful business then, Jerry.\"\n\n\"It's enough for you,\" retorted Mr. Cruncher, \"to be the wife of a\nhonest tradesman, and not to occupy your female mind with calculations\nwhen he took to his trade or when he didn't. A honouring and obeying\nwife would let his trade alone altogether. Call yourself a religious\nwoman? If you're a religious woman,\n\n### Summary:\n\n", "answer": "Carton is consumed by his feelings for Lucie and although his position is hopeless he decides to confide in Lucie.

Fouquet.\n\n\nD'Artagnan, still confused and oppressed by the conversation he had just\nhad with the king, could not resist asking himself if he were really in\npossession of his senses, if he were really and truly at Vaux; if he,\nD'Artagnan, were really the captain of the musketeers, and M. Fouquet\nthe owner of the chateau in which Louis XIV. was at that moment\npartaking of his hospitality. These reflections were not those of a\ndrunken man, although everything was in prodigal profusion at Vaux, and\nthe surintendant's wines had met with a distinguished reception at the\n_fete_. The Gascon, however, was a man of calm self-possession; and no\nsooner did he touch his bright steel blade, than he knew how to adopt\nmorally the cold, keen weapon as his guide of action.\n\n\"Well,\" he said, as he quitted the royal apartment, \"I seem now to\nbe mixed up historically with the destinies of the king and of the\nminister; it will be written, that M. d'Artagnan, a younger son of a\nGascon family, placed his hand on the shoulder of M. Nicolas Fouquet,\nthe surintendant of the finances of France. My descendants, if I have\nany, will flatter themselves with the distinction which this arrest\nwill confer, just as the members of the De Luynes family have done with\nregard to the estates of the poor Marechal d'Ancre. But the thing is,\nhow best to execute the king's directions in a proper manner. Any man\nwould know how to say to M. Fouquet, 'Your sword, monsieur.' But it\nis not every one who would be able to take care of M. Fouquet without\nothers knowing anything about it. How am I to manage, then, so that M.\nle surintendant pass from the height of favor to the direst disgrace;\nthat Vaux be turned into a dungeon for him; that after having been\nsteeped to his lips, as it were, in all the perfumes and incense of\nAhasuerus, he is transferred to the gallows of Haman; in other words, of\nEnguerrand de Marigny?\" And at this reflection, D'Artagnan's brow became\nclouded with perplexity. The musketeer had certain scruples on the\nmatter, it must be admitted. To deliver up to death (for not a doubt\nexisted that Louis hated Fouquet mortally) the man who had just shown\nhimself so delightful and charming a host in every way, was a real\ninsult to one's conscience. \"It almost seems,\" said D'Artagnan to\nhimself, \"that if I am not a poor, mean, miserable fellow, I should let\nM. Fouquet know the opinion the king has about him. Yet, if I betray\nmy master's secret, I shall be a false-hearted, treacherous knave, a\ntraitor, too, a crime provided for and punishable by military laws--so\nmuch so, indeed, that twenty times, in former days when wars were rife,\nI have seen many a miserable fellow strung up to a tree for doing, in\nbut a small degree, what my scruples counsel me to undertake upon a\ngreat scale now. No, I think that a man of true readiness of wit ought\nto get out of this difficulty with more skill than that. And now, let\nus admit that I do possess a little readiness of invention; it is not at\nall certain, though, for, after having for forty years absorbed so\nlarge a quantity, I shall be lucky if there were to be a pistole's-worth\nleft.\" D'Artagnan buried his head in his hands, tore at his mustache\nin sheer vexation, and added, \"What can be the reason of M. Fouquet's\ndisgrace? There seem to be three good ones: the first, because M.\nColbert doesn't like him; the second, because he wished to fall in love\nwith Mademoiselle de la Valliere; and lastly, because the king likes M.\nColbert and loves Mademoiselle de la Valliere. Oh! he is lost! But shall\nI put my foot on his neck, I, of all men, when he is falling a prey\nto the intrigues of a pack of women and clerks? For shame! If he\nbe dangerous, I will lay him low enough; if, however, he be\nonly persecuted, I will look on. I have come to such a decisive\ndetermination, that neither king nor living man shall change my mind.\nIf Athos were here, he would do as I have done. Therefore, instead of\ngoing, in cold blood, up to M. Fouquet, and arresting him off-hand and\nshutting him up altogether, I will try and conduct myself like a man who\nunderstands what good manners are. People will talk about it, of course;\nbut they shall talk well of it, I am determined.\" And D'Artagnan,\ndrawing by a gesture peculiar to himself his shoulder-belt over his\nshoulder, went straight off to M. Fouquet, who, after he had taken\nleave of his guests, was preparing to retire for the night and to sleep\ntranquilly after the triumphs of the day. The air was still perfumed,\nor infected, whichever way it may be considered, with the odors of\nthe torches and the fireworks. The wax-lights were dying away in their\nsockets, the flowers fell unfastened from the garlands, the groups of\ndancers and courtiers were separating in the salons. Surrounded by his\nfriends, who complimented him and received his flattering remarks in\nreturn, the surintendant half-closed his wearied eyes. He longed for\nrest and quiet; he sank upon the bed of laurels which had been heaped\nup for him for so many days past; it might almost have been said that he\nseemed bowed beneath the weight of the new debts which he had incurred\nfor the purpose of giving the greatest possible honor to this _fete_.\nFouquet had just retired to his room, still smiling, but more than\nhalf-asleep. He could listen to nothing more, he could hardly keep his\neyes open; his bed seemed to possess a fascinating and irresistible\nattraction for him. The god Morpheus, the presiding deity of the dome\npainted by Lebrun, had extended his influence over the adjoining rooms,\nand showered down his most sleep-inducing poppies upon the master of the\nhouse. Fouquet, almost entirely alone, was being assisted by his _valet\nde chambre_ to undress, when M. d'Artagnan appeared at the entrance of\nthe room. D'Artagnan had never been able to succeed in making himself\ncommon at the court; and notwithstanding he was seen everywhere and\non all occasions, he never failed to produce an effect wherever and\nwhenever he made his appearance. Such is the happy privilege of certain\nnatures, which in that respect resemble either thunder or lightning;\nevery one recognizes them; but their appearance never fails to arouse\nsurprise and astonishment, and whenever they occur, the impression is\nalways left that the last was the most conspicuous or most important.\n\n\"What! M. d'Artagnan?\" said Fouquet, who had already taken his right arm\nout of the sleeve of his doublet.\n\n\"At your service,\" replied the musketeer.\n\n\"Come in, my dear M. d'Artagnan.\"\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\n\"Have you come to criticise the _fete?_ You are ingenious enough in your\ncriticisms, I know.\"\n\n\"By no means.\"\n\n\"Are not your men looked after properly?\"\n\n\"In every way.\"\n\n\"You are not comfortably lodged, perhaps?\"\n\n\"Nothing could be better.\"\n\n\"In that case, I have to thank you for being so amiably disposed, and I\nmust not fail to express my obligations to you for all your flattering\nkindness.\"\n\nThese words were as much as to say, \"My dear D'Artagnan, pray go to bed,\nsince you have a bed to lie down on, and let me do the same.\"\n\nD'Artagnan did not seem to understand it.\n\n\"Are you going to bed already?\" he said to the superintendent.\n\n\"Yes; have you anything to say to me?\"\n\n\"Nothing, monsieur, nothing at all. You sleep in this room, then?\"\n\n\"Yes; as you see.\"\n\n\"You have given a most charming _fete_ to the king.\"\n\n\"Do you think so?\"\n\n\"Oh! beautiful!\"\n\n\"Is the king pleased?\"\n\n\"Enchanted.\"\n\n\"Did he desire you to say as much to me?\"\n\n\"He would not choose so unworthy a messenger, monseigneur.\"\n\n\"You do not do yourself justice, Monsieur d'Artagnan.\"\n\n\"Is that your bed, there?\"\n\n\"Yes; but why do you ask? Are you not satisfied with your own?\"\n\n\"My I speak frankly to you?\"\n\n\"Most assuredly.\"\n\n\"Well, then, I am not.\"\n\nFouquet started; and then replied, \"Will you take my room, Monsieur\nd'Artagnan?\"\n\n\"What! deprive you of it, monseigneur? never!\"\n\n\"What am I to do, then?\"\n\n\"Allow me to share yours with you.\"\n\nFouquet looked at the musketeer fixedly. \"Ah! ah!\" he said, \"you have\njust left the king.\"\n\n\"I have, monseigneur.\"\n\n\"And the king wishes you to pass the night in my room?\"\n\n\"Monseigneur--\"\n\n\"Very well, Monsieur d'Artagnan, very well. You are the master here.\"\n\n\"I assure you, monseigneur, that I do not wish to abuse--\"\n\nFouquet turned to his valet, and said, \"Leave us.\" When the man had\nleft, he said to D'Artagnan, \"You have something to say to me?\"\n\n\"I?\"\n\n\"A man of your superior intelligence cannot have come to talk with a man\nlike myself, at such an hour as the present, without grave motives.\"\n\n\"Do not interrogate me.\"\n\n\"On the contrary. What do you want with me?\"\n\n\"Nothing more than the pleasure of your society.\"\n\n\"Come into the garden, then,\" said the superintendent suddenly, \"or into\nthe park.\"\n\n\"No,\" replied the musketeer, hastily, \"no.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"The fresh air--\"\n\n\"Come, admit at once that you arrest me,\" said the superintendent to the\ncaptain.\n\n\"Never!\" said the latter.\n\n\"You intend to look after me, then?\"\n\n\"Yes, monseigneur, I do, upon my honor.\"\n\n\"Upon your honor--ah! that is quite another thing! So I am to be\narrested in my own house.\"\n\n\"Do not say such a thing.\"\n\n\"On the contrary, I will proclaim it aloud.\"\n\n\"If you do so, I shall be compelled to request you to be silent.\"\n\n\"Very good! Violence towards me, and in my own house, too.\"\n\n\"We do not seem to understand one another at all. Stay a moment; there\nis a chess-board there; we will have a game, if you have no objections.\"\n\n\"Monsieur d'Artagnan, I am in disgrace, then?\"\n\n\"Not at all; but--\"\n\n\"I am prohibited, I suppose, from withdrawing from your sight.\"\n\n\"I do not understand a word you are saying, monseigneur; and if you wish\nme to withdraw, tell me so.\"\n\n\"My dear Monsieur d'Artagnan, your mode of action is enough to drive\nme mad; I was almost sinking for want of sleep, but you have completely\nawakened me.\"\n\n\"I shall never forgive myself, I am sure; and if you wish to reconcile\nme with myself, why, go to sleep in your bed in my presence; and I shall\nbe delighted.\"\n\n\"I am under surveillance, I see.\"\n\n\"I will leave the room if you say any such thing.\"\n\n\"You are beyond my comprehension.\"\n\n\"Good night, monseigneur,\" said D'Artagnan, as he pretended to withdraw.\n\nFouquet ran after him. \"I will not lie down,\" he said. \"Seriously, and\nsince you refuse to treat me as a man, and since you finesse with me, I\nwill try and set you at bay, as a hunter does a wild boar.\"\n\n\"Bah!\" cried D'Artagnan, pretending to smile.\n\n\"I shall order my horses, and set off for Paris,\" said Fouquet, sounding\nthe captain of the musketeers.\n\n\"If that be the case, monseigneur, it is very difficult.\"\n\n\"You will arrest me, then?\"\n\n\"No, but I shall go along with you.\"\n\n\"That is quite sufficient, Monsieur d'Artagnan,\" returned Fouquet,\ncoldly. \"It was not for nothing you acquired your reputation as a man\nof intelligence and resource; but with me all this is quite superfluous.\nLet us come to the point. Do me a service. Why do you arrest me? What\nhave I done?\"\n\n\"Oh! I know nothing about what you may have done; but I do not arrest\nyou--this evening, at least!\"\n\n\"This evening!\" said Fouquet, turning pale, \"but to-morrow?\"\n\n\"It is not to-morrow just yet, monseigneur. Who can ever answer for the\nmorrow?\"\n\n\"Quick, quick, captain! let me speak to M. d'Herblay.\"\n\n\"Alas! that is quite impossible, monseigneur. I have strict orders to\nsee that you hold no communication with any one.\"\n\n\"With M. d'Herblay, captain--with your friend!\"\n\n\"Monseigneur, is M. d'Herblay the only person with whom you ought to be\nprevented holding any communication?\"\n\nFouquet colored, and then assuming an air of resignation, he said: \"You\nare right, monsieur; you have taught me a lesson I ought not to have\nevoked. A fallen man cannot assert his right to anything, even from\nthose whose fortunes he may have made; for a still stronger reason,\nhe cannot claim anything from those to whom he may never have had the\nhappiness of doing a service.\"\n\n\"Monseigneur!\"\n\n\"It is perfectly true, Monsieur d'Artagnan; you have always acted in\nthe most admirable manner towards me--in such a manner, indeed, as most\nbecomes the man who is destined to arrest me. You, at least, have never\nasked me anything.\"\n\n\"Monsieur,\" replied the Gascon, touched by his eloquent and noble tone\nof grief, \"will you--I ask it as a favor--pledge me your word as a man\nof honor that you will not leave this room?\"\n\n\"What is the use of it, dear Monsieur d'Artagnan, since you keep watch\nand ward over me? Do you suppose I should contend against the most\nvaliant sword in the kingdom?\"\n\n\"It is not that, at all, monseigneur; but that I am going to look for M.\nd'Herblay, and, consequently, to leave you alone.\"\n\nFouquet uttered a cry of delight and surprise.\n\n\"To look for M. d'Herblay! to leave me alone!\" he exclaimed, clasping\nhis hands together.\n\n\"Which is M. d'Herblay's room? The blue room is it not?\"\n\n\"Yes, my friend, yes.\"\n\n\"Your friend! thank you for that word, monseigneur; you confer it upon\nme to-day, at least, if you have never done so before.\"\n\n\"Ah! you have saved me.\"\n\n\"It will take a good ten minutes to go from hence to the blue room, and\nto return?\" said D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Nearly so.\"\n\n\"And then to wake Aramis, who sleeps very soundly, when he is asleep,\nI put that down at another five minutes; making a total of fifteen\nminutes' absence. And now, monseigneur, give me your word that you will\nnot in any way attempt to make your escape, and that when I return I\nshall find you here again.\"\n\n\"I give it, monsieur,\" replied Fouquet, with an expression of the\nwarmest and deepest gratitude.\n\nD'Artagnan disappeared. Fouquet looked at him as he quitted the room,\nwaited with a feverish impatience until the door was closed behind him,\nand as soon as it was shut, flew to his keys, opened two or three secret\ndoors concealed in various articles of furniture in the room, looked\nvainly for certain papers, which doubtless he had left at Saint-Mande,\nand which he seemed to regret not having found in them; then hurriedly\nseizing hold of letters, contracts, papers, writings, he heaped them\nup into a pile, which he burnt in the extremest haste upon the marble\nhearth of the fireplace, not even taking time to draw from the interior\nof it the vases and pots of flowers with which it was filled. As soon as\nhe had finished, like a man who has just escaped an imminent danger, and\nwhose strength abandons him as soon as the danger is past, he sank down,\ncompletely overcome, on a couch. When D'Artagnan returned, he found\nFouquet in the same position; the worthy musketeer had not the slightest\ndoubt that Fouquet, having given his word, would not even think of\nfailing to keep it, but he had thought it most likely that Fouquet would\nturn his (D'Artagnan's) absence to the best advantage in getting rid of\nall the papers, memorandums, and contracts, which might possibly render\nhis position, which was even now serious enough, more dangerous than\never. And so, lifting up his head like a dog who has regained the scent,\nhe perceived an odor resembling smoke he had relied on finding in the\natmosphere, and having found it, made a movement of his head in token\nof satisfaction. As D'Artagnan entered, Fouquet, on his side, raised his\nhead, and not one of D'Artagnan's movements escaped him. And then the\nlooks of the two men met, and they both saw that they had understood\neach other without exchanging a syllable.\n\n\"Well!\" asked Fouquet, the first to speak, \"and M. d'Herblay?\"\n\n\"Upon my word, monseigneur,\" replied D'Artagnan, \"M. d'Herblay must\nbe desperately fond of walking out at night, and composing verses\nby moonlight in the park of Vaux, with some of your poets, in all\nprobability, for he is not in his own room.\"\n\n\"What! not in his own room?\" cried Fouquet, whose last hope thus escaped\nhim; for unless he could ascertain in what way the bishop of Vannes\ncould assist him, he perfectly well knew that he could expect assistance\nfrom no other quarter.\n\n\"Or, indeed,\" continued D'Artagnan, \"if he is in his own room, he has\nvery good reasons for not answering.\"\n\n\"But surely you did not call him in such a manner that he could have\nheard you?\"\n\n\"You can hardly suppose, monseigneur, that having already exceeded my\norders, which forbade me leaving you a single moment--you can hardly\nsuppose, I say, that I should have been mad enough to rouse the whole\nhouse and allow myself to be seen in the corridor of the bishop of\nVannes, in order that M. Colbert might state with positive certainty\nthat I gave you time to burn your papers.\"\n\n\"My papers?\"\n\n\"Of course; at least that is what I should have done in your place. When\nany one opens a door for me I always avail myself of it.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, and I thank you, for I have availed myself of it.\"\n\n\"And you have done perfectly right. Every man has his own peculiar\nsecrets with which others have nothing to do. But let us return to\nAramis, monseigneur.\"\n\n\"Well, then, I tell you, you could not have called loud enough, or\nAramis would have heard you.\"\n\n\"However softly any one may call Aramis, monseigneur, Aramis always\nhears when he has an interest in hearing. I repeat what I said\nbefore--Aramis was not in his own room, or Aramis had certain reasons\nfor not recognizing my voice, of which I am ignorant, and of which you\nmay be even ignorant yourself, notwithstanding your liege-man is His\nGreatness the Lord Bishop of Vannes.\"\n\nFouquet drew a deep sigh, rose from his seat, took three or four turns\nin his room, and finished by seating himself, with an expression of\nextreme dejection, upon his magnificent bed with velvet hangings,\nand costliest lace. D'Artagnan looked at Fouquet with feelings of the\ndeepest and sincerest pity.\n\n\"I have seen a good many men arrested in my life,\" said the musketeer,\nsadly; \"I have seen both M. de Cinq-Mars and M. de Chalais arrested,\nthough I was very young then. I have seen M. de Conde arrested with\nthe princes; I have seen M. de Retz arrested; I have seen M. Broussel\narrested. Stay a moment, monseigneur, it is disagreeable to have to say,\nbut the very one of all those whom you most resemble at this moment was\nthat poor fellow Broussel. You were very near doing as he did, putting\nyour dinner napkin in your portfolio, and wiping your mouth with your\npapers. _Mordioux!_ Monseigneur Fouquet, a man like you ought not to be\ndejected in this manner. Suppose your friends saw you?\"\n\n\"Monsieur d'Artagnan,\" returned the surintendant, with a smile full\nof gentleness, \"you do not understand me; it is precisely because my\nfriends are not looking on, that I am as you see me now. I do not live,\nexist even, isolated from others; I am nothing when left to myself.\nUnderstand that throughout my whole life I have passed every moment of\nmy time in making friends, whom I hoped to render my stay and support.\nIn times of prosperity, all these cheerful, happy voices--rendered so\nthrough and by my means--formed in my honor a concert of praise and\nkindly actions. In the least disfavor, these humbler voices accompanied\nin harmonious accents the murmur of my own heart. Isolation I have never\nyet known. Poverty (a phantom I have sometimes beheld, clad in rags,\nawaiting me at the end of my journey through life)--poverty has been the\nspecter with which many of my own friends have trifled for years past,\nwhich they poetize and caress, and which has attracted me towards them.\nPoverty! I accept it, acknowledge it, receive it, as a disinherited\nsister; for poverty is neither solitude, nor exile, nor imprisonment.\nIs it likely I shall ever be poor, with such friends as Pelisson, as\nLa Fontaine, as Moliere? with such a mistress as--Oh! if you knew how\nutterly lonely and desolate I feel at this moment, and how you, who\nseparate me from all I love, seem to resemble the image of solitude, of\nannihilation--death itself.\"\n\n\"But I have already told you, Monsieur Fouquet,\" replied D'Artagnan,\nmoved to the depths of his soul, \"that you are woefully exaggerating.\nThe king likes you.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" said Fouquet, shaking his head.\n\n\"M. Colbert hates you.\"\n\n\"M. Colbert! What does that matter to me?\"\n\n\"He will ruin you.\"\n\n\"Ah! I defy him to do that, for I am ruined already.\"\n\nAt this singular confession of the superintendent, D'Artagnan cast\nhis glance all round the room; and although he did not open his lips,\nFouquet understood him so thoroughly, that he added: \"What can be done\nwith such wealth of substance as surrounds us, when a man can no longer\ncultivate his taste for the magnificent? Do you know what good the\ngreater part of the wealth and the possessions which we rich enjoy,\nconfer upon us? merely to disgust us, by their very splendor even, with\neverything which does not equal it! Vaux! you will say, and the wonders\nof Vaux! What of it? What boot these wonders? If I am ruined, how shall\nI fill with water the urns which my Naiads bear in their arms, or\nforce the air into the lungs of my Tritons? To be rich enough, Monsieur\nd'Artagnan, a man must be too rich.\"\n\nD'Artagnan shook his head.\n\n\"Oh! I know very well what you think,\" replied Fouquet, quickly. \"If\nVaux were yours, you would sell it, and would purchase an estate in the\ncountry; an estate which should have woods, orchards, and land attached,\nso that the estate should be made to support its master. With forty\nmillions you might--\"\n\n\"Ten millions,\" interrupted D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Not a million, my dear captain. No one in France is rich enough to give\ntwo millions for Vaux, and to continue to maintain it as I have done; no\none could do it, no one would know how.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said D'Artagnan, \"in any case, a million is not abject misery.\"\n\n\"It is not far from it, my dear monsieur. But you do not understand me.\nNo; I will not sell my residence at Vaux; I will give it to you, if\nyou like;\" and Fouquet accompanied these words with a movement of the\nshoulders to which it would be impossible to do justice.\n\n\"Give it to the king; you will make a better bargain.\"\n\n\"The king does not require me to give it to him,\" said Fouquet; \"he\nwill take it away from me with the most absolute ease and grace, if it\npleases him to do so; and that is the very reason I should prefer to see\nit perish. Do you know, Monsieur d'Artagnan, that if the king did not\nhappen to be under my roof, I would take this candle, go straight to the\ndome, and set fire to a couple of huge chests of fusees and fireworks\nwhich are in reserve there, and would reduce my palace to ashes.\"\n\n\"Bah!\" said the musketeer, negligently. \"At all events, you would not be\nable to burn the gardens, and that is the finest feature of the place.\"\n\n\"And yet,\" resumed Fouquet, thoughtfully, \"what was I saying? Great\nheavens! burn Vaux! destroy my palace! But Vaux is not mine; these\nwonderful creations are, it is true, the property, as far as sense of\nenjoyment goes, of the man who has paid for them; but as far as duration\nis concerned, they belong to those who created them. Vaux belongs to\nLebrun, to Lenotre, to Pelisson, to Levau, to La Fontaine, to Moliere;\nVaux belongs to posterity, in fact. You see, Monsieur d'Artagnan, that\nmy very house has ceased to be my own.\"\n\n\"That is all well and good,\" said D'Artagnan; \"the idea is agreeable\nenough, and I recognize M. Fouquet himself in it. That idea, indeed,\nmakes me forget that poor fellow Broussel altogether; and I now fail to\nrecognize in you the whining complaints of that old Frondeur. If you are\nruined, monsieur, look at the affair manfully, for you too, _mordioux!_\nbelong to posterity, and have no right to lessen yourself in any way.\nStay a moment; look at me, I who seem to exercise in some degree a\nkind of superiority over you, because I am arresting you; fate, which\ndistributes their different parts to the comedians of this world,\naccorded me a less agreeable and less advantageous part to fill than\nyours has been. I am one of those who think that the parts which kings\nand powerful nobles are called upon to act are infinitely of more worth\nthan the parts of beggars or lackeys. It is far better on the stage--on\nthe stage, I mean, of another theater than the theater of this world--it\nis far better to wear a fine coat and to talk a fine language, than to\nwalk the boards shod with a pair of old shoes, or to get one's backbone\ngently polished by a hearty dressing with a stick. In one word, you have\nbeen a prodigal with money, you have ordered and been obeyed--have been\nsteeped to the lips in enjoyment; while I have dragged my tether after\nme, have been commanded and have obeyed, and have drudged my life\naway. Well, although I may seem of such trifling importance beside you,\nmonseigneur, I do declare to you, that the recollection of what I have\ndone serves me as a spur, and prevents me from bowing my old head too\nsoon. I shall remain unto the very end a trooper; and when my turn\ncomes, I shall fall perfectly straight, all in a heap, still alive,\nafter having selected my place beforehand. Do as I do, Monsieur Fouquet,\nyou will not find yourself the worse for it; a fall happens only once\nin a lifetime to men like yourself, and the chief thing is, to take\nit gracefully when the chance presents itself. There is a Latin\nproverb--the words have escaped me, but I remember the sense of it very\nwell, for I have thought over it more than once--which says, 'The end\ncrowns the work!'\"\n\nFouquet rose from his seat, passed his arm round D'Artagnan's neck, and\nclasped him in a close embrace, whilst with the other hand he pressed\nhis hand. \"An excellent homily,\" he said, after a moment's pause.\n\n\"A soldier's, monseigneur.\"\n\n\"You have a regard for me, in telling me all that.\"\n\n\"Perhaps.\"\n\nFouquet resumed his pensive attitude once more, and then, a moment\nafter, he said: \"Where can M. d'Herblay be? I dare not ask you to send\nfor him.\"\n\n\"You would not ask me, because I would not do it, Monsieur Fouquet.\nPeople would learn it, and Aramis, who is not mixed up with the affair,\nmight possibly be compromised and included in your disgrace.\"\n\n\"I will wait here till daylight,\" said Fouquet.\n\n\"Yes; that is best.\"\n\n\"What shall we do when daylight comes?\"\n\n\"I know nothing at all about it, monseigneur.\"\n\n\"Monsieur d'Artagnan, will you do me a favor?\"\n\n\"Most willingly.\"\n\n\"You guard me, I remain; you are acting in the full discharge of your\nduty, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"Very good, then; remain as close to me as my shadow if you like; and I\ninfinitely prefer such a shadow to any one else.\"\n\nD'Artagnan bowed to the compliment.\n\n\"But, forget that you are Monsieur d'Artagnan, captain of the\nmusketeers; forget that I am Monsieur Fouquet, surintendant of the\nfinances; and let us talk about my affairs.\"\n\n\"That is rather a delicate subject.\"\n\n\"Indeed?\"\n\n\"Yes; but, for your sake, Monsieur Fouquet, I will do what may almost be\nregarded as an impossibility.\"\n\n\"Thank you. What did the king say to you?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\n\"Ah! is that the way you talk?\"\n\n\"The deuce!\"\n\n\"What do you think of my situation?\"\n\n\"I do not know.\"\n\n\"However, unless you have some ill feeling against me--\"\n\n\"Your position is a difficult one.\"\n\n\"In what respect?\"\n\n\"Because you are under your own roof.\"\n\n\"However difficult it may be, I understand it very well.\"\n\n\"Do you suppose that, with any one else but yourself, I should have\nshown so much frankness?\"\n\n\"What! so much frankness, do you say? you, who refuse to tell me the\nslightest thing?\"\n\n\"At all events, then, so much ceremony and consideration.\"\n\n\"Ah! I have nothing to say in that respect.\"\n\n\"One moment, monseigneur: let me tell you how I should have behaved\ntowards any one but yourself. It might be that I happened to arrive at\nyour door just as your guests or your friends had left you--or, if they\nhad not gone yet, I should wait until they were leaving, and should\nthen catch them one after the other, like rabbits; I should lock them up\nquietly enough, I should steal softly along the carpet of your corridor,\nand with one hand upon you, before you suspected the slightest thing\namiss, I should keep you safely until my master's breakfast in the\nmorning. In this way, I should just the same have avoided all publicity,\nall disturbance, all opposition; but there would also have been no\nwarning for M. Fouquet, no consideration for his feelings, none of those\ndelicate concessions which are shown by persons who are essentially\ncourteous in their natures, whenever the decisive moment may arrive. Are\nyou satisfied with the plan?\"\n\n\"It makes me shud\n\n### Summary:\n\n", "answer": "D'Artagnan is uncertain of how to handle the business of arresting Fouquet in a tactful and subtle manner. Fouquet is exhausted when he retires to his bedroom. D'Artagnan shows up at the door. Fouquet asks what he can do for the captain. It's clear Fouquet would like nothing better than to hit the sack, but D'Artagnan continues determinedly to make small talk. Finally, D'Artagnan asks point blank if he can spend the night in Fouquet's room. Fouquet is astonished at first, then understands. He asks D'Artagnan if he has just come from the King. D'Artagnan replies in the affirmative. Fouquet asks if he is forbidden from leaving. D'Artagnan continues trying to be tactful, finally admitting that he will not arrest Fouquet this evening. Fouquet draws the necessary conclusions, and asks if he is to be arrested tomorrow. He asks to speak with Aramis. D'Artagnan tells Fouquet he is forbidden from communicating with others. D'Artagnan asks if Fouquet can be trusted to remain in the room. D'Artagnan tells Fouquet that he will go fetch Aramis; he will be gone from the room for about fifteen minutes. Fouquet assures D'Artagnan that he will not try to escape. D'Artagnan leaves. Fouquet opens up some secret compartments and takes out various papers and throws them into the fire. D'Artagnan returns, and, as expected, determines that Fouquet has made use of his absence to destroy some incriminating papers. The two of them exchange a glance conveying that they understand one another perfectly. D'Artagnan tells Fouquet that Aramis is nowhere to be found. Fouquet talks his home, pointing out that no one in all of France has enough money to buy or even maintain the splendors of Vaux. Fouquet asks that the two of them forget their positions in the King's court and talk freely. Eventually D'Artagnan tells Fouquet that he has done all he can to prepare Fouquet for tomorrow. He tells Fouquet to get some sleep. D'Artagnan himself will sleep in an armchair by the door. He tells Fouquet that he sleeps very deeply, but that if someone places a hand on the door handle, he will wake up right away. Fouquet tells D'Artagnan that he is a wonderful man, and he is sorry to make his acquaintance so late. The two of them spend the night peacefully."}
{"original_length": 9491, "trunc_length": 8192, "text": "\n\nSummarize the following text into a summary of less than 800 words.\n### Text:\n\nWHEN Phoebe awoke,--which she did with the early twittering of the\nconjugal couple of robins in the pear-tree,--she heard movements below\nstairs, and, hastening down, found Hepzibah already in the kitchen.\nShe stood by a window, holding a book in close contiguity to her nose,\n    as if with the hope of gaining an olfactory acquaintance with its\n    contents, since her imperfect vision made it not very easy to read\n    them.  If any volume could have manifested its essential wisdom in the\n    mode suggested, it would certainly have been the one now in Hepzibah's\n    hand; and the kitchen, in such an event, would forthwith have streamed\n    with the fragrance of venison, turkeys, capons, larded partridges,\n    puddings, cakes, and Christmas pies, in all manner of elaborate mixture\n    and concoction.  It was a cookery book, full of innumerable old\n    fashions of English dishes, and illustrated with engravings, which\n    represented the arrangements of the table at such banquets as it might\n    have befitted a nobleman to give in the great hall of his castle.  And,\n    amid these rich and potent devices of the culinary art (not one of\n            which, probably, had been tested, within the memory of any man's\n            grandfather), poor Hepzibah was seeking for some nimble little titbit,\n    which, with what skill she had, and such materials as were at hand, she\n    might toss up for breakfast.\n\n    Soon, with a deep sigh, she put aside the savory volume, and inquired\n    of Phoebe whether old Speckle, as she called one of the hens, had laid\n    an egg the preceding day.  Phoebe ran to see, but returned without the\n    expected treasure in her hand.  At that instant, however, the blast of\n    a fish-dealer's conch was heard, announcing his approach along the\n    street.  With energetic raps at the shop-window, Hepzibah summoned the\n    man in, and made purchase of what he warranted as the finest mackerel\n    in his cart, and as fat a one as ever he felt with his finger so early\n    in the season.  Requesting Phoebe to roast some coffee,--which she\n    casually observed was the real Mocha, and so long kept that each of the\n    small berries ought to be worth its weight in gold,--the maiden lady\n    heaped fuel into the vast receptacle of the ancient fireplace in such\n    quantity as soon to drive the lingering dusk out of the kitchen.  The\n    country-girl, willing to give her utmost assistance, proposed to make\n    an Indian cake, after her mother's peculiar method, of easy\n    manufacture, and which she could vouch for as possessing a richness,\n    and, if rightly prepared, a delicacy, unequalled by any other mode of\n    breakfast-cake.  Hepzibah gladly assenting, the kitchen was soon the\n    scene of savory preparation.  Perchance, amid their proper element of\n    smoke, which eddied forth from the ill-constructed chimney, the ghosts\n    of departed cook-maids looked wonderingly on, or peeped down the great\n    breadth of the flue, despising the simplicity of the projected meal,\n    yet ineffectually pining to thrust their shadowy hands into each\n    inchoate dish.  The half-starved rats, at any rate, stole visibly out\n    of their hiding-places, and sat on their hind-legs, snuffing the fumy\n    atmosphere, and wistfully awaiting an opportunity to nibble.\n\n    Hepzibah had no natural turn for cookery, and, to say the truth, had\n    fairly incurred her present meagreness by often choosing to go without\n    her dinner rather than be attendant on the rotation of the spit, or\n    ebullition of the pot.  Her zeal over the fire, therefore, was quite an\n    heroic test of sentiment.  It was touching, and positively worthy of\n    tears (if Phoebe, the only spectator, except the rats and ghosts\n            aforesaid, had not been better employed than in shedding them), to see\n    her rake out a bed of fresh and glowing coals, and proceed to broil the\n    mackerel.  Her usually pale cheeks were all ablaze with heat and hurry.\n    She watched the fish with as much tender care and minuteness of\n    attention as if,--we know not how to express it otherwise,--as if her\n    own heart were on the gridiron, and her immortal happiness were\n    involved in its being done precisely to a turn!\n\n    Life, within doors, has few pleasanter prospects than a neatly arranged\n    and well-provisioned breakfast-table.  We come to it freshly, in the\n    dewy youth of the day, and when our spiritual and sensual elements are\n    in better accord than at a later period; so that the material delights\n    of the morning meal are capable of being fully enjoyed, without any\n    very grievous reproaches, whether gastric or conscientious, for\n    yielding even a trifle overmuch to the animal department of our nature.\n    The thoughts, too, that run around the ring of familiar guests have a\n    piquancy and mirthfulness, and oftentimes a vivid truth, which more\n    rarely find their way into the elaborate intercourse of dinner.\n    Hepzibah's small and ancient table, supported on its slender and\n    graceful legs, and covered with a cloth of the richest damask, looked\n    worthy to be the scene and centre of one of the cheerfullest of\n    parties.  The vapor of the broiled fish arose like incense from the\n    shrine of a barbarian idol, while the fragrance of the Mocha might have\n    gratified the nostrils of a tutelary Lar, or whatever power has scope\n    over a modern breakfast-table.  Phoebe's Indian cakes were the sweetest\n    offering of all,--in their hue befitting the rustic altars of the\n    innocent and golden age,--or, so brightly yellow were they, resembling\n    some of the bread which was changed to glistening gold when Midas tried\n    to eat it.  The butter must not be forgotten,--butter which Phoebe\n    herself had churned, in her own rural home, and brought it to her\n    cousin as a propitiatory gift,--smelling of clover-blossoms, and\n    diffusing the charm of pastoral scenery through the dark-panelled\n    parlor.  All this, with the quaint gorgeousness of the old china cups\n    and saucers, and the crested spoons, and a silver cream-jug (Hepzibah's\n            only other article of plate, and shaped like the rudest porringer), set\n    out a board at which the stateliest of old Colonel Pyncheon's guests\n    need not have scorned to take his place.  But the Puritan's face\n    scowled down out of the picture, as if nothing on the table pleased his\n    appetite.\n\n    By way of contributing what grace she could, Phoebe gathered some roses\n    and a few other flowers, possessing either scent or beauty, and\n    arranged them in a glass pitcher, which, having long ago lost its\n    handle, was so much the fitter for a flower-vase.  The early\n    sunshine--as fresh as that which peeped into Eve's bower while she and\n    Adam sat at breakfast there--came twinkling through the branches of the\n    pear-tree, and fell quite across the table.  All was now ready.  There\n    were chairs and plates for three.  A chair and plate for Hepzibah,--the\n    same for Phoebe,--but what other guest did her cousin look for?\n\n    Throughout this preparation there had been a constant tremor in\n    Hepzibah's frame; an agitation so powerful that Phoebe could see the\n    quivering of her gaunt shadow, as thrown by the firelight on the\n    kitchen wall, or by the sunshine on the parlor floor.  Its\n    manifestations were so various, and agreed so little with one another,\n    that the girl knew not what to make of it.  Sometimes it seemed an\n    ecstasy of delight and happiness.  At such moments, Hepzibah would\n    fling out her arms, and infold Phoebe in them, and kiss her cheek as\n    tenderly as ever her mother had; she appeared to do so by an inevitable\n    impulse, and as if her bosom were oppressed with tenderness, of which\n    she must needs pour out a little, in order to gain breathing-room.  The\n    next moment, without any visible cause for the change, her unwonted joy\n    shrank back, appalled, as it were, and clothed itself in mourning; or\n    it ran and hid itself, so to speak, in the dungeon of her heart, where\n    it had long lain chained, while a cold, spectral sorrow took the place\n    of the imprisoned joy, that was afraid to be enfranchised,--a sorrow as\n    black as that was bright.  She often broke into a little, nervous,\n    hysteric laugh, more touching than any tears could be; and forthwith,\n    as if to try which was the most touching, a gush of tears would follow;\nor perhaps the laughter and tears came both at once, and surrounded our\npoor Hepzibah, in a moral sense, with a kind of pale, dim rainbow.\nTowards Phoebe, as we have said, she was affectionate,--far tenderer\nthan ever before, in their brief acquaintance, except for that one kiss\non the preceding night,--yet with a continually recurring pettishness\nand irritability.  She would speak sharply to her; then, throwing aside\nall the starched reserve of her ordinary manner, ask pardon, and the\nnext instant renew the just-forgiven injury.\n\nAt last, when their mutual labor was all finished, she took Phoebe's\nhand in her own trembling one.\n\n\"Bear with me, my dear child,\" she cried; \"for truly my heart is full\nto the brim! Bear with me; for I love you, Phoebe, though I speak so\nroughly.  Think nothing of it, dearest child! By and by, I shall be\nkind, and only kind!\"\n\n\"My dearest cousin, cannot you tell me what has happened?\" asked\nPhoebe, with a sunny and tearful sympathy.  \"What is it that moves you\nso?\"\n\n\"Hush! hush! He is coming!\" whispered Hepzibah, hastily wiping her\neyes. \"Let him see you first, Phoebe; for you are young and rosy, and\ncannot help letting a smile break out whether or no.  He always liked\nbright faces! And mine is old now, and the tears are hardly dry on it.\nHe never could abide tears.  There; draw the curtain a little, so that\nthe shadow may fall across his side of the table! But let there be a\ngood deal of sunshine, too; for he never was fond of gloom, as some\npeople are.  He has had but little sunshine in his life,--poor\nClifford,--and, oh, what a black shadow.  Poor, poor Clifford!\"\n\nThus murmuring in an undertone, as if speaking rather to her own heart\nthan to Phoebe, the old gentlewoman stepped on tiptoe about the room,\n     making such arrangements as suggested themselves at the crisis.\n\n     Meanwhile there was a step in the passage-way, above stairs.  Phoebe\n     recognized it as the same which had passed upward, as through her\n     dream, in the night-time.  The approaching guest, whoever it might be,\n     appeared to pause at the head of the staircase; he paused twice or\n     thrice in the descent; he paused again at the foot.  Each time, the\n     delay seemed to be without purpose, but rather from a forgetfulness of\n     the purpose which had set him in motion, or as if the person's feet\n     came involuntarily to a stand-still because the motive-power was too\n     feeble to sustain his progress.  Finally, he made a long pause at the\n     threshold of the parlor.  He took hold of the knob of the door; then\n     loosened his grasp without opening it.  Hepzibah, her hands\n     convulsively clasped, stood gazing at the entrance.\n\n     \"Dear Cousin Hepzibah, pray don't look so!\" said Phoebe, trembling; for\n     her cousin's emotion, and this mysteriously reluctant step, made her\n     feel as if a ghost were coming into the room.  \"You really frighten me!\n     Is something awful going to happen?\"\n\n     \"Hush!\" whispered Hepzibah.  \"Be cheerful! whatever may happen, be\n     nothing but cheerful!\"\n\n     The final pause at the threshold proved so long, that Hepzibah, unable\n     to endure the suspense, rushed forward, threw open the door, and led in\n     the stranger by the hand.  At the first glance, Phoebe saw an elderly\n     personage, in an old-fashioned dressing-gown of faded damask, and\n     wearing his gray or almost white hair of an unusual length.  It quite\n     overshadowed his forehead, except when he thrust it back, and stared\n     vaguely about the room.  After a very brief inspection of his face, it\n     was easy to conceive that his footstep must necessarily be such an one\n     as that which, slowly and with as indefinite an aim as a child's first\n     journey across a floor, had just brought him hitherward.  Yet there\n     were no tokens that his physical strength might not have sufficed for a\n     free and determined gait.  It was the spirit of the man that could not\n     walk.  The expression of his countenance--while, notwithstanding it had\n     the light of reason in it--seemed to waver, and glimmer, and nearly to\n     die away, and feebly to recover itself again.  It was like a flame\n     which we see twinkling among half-extinguished embers; we gaze at it\n     more intently than if it were a positive blaze, gushing vividly\n     upward,--more intently, but with a certain impatience, as if it ought\n     either to kindle itself into satisfactory splendor, or be at once\n     extinguished.\n\n     For an instant after entering the room, the guest stood still,\n     retaining Hepzibah's hand instinctively, as a child does that of the\n     grown person who guides it.  He saw Phoebe, however, and caught an\n     illumination from her youthful and pleasant aspect, which, indeed,\n     threw a cheerfulness about the parlor, like the circle of reflected\n     brilliancy around the glass vase of flowers that was standing in the\n     sunshine.  He made a salutation, or, to speak nearer the truth, an\n     ill-defined, abortive attempt at curtsy.  Imperfect as it was, however,\n     it conveyed an idea, or, at least, gave a hint, of indescribable grace,\n     such as no practised art of external manners could have attained.  It\n     was too slight to seize upon at the instant; yet, as recollected\n     afterwards, seemed to transfigure the whole man.\n\n     \"Dear Clifford,\" said Hepzibah, in the tone with which one soothes a\n     wayward infant, \"this is our cousin Phoebe,--little Phoebe\n     Pyncheon,--Arthur's only child, you know.  She has come from the\n     country to stay with us awhile; for our old house has grown to be very\n     lonely now.\"\n\n     \"Phoebe--Phoebe Pyncheon?--Phoebe?\" repeated the guest, with a strange,\n     sluggish, ill-defined utterance.  \"Arthur's child! Ah, I forget! No\n     matter.  She is very welcome!\"\n\n     \"Come, dear Clifford, take this chair,\" said Hepzibah, leading him to\n     his place.  \"Pray, Phoebe, lower the curtain a very little more.  Now\n     let us begin breakfast.\"\n\n     The guest seated himself in the place assigned him, and looked\n     strangely around.  He was evidently trying to grapple with the present\n     scene, and bring it home to his mind with a more satisfactory\n     distinctness.  He desired to be certain, at least, that he was here, in\n     the low-studded, cross-beamed, oaken-panelled parlor, and not in some\n     other spot, which had stereotyped itself into his senses.  But the\n     effort was too great to be sustained with more than a fragmentary\n     success.  Continually, as we may express it, he faded away out of his\n     place; or, in other words, his mind and consciousness took their\n     departure, leaving his wasted, gray, and melancholy figure--a\n     substantial emptiness, a material ghost--to occupy his seat at table.\n     Again, after a blank moment, there would be a flickering taper-gleam in\n     his eyeballs.  It betokened that his spiritual part had returned, and\n     was doing its best to kindle the heart's household fire, and light up\n     intellectual lamps in the dark and ruinous mansion, where it was doomed\n     to be a forlorn inhabitant.\n\n     At one of these moments of less torpid, yet still imperfect animation,\n     Phoebe became convinced of what she had at first rejected as too\n     extravagant and startling an idea.  She saw that the person before her\n     must have been the original of the beautiful miniature in her cousin\n     Hepzibah's possession.  Indeed, with a feminine eye for costume, she\n     had at once identified the damask dressing-gown, which enveloped him,\n     as the same in figure, material, and fashion, with that so elaborately\n     represented in the picture.  This old, faded garment, with all its\n     pristine brilliancy extinct, seemed, in some indescribable way, to\n     translate the wearer's untold misfortune, and make it perceptible to\n     the beholder's eye.  It was the better to be discerned, by this\n     exterior type, how worn and old were the soul's more immediate\n     garments; that form and countenance, the beauty and grace of which had\n     almost transcended the skill of the most exquisite of artists.  It\n     could the more adequately be known that the soul of the man must have\n     suffered some miserable wrong, from its earthly experience.  There he\n     seemed to sit, with a dim veil of decay and ruin betwixt him and the\n     world, but through which, at flitting intervals, might be caught the\n     same expression, so refined, so softly imaginative, which\n     Malbone--venturing a happy touch, with suspended breath--had imparted\n     to the miniature! There had been something so innately characteristic\n     in this look, that all the dusky years, and the burden of unfit\n     calamity which had fallen upon him, did not suffice utterly to destroy\n     it.\n\n     Hepzibah had now poured out a cup of deliciously fragrant coffee, and\n     presented it to her guest.  As his eyes met hers, he seemed bewildered\n     and disquieted.\n\n     \"Is this you, Hepzibah?\" he murmured sadly; then, more apart, and\n     perhaps unconscious that he was overheard, \"How changed!  how changed!\n     And is she angry with me? Why does she bend her brow so?\"\n\n     Poor Hepzibah! It was that wretched scowl which time and her\n     near-sightedness, and the fret of inward discomfort, had rendered so\n     habitual that any vehemence of mood invariably evoked it.  But at the\n     indistinct murmur of his words her whole face grew tender, and even\n     lovely, with sorrowful affection; the harshness of her features\n     disappeared, as it were, behind the warm and misty glow.\n\n     \"Angry!\" she repeated; \"angry with you, Clifford!\"\n\n     Her tone, as she uttered the exclamation, had a plaintive and really\n     exquisite melody thrilling through it, yet without subduing a certain\n     something which an obtuse auditor might still have mistaken for\n     asperity. It was as if some transcendent musician should draw a\n     soul-thrilling sweetness out of a cracked instrument, which makes its\n     physical imperfection heard in the midst of ethereal harmony,--so deep\n     was the sensibility that found an organ in Hepzibah's voice!\n\n     \"There is nothing but love here, Clifford,\" she added,--\"nothing but\n     love! You are at home!\"\n\n     The guest responded to her tone by a smile, which did not half light up\n     his face.  Feeble as it was, however, and gone in a moment, it had a\n     charm of wonderful beauty.  It was followed by a coarser expression; or\n     one that had the effect of coarseness on the fine mould and outline of\n     his countenance, because there was nothing intellectual to temper it.\n     It was a look of appetite.  He ate food with what might almost be\n     termed voracity; and seemed to forget himself, Hepzibah, the young\n     girl, and everything else around him, in the sensual enjoyment which\n     the bountifully spread table afforded.  In his natural system, though\n     high-wrought and delicately refined, a sensibility to the delights of\n     the palate was probably inherent.  It would have been kept in check,\n     however, and even converted into an accomplishment, and one of the\n     thousand modes of intellectual culture, had his more ethereal\n     characteristics retained their vigor.  But as it existed now, the\n     effect was painful and made Phoebe droop her eyes.\n\n     In a little while the guest became sensible of the fragrance of the yet\n     untasted coffee.  He quaffed it eagerly.  The subtle essence acted on\n     him like a charmed draught, and caused the opaque substance of his\n     animal being to grow transparent, or, at least, translucent; so that a\n     spiritual gleam was transmitted through it, with a clearer lustre than\n     hitherto.\n\n     \"More, more!\" he cried, with nervous haste in his utterance, as if\n     anxious to retain his grasp of what sought to escape him.  \"This is\n     what I need! Give me more!\"\n\n     Under this delicate and powerful influence he sat more erect, and\n     looked out from his eyes with a glance that took note of what it rested\n     on.  It was not so much that his expression grew more intellectual;\n     this, though it had its share, was not the most peculiar effect.\n     Neither was what we call the moral nature so forcibly awakened as to\n     present itself in remarkable prominence.  But a certain fine temper of\n     being was now not brought out in full relief, but changeably and\n     imperfectly betrayed, of which it was the function to deal with all\n     beautiful and enjoyable things.  In a character where it should exist\n     as the chief attribute, it would bestow on its possessor an exquisite\n     taste, and an enviable susceptibility of happiness.  Beauty would be\n     his life; his aspirations would all tend toward it; and, allowing his\n     frame and physical organs to be in consonance, his own developments\n     would likewise be beautiful.  Such a man should have nothing to do with\n     sorrow; nothing with strife; nothing with the martyrdom which, in an\n     infinite variety of shapes, awaits those who have the heart, and will,\n     and conscience, to fight a battle with the world.  To these heroic\n     tempers, such martyrdom is the richest meed in the world's gift.  To\n     the individual before us, it could only be a grief, intense in due\n     proportion with the severity of the infliction.  He had no right to be\n     a martyr; and, beholding him so fit to be happy and so feeble for all\n     other purposes, a generous, strong, and noble spirit would, methinks,\n     have been ready to sacrifice what little enjoyment it might have\n     planned for itself,--it would have flung down the hopes, so paltry in\n     its regard,--if thereby the wintry blasts of our rude sphere might come\n     tempered to such a man.\n\n     Not to speak it harshly or scornfully, it seemed Clifford's nature to\n     be a Sybarite.  It was perceptible, even there, in the dark old parlor,\n     in the inevitable polarity with which his eyes were attracted towards\n     the quivering play of sunbeams through the shadowy foliage.  It was\n     seen in his appreciating notice of the vase of flowers, the scent of\n     which he inhaled with a zest almost peculiar to a physical organization\n     so refined that spiritual ingredients are moulded in with it.  It was\n     betrayed in the unconscious smile with which he regarded Phoebe, whose\n     fresh and maidenly figure was both sunshine and flowers,--their\n     essence, in a prettier and more agreeable mode of manifestation.  Not\n     less evident was this love and necessity for the Beautiful, in the\n     instinctive caution with which, even so soon, his eyes turned away from\n     his hostess, and wandered to any quarter rather than come back.  It was\n     Hepzibah's misfortune,--not Clifford's fault.  How could he,--so yellow\n     as she was, so wrinkled, so sad of mien, with that odd uncouthness of a\n     turban on her head, and that most perverse of scowls contorting her\n     brow,--how could he love to gaze at her? But, did he owe her no\n     affection for so much as she had silently given? He owed her nothing.\n     A nature like Clifford's can contract no debts of that kind.  It is--we\n     say it without censure, nor in diminution of the claim which it\n     indefeasibly possesses on beings of another mould--it is always selfish\n     in its essence; and we must give it leave to be so, and heap up our\n     heroic and disinterested love upon it so much the more, without a\n     recompense.  Poor Hepzibah knew this truth, or, at least, acted on the\n     instinct of it.  So long estranged from what was lovely as Clifford had\n     been, she rejoiced--rejoiced, though with a present sigh, and a secret\n     purpose to shed tears in her own chamber that he had brighter objects\n     now before his eyes than her aged and uncomely features.  They never\n     possessed a charm; and if they had, the canker of her grief for him\n     would long since have destroyed it.\n\n     The guest leaned back in his chair.  Mingled in his countenance with a\n     dreamy delight, there was a troubled look of effort and unrest.  He was\n     seeking to make himself more fully sensible of the scene around him;\n     or, perhaps, dreading it to be a dream, or a play of imagination, was\n     vexing the fair moment with a struggle for some added brilliancy and\n     more durable illusion.\n\n     \"How pleasant!--How delightful!\" he murmured, but not as if addressing\n     any one.  \"Will it last? How balmy the atmosphere through that open\n     window! An open window! How beautiful that play of sunshine! Those\n     flowers, how very fragrant! That young girl's face, how cheerful, how\n     blooming!--a flower with the dew on it, and sunbeams in the dew-drops!\n     Ah! this must be all a dream!  A dream! A dream! But it has quite\n     hidden the four stone walls!\"\n\n     Then his face darkened, as if the shadow of a cavern or a dungeon had\n     come over it; there was no more light in its expression than might have\n     come through the iron grates of a prison-window--still lessening, too,\n     as if he were sinking farther into the depths.  Phoebe (being of that\n             quickness and activity of temperament that she seldom long refrained\n             from taking a part, and generally a good one, in what was going\n             forward) now felt herself moved to address the stranger.\n\n     \"Here is a new kind of rose, which I found this morning in the garden,\"\n     said she, choosing a small crimson one from among the flowers in the\n     vase.  \"There will be but five or six on the bush this season.  This is\n     the most perfect of them all; not a speck of blight or mildew in it.\n     And how sweet it is!--sweet like no other rose! One can never forget\n     that scent!\"\n\n     \"Ah!--let me see!--let me hold it!\" cried the guest, eagerly seizing\n     the flower, which, by the spell peculiar to remembered odors, brought\n     innumerable associations along with the fragrance that it exhaled.\n     \"Thank you! This has done me good.  I remember how I used to prize this\n     flower,--long ago, I suppose, very long ago!--or was it only yesterday?\n     It makes me feel young again!  Am I young? Either this remembrance is\n     singularly distinct, or this consciousness strangely dim! But how kind\n     of the fair young girl! Thank you! Thank you!\"\n\n     The favorable excitement derived from this little crimson rose afforded\n     Clifford the brightest moment which he enjoyed at the breakfast-table.\n     It might have lasted longer, but that his eyes happened, soon\n     afterwards, to rest on the face of the old Puritan, who, out of his\n     dingy frame and lustreless canvas, was looking down on the scene like a\n     ghost, and a most ill-tempered and ungenial one.  The guest made an\n     impatient gesture of the hand, and addressed Hepzibah with what might\n     easily be recognized as the licensed irritability of a petted member of\n     the family.\n\n     \"Hepzibah!--Hepzibah!\" cried he with no little force and distinctness,\n     \"why do you keep that odious picture on the wall?  Yes, yes!--that is\n     precisely your taste! I have told you, a thousand times, that it was\n     the evil genius of the house!--my evil genius particularly! Take it\n     down, at once!\"\n\n     \"Dear Clifford,\" said Hepzibah sadly, \"you know it cannot be!\"\n\n     \"Then, at all events,\" continued he, still speaking with some energy,\n     \"pray cover it with a crimson curtain, broad enough to hang in folds,\n     and with a golden border and tassels.  I cannot bear it! It must not\n     stare me in the face!\"\n\n     \"Yes, dear Clifford, the picture shall be covered,\" said Hepzibah\n     soothingly.  \"There is a crimson curtain in a trunk above stairs,--a\n     little faded and moth-eaten, I'm afraid,--but Phoebe and I will do\n     wonders with it.\"\n\n     \"This very day, remember\" said he; and then added, in a low,\n     self-communing voice, \"Why should we live in this dismal house at all?\n     Why not go to the South of France?--to Italy?--Paris, Naples, Venice,\n     Rome? Hepzibah will say we have not the means.  A droll idea that!\"\n\n     He smiled to himself, and threw a glance of fine sarcastic meaning\n     towards Hepzibah.\n\n     But the several moods of feeling, faintly as they were marked, through\n     which he had passed, occurring in so brief an interval of time, had\n     evidently wearied the stranger.  He was probably accustomed to a sad\n     monotony of life, not so much flowing in a stream, however sluggish, as\n     stagnating in a pool around his feet.  A slumberous veil diffused\n     itself over his countenance, and had an effect, morally speaking, on\n     its naturally delicate and elegant outline, like that which a brooding\n     mist, with no sunshine in it, throws over the features of a landscape.\n     He appeared to become grosser,--almost cloddish.  If aught of interest\n     or beauty--even ruined beauty--had heretofore been visible in this man,\n     the beholder might now begin to doubt it, and to accuse his own\n     imagination of deluding him with whatever grace had flickered over that\n     visage, and whatever exquisite lustre had gleamed in those filmy eyes.\n\n     Before he had\n\n### Summary:\n\n", "answer": "The Guest: Phoebe awoke and found Hepzibah already in the kitchen, preparing breakfast. She and Phoebe prepare food, despite Hepzibah's lack of a natural inclination for cookery. While they prepare food, there is a constant tremor in Hepzibah's frame, a powerful agitation that seemed an ecstasy of delight, but Hepzibah also shrank into sorrow at times. Hepzibah tells Phoebe that Clifford is coming, and that he will need the great joy that Phoebe can provide. That night, Clifford arrives at the house. He approaches it with the gait of a man who can barely walk. Hepzibah leads him into the house by the hand, and when Clifford sees Phoebe he becomes more cheerful. Phoebe realizes that this must be the person in Hepzibah's miniature. Clifford notices Hepzibah's furrowed brow and wonders whether she is angry at him, but when he hears her voice he realizes that she has nothing but love for him. To Hepzibah Clifford seemed to be by his nature a Sybarite. He had a love and a need for the beautiful, and having been jailed for so long, he rejoiced at any opportunity for beauty, such as visage of Phoebe. Clifford panics upon seeing the portrait of Colonel Pyncheon, and begs Hepzibah to cover it. He suggests to Hepzibah that they not live in the dismal house, but go to Europe. When Clifford learns that Hepzibah has opened a shop, he bursts into tears. He finally falls asleep in his chair. While he sleeps, Hepzibah peruses his face, but soon feels guilty for doing so."}
{"original_length": 9491, "trunc_length": 8192, "text": "\n\nSummarize the following text into a summary of less than 800 words.\n### Text:\n\nWHEN Phoebe awoke,--which she did with the early twittering of the\nconjugal couple of robins in the pear-tree,--she heard movements below\nstairs, and, hastening down, found Hepzibah already in the kitchen.\nShe stood by a window, holding a book in close contiguity to her nose,\n    as if with the hope of gaining an olfactory acquaintance with its\n    contents, since her imperfect vision made it not very easy to read\n    them.  If any volume could have manifested its essential wisdom in the\n    mode suggested, it would certainly have been the one now in Hepzibah's\n    hand; and the kitchen, in such an event, would forthwith have streamed\n    with the fragrance of venison, turkeys, capons, larded partridges,\n    puddings, cakes, and Christmas pies, in all manner of elaborate mixture\n    and concoction.  It was a cookery book, full of innumerable old\n    fashions of English dishes, and illustrated with engravings, which\n    represented the arrangements of the table at such banquets as it might\n    have befitted a nobleman to give in the great hall of his castle.  And,\n    amid these rich and potent devices of the culinary art (not one of\n            which, probably, had been tested, within the memory of any man's\n            grandfather), poor Hepzibah was seeking for some nimble little titbit,\n    which, with what skill she had, and such materials as were at hand, she\n    might toss up for breakfast.\n\n    Soon, with a deep sigh, she put aside the savory volume, and inquired\n    of Phoebe whether old Speckle, as she called one of the hens, had laid\n    an egg the preceding day.  Phoebe ran to see, but returned without the\n    expected treasure in her hand.  At that instant, however, the blast of\n    a fish-dealer's conch was heard, announcing his approach along the\n    street.  With energetic raps at the shop-window, Hepzibah summoned the\n    man in, and made purchase of what he warranted as the finest mackerel\n    in his cart, and as fat a one as ever he felt with his finger so early\n    in the season.  Requesting Phoebe to roast some coffee,--which she\n    casually observed was the real Mocha, and so long kept that each of the\n    small berries ought to be worth its weight in gold,--the maiden lady\n    heaped fuel into the vast receptacle of the ancient fireplace in such\n    quantity as soon to drive the lingering dusk out of the kitchen.  The\n    country-girl, willing to give her utmost assistance, proposed to make\n    an Indian cake, after her mother's peculiar method, of easy\n    manufacture, and which she could vouch for as possessing a richness,\n    and, if rightly prepared, a delicacy, unequalled by any other mode of\n    breakfast-cake.  Hepzibah gladly assenting, the kitchen was soon the\n    scene of savory preparation.  Perchance, amid their proper element of\n    smoke, which eddied forth from the ill-constructed chimney, the ghosts\n    of departed cook-maids looked wonderingly on, or peeped down the great\n    breadth of the flue, despising the simplicity of the projected meal,\n    yet ineffectually pining to thrust their shadowy hands into each\n    inchoate dish.  The half-starved rats, at any rate, stole visibly out\n    of their hiding-places, and sat on their hind-legs, snuffing the fumy\n    atmosphere, and wistfully awaiting an opportunity to nibble.\n\n    Hepzibah had no natural turn for cookery, and, to say the truth, had\n    fairly incurred her present meagreness by often choosing to go without\n    her dinner rather than be attendant on the rotation of the spit, or\n    ebullition of the pot.  Her zeal over the fire, therefore, was quite an\n    heroic test of sentiment.  It was touching, and positively worthy of\n    tears (if Phoebe, the only spectator, except the rats and ghosts\n            aforesaid, had not been better employed than in shedding them), to see\n    her rake out a bed of fresh and glowing coals, and proceed to broil the\n    mackerel.  Her usually pale cheeks were all ablaze with heat and hurry.\n    She watched the fish with as much tender care and minuteness of\n    attention as if,--we know not how to express it otherwise,--as if her\n    own heart were on the gridiron, and her immortal happiness were\n    involved in its being done precisely to a turn!\n\n    Life, within doors, has few pleasanter prospects than a neatly arranged\n    and well-provisioned breakfast-table.  We come to it freshly, in the\n    dewy youth of the day, and when our spiritual and sensual elements are\n    in better accord than at a later period; so that the material delights\n    of the morning meal are capable of being fully enjoyed, without any\n    very grievous reproaches, whether gastric or conscientious, for\n    yielding even a trifle overmuch to the animal department of our nature.\n    The thoughts, too, that run around the ring of familiar guests have a\n    piquancy and mirthfulness, and oftentimes a vivid truth, which more\n    rarely find their way into the elaborate intercourse of dinner.\n    Hepzibah's small and ancient table, supported on its slender and\n    graceful legs, and covered with a cloth of the richest damask, looked\n    worthy to be the scene and centre of one of the cheerfullest of\n    parties.  The vapor of the broiled fish arose like incense from the\n    shrine of a barbarian idol, while the fragrance of the Mocha might have\n    gratified the nostrils of a tutelary Lar, or whatever power has scope\n    over a modern breakfast-table.  Phoebe's Indian cakes were the sweetest\n    offering of all,--in their hue befitting the rustic altars of the\n    innocent and golden age,--or, so brightly yellow were they, resembling\n    some of the bread which was changed to glistening gold when Midas tried\n    to eat it.  The butter must not be forgotten,--butter which Phoebe\n    herself had churned, in her own rural home, and brought it to her\n    cousin as a propitiatory gift,--smelling of clover-blossoms, and\n    diffusing the charm of pastoral scenery through the dark-panelled\n    parlor.  All this, with the quaint gorgeousness of the old china cups\n    and saucers, and the crested spoons, and a silver cream-jug (Hepzibah's\n            only other article of plate, and shaped like the rudest porringer), set\n    out a board at which the stateliest of old Colonel Pyncheon's guests\n    need not have scorned to take his place.  But the Puritan's face\n    scowled down out of the picture, as if nothing on the table pleased his\n    appetite.\n\n    By way of contributing what grace she could, Phoebe gathered some roses\n    and a few other flowers, possessing either scent or beauty, and\n    arranged them in a glass pitcher, which, having long ago lost its\n    handle, was so much the fitter for a flower-vase.  The early\n    sunshine--as fresh as that which peeped into Eve's bower while she and\n    Adam sat at breakfast there--came twinkling through the branches of the\n    pear-tree, and fell quite across the table.  All was now ready.  There\n    were chairs and plates for three.  A chair and plate for Hepzibah,--the\n    same for Phoebe,--but what other guest did her cousin look for?\n\n    Throughout this preparation there had been a constant tremor in\n    Hepzibah's frame; an agitation so powerful that Phoebe could see the\n    quivering of her gaunt shadow, as thrown by the firelight on the\n    kitchen wall, or by the sunshine on the parlor floor.  Its\n    manifestations were so various, and agreed so little with one another,\n    that the girl knew not what to make of it.  Sometimes it seemed an\n    ecstasy of delight and happiness.  At such moments, Hepzibah would\n    fling out her arms, and infold Phoebe in them, and kiss her cheek as\n    tenderly as ever her mother had; she appeared to do so by an inevitable\n    impulse, and as if her bosom were oppressed with tenderness, of which\n    she must needs pour out a little, in order to gain breathing-room.  The\n    next moment, without any visible cause for the change, her unwonted joy\n    shrank back, appalled, as it were, and clothed itself in mourning; or\n    it ran and hid itself, so to speak, in the dungeon of her heart, where\n    it had long lain chained, while a cold, spectral sorrow took the place\n    of the imprisoned joy, that was afraid to be enfranchised,--a sorrow as\n    black as that was bright.  She often broke into a little, nervous,\n    hysteric laugh, more touching than any tears could be; and forthwith,\n    as if to try which was the most touching, a gush of tears would follow;\nor perhaps the laughter and tears came both at once, and surrounded our\npoor Hepzibah, in a moral sense, with a kind of pale, dim rainbow.\nTowards Phoebe, as we have said, she was affectionate,--far tenderer\nthan ever before, in their brief acquaintance, except for that one kiss\non the preceding night,--yet with a continually recurring pettishness\nand irritability.  She would speak sharply to her; then, throwing aside\nall the starched reserve of her ordinary manner, ask pardon, and the\nnext instant renew the just-forgiven injury.\n\nAt last, when their mutual labor was all finished, she took Phoebe's\nhand in her own trembling one.\n\n\"Bear with me, my dear child,\" she cried; \"for truly my heart is full\nto the brim! Bear with me; for I love you, Phoebe, though I speak so\nroughly.  Think nothing of it, dearest child! By and by, I shall be\nkind, and only kind!\"\n\n\"My dearest cousin, cannot you tell me what has happened?\" asked\nPhoebe, with a sunny and tearful sympathy.  \"What is it that moves you\nso?\"\n\n\"Hush! hush! He is coming!\" whispered Hepzibah, hastily wiping her\neyes. \"Let him see you first, Phoebe; for you are young and rosy, and\ncannot help letting a smile break out whether or no.  He always liked\nbright faces! And mine is old now, and the tears are hardly dry on it.\nHe never could abide tears.  There; draw the curtain a little, so that\nthe shadow may fall across his side of the table! But let there be a\ngood deal of sunshine, too; for he never was fond of gloom, as some\npeople are.  He has had but little sunshine in his life,--poor\nClifford,--and, oh, what a black shadow.  Poor, poor Clifford!\"\n\nThus murmuring in an undertone, as if speaking rather to her own heart\nthan to Phoebe, the old gentlewoman stepped on tiptoe about the room,\n     making such arrangements as suggested themselves at the crisis.\n\n     Meanwhile there was a step in the passage-way, above stairs.  Phoebe\n     recognized it as the same which had passed upward, as through her\n     dream, in the night-time.  The approaching guest, whoever it might be,\n     appeared to pause at the head of the staircase; he paused twice or\n     thrice in the descent; he paused again at the foot.  Each time, the\n     delay seemed to be without purpose, but rather from a forgetfulness of\n     the purpose which had set him in motion, or as if the person's feet\n     came involuntarily to a stand-still because the motive-power was too\n     feeble to sustain his progress.  Finally, he made a long pause at the\n     threshold of the parlor.  He took hold of the knob of the door; then\n     loosened his grasp without opening it.  Hepzibah, her hands\n     convulsively clasped, stood gazing at the entrance.\n\n     \"Dear Cousin Hepzibah, pray don't look so!\" said Phoebe, trembling; for\n     her cousin's emotion, and this mysteriously reluctant step, made her\n     feel as if a ghost were coming into the room.  \"You really frighten me!\n     Is something awful going to happen?\"\n\n     \"Hush!\" whispered Hepzibah.  \"Be cheerful! whatever may happen, be\n     nothing but cheerful!\"\n\n     The final pause at the threshold proved so long, that Hepzibah, unable\n     to endure the suspense, rushed forward, threw open the door, and led in\n     the stranger by the hand.  At the first glance, Phoebe saw an elderly\n     personage, in an old-fashioned dressing-gown of faded damask, and\n     wearing his gray or almost white hair of an unusual length.  It quite\n     overshadowed his forehead, except when he thrust it back, and stared\n     vaguely about the room.  After a very brief inspection of his face, it\n     was easy to conceive that his footstep must necessarily be such an one\n     as that which, slowly and with as indefinite an aim as a child's first\n     journey across a floor, had just brought him hitherward.  Yet there\n     were no tokens that his physical strength might not have sufficed for a\n     free and determined gait.  It was the spirit of the man that could not\n     walk.  The expression of his countenance--while, notwithstanding it had\n     the light of reason in it--seemed to waver, and glimmer, and nearly to\n     die away, and feebly to recover itself again.  It was like a flame\n     which we see twinkling among half-extinguished embers; we gaze at it\n     more intently than if it were a positive blaze, gushing vividly\n     upward,--more intently, but with a certain impatience, as if it ought\n     either to kindle itself into satisfactory splendor, or be at once\n     extinguished.\n\n     For an instant after entering the room, the guest stood still,\n     retaining Hepzibah's hand instinctively, as a child does that of the\n     grown person who guides it.  He saw Phoebe, however, and caught an\n     illumination from her youthful and pleasant aspect, which, indeed,\n     threw a cheerfulness about the parlor, like the circle of reflected\n     brilliancy around the glass vase of flowers that was standing in the\n     sunshine.  He made a salutation, or, to speak nearer the truth, an\n     ill-defined, abortive attempt at curtsy.  Imperfect as it was, however,\n     it conveyed an idea, or, at least, gave a hint, of indescribable grace,\n     such as no practised art of external manners could have attained.  It\n     was too slight to seize upon at the instant; yet, as recollected\n     afterwards, seemed to transfigure the whole man.\n\n     \"Dear Clifford,\" said Hepzibah, in the tone with which one soothes a\n     wayward infant, \"this is our cousin Phoebe,--little Phoebe\n     Pyncheon,--Arthur's only child, you know.  She has come from the\n     country to stay with us awhile; for our old house has grown to be very\n     lonely now.\"\n\n     \"Phoebe--Phoebe Pyncheon?--Phoebe?\" repeated the guest, with a strange,\n     sluggish, ill-defined utterance.  \"Arthur's child! Ah, I forget! No\n     matter.  She is very welcome!\"\n\n     \"Come, dear Clifford, take this chair,\" said Hepzibah, leading him to\n     his place.  \"Pray, Phoebe, lower the curtain a very little more.  Now\n     let us begin breakfast.\"\n\n     The guest seated himself in the place assigned him, and looked\n     strangely around.  He was evidently trying to grapple with the present\n     scene, and bring it home to his mind with a more satisfactory\n     distinctness.  He desired to be certain, at least, that he was here, in\n     the low-studded, cross-beamed, oaken-panelled parlor, and not in some\n     other spot, which had stereotyped itself into his senses.  But the\n     effort was too great to be sustained with more than a fragmentary\n     success.  Continually, as we may express it, he faded away out of his\n     place; or, in other words, his mind and consciousness took their\n     departure, leaving his wasted, gray, and melancholy figure--a\n     substantial emptiness, a material ghost--to occupy his seat at table.\n     Again, after a blank moment, there would be a flickering taper-gleam in\n     his eyeballs.  It betokened that his spiritual part had returned, and\n     was doing its best to kindle the heart's household fire, and light up\n     intellectual lamps in the dark and ruinous mansion, where it was doomed\n     to be a forlorn inhabitant.\n\n     At one of these moments of less torpid, yet still imperfect animation,\n     Phoebe became convinced of what she had at first rejected as too\n     extravagant and startling an idea.  She saw that the person before her\n     must have been the original of the beautiful miniature in her cousin\n     Hepzibah's possession.  Indeed, with a feminine eye for costume, she\n     had at once identified the damask dressing-gown, which enveloped him,\n     as the same in figure, material, and fashion, with that so elaborately\n     represented in the picture.  This old, faded garment, with all its\n     pristine brilliancy extinct, seemed, in some indescribable way, to\n     translate the wearer's untold misfortune, and make it perceptible to\n     the beholder's eye.  It was the better to be discerned, by this\n     exterior type, how worn and old were the soul's more immediate\n     garments; that form and countenance, the beauty and grace of which had\n     almost transcended the skill of the most exquisite of artists.  It\n     could the more adequately be known that the soul of the man must have\n     suffered some miserable wrong, from its earthly experience.  There he\n     seemed to sit, with a dim veil of decay and ruin betwixt him and the\n     world, but through which, at flitting intervals, might be caught the\n     same expression, so refined, so softly imaginative, which\n     Malbone--venturing a happy touch, with suspended breath--had imparted\n     to the miniature! There had been something so innately characteristic\n     in this look, that all the dusky years, and the burden of unfit\n     calamity which had fallen upon him, did not suffice utterly to destroy\n     it.\n\n     Hepzibah had now poured out a cup of deliciously fragrant coffee, and\n     presented it to her guest.  As his eyes met hers, he seemed bewildered\n     and disquieted.\n\n     \"Is this you, Hepzibah?\" he murmured sadly; then, more apart, and\n     perhaps unconscious that he was overheard, \"How changed!  how changed!\n     And is she angry with me? Why does she bend her brow so?\"\n\n     Poor Hepzibah! It was that wretched scowl which time and her\n     near-sightedness, and the fret of inward discomfort, had rendered so\n     habitual that any vehemence of mood invariably evoked it.  But at the\n     indistinct murmur of his words her whole face grew tender, and even\n     lovely, with sorrowful affection; the harshness of her features\n     disappeared, as it were, behind the warm and misty glow.\n\n     \"Angry!\" she repeated; \"angry with you, Clifford!\"\n\n     Her tone, as she uttered the exclamation, had a plaintive and really\n     exquisite melody thrilling through it, yet without subduing a certain\n     something which an obtuse auditor might still have mistaken for\n     asperity. It was as if some transcendent musician should draw a\n     soul-thrilling sweetness out of a cracked instrument, which makes its\n     physical imperfection heard in the midst of ethereal harmony,--so deep\n     was the sensibility that found an organ in Hepzibah's voice!\n\n     \"There is nothing but love here, Clifford,\" she added,--\"nothing but\n     love! You are at home!\"\n\n     The guest responded to her tone by a smile, which did not half light up\n     his face.  Feeble as it was, however, and gone in a moment, it had a\n     charm of wonderful beauty.  It was followed by a coarser expression; or\n     one that had the effect of coarseness on the fine mould and outline of\n     his countenance, because there was nothing intellectual to temper it.\n     It was a look of appetite.  He ate food with what might almost be\n     termed voracity; and seemed to forget himself, Hepzibah, the young\n     girl, and everything else around him, in the sensual enjoyment which\n     the bountifully spread table afforded.  In his natural system, though\n     high-wrought and delicately refined, a sensibility to the delights of\n     the palate was probably inherent.  It would have been kept in check,\n     however, and even converted into an accomplishment, and one of the\n     thousand modes of intellectual culture, had his more ethereal\n     characteristics retained their vigor.  But as it existed now, the\n     effect was painful and made Phoebe droop her eyes.\n\n     In a little while the guest became sensible of the fragrance of the yet\n     untasted coffee.  He quaffed it eagerly.  The subtle essence acted on\n     him like a charmed draught, and caused the opaque substance of his\n     animal being to grow transparent, or, at least, translucent; so that a\n     spiritual gleam was transmitted through it, with a clearer lustre than\n     hitherto.\n\n     \"More, more!\" he cried, with nervous haste in his utterance, as if\n     anxious to retain his grasp of what sought to escape him.  \"This is\n     what I need! Give me more!\"\n\n     Under this delicate and powerful influence he sat more erect, and\n     looked out from his eyes with a glance that took note of what it rested\n     on.  It was not so much that his expression grew more intellectual;\n     this, though it had its share, was not the most peculiar effect.\n     Neither was what we call the moral nature so forcibly awakened as to\n     present itself in remarkable prominence.  But a certain fine temper of\n     being was now not brought out in full relief, but changeably and\n     imperfectly betrayed, of which it was the function to deal with all\n     beautiful and enjoyable things.  In a character where it should exist\n     as the chief attribute, it would bestow on its possessor an exquisite\n     taste, and an enviable susceptibility of happiness.  Beauty would be\n     his life; his aspirations would all tend toward it; and, allowing his\n     frame and physical organs to be in consonance, his own developments\n     would likewise be beautiful.  Such a man should have nothing to do with\n     sorrow; nothing with strife; nothing with the martyrdom which, in an\n     infinite variety of shapes, awaits those who have the heart, and will,\n     and conscience, to fight a battle with the world.  To these heroic\n     tempers, such martyrdom is the richest meed in the world's gift.  To\n     the individual before us, it could only be a grief, intense in due\n     proportion with the severity of the infliction.  He had no right to be\n     a martyr; and, beholding him so fit to be happy and so feeble for all\n     other purposes, a generous, strong, and noble spirit would, methinks,\n     have been ready to sacrifice what little enjoyment it might have\n     planned for itself,--it would have flung down the hopes, so paltry in\n     its regard,--if thereby the wintry blasts of our rude sphere might come\n     tempered to such a man.\n\n     Not to speak it harshly or scornfully, it seemed Clifford's nature to\n     be a Sybarite.  It was perceptible, even there, in the dark old parlor,\n     in the inevitable polarity with which his eyes were attracted towards\n     the quivering play of sunbeams through the shadowy foliage.  It was\n     seen in his appreciating notice of the vase of flowers, the scent of\n     which he inhaled with a zest almost peculiar to a physical organization\n     so refined that spiritual ingredients are moulded in with it.  It was\n     betrayed in the unconscious smile with which he regarded Phoebe, whose\n     fresh and maidenly figure was both sunshine and flowers,--their\n     essence, in a prettier and more agreeable mode of manifestation.  Not\n     less evident was this love and necessity for the Beautiful, in the\n     instinctive caution with which, even so soon, his eyes turned away from\n     his hostess, and wandered to any quarter rather than come back.  It was\n     Hepzibah's misfortune,--not Clifford's fault.  How could he,--so yellow\n     as she was, so wrinkled, so sad of mien, with that odd uncouthness of a\n     turban on her head, and that most perverse of scowls contorting her\n     brow,--how could he love to gaze at her? But, did he owe her no\n     affection for so much as she had silently given? He owed her nothing.\n     A nature like Clifford's can contract no debts of that kind.  It is--we\n     say it without censure, nor in diminution of the claim which it\n     indefeasibly possesses on beings of another mould--it is always selfish\n     in its essence; and we must give it leave to be so, and heap up our\n     heroic and disinterested love upon it so much the more, without a\n     recompense.  Poor Hepzibah knew this truth, or, at least, acted on the\n     instinct of it.  So long estranged from what was lovely as Clifford had\n     been, she rejoiced--rejoiced, though with a present sigh, and a secret\n     purpose to shed tears in her own chamber that he had brighter objects\n     now before his eyes than her aged and uncomely features.  They never\n     possessed a charm; and if they had, the canker of her grief for him\n     would long since have destroyed it.\n\n     The guest leaned back in his chair.  Mingled in his countenance with a\n     dreamy delight, there was a troubled look of effort and unrest.  He was\n     seeking to make himself more fully sensible of the scene around him;\n     or, perhaps, dreading it to be a dream, or a play of imagination, was\n     vexing the fair moment with a struggle for some added brilliancy and\n     more durable illusion.\n\n     \"How pleasant!--How delightful!\" he murmured, but not as if addressing\n     any one.  \"Will it last? How balmy the atmosphere through that open\n     window! An open window! How beautiful that play of sunshine! Those\n     flowers, how very fragrant! That young girl's face, how cheerful, how\n     blooming!--a flower with the dew on it, and sunbeams in the dew-drops!\n     Ah! this must be all a dream!  A dream! A dream! But it has quite\n     hidden the four stone walls!\"\n\n     Then his face darkened, as if the shadow of a cavern or a dungeon had\n     come over it; there was no more light in its expression than might have\n     come through the iron grates of a prison-window--still lessening, too,\n     as if he were sinking farther into the depths.  Phoebe (being of that\n             quickness and activity of temperament that she seldom long refrained\n             from taking a part, and generally a good one, in what was going\n             forward) now felt herself moved to address the stranger.\n\n     \"Here is a new kind of rose, which I found this morning in the garden,\"\n     said she, choosing a small crimson one from among the flowers in the\n     vase.  \"There will be but five or six on the bush this season.  This is\n     the most perfect of them all; not a speck of blight or mildew in it.\n     And how sweet it is!--sweet like no other rose! One can never forget\n     that scent!\"\n\n     \"Ah!--let me see!--let me hold it!\" cried the guest, eagerly seizing\n     the flower, which, by the spell peculiar to remembered odors, brought\n     innumerable associations along with the fragrance that it exhaled.\n     \"Thank you! This has done me good.  I remember how I used to prize this\n     flower,--long ago, I suppose, very long ago!--or was it only yesterday?\n     It makes me feel young again!  Am I young? Either this remembrance is\n     singularly distinct, or this consciousness strangely dim! But how kind\n     of the fair young girl! Thank you! Thank you!\"\n\n     The favorable excitement derived from this little crimson rose afforded\n     Clifford the brightest moment which he enjoyed at the breakfast-table.\n     It might have lasted longer, but that his eyes happened, soon\n     afterwards, to rest on the face of the old Puritan, who, out of his\n     dingy frame and lustreless canvas, was looking down on the scene like a\n     ghost, and a most ill-tempered and ungenial one.  The guest made an\n     impatient gesture of the hand, and addressed Hepzibah with what might\n     easily be recognized as the licensed irritability of a petted member of\n     the family.\n\n     \"Hepzibah!--Hepzibah!\" cried he with no little force and distinctness,\n     \"why do you keep that odious picture on the wall?  Yes, yes!--that is\n     precisely your taste! I have told you, a thousand times, that it was\n     the evil genius of the house!--my evil genius particularly! Take it\n     down, at once!\"\n\n     \"Dear Clifford,\" said Hepzibah sadly, \"you know it cannot be!\"\n\n     \"Then, at all events,\" continued he, still speaking with some energy,\n     \"pray cover it with a crimson curtain, broad enough to hang in folds,\n     and with a golden border and tassels.  I cannot bear it! It must not\n     stare me in the face!\"\n\n     \"Yes, dear Clifford, the picture shall be covered,\" said Hepzibah\n     soothingly.  \"There is a crimson curtain in a trunk above stairs,--a\n     little faded and moth-eaten, I'm afraid,--but Phoebe and I will do\n     wonders with it.\"\n\n     \"This very day, remember\" said he; and then added, in a low,\n     self-communing voice, \"Why should we live in this dismal house at all?\n     Why not go to the South of France?--to Italy?--Paris, Naples, Venice,\n     Rome? Hepzibah will say we have not the means.  A droll idea that!\"\n\n     He smiled to himself, and threw a glance of fine sarcastic meaning\n     towards Hepzibah.\n\n     But the several moods of feeling, faintly as they were marked, through\n     which he had passed, occurring in so brief an interval of time, had\n     evidently wearied the stranger.  He was probably accustomed to a sad\n     monotony of life, not so much flowing in a stream, however sluggish, as\n     stagnating in a pool around his feet.

She is surprised to see that Hepzibah has set the table for three. Who is the third visitor? Throughout all of this preparation, Hepzibah has been trembling anxiously.

The approaching footsteps come slowly in fits and starts. Finally the footsteps hesitate at the threshold of the door. Hepzibah warns Phoebe: \"Whatever may happen, be nothing but cheerful!\" . Hepzibah jumps up and leads an elderly man into the room. This man has unusually long white hair and a broken face. He looks like he is capable of thinking and feeling, but only sometimes - otherwise, his mind seems to \"waver, and glimmer\" . Hepzibah introduces Phoebe to Clifford Pyncheon. Clifford keeps looking around the room as though he cannot believe that he is there. Finally Phoebe realizes that she is seeing the face of the man in Hepzibah's miniature portrait. She can see, now and again, the remnants of that sensitive spirit captured in the portrait. Clifford thinks that Hepzibah is angry with him.

{"original_length": 9491, "trunc_length": 8192, "text": "\n\nSummarize the following text into a summary of less than 800 words.\n### Text:\n\nWHEN Phoebe awoke,--which she did with the early twittering of the\nconjugal couple of robins in the pear-tree,--she heard movements below\nstairs, and, hastening down, found Hepzibah already in the kitchen.\nShe stood by a window, holding a book in close contiguity to her nose,\n    as if with the hope of gaining an olfactory acquaintance with its\n    contents, since her imperfect vision made it not very easy to read\n    them.  If any volume could have manifested its essential wisdom in the\n    mode suggested, it would certainly have been the one now in Hepzibah's\n    hand; and the kitchen, in such an event, would forthwith have streamed\n    with the fragrance of venison, turkeys, capons, larded partridges,\n    puddings, cakes, and Christmas pies, in all manner of elaborate mixture\n    and concoction.  It was a cookery book, full of innumerable old\n    fashions of English dishes, and illustrated with engravings, which\n    represented the arrangements of the table at such banquets as it might\n    have befitted a nobleman to give in the great hall of his castle.  And,\n    amid these rich and potent devices of the culinary art (not one of\n            which, probably, had been tested, within the memory of any man's\n            grandfather), poor Hepzibah was seeking for some nimble little titbit,\n    which, with what skill she had, and such materials as were at hand, she\n    might toss up for breakfast.\n\n    Soon, with a deep sigh, she put aside the savory volume, and inquired\n    of Phoebe whether old Speckle, as she called one of the hens, had laid\n    an egg the preceding day.  Phoebe ran to see, but returned without the\n    expected treasure in her hand.  At that instant, however, the blast of\n    a fish-dealer's conch was heard, announcing his approach along the\n    street.  With energetic raps at the shop-window, Hepzibah summoned the\n    man in, and made purchase of what he warranted as the finest mackerel\n    in his cart, and as fat a one as ever he felt with his finger so early\n    in the season.  Requesting Phoebe to roast some coffee,--which she\n    casually observed was the real Mocha, and so long kept that each of the\n    small berries ought to be worth its weight in gold,--the maiden lady\n    heaped fuel into the vast receptacle of the ancient fireplace in such\n    quantity as soon to drive the lingering dusk out of the kitchen.  The\n    country-girl, willing to give her utmost assistance, proposed to make\n    an Indian cake, after her mother's peculiar method, of easy\n    manufacture, and which she could vouch for as possessing a richness,\n    and, if rightly prepared, a delicacy, unequalled by any other mode of\n    breakfast-cake.  Hepzibah gladly assenting, the kitchen was soon the\n    scene of savory preparation.  Perchance, amid their proper element of\n    smoke, which eddied forth from the ill-constructed chimney, the ghosts\n    of departed cook-maids looked wonderingly on, or peeped down the great\n    breadth of the flue, despising the simplicity of the projected meal,\n    yet ineffectually pining to thrust their shadowy hands into each\n    inchoate dish.  The half-starved rats, at any rate, stole visibly out\n    of their hiding-places, and sat on their hind-legs, snuffing the fumy\n    atmosphere, and wistfully awaiting an opportunity to nibble.\n\n    Hepzibah had no natural turn for cookery, and, to say the truth, had\n    fairly incurred her present meagreness by often choosing to go without\n    her dinner rather than be attendant on the rotation of the spit, or\n    ebullition of the pot.  Her zeal over the fire, therefore, was quite an\n    heroic test of sentiment.  It was touching, and positively worthy of\n    tears (if Phoebe, the only spectator, except the rats and ghosts\n            aforesaid, had not been better employed than in shedding them), to see\n    her rake out a bed of fresh and glowing coals, and proceed to broil the\n    mackerel.  Her usually pale cheeks were all ablaze with heat and hurry.\n    She watched the fish with as much tender care and minuteness of\n    attention as if,--we know not how to express it otherwise,--as if her\n    own heart were on the gridiron, and her immortal happiness were\n    involved in its being done precisely to a turn!\n\n    Life, within doors, has few pleasanter prospects than a neatly arranged\n    and well-provisioned breakfast-table.  We come to it freshly, in the\n    dewy youth of the day, and when our spiritual and sensual elements are\n    in better accord than at a later period; so that the material delights\n    of the morning meal are capable of being fully enjoyed, without any\n    very grievous reproaches, whether gastric or conscientious, for\n    yielding even a trifle overmuch to the animal department of our nature.\n    The thoughts, too, that run around the ring of familiar guests have a\n    piquancy and mirthfulness, and oftentimes a vivid truth, which more\n    rarely find their way into the elaborate intercourse of dinner.\n    Hepzibah's small and ancient table, supported on its slender and\n    graceful legs, and covered with a cloth of the richest damask, looked\n    worthy to be the scene and centre of one of the cheerfullest of\n    parties.  The vapor of the broiled fish arose like incense from the\n    shrine of a barbarian idol, while the fragrance of the Mocha might have\n    gratified the nostrils of a tutelary Lar, or whatever power has scope\n    over a modern breakfast-table.  Phoebe's Indian cakes were the sweetest\n    offering of all,--in their hue befitting the rustic altars of the\n    innocent and golden age,--or, so brightly yellow were they, resembling\n    some of the bread which was changed to glistening gold when Midas tried\n    to eat it.  The butter must not be forgotten,--butter which Phoebe\n    herself had churned, in her own rural home, and brought it to her\n    cousin as a propitiatory gift,--smelling of clover-blossoms, and\n    diffusing the charm of pastoral scenery through the dark-panelled\n    parlor.  All this, with the quaint gorgeousness of the old china cups\n    and saucers, and the crested spoons, and a silver cream-jug (Hepzibah's\n            only other article of plate, and shaped like the rudest porringer), set\n    out a board at which the stateliest of old Colonel Pyncheon's guests\n    need not have scorned to take his place.  But the Puritan's face\n    scowled down out of the picture, as if nothing on the table pleased his\n    appetite.\n\n    By way of contributing what grace she could, Phoebe gathered some roses\n    and a few other flowers, possessing either scent or beauty, and\n    arranged them in a glass pitcher, which, having long ago lost its\n    handle, was so much the fitter for a flower-vase.  The early\n    sunshine--as fresh as that which peeped into Eve's bower while she and\n    Adam sat at breakfast there--came twinkling through the branches of the\n    pear-tree, and fell quite across the table.  All was now ready.  There\n    were chairs and plates for three.  A chair and plate for Hepzibah,--the\n    same for Phoebe,--but what other guest did her cousin look for?\n\n    Throughout this preparation there had been a constant tremor in\n    Hepzibah's frame; an agitation so powerful that Phoebe could see the\n    quivering of her gaunt shadow, as thrown by the firelight on the\n    kitchen wall, or by the sunshine on the parlor floor.  Its\n    manifestations were so various, and agreed so little with one another,\n    that the girl knew not what to make of it.  Sometimes it seemed an\n    ecstasy of delight and happiness.  At such moments, Hepzibah would\n    fling out her arms, and infold Phoebe in them, and kiss her cheek as\n    tenderly as ever her mother had; she appeared to do so by an inevitable\n    impulse, and as if her bosom were oppressed with tenderness, of which\n    she must needs pour out a little, in order to gain breathing-room.  The\n    next moment, without any visible cause for the change, her unwonted joy\n    shrank back, appalled, as it were, and clothed itself in mourning; or\n    it ran and hid itself, so to speak, in the dungeon of her heart, where\n    it had long lain chained, while a cold, spectral sorrow took the place\n    of the imprisoned joy, that was afraid to be enfranchised,--a sorrow as\n    black as that was bright.  She often broke into a little, nervous,\n    hysteric laugh, more touching than any tears could be; and forthwith,\n    as if to try which was the most touching, a gush of tears would follow;\nor perhaps the laughter and tears came both at once, and surrounded our\npoor Hepzibah, in a moral sense, with a kind of pale, dim rainbow.\nTowards Phoebe, as we have said, she was affectionate,--far tenderer\nthan ever before, in their brief acquaintance, except for that one kiss\non the preceding night,--yet with a continually recurring pettishness\nand irritability.  She would speak sharply to her; then, throwing aside\nall the starched reserve of her ordinary manner, ask pardon, and the\nnext instant renew the just-forgiven injury.\n\nAt last, when their mutual labor was all finished, she took Phoebe's\nhand in her own trembling one.\n\n\"Bear with me, my dear child,\" she cried; \"for truly my heart is full\nto the brim! Bear with me; for I love you, Phoebe, though I speak so\nroughly.  Think nothing of it, dearest child! By and by, I shall be\nkind, and only kind!\"\n\n\"My dearest cousin, cannot you tell me what has happened?\" asked\nPhoebe, with a sunny and tearful sympathy.  \"What is it that moves you\nso?\"\n\n\"Hush! hush! He is coming!\" whispered Hepzibah, hastily wiping her\neyes. \"Let him see you first, Phoebe; for you are young and rosy, and\ncannot help letting a smile break out whether or no.  He always liked\nbright faces! And mine is old now, and the tears are hardly dry on it.\nHe never could abide tears.  There; draw the curtain a little, so that\nthe shadow may fall across his side of the table! But let there be a\ngood deal of sunshine, too; for he never was fond of gloom, as some\npeople are.  He has had but little sunshine in his life,--poor\nClifford,--and, oh, what a black shadow.  Poor, poor Clifford!\"\n\nThus murmuring in an undertone, as if speaking rather to her own heart\nthan to Phoebe, the old gentlewoman stepped on tiptoe about the room,\n     making such arrangements as suggested themselves at the crisis.\n\n     Meanwhile there was a step in the passage-way, above stairs.  Phoebe\n     recognized it as the same which had passed upward, as through her\n     dream, in the night-time.  The approaching guest, whoever it might be,\n     appeared to pause at the head of the staircase; he paused twice or\n     thrice in the descent; he paused again at the foot.  Each time, the\n     delay seemed to be without purpose, but rather from a forgetfulness of\n     the purpose which had set him in motion, or as if the person's feet\n     came involuntarily to a stand-still because the motive-power was too\n     feeble to sustain his progress.  Finally, he made a long pause at the\n     threshold of the parlor.  He took hold of the knob of the door; then\n     loosened his grasp without opening it.  Hepzibah, her hands\n     convulsively clasped, stood gazing at the entrance.\n\n     \"Dear Cousin Hepzibah, pray don't look so!\" said Phoebe, trembling; for\n     her cousin's emotion, and this mysteriously reluctant step, made her\n     feel as if a ghost were coming into the room.  \"You really frighten me!\n     Is something awful going to happen?\"\n\n     \"Hush!\" whispered Hepzibah.  \"Be cheerful! whatever may happen, be\n     nothing but cheerful!\"\n\n     The final pause at the threshold proved so long, that Hepzibah, unable\n     to endure the suspense, rushed forward, threw open the door, and led in\n     the stranger by the hand.  At the first glance, Phoebe saw an elderly\n     personage, in an old-fashioned dressing-gown of faded damask, and\n     wearing his gray or almost white hair of an unusual length.  It quite\n     overshadowed his forehead, except when he thrust it back, and stared\n     vaguely about the room.  After a very brief inspection of his face, it\n     was easy to conceive that his footstep must necessarily be such an one\n     as that which, slowly and with as indefinite an aim as a child's first\n     journey across a floor, had just brought him hitherward.  Yet there\n     were no tokens that his physical strength might not have sufficed for a\n     free and determined gait.  It was the spirit of the man that could not\n     walk.  The expression of his countenance--while, notwithstanding it had\n     the light of reason in it--seemed to waver, and glimmer, and nearly to\n     die away, and feebly to recover itself again.  It was like a flame\n     which we see twinkling among half-extinguished embers; we gaze at it\n     more intently than if it were a positive blaze, gushing vividly\n     upward,--more intently, but with a certain impatience, as if it ought\n     either to kindle itself into satisfactory splendor, or be at once\n     extinguished.\n\n     For an instant after entering the room, the guest stood still,\n     retaining Hepzibah's hand instinctively, as a child does that of the\n     grown person who guides it.  He saw Phoebe, however, and caught an\n     illumination from her youthful and pleasant aspect, which, indeed,\n     threw a cheerfulness about the parlor, like the circle of reflected\n     brilliancy around the glass vase of flowers that was standing in the\n     sunshine.  He made a salutation, or, to speak nearer the truth, an\n     ill-defined, abortive attempt at curtsy.  Imperfect as it was, however,\n     it conveyed an idea, or, at least, gave a hint, of indescribable grace,\n     such as no practised art of external manners could have attained.  It\n     was too slight to seize upon at the instant; yet, as recollected\n     afterwards, seemed to transfigure the whole man.\n\n     \"Dear Clifford,\" said Hepzibah, in the tone with which one soothes a\n     wayward infant, \"this is our cousin Phoebe,--little Phoebe\n     Pyncheon,--Arthur's only child, you know.  She has come from the\n     country to stay with us awhile; for our old house has grown to be very\n     lonely now.\"\n\n     \"Phoebe--Phoebe Pyncheon?--Phoebe?\" repeated the guest, with a strange,\n     sluggish, ill-defined utterance.  \"Arthur's child! Ah, I forget! No\n     matter.  She is very welcome!\"\n\n     \"Come, dear Clifford, take this chair,\" said Hepzibah, leading him to\n     his place.  \"Pray, Phoebe, lower the curtain a very little more.  Now\n     let us begin breakfast.\"\n\n     The guest seated himself in the place assigned him, and looked\n     strangely around.  He was evidently trying to grapple with the present\n     scene, and bring it home to his mind with a more satisfactory\n     distinctness.  He desired to be certain, at least, that he was here, in\n     the low-studded, cross-beamed, oaken-panelled parlor, and not in some\n     other spot, which had stereotyped itself into his senses.  But the\n     effort was too great to be sustained with more than a fragmentary\n     success.  Continually, as we may express it, he faded away out of his\n     place; or, in other words, his mind and consciousness took their\n     departure, leaving his wasted, gray, and melancholy figure--a\n     substantial emptiness, a material ghost--to occupy his seat at table.\n     Again, after a blank moment, there would be a flickering taper-gleam in\n     his eyeballs.  It betokened that his spiritual part had returned, and\n     was doing its best to kindle the heart's household fire, and light up\n     intellectual lamps in the dark and ruinous mansion, where it was doomed\n     to be a forlorn inhabitant.\n\n     At one of these moments of less torpid, yet still imperfect animation,\n     Phoebe became convinced of what she had at first rejected as too\n     extravagant and startling an idea.  She saw that the person before her\n     must have been the original of the beautiful miniature in her cousin\n     Hepzibah's possession.  Indeed, with a feminine eye for costume, she\n     had at once identified the damask dressing-gown, which enveloped him,\n     as the same in figure, material, and fashion, with that so elaborately\n     represented in the picture.  This old, faded garment, with all its\n     pristine brilliancy extinct, seemed, in some indescribable way, to\n     translate the wearer's untold misfortune, and make it perceptible to\n     the beholder's eye.  It was the better to be discerned, by this\n     exterior type, how worn and old were the soul's more immediate\n     garments; that form and countenance, the beauty and grace of which had\n     almost transcended the skill of the most exquisite of artists.  It\n     could the more adequately be known that the soul of the man must have\n     suffered some miserable wrong, from its earthly experience.  There he\n     seemed to sit, with a dim veil of decay and ruin betwixt him and the\n     world, but through which, at flitting intervals, might be caught the\n     same expression, so refined, so softly imaginative, which\n     Malbone--venturing a happy touch, with suspended breath--had imparted\n     to the miniature! There had been something so innately characteristic\n     in this look, that all the dusky years, and the burden of unfit\n     calamity which had fallen upon him, did not suffice utterly to destroy\n     it.\n\n     Hepzibah had now poured out a cup of deliciously fragrant coffee, and\n     presented it to her guest.  As his eyes met hers, he seemed bewildered\n     and disquieted.\n\n     \"Is this you, Hepzibah?\" he murmured sadly; then, more apart, and\n     perhaps unconscious that he was overheard, \"How changed!  how changed!\n     And is she angry with me? Why does she bend her brow so?\"\n\n     Poor Hepzibah! It was that wretched scowl which time and her\n     near-sightedness, and the fret of inward discomfort, had rendered so\n     habitual that any vehemence of mood invariably evoked it.  But at the\n     indistinct murmur of his words her whole face grew tender, and even\n     lovely, with sorrowful affection; the harshness of her features\n     disappeared, as it were, behind the warm and misty glow.\n\n     \"Angry!\" she repeated; \"angry with you, Clifford!\"\n\n     Her tone, as she uttered the exclamation, had a plaintive and really\n     exquisite melody thrilling through it, yet without subduing a certain\n     something which an obtuse auditor might still have mistaken for\n     asperity. It was as if some transcendent musician should draw a\n     soul-thrilling sweetness out of a cracked instrument, which makes its\n     physical imperfection heard in the midst of ethereal harmony,--so deep\n     was the sensibility that found an organ in Hepzibah's voice!\n\n     \"There is nothing but love here, Clifford,\" she added,--\"nothing but\n     love! You are at home!\"\n\n     The guest responded to her tone by a smile, which did not half light up\n     his face.  Feeble as it was, however, and gone in a moment, it had a\n     charm of wonderful beauty.  It was followed by a coarser expression; or\n     one that had the effect of coarseness on the fine mould and outline of\n     his countenance, because there was nothing intellectual to temper it.\n     It was a look of appetite.  He ate food with what might almost be\n     termed voracity; and seemed to forget himself, Hepzibah, the young\n     girl, and everything else around him, in the sensual enjoyment which\n     the bountifully spread table afforded.  In his natural system, though\n     high-wrought and delicately refined, a sensibility to the delights of\n     the palate was probably inherent.  It would have been kept in check,\n     however, and even converted into an accomplishment, and one of the\n     thousand modes of intellectual culture, had his more ethereal\n     characteristics retained their vigor.  But as it existed now, the\n     effect was painful and made Phoebe droop her eyes.\n\n     In a little while the guest became sensible of the fragrance of the yet\n     untasted coffee.  He quaffed it eagerly.  The subtle essence acted on\n     him like a charmed draught, and caused the opaque substance of his\n     animal being to grow transparent, or, at least, translucent; so that a\n     spiritual gleam was transmitted through it, with a clearer lustre than\n     hitherto.\n\n     \"More, more!\" he cried, with nervous haste in his utterance, as if\n     anxious to retain his grasp of what sought to escape him.  \"This is\n     what I need! Give me more!\"\n\n     Under this delicate and powerful influence he sat more erect, and\n     looked out from his eyes with a glance that took note of what it rested\n     on.  It was not so much that his expression grew more intellectual;\n     this, though it had its share, was not the most peculiar effect.\n     Neither was what we call the moral nature so forcibly awakened as to\n     present itself in remarkable prominence.  But a certain fine temper of\n     being was now not brought out in full relief, but changeably and\n     imperfectly betrayed, of which it was the function to deal with all\n     beautiful and enjoyable things.  In a character where it should exist\n     as the chief attribute, it would bestow on its possessor an exquisite\n     taste, and an enviable susceptibility of happiness.  Beauty would be\n     his life; his aspirations would all tend toward it; and, allowing his\n     frame and physical organs to be in consonance, his own developments\n     would likewise be beautiful.  Such a man should have nothing to do with\n     sorrow; nothing with strife; nothing with the martyrdom which, in an\n     infinite variety of shapes, awaits those who have the heart, and will,\n     and conscience, to fight a battle with the world.  To these heroic\n     tempers, such martyrdom is the richest meed in the world's gift.  To\n     the individual before us, it could only be a grief, intense in due\n     proportion with the severity of the infliction.  He had no right to be\n     a martyr; and, beholding him so fit to be happy and so feeble for all\n     other purposes, a generous, strong, and noble spirit would, methinks,\n     have been ready to sacrifice what little enjoyment it might have\n     planned for itself,--it would have flung down the hopes, so paltry in\n     its regard,--if thereby the wintry blasts of our rude sphere might come\n     tempered to such a man.\n\n     Not to speak it harshly or scornfully, it seemed Clifford's nature to\n     be a Sybarite.  It was perceptible, even there, in the dark old parlor,\n     in the inevitable polarity with which his eyes were attracted towards\n     the quivering play of sunbeams through the shadowy foliage.  It was\n     seen in his appreciating notice of the vase of flowers, the scent of\n     which he inhaled with a zest almost peculiar to a physical organization\n     so refined that spiritual ingredients are moulded in with it.  It was\n     betrayed in the unconscious smile with which he regarded Phoebe, whose\n     fresh and maidenly figure was both sunshine and flowers,--their\n     essence, in a prettier and more agreeable mode of manifestation.  Not\n     less evident was this love and necessity for the Beautiful, in the\n     instinctive caution with which, even so soon, his eyes turned away from\n     his hostess, and wandered to any quarter rather than come back.  It was\n     Hepzibah's misfortune,--not Clifford's fault.  How could he,--so yellow\n     as she was, so wrinkled, so sad of mien, with that odd uncouthness of a\n     turban on her head, and that most perverse of scowls contorting her\n     brow,--how could he love to gaze at her? But, did he owe her no\n     affection for so much as she had silently given? He owed her nothing.\n     A nature like Clifford's can contract no debts of that kind.  It is--we\n     say it without censure, nor in diminution of the claim which it\n     indefeasibly possesses on beings of another mould--it is always selfish\n     in its essence; and we must give it leave to be so, and heap up our\n     heroic and disinterested love upon it so much the more, without a\n     recompense.  Poor Hepzibah knew this truth, or, at least, acted on the\n     instinct of it.  So long estranged from what was lovely as Clifford had\n     been, she rejoiced--rejoiced, though with a present sigh, and a secret\n     purpose to shed tears in her own chamber that he had brighter objects\n     now before his eyes than her aged and uncomely features.  They never\n     possessed a charm; and if they had, the canker of her grief for him\n     would long since have destroyed it.\n\n     The guest leaned back in his chair.  Mingled in his countenance with a\n     dreamy delight, there was a troubled look of effort and unrest.  He was\n     seeking to make himself more fully sensible of the scene around him;\n     or, perhaps, dreading it to be a dream, or a play of imagination, was\n     vexing the fair moment with a struggle for some added brilliancy and\n     more durable illusion.\n\n     \"How pleasant!--How delightful!\" he murmured, but not as if addressing\n     any one.  \"Will it last? How balmy the atmosphere through that open\n     window! An open window! How beautiful that play of sunshine! Those\n     flowers, how very fragrant! That young girl's face, how cheerful, how\n     blooming!--a flower with the dew on it, and sunbeams in the dew-drops!\n     Ah! this must be all a dream!  A dream! A dream! But it has quite\n     hidden the four stone walls!\"\n\n     Then his face darkened, as if the shadow of a cavern or a dungeon had\n     come over it; there was no more light in its expression than might have\n     come through the iron grates of a prison-window--still lessening, too,\n     as if he were sinking farther into the depths.  Phoebe (being of that\n             quickness and activity of temperament that she seldom long refrained\n             from taking a part, and generally a good one, in what was going\n             forward) now felt herself moved to address the stranger.\n\n     \"Here is a new kind of rose, which I found this morning in the garden,\"\n     said she, choosing a small crimson one from among the flowers in the\n     vase.  \"There will be but five or six on the bush this season.  This is\n     the most perfect of them all; not a speck of blight or mildew in it.\n     And how sweet it is!--sweet like no other rose! One can never forget\n     that scent!\"\n\n     \"Ah!--let me see!--let me hold it!\" cried the guest, eagerly seizing\n     the flower, which, by the spell peculiar to remembered odors, brought\n     innumerable associations along with the fragrance that it exhaled.\n     \"Thank you! This has done me good.  I remember how I used to prize this\n     flower,--long ago, I suppose, very long ago!--or was it only yesterday?\n     It makes me feel young again!  Am I young? Either this remembrance is\n     singularly distinct, or this consciousness strangely dim! But how kind\n     of the fair young girl! Thank you! Thank you!\"\n\n     The favorable excitement derived from this little crimson rose afforded\n     Clifford the brightest moment which he enjoyed at the breakfast-table.\n     It might have lasted longer, but that his eyes happened, soon\n     afterwards, to rest on the face of the old Puritan, who, out of his\n     dingy frame and lustreless canvas, was looking down on the scene like a\n     ghost, and a most ill-tempered and ungenial one.  The guest made an\n     impatient gesture of the hand, and addressed Hepzibah with what might\n     easily be recognized as the licensed irritability of a petted member of\n     the family.\n\n     \"Hepzibah!--Hepzibah!\" cried he with no little force and distinctness,\n     \"why do you keep that odious picture on the wall?  Yes, yes!--that is\n     precisely your taste! I have told you, a thousand times, that it was\n     the evil genius of the house!--my evil genius particularly! Take it\n     down, at once!\"\n\n     \"Dear Clifford,\" said Hepzibah sadly, \"you know it cannot be!\"\n\n     \"Then, at all events,\" continued he, still speaking with some energy,\n     \"pray cover it with a crimson curtain, broad enough to hang in folds,\n     and with a golden border and tassels.  I cannot bear it! It must not\n     stare me in the face!\"\n\n     \"Yes, dear Clifford, the picture shall be covered,\" said Hepzibah\n     soothingly.  \"There is a crimson curtain in a trunk above stairs,--a\n     little faded and moth-eaten, I'm afraid,--but Phoebe and I will do\n     wonders with it.\"\n\n     \"This very day, remember\" said he; and then added, in a low,\n     self-communing voice, \"Why should we live in this dismal house at all?\n     Why not go to the South of France?--to Italy?--Paris, Naples, Venice,\n     Rome? Hepzibah will say we have not the means.  A droll idea that!\"\n\n     He smiled to himself, and threw a glance of fine sarcastic meaning\n     towards Hepzibah.\n\n     But the several moods of feeling, faintly as they were marked, through\n     which he had passed, occurring in so brief an interval of time, had\n     evidently wearied the stranger.  He was probably accustomed to a sad\n     monotony of life, not so much flowing in a stream, however sluggish, as\n     stagnating in a pool around his feet.  A slumberous veil diffused\n     itself over his countenance, and had an effect, morally speaking, on\n     its naturally delicate and elegant outline, like that which a brooding\n     mist, with no sunshine in it, throws over the features of a landscape.\n     He appeared to become grosser,--almost cloddish.  If aught of interest\n     or beauty--even ruined beauty--had heretofore been visible in this man,\n     the beholder might now begin to doubt it, and to accuse his own\n     imagination of deluding him with whatever grace had flickered over that\n     visage, and whatever exquisite lustre had gleamed in those filmy eyes.\n\n     Before he had\n\n### Summary:\n\n", "answer": "The Guest Phoebe awakes to find Hepzibah downstairs, deeply immersed in a cookbook. Hepzibah decides to buy a mackerel from a fishmonger walking along the street and immediately begins cooking it. Phoebe, surprised by Hepzibah's sudden energy, helps to cook the large breakfast. Throughout the cooking, Hepzibah is on an emotional roller-coaster, hugging Phoebe joyfully one minute and bursting into tears the next. Phoebe is surprised to see three places set for the meal, and when they hear the sounds of their long-awaited guest, Hepzibah begs her to be cheerful no matter what. Finally, with Hepzibah's assistance, in walks their guest, Hepzibah's long-absent brother, Clifford. He wanders about in confusion, addresses his sister in the third person, and though he is quite taken with Phoebe, he can barely place her in the family. Phoebe eventually recognizes him as the man whose miniature portrait Hepzibah keeps in her drawer. Clifford eats his food ravenously, but he cannot look his sister in the face and keeps casting his eyes around so that he does not have to look at the ugliness of Hepzibah's scowl. After breakfast, Clifford begins to look around the room. It becomes apparent that, for all his frailty, he is at heart a sybarite--a person who devotes his life to the sensual pleasures of sight, sound, and touch. Clifford takes particular pleasure in the old house and the pleasant sight of young Phoebe. When he spots the old portrait of Colonel Pyncheon, however, Clifford recoils in horror and asks that it be removed. Hepzibah replies that, as Clifford well knows, she can do no such thing, but she agrees to cover it with a cloth instead. The sudden ring of the shop bell greatly troubles Clifford. Hepzibah explains to him that times have changed and that they are now so poor that she has been forced to take up shop-keeping. She frets that by doing so she has brought shame on the family, but Clifford replies that he cannot be shamed further and is not bothered by Hepzibah's occupation. He weeps, however, over the ruins of his life. Eventually, he falls asleep in his chair, while Hepzibah looks at his face and sheds silent tears"}

The Cyclone.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\nDorothy lived in the midst of the great Kansas prairies, with Uncle\nHenry, who was a farmer, and Aunt Em, who was the farmer's wife.\nTheir house was small, for the lumber to build it had to be carried\nby wagon many miles. There were four walls, a floor and a roof,\nwhich made one room; and this room contained a rusty looking cooking\nstove, a cupboard for the dishes, a table, three or four chairs,\nand the beds. Uncle Henry and Aunt Em had a big bed in one corner,\nand Dorothy a little bed in another corner. There was no garret at\nall, and no cellar--except a small hole, dug in the ground, called a\ncyclone cellar, where the family could go in case one of those great\nwhirlwinds arose, mighty enough to crush any building in its path. It\nwas reached by a trap-door in the middle of the floor, from which a\nladder led down into the small, dark hole.\n\nWhen Dorothy stood in the doorway and looked around, she could see\nnothing but the great gray prairie on every side. Not a tree nor a\nhouse broke the broad sweep of flat country that reached the edge of\nthe sky in all directions. The sun had baked the plowed land into a\ngray mass, with little cracks running through it. Even the grass was\nnot green, for the sun had burned the tops of the long blades until\nthey were the same gray color to be seen everywhere. Once the house had\nbeen painted, but the sun blistered the paint and the rains washed it\naway, and now the house was as dull and gray as everything else.\n\n[Illustration: \"_She caught Toto by the ear._\"]\n\nWhen Aunt Em came there to live she was a young, pretty wife. The\nsun and wind had changed her, too. They had taken the sparkle from\nher eyes and left them a sober gray; they had taken the red from her\ncheeks and lips, and they were gray also. She was thin and gaunt,\nand never smiled, now. When Dorothy, who was an orphan, first came\nto her, Aunt Em had been so startled by the child's laughter that\nshe would scream and press her hand upon her heart whenever Dorothy's\nmerry voice reached her ears; and she still looked at the little girl\nwith wonder that she could find anything to laugh at.\n\nUncle Henry never laughed. He worked hard from morning till night and\ndid not know what joy was. He was gray also, from his long beard to\nhis rough boots, and he looked stern and solemn, and rarely spoke.\n\nIt was Toto that made Dorothy laugh, and saved her from growing as\ngray as her other surroundings. Toto was not gray; he was a little\nblack dog, with long, silky hair and small black eyes that twinkled\nmerrily on either side of his funny, wee nose. Toto played all day\nlong, and Dorothy played with him, and loved him dearly.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nTo-day, however, they were not playing. Uncle Henry sat upon the\ndoor-step and looked anxiously at the sky, which was even grayer than\nusual. Dorothy stood in the door with Toto in her arms, and looked at\nthe sky too. Aunt Em was washing the dishes.\n\nFrom the far north they heard a low wail of the wind, and Uncle\nHenry and Dorothy could see where the long grass bowed in waves\nbefore the coming storm. There now came a sharp whistling in the\nair from the south, and as they turned their eyes that way they saw\nripples in the grass coming from that direction also.\n\nSuddenly Uncle Henry stood up.\n\n\"There's a cyclone coming, Em,\" he called to his wife; \"I'll go look\nafter the stock.\" Then he ran toward the sheds where the cows and\nhorses were kept.\n\nAunt Em dropped her work and came to the door. One glance told her of\nthe danger close at hand.\n\n\"Quick, Dorothy!\" she screamed; \"run for the cellar!\"\n\nToto jumped out of Dorothy's arms and hid under the bed, and the\ngirl started to get him. Aunt Em, badly frightened, threw open the\ntrap-door in the floor and climbed down the ladder into the small,\ndark hole. Dorothy caught Toto at last, and started to follow her\naunt. When she was half way across the room there came a great shriek\nfrom the wind, and the house shook so hard that she lost her footing\nand sat down suddenly upon the floor.\n\nA strange thing then happened.\n\nThe house whirled around two or three times and rose slowly through\nthe air. Dorothy felt as if she were going up in a balloon.\n\nThe north and south winds met where the house stood, and made it the\nexact center of the cyclone. In the middle of a cyclone the air is\ngenerally still, but the great pressure of the wind on every side of\nthe house raised it up higher and higher, until it was at the very\ntop of the cyclone; and there it remained and was carried miles and\nmiles away as easily as you could carry a feather.\n\nIt was very dark, and the wind howled horribly around her, but\nDorothy found she was riding quite easily. After the first few whirls\naround, and one other time when the house tipped badly, she felt as\nif she were being rocked gently, like a baby in a cradle.\n\nToto did not like it. He ran about the room, now here, now there,\nbarking loudly; but Dorothy sat quite still on the floor and waited\nto see what would happen.\n\nOnce Toto got too near the open trap-door, and fell in; and at first\nthe little girl thought she had lost him. But soon she saw one of his\nears sticking up through the hole, for the strong pressure of the air\nwas keeping him up so that he could not fall. She crept to the hole,\ncaught Toto by the ear, and dragged him into the room again; afterward\nclosing the trap-door so that no more accidents could happen.\n\nHour after hour passed away, and slowly Dorothy got over her fright;\nbut she felt quite lonely, and the wind shrieked so loudly all about\nher that she nearly became deaf. At first she had wondered if she\nwould be dashed to pieces when the house fell again; but as the hours\npassed and nothing terrible happened, she stopped worrying and\nresolved to wait calmly and see what the future would bring. At last\nshe crawled over the swaying floor to her bed, and lay down upon it;\nand Toto followed and lay down beside her.\n\nIn spite of the swaying of the house and the wailing of the wind,\nDorothy soon closed her eyes and fell fast asleep.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter II. The Council with The Munchkins.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\nShe was awakened by a shock, so sudden and severe that if Dorothy\nhad not been lying on the soft bed she might have been hurt. As it\nwas, the jar made her catch her breath and wonder what had happened;\nand Toto put his cold little nose into her face and whined dismally.\nDorothy sat up and noticed that the house was not moving; nor was it\ndark, for the bright sunshine came in at the window, flooding the\nlittle room. She sprang from her bed and with Toto at her heels ran\nand opened the door.\n\nThe little girl gave a cry of amazement and looked about her, her\neyes growing bigger and bigger at the wonderful sights she saw.\n\nThe cyclone had set the house down, very gently--for a cyclone--in\nthe midst of a country of marvelous beauty. There were lovely patches\nof green sward all about, with stately trees bearing rich and\nluscious fruits. Banks of gorgeous flowers were on every hand, and\nbirds with rare and brilliant plumage sang and fluttered in the trees\nand bushes. A little way off was a small brook, rushing and sparkling\nalong between green banks, and murmuring in a voice very grateful to\na little girl who had lived so long on the dry, gray prairies.\n\nWhile she stood looking eagerly at the strange and beautiful sights,\nshe noticed coming toward her a group of the queerest people she had\never seen. They were not as big as the grown folk she had always been\nused to; but neither were they very small. In fact, they seemed about\nas tall as Dorothy, who was a well-grown child for her age, although\nthey were, so far as looks go, many years older.\n\n[Illustration: \"_I am the Witch of the North._\"]\n\nThree were men and one a woman, and all were oddly dressed. They wore\nround hats that rose to a small point a foot above their heads, with\nlittle bells around the brims that tinkled sweetly as they moved. The\nhats of the men were blue; the little woman's hat was white, and she\nwore a white gown that hung in plaits from her shoulders; over it were\nsprinkled little stars that glistened in the sun like diamonds. The men\nwere dressed in blue, of the same shade as their hats, and wore well\npolished boots with a deep roll of blue at the tops. The men, Dorothy\nthought, were about as old as Uncle Henry, for two of them had beards.\nBut the little woman was doubtless much older: her face was covered\nwith wrinkles, her hair was nearly white, and she walked rather stiffly.\n\nWhen these people drew near the house where Dorothy was standing in\nthe doorway, they paused and whispered among themselves, as if afraid\nto come farther. But the little old woman walked up to Dorothy, made\na low bow and said, in a sweet voice,\n\n\"You are welcome, most noble Sorceress, to the land of the Munchkins.\nWe are so grateful to you for having killed the wicked Witch of the\nEast, and for setting our people free from bondage.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nDorothy listened to this speech with wonder. What could the little\nwoman possibly mean by calling her a sorceress, and saying she\nhad killed the wicked Witch of the East? Dorothy was an innocent,\nharmless little girl, who had been carried by a cyclone many miles\nfrom home; and she had never killed anything in all her life.\n\nBut the little woman evidently expected her to answer; so Dorothy\nsaid, with hesitation,\n\n\"You are very kind; but there must be some mistake. I have not killed\nanything.\"\n\n\"Your house did, anyway,\" replied the little old woman, with a laugh;\n\"and that is the same thing. See!\" she continued, pointing to the\ncorner of the house; \"there are her two toes, still sticking out from\nunder a block of wood.\"\n\nDorothy looked, and gave a little cry of fright. There, indeed, just\nunder the corner of the great beam the house rested on, two feet were\nsticking out, shod in silver shoes with pointed toes.\n\n\"Oh, dear! oh, dear!\" cried Dorothy, clasping her hands together in\ndismay; \"the house must have fallen on her. What ever shall we do?\"\n\n\"There is nothing to be done,\" said the little woman, calmly.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"But who was she?\" asked Dorothy.\n\n\"She was the wicked Witch of the East, as I said,\" answered the\nlittle woman. \"She has held all the Munchkins in bondage for many\nyears, making them slave for her night and day. Now they are all set\nfree, and are grateful to you for the favour.\"\n\n\"Who are the Munchkins?\" enquired Dorothy.\n\n\"They are the people who live in this land of the East, where the\nwicked Witch ruled.\"\n\n\"Are you a Munchkin?\" asked Dorothy.\n\n\"No; but I am their friend, although I live in the land of the North.\nWhen they saw the Witch of the East was dead the Munchkins sent a swift\nmessenger to me, and I came at once. I am the Witch of the North.\"\n\n\"Oh, gracious!\" cried Dorothy; \"are you a real witch?\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed;\" answered the little woman. \"But I am a good witch, and\nthe people love me. I am not as powerful as the wicked Witch was who\nruled here, or I should have set the people free myself.\"\n\n\"But I thought all witches were wicked,\" said the girl, who was half\nfrightened at facing a real witch.\n\n\"Oh, no; that is a great mistake. There were only four witches in all\nthe Land of Oz, and two of them, those who live in the North and the\nSouth, are good witches. I know this is true, for I am one of them\nmyself, and cannot be mistaken. Those who dwelt in the East and the\nWest were, indeed, wicked witches; but now that you have killed one\nof them, there is but one wicked Witch in all the Land of Oz--the one\nwho lives in the West.\"\n\n\"But,\" said Dorothy, after a moment's thought, \"Aunt Em has told me\nthat the witches were all dead--years and years ago.\"\n\n\"Who is Aunt Em?\" inquired the little old woman.\n\n\"She is my aunt who lives in Kansas, where I came from.\"\n\nThe Witch of the North seemed to think for a time, with her head\nbowed and her eyes upon the ground. Then she looked up and said,\n\n\"I do not know where Kansas is, for I have never heard that country\nmentioned before. But tell me, is it a civilized country?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes;\" replied Dorothy.\n\n\"Then that accounts for it. In the civilized countries I believe\nthere are no witches left; nor wizards, nor sorceresses, nor\nmagicians. But, you see, the Land of Oz has never been civilized, for\nwe are cut off from all the rest of the world. Therefore we still\nhave witches and wizards amongst us.\"\n\n\"Who are the Wizards?\" asked Dorothy.\n\n\"Oz himself is the Great Wizard,\" answered the Witch, sinking her\nvoice to a whisper. \"He is more powerful than all the rest of us\ntogether. He lives in the City of Emeralds.\"\n\nDorothy was going to ask another question, but just then the Munchkins,\nwho had been standing silently by, gave a loud shout and pointed to the\ncorner of the house where the Wicked Witch had been lying.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"What is it?\" asked the little old woman; and looked, and began\nto laugh. The feet of the dead Witch had disappeared entirely and\nnothing was left but the silver shoes.\n\n\"She was so old,\" explained the Witch of the North, \"that she dried\nup quickly in the sun. That is the end of her. But the silver shoes\nare yours, and you shall have them to wear.\" She reached down and\npicked up the shoes, and after shaking the dust out of them handed\nthem to Dorothy.\n\n\"The Witch of the East was proud of those silver shoes,\" said one of\nthe Munchkins; \"and there is some charm connected with them; but what\nit is we never knew.\"\n\nDorothy carried the shoes into the house and placed them on the\ntable. Then she came out again to the Munchkins and said,\n\n\"I am anxious to get back to my Aunt and Uncle, for I am sure they\nwill worry about me. Can you help me find my way?\"\n\nThe Munchkins and the Witch first looked at one another, and then at\nDorothy, and then shook their heads.\n\n\"At the East, not far from here,\" said one, \"there is a great desert,\nand none could live to cross it.\"\n\n\"It is the same at the South,\" said another, \"for I have been there\nand seen it. The South is the country of the Quadlings.\"\n\n\"I am told,\" said the third man, \"that it is the same at the West. And\nthat country, where the Winkies live, is ruled by the wicked Witch of\nthe West, who would make you her slave if you passed her way.\"\n\n\"The North is my home,\" said the old lady, \"and at its edge is the\nsame great desert that surrounds this land of Oz. I'm afraid, my\ndear, you will have to live with us.\"\n\nDorothy began to sob, at this, for she felt lonely among all\nthese strange people. Her tears seemed to grieve the kind-hearted\nMunchkins, for they immediately took out their handkerchiefs and\nbegan to weep also. As for the little old woman, she took off her\ncap and balanced the point on the end of her nose, while she counted\n\"one, two, three\" in a solemn voice. At once the cap changed to a\nslate, on which was written in big, white chalk marks:\n\n\"LET DOROTHY GO TO THE CITY OF EMERALDS.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe little old woman took the slate from her nose, and, having read\nthe words on it, asked,\n\n\"Is your name Dorothy, my dear?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered the child, looking up and drying her tears.\n\n\"Then you must go to the City of Emeralds. Perhaps Oz will help you.\"\n\n\"Where is this City?\" asked Dorothy.\n\n\"It is exactly in the center of the country, and is ruled by Oz, the\nGreat Wizard I told you of.\"\n\n\"Is he a good man?\" enquired the girl, anxiously.\n\n\"He is a good Wizard. Whether he is a man or not I cannot tell, for I\nhave never seen him.\"\n\n\"How can I get there?\" asked Dorothy.\n\n\"You must walk. It is a long journey, through a country that is\nsometimes pleasant and sometimes dark and terrible. However, I will\nuse all the magic arts I know of to keep you from harm.\"\n\n\"Won't you go with me?\" pleaded the girl, who had begun to look upon\nthe little old woman as her only friend.\n\n\"No, I cannot do that,\" she replied; \"but I will give you my kiss,\nand no one will dare injure a person who has been kissed by the Witch\nof the North.\"\n\nShe came close to Dorothy and kissed her gently on the forehead.\nWhere her lips touched the girl they left a round, shining mark, as\nDorothy found out soon after.\n\n\"The road to the City of Emeralds is paved with yellow brick,\" said the\nWitch; \"so you cannot miss it. When you get to Oz do not be afraid of\nhim, but tell your story and ask him to help you. Good-bye, my dear.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe three Munchkins bowed low to her and wished her a pleasant\njourney, after which they walked away through the trees. The Witch\ngave Dorothy a friendly little nod, whirled around on her left heel\nthree times, and straightway disappeared, much to the surprise of\nlittle Toto, who barked after her loudly enough when she had gone,\nbecause he had been afraid even to growl while she stood by.\n\nBut Dorothy, knowing her to be a witch, had expected her to disappear\nin just that way, and was not surprised in the least.\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter III How Dorothy saved the Scarecrow.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nWhen Dorothy was left alone she began to feel hungry. So she went\nto the cupboard and cut herself some bread, which she spread with\nbutter. She gave some to Toto, and taking a pail from the shelf\nshe carried it down to the little brook and filled it with clear,\nsparkling water. Toto ran over to the trees and began to bark at the\nbirds sitting there. Dorothy went to get him, and saw such delicious\nfruit hanging from the branches that she gathered some of it, finding\nit just what she wanted to help out her breakfast.\n\nThen she went back to the house, and having helped herself and Toto\nto a good drink of the cool, clear water, she set about making ready\nfor the journey to the City of Emeralds.\n\nDorothy had only one other dress, but that happened to be clean and\nwas hanging on a peg beside her bed. It was gingham, with checks\nof white and blue; and although the blue was somewhat faded with\nmany washings, it was still a pretty frock. The girl washed herself\ncarefully, dressed herself in the clean gingham, and tied her pink\nsunbonnet on her head. She took a little basket and filled it with\nbread from the cupboard, laying a white cloth over the top. Then she\nlooked down at her feet and noticed how old and worn her shoes were.\n\n\"They surely will never do for a long journey, Toto,\" she said. And\nToto looked up into her face with his little black eyes and wagged\nhis tail to show he knew what she meant.\n\nAt that moment Dorothy saw lying on the table the silver shoes that\nhad belonged to the Witch of the East.\n\n\"I wonder if they will fit me,\" she said to Toto. \"They would be just\nthe thing to take a long walk in, for they could not wear out.\"\n\nShe took off her old leather shoes and tried on the silver ones,\nwhich fitted her as well as if they had been made for her.\n\nFinally she picked up her basket.\n\n\"Come along, Toto,\" she said, \"we will go to the Emerald City and ask\nthe great Oz how to get back to Kansas again.\"\n\nShe closed the door, locked it, and put the key carefully in the\npocket of her dress. And so, with Toto trotting along soberly behind\nher, she started on her journey.\n\nThere were several roads near by, but it did not take her long to\nfind the one paved with yellow brick. Within a short time she was\nwalking briskly toward the Emerald City, her silver shoes tinkling\nmerrily on the hard, yellow roadbed. The sun shone bright and the\nbirds sang sweet and Dorothy did not feel nearly as bad as you might\nthink a little girl would who had been suddenly whisked away from her\nown country and set down in the midst of a strange land.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nShe was surprised, as she walked along, to see how pretty the country\nwas about her. There were neat fences at the sides of the road,\npainted a dainty blue color, and beyond them were fields of grain and\nvegetables in abundance. Evidently the Munchkins were good farmers\nand able to raise large crops. Once in a while she would pass a\nhouse, and the people came out to look at her and bow low as she\nwent by; for everyone knew she had been the means of destroying the\nwicked witch and setting them free from bondage. The houses of the\nMunchkins were odd looking dwellings, for each was round, with a big\ndome for a roof. All were painted blue, for in this country of the\nEast blue was the favorite color.\n\nTowards evening, when Dorothy was tired with her long walk and began\nto wonder where she should pass the night, she came to a house rather\nlarger than the rest. On the green lawn before it many men and women\nwere dancing. Five little fiddlers played as loudly as possible and\nthe people were laughing and singing, while a big table near by was\nloaded with delicious fruits and nuts, pies and cakes, and many other\ngood things to eat.\n\nThe people greeted Dorothy kindly, and invited her to supper and to\npass the night with them; for this was the home of one of the richest\nMunchkins in the land, and his friends were gathered with him to\ncelebrate their freedom from the bondage of the wicked witch.\n\nDorothy ate a hearty supper and was waited upon by the rich Munchkin\nhimself, whose name was Boq. Then she sat down upon a settee and\nwatched the people dance.\n\nWhen Boq saw her silver shoes he said,\n\n\"You must be a great sorceress.\"\n\n\"Why?\" asked the girl.\n\n\"Because you wear silver shoes and have killed the wicked witch.\nBesides, you have white in your frock, and only witches and\nsorceresses wear white.\"\n\n[Illustration: \"_You must be a great sorceress._\"]\n\n\"My dress is blue and white checked,\" said Dorothy, smoothing out the\nwrinkles in it.\n\n\"It is kind of you to wear that,\" said Boq. \"Blue is the color of\nthe Munchkins, and white is the witch color; so we know you are a\nfriendly witch.\"\n\nDorothy did not know what to say to this, for all the people seemed\nto think her a witch, and she knew very well she was only an ordinary\nlittle girl who had come by the chance of a cyclone into a strange land.\n\nWhen she had tired watching the dancing, Boq led her into the house,\nwhere he gave her a room with a pretty bed in it. The sheets were\nmade of blue cloth, and Dorothy slept soundly in them till morning,\nwith Toto curled up on the blue rug beside her.\n\nShe ate a hearty breakfast, and watched a wee Munchkin baby, who\nplayed with Toto and pulled his tail and crowed and laughed in a way\nthat greatly amused Dorothy. Toto was a fine curiosity to all the\npeople, for they had never seen a dog before.\n\n\"How far is it to the Emerald City?\" the girl asked.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"I do not know,\" answered Boq, gravely, \"for I have never been there.\nIt is better for people to keep away from Oz, unless they have\nbusiness with him. But it is a long way to the Emerald City, and it\nwill take you many days. The country here is rich and pleasant, but\nyou must pass through rough and dangerous places before you reach the\nend of your journey.\"\n\nThis worried Dorothy a little, but she knew that only the great Oz\ncould help her get to Kansas again, so she bravely resolved not to\nturn back.\n\nShe bade her friends good-bye, and again started along the road of\nyellow brick. When she had gone several miles she thought she would\nstop to rest, and so climbed to the top of the fence beside the road\nand sat down. There was a great cornfield beyond the fence, and not\nfar away she saw a Scarecrow, placed high on a pole to keep the birds\nfrom the ripe corn.\n\nDorothy leaned her chin upon her hand and gazed thoughtfully at the\nScarecrow. Its head was a small sack stuffed with straw, with eyes,\nnose and mouth painted on it to represent a face. An old, pointed\nblue hat, that had belonged to some Munchkin, was perched on this\nhead, and the rest of the figure was a blue suit of clothes, worn and\nfaded, which had also been stuffed with straw. On the feet were some\nold boots with blue tops, such as every man wore in this country, and\nthe figure was raised above the stalks of corn by means of the pole\nstuck up its back.\n\n[Illustration: \"_Dorothy gazed thoughtfully at the Scarecrow._\"]\n\nWhile Dorothy was looking earnestly into the queer, painted face of\nthe Scarecrow, she was surprised to see one of the eyes slowly wink\nat her. She thought she must have been mistaken, at first, for none of\nthe scarecrows in Kansas ever wink; but presently the figure nodded its\nhead to her in a friendly way. Then she climbed down from the fence and\nwalked up to it, while Toto ran around the pole and barked.\n\n\"Good day,\" said the Scarecrow, in a rather husky voice.\n\n\"Did you speak?\" asked the girl, in wonder.\n\n\"Certainly,\" answered the Scarecrow; \"how do you do?\"\n\n\"I'm pretty well, thank you,\" replied Dorothy, politely; \"how do you\ndo?\"\n\n\"I'm not feeling well,\" said the Scarecrow, with a smile, \"for it is\nvery tedious being perched up here night and day to scare away crows.\"\n\n\"Can't you get down?\" asked Dorothy.\n\n\"No, for this pole is stuck up my back. If you will please take away\nthe pole I shall be greatly obliged to you.\"\n\nDorothy reached up both arms and lifted the figure off the pole; for,\nbeing stuffed with straw, it was quite light.\n\n\"Thank you very much,\" said the Scarecrow, when he had been set down\non the ground. \"I feel like a new man.\"\n\nDorothy was puzzled at this, for it sounded queer to hear a stuffed\nman speak, and to see him bow and walk along beside her.\n\n\"Who are you?\" asked the Scarecrow, when he had stretched himself and\nyawned, \"and where are you going?\"\n\n\"My name is Dorothy,\" said the girl, \"and I am going to the Emerald\nCity, to ask the great Oz to send me back to Kansas.\"\n\n\"Where is the Emerald City?\" he enquired; \"and who is Oz?\"\n\n\"Why, don't you know?\" she returned, in surprise.\n\n\"No, indeed; I don't know anything. You see, I am stuffed, so I have\nno brains at all,\" he answered, sadly.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Oh,\" said Dorothy; \"I'm awfully sorry for you.\"\n\n\"Do you think,\" he asked, \"If I go to the Emerald City with you, that\nthe great Oz would give me some brains?\"\n\n\"I cannot tell,\" she returned; \"but you may come with me, if you\nlike. If Oz will not give you any brains you will be no worse off\nthan you are now.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" said the Scarecrow. \"You see,\" he continued,\nconfidentially, \"I don't mind my legs and arms and body being stuffed,\nbecause I cannot get hurt. If anyone treads on my toes or sticks a\npin into me, it doesn't matter, for I cant feel it. But I do not want\npeople to call me a fool, and if my head stays stuffed with straw\ninstead of with brains, as yours is, how am I ever to know anything?\"\n\n\"I understand how you feel,\" said the little girl, who was truly\nsorry for him. \"If you will come with me I'll ask Oz to do all he can\nfor you.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" he answered, gratefully.\n\nThey walked back to the road, Dorothy helped him over the fence, and\nthey started along the path of yellow brick for the Emerald City.\n\nToto did not like this addition to the party, at first. He smelled\naround the stuffed man as if he suspected there might be a nest of\nrats in the straw, and he often growled in an unfriendly way at the\nScarecrow.\n\n\"Don't mind Toto,\" said Dorothy, to her new friend; \"he never bites.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm not afraid,\" replied the Scarecrow, \"he can't hurt the\nstraw. Do let me carry that basket for you. I shall not mind it,\nfor I can't get tired. I'll tell you a secret,\" he continued, as he\nwalked along; \"there is only one thing in the world I am afraid of.\"\n\n\"What is that?\" asked Dorothy; \"the Munchkin farmer who made you?\"\n\n\"No,\" answered the Scarecrow; \"it's a lighted match.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter IV. The Road through the Forest.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nAfter a few hours the road began to be rough, and the walking grew so\ndifficult that the Scarecrow often stumbled over the yellow brick,\nwhich were here very uneven. Sometimes, indeed, they were broken or\nmissing altogether, leaving holes that Toto jumped across and Dorothy\nwalked around. As for the Scarecrow, having no brains he walked\nstraight ahead, and so stepped into the holes and fell at full length\non the hard bricks. It never hurt him, however, and Dorothy would\npick him up and set him upon his feet again, while he joined her in\nlaughing merrily at his own mishap.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe farms were not nearly so well cared for here as they were farther\nback. There were fewer houses and fewer fruit trees, and the farther\nthey went the more dismal and lonesome the country became.\n\nAt noon they sat down by the roadside, near a little brook, and\nDorothy opened her basket and got out some bread. She offered a piece\nto the Scarecrow, but he refused.\n\n\"I am never hungry,\" he said; \"and it is a lucky thing I am not. For\nmy mouth is only painted, and if I should cut a hole in it so I could\neat, the straw I am stuffed with would come out, and that would spoil\nthe shape of my head.\"\n\nDorothy saw at once that this was true, so she only nodded and went\non eating her bread.\n\n\"Tell me something about yourself, and the country you came from,\"\nsaid the Scarecrow, when she had finished her dinner. So she told\nhim all about Kansas, and how gray everything was there, and how\nthe cyclone had carried her to this queer land of Oz. The Scarecrow\nlistened carefully, and said,\n\n\"I cannot understand why you should wish to leave this beautiful\n\n### Summary:\n\n", "answer": "Dorothy lived on the great and desolate Kansas prairie with her Uncle Henry and her Aunt Em. They had a very small house and Dorothy had a little bed in the corner of the single room. There was a small hole in the floor that served as a cyclone cellar. Everywhere Dorothy looked was flat and gray. The sun and wind were harsh and turned the once pretty and young Aunt Em into a hardened old woman. Uncle Henry never smiled either, and when Dorothy laughed Aunt Em looked surprised. What made Dorothy laugh was her little dog Toto; she was amused by him and they played all day long. There was no room for laughter this day, however. Uncle Henry cried out that there was a cyclone coming and ran to take care of the cows and horses. Aunt Em rushed into the cellar and screamed for Dorothy to follow, but the girl tried to get Toto out from under her bed. Suddenly the house whirled around in the air and rose higher and higher until it was at the top of the cyclone. It was carried miles away and rocked Dorothy and Toto gently, although the darkness and wind were horrible to behold. Once Toto even fell out of the trap door, but the pressure kept him aloft and Dorothy was able to grab him back inside and shut the trapdoor. As the hours went by, she decided to wait to see what happened and not worry; she soon fell asleep. When Dorothy awoke she saw bright sunshine flooding the room. She was even more shocked by the beautiful land the house had settled in: there were stunning flowers, tall trees, a bubbling brook, and strange and colorful birds. She observed three small men wearing bright blue clothing and a woman in white coming towards her. The men were no bigger than Dorothy despite being many years older. The woman - The Witch of the North - was also very old but spoke sweetly to Dorothy, welcoming her to the land of the Munchkins and expressing her gratitude for Dorothy's killing of the Wicked Witch of the East and setting her people free from slavery. Dorothy was confused and said she did not recall killing anyone. The Witch of the North said it was her house that had landed on the Witch. From underneath the house a pair of legs and feet clad in silver shoes stuck out. The Witch of the North said that the little men, the Munchkins, were previously held in slavery. Although she was a witch herself, she was not powerful enough to stop the Witch of the East. Dorothy replied that she thought all witches were bad, but the Witch of the North explained that the Witches of the North and South were good and the Witches of the East and West were evil. The Witch of the North also mentioned wizards, and whispered \"Oz himself is the Great Wizard.\" Before they could continue speaking, their attention was drawn to the disappearance of the Wicked Witch's feet. The sun dried up her body until only the silver shoes were left. The Witch of the North gave Dorothy the shoes, stating they belonged to her now. Dorothy inquired of her new friends how she could get back to Kansas. The Witch and Munchkins said it would be impossible to get there since the land was bordered by desert. Dorothy's tears startled and saddened the Witch, so she told her that the Wizard of Oz might know what to do. The Witch kissed Dorothy's forehead and said she would be safe from harm on her imminent journey. She told her that the road was paved in yellow brick and that she and Toto should follow it straight to Oz. When Dorothy and Toto were left alone, she changed into a white and blue gingham dress and the silver slippers, and had a lunch of bread and fruit. They began their walk, and Dorothy noted the abundant fields and the lovely blue houses of the Munchkins. She passed by a gathering of many Munchkins and had a meal with them, being personally served by the richest Munchkin himself, Boq. She was a little worried when he told her that he did not know how far away the Emerald City was because most people knew to keep away from Oz unless they had business there. As Dorothy continued her journey she came upon a Scarecrow in a field. She was surprised to see one of his eyes wink at her in a friendly way, and she helped him down from the pole that held him aloft in the field. They introduced themselves, and he asked if he could go to the Emerald City to ask Oz for brains, since \"I do not want people to call me a fool, and if my head stays stuffed with straw instead of with brains, as yours is, how am I ever to know anything?\" Dorothy agreed and the two set out on the yellow brick road. The road became rougher but it did not hurt The Scarecrow, even when he fell. The country became more \"dismal and lonesome.\" The travelers sat down for a meal and he asked her to tell him about herself. She spoke of Kansas and he marveled why she would want to go back to such a dreary place. She asked him to tell her a story, and he said he was only made yesterday and did not know many. Instead the Scarecrow spoke of how the farmer created him, painting his ears, then eyes, then his nose and mouth. The farmer and his friend left the Scarecrow alone in the field. Some birds were afraid of him but an old crow landed on him and was not fooled. The crow told him how important brains were and the Scarecrow resolved to try and find some. Dorothy and the Scarecrow continued along their way until they came to a great forest. The road went into it and they knew it must come out, but they decided to stay in a cottage so as to not walk in the dark. Dorothy fell asleep on a little pile of leaves on the floor and the Scarecrow stood by, as he did not need to sleep."}

For a long time, even with the\nutmost discretion and reticence, it would have been impossible to make\nthe facts public; but now the principal person concerned is beyond the\nreach of human law, and with due suppression the story may be told\nin such fashion as to injure no one. It records an absolutely unique\nexperience in the career both of Mr. Sherlock Holmes and of myself. The\nreader will excuse me if I conceal the date or any other fact by which\nhe might trace the actual occurrence.\n\nWe had been out for one of our evening rambles, Holmes and I, and had\nreturned about six o'clock on a cold, frosty winter's evening. As Holmes\nturned up the lamp the light fell upon a card on the table. He glanced\nat it, and then, with an ejaculation of disgust, threw it on the floor.\nI picked it up and read:--\n\n             CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON,\n                  APPLEDORE TOWERS,\n            AGENT.              HAMPSTEAD.\n\n\"Who is he?\" I asked.\n\n\"The worst man in London,\" Holmes answered, as he sat down and stretched\nhis legs before the fire. \"Is anything on the back of the card?\"\n\nI turned it over.\n\n\"Will call at 6.30--C.A.M.,\" I read.\n\n\"Hum! He's about due. Do you feel a creeping, shrinking sensation,\nWatson, when you stand before the serpents in the Zoo and see the\nslithery, gliding, venomous creatures, with their deadly eyes and\nwicked, flattened faces? Well, that's how Milverton impresses me. I've\nhad to do with fifty murderers in my career, but the worst of them never\ngave me the repulsion which I have for this fellow. And yet I can't get\nout of doing business with him--indeed, he is here at my invitation.\"\n\n\"But who is he?\"\n\n\"I'll tell you, Watson. He is the king of all the blackmailers. Heaven\nhelp the man, and still more the woman, whose secret and reputation come\ninto the power of Milverton. With a smiling face and a heart of marble\nhe will squeeze and squeeze until he has drained them dry. The fellow is\na genius in his way, and would have made his mark in some more savoury\ntrade. His method is as follows: He allows it to be known that he is\nprepared to pay very high sums for letters which compromise people of\nwealth or position. He receives these wares not only from treacherous\nvalets or maids, but frequently from genteel ruffians who have gained\nthe confidence and affection of trusting women. He deals with no niggard\nhand. I happen to know that he paid seven hundred pounds to a footman\nfor a note two lines in length, and that the ruin of a noble family was\nthe result. Everything which is in the market goes to Milverton, and\nthere are hundreds in this great city who turn white at his name. No\none knows where his grip may fall, for he is far too rich and far too\ncunning to work from hand to mouth. He will hold a card back for years\nin order to play it at the moment when the stake is best worth winning.\nI have said that he is the worst man in London, and I would ask you how\ncould one compare the ruffian who in hot blood bludgeons his mate with\nthis man, who methodically and at his leisure tortures the soul and\nwrings the nerves in order to add to his already swollen money-bags?\"\n\nI had seldom heard my friend speak with such intensity of feeling.\n\n\"But surely,\" said I, \"the fellow must be within the grasp of the law?\"\n\n\"Technically, no doubt, but practically not. What would it profit a\nwoman, for example, to get him a few months' imprisonment if her own\nruin must immediately follow? His victims dare not hit back. If ever he\nblackmailed an innocent person, then, indeed, we should have him; but he\nis as cunning as the Evil One. No, no; we must find other ways to fight\nhim.\"\n\n\"And why is he here?\"\n\n\"Because an illustrious client has placed her piteous case in my hands.\nIt is the Lady Eva Brackwell, the most beautiful DEBUTANTE of last\nseason. She is to be married in a fortnight to the Earl of Dovercourt.\nThis fiend has several imprudent letters--imprudent, Watson, nothing\nworse--which were written to an impecunious young squire in the country.\nThey would suffice to break off the match. Milverton will send the\nletters to the Earl unless a large sum of money is paid him. I have been\ncommissioned to meet him, and--to make the best terms I can.\"\n\nAt that instant there was a clatter and a rattle in the street below.\nLooking down I saw a stately carriage and pair, the brilliant lamps\ngleaming on the glossy haunches of the noble chestnuts. A footman\nopened the door, and a small, stout man in a shaggy astrachan overcoat\ndescended. A minute later he was in the room.\n\nCharles Augustus Milverton was a man of fifty, with a large,\nintellectual head, a round, plump, hairless face, a perpetual frozen\nsmile, and two keen grey eyes, which gleamed brightly from behind broad,\ngolden-rimmed glasses. There was something of Mr. Pickwick's benevolence\nin his appearance, marred only by the insincerity of the fixed smile and\nby the hard glitter of those restless and penetrating eyes. His voice\nwas as smooth and suave as his countenance, as he advanced with a plump\nlittle hand extended, murmuring his regret for having missed us at his\nfirst visit. Holmes disregarded the outstretched hand and looked at him\nwith a face of granite. Milverton's smile broadened; he shrugged his\nshoulders, removed his overcoat, folded it with great deliberation over\nthe back of a chair, and then took a seat.\n\n\"This gentleman?\" said he, with a wave in my direction. \"Is it discreet?\nIs it right?\"\n\n\"Dr. Watson is my friend and partner.\"\n\n\"Very good, Mr. Holmes. It is only in your client's interests that I\nprotested. The matter is so very delicate----\"\n\n\"Dr. Watson has already heard of it.\"\n\n\"Then we can proceed to business. You say that you are acting for Lady\nEva. Has she empowered you to accept my terms?\"\n\n\"What are your terms?\"\n\n\"Seven thousand pounds.\"\n\n\"And the alternative?\"\n\n\"My dear sir, it is painful for me to discuss it; but if the money is\nnot paid on the 14th there certainly will be no marriage on the 18th.\"\nHis insufferable smile was more complacent than ever.\n\nHolmes thought for a little.\n\n\"You appear to me,\" he said, at last, \"to be taking matters too much for\ngranted. I am, of course, familiar with the contents of these letters.\nMy client will certainly do what I may advise. I shall counsel her to\ntell her future husband the whole story and to trust to his generosity.\"\n\nMilverton chuckled.\n\n\"You evidently do not know the Earl,\" said he.\n\nFrom the baffled look upon Holmes's face I could see clearly that he\ndid.\n\n\"What harm is there in the letters?\" he asked.\n\n\"They are sprightly--very sprightly,\" Milverton answered. \"The lady\nwas a charming correspondent. But I can assure you that the Earl of\nDovercourt would fail to appreciate them. However, since you think\notherwise, we will let it rest at that. It is purely a matter of\nbusiness. If you think that it is in the best interests of your client\nthat these letters should be placed in the hands of the Earl, then you\nwould indeed be foolish to pay so large a sum of money to regain them.\"\nHe rose and seized his astrachan coat.\n\nHolmes was grey with anger and mortification.\n\n\"Wait a little,\" he said. \"You go too fast. We would certainly make\nevery effort to avoid scandal in so delicate a matter.\"\n\nMilverton relapsed into his chair.\n\n\"I was sure that you would see it in that light,\" he purred.\n\n\"At the same time,\" Holmes continued, \"Lady Eva is not a wealthy\nwoman. I assure you that two thousand pounds would be a drain upon her\nresources, and that the sum you name is utterly beyond her power. I beg,\ntherefore, that you will moderate your demands, and that you will return\nthe letters at the price I indicate, which is, I assure you, the highest\nthat you can get.\"\n\nMilverton's smile broadened and his eyes twinkled humorously.\n\n\"I am aware that what you say is true about the lady's resources,\" said\nhe. \"At the same time, you must admit that the occasion of a lady's\nmarriage is a very suitable time for her friends and relatives to\nmake some little effort upon her behalf. They may hesitate as to an\nacceptable wedding present. Let me assure them that this little bundle\nof letters would give more joy than all the candelabra and butter-dishes\nin London.\"\n\n\"It is impossible,\" said Holmes.\n\n\"Dear me, dear me, how unfortunate!\" cried Milverton, taking out a bulky\npocket-book. \"I cannot help thinking that ladies are ill-advised in\nnot making an effort. Look at this!\" He held up a little note with a\ncoat-of-arms upon the envelope. \"That belongs to--well, perhaps it is\nhardly fair to tell the name until to-morrow morning. But at that time\nit will be in the hands of the lady's husband. And all because she will\nnot find a beggarly sum which she could get by turning her diamonds\ninto paste. It IS such a pity. Now, you remember the sudden end of the\nengagement between the Honourable Miss Miles and Colonel Dorking? Only\ntwo days before the wedding there was a paragraph in the MORNING POST\nto say that it was all off. And why? It is almost incredible, but\nthe absurd sum of twelve hundred pounds would have settled the whole\nquestion. Is it not pitiful? And here I find you, a man of sense,\nboggling about terms when your client's future and honour are at stake.\nYou surprise me, Mr. Holmes.\"\n\n\"What I say is true,\" Holmes answered. \"The money cannot be found.\nSurely it is better for you to take the substantial sum which I offer\nthan to ruin this woman's career, which can profit you in no way?\"\n\n\"There you make a mistake, Mr. Holmes. An exposure would profit me\nindirectly to a considerable extent. I have eight or ten similar cases\nmaturing. If it was circulated among them that I had made a severe\nexample of the Lady Eva I should find all of them much more open to\nreason. You see my point?\"\n\nHolmes sprang from his chair.\n\n\"Get behind him, Watson! Don't let him out! Now, sir, let us see the\ncontents of that note-book.\"\n\nMilverton had glided as quick as a rat to the side of the room, and\nstood with his back against the wall.\n\n\"Mr. Holmes, Mr. Holmes,\" he said, turning the front of his coat and\nexhibiting the butt of a large revolver, which projected from the inside\npocket. \"I have been expecting you to do something original. This has\nbeen done so often, and what good has ever come from it? I assure you\nthat I am armed to the teeth, and I am perfectly prepared to use my\nweapons, knowing that the law will support me. Besides, your supposition\nthat I would bring the letters here in a note-book is entirely mistaken.\nI would do nothing so foolish. And now, gentlemen, I have one or two\nlittle interviews this evening, and it is a long drive to Hampstead.\"\nHe stepped forward, took up his coat, laid his hand on his revolver, and\nturned to the door. I picked up a chair, but Holmes shook his head and\nI laid it down again. With bow, a smile, and a twinkle Milverton was out\nof the room, and a few moments after we heard the slam of the carriage\ndoor and the rattle of the wheels as he drove away.\n\nHolmes sat motionless by the fire, his hands buried deep in his trouser\npockets, his chin sunk upon his breast, his eyes fixed upon the glowing\nembers. For half an hour he was silent and still. Then, with the gesture\nof a man who has taken his decision, he sprang to his feet and passed\ninto his bedroom. A little later a rakish young workman with a goatee\nbeard and a swagger lit his clay pipe at the lamp before descending into\nthe street. \"I'll be back some time, Watson,\" said he, and vanished into\nthe night. I understood that he had opened his campaign against Charles\nAugustus Milverton; but I little dreamed the strange shape which that\ncampaign was destined to take.\n\nFor some days Holmes came and went at all hours in this attire, but\nbeyond a remark that his time was spent at Hampstead, and that it was\nnot wasted, I knew nothing of what he was doing. At last, however, on\na wild, tempestuous evening, when the wind screamed and rattled against\nthe windows, he returned from his last expedition, and having removed\nhis disguise he sat before the fire and laughed heartily in his silent\ninward fashion.\n\n\"You would not call me a marrying man, Watson?\"\n\n\"No, indeed!\"\n\n\"You'll be interested to hear that I am engaged.\"\n\n\"My dear fellow! I congrat----\"\n\n\"To Milverton's housemaid.\"\n\n\"Good heavens, Holmes!\"\n\n\"I wanted information, Watson.\"\n\n\"Surely you have gone too far?\"\n\n\"It was a most necessary step. I am a plumber with a rising business,\nEscott by name. I have walked out with her each evening, and I have\ntalked with her. Good heavens, those talks! However, I have got all I\nwanted. I know Milverton's house as I know the palm of my hand.\"\n\n\"But the girl, Holmes?\"\n\nHe shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"You can't help it, my dear Watson. You must play your cards as best you\ncan when such a stake is on the table. However, I rejoice to say that\nI have a hated rival who will certainly cut me out the instant that my\nback is turned. What a splendid night it is!\"\n\n\"You like this weather?\"\n\n\"It suits my purpose. Watson, I mean to burgle Milverton's house\nto-night.\"\n\nI had a catching of the breath, and my skin went cold at the words,\nwhich were slowly uttered in a tone of concentrated resolution. As a\nflash of lightning in the night shows up in an instant every detail of\na wide landscape, so at one glance I seemed to see every possible result\nof such an action--the detection, the capture, the honoured career\nending in irreparable failure and disgrace, my friend himself lying at\nthe mercy of the odious Milverton.\n\n\"For Heaven's sake, Holmes, think what you are doing,\" I cried.\n\n\"My dear fellow, I have given it every consideration. I am never\nprecipitate in my actions, nor would I adopt so energetic and indeed so\ndangerous a course if any other were possible. Let us look at the matter\nclearly and fairly. I suppose that you will admit that the action is\nmorally justifiable, though technically criminal. To burgle his house\nis no more than to forcibly take his pocket-book--an action in which you\nwere prepared to aid me.\"\n\nI turned it over in my mind.\n\n\"Yes,\" I said; \"it is morally justifiable so long as our object is to\ntake no articles save those which are used for an illegal purpose.\"\n\n\"Exactly. Since it is morally justifiable I have only to consider the\nquestion of personal risk. Surely a gentleman should not lay much stress\nupon this when a lady is in most desperate need of his help?\"\n\n\"You will be in such a false position.\"\n\n\"Well, that is part of the risk. There is no other possible way of\nregaining these letters. The unfortunate lady has not the money, and\nthere are none of her people in whom she could confide. To-morrow is\nthe last day of grace, and unless we can get the letters to-night this\nvillain will be as good as his word and will bring about her ruin. I\nmust, therefore, abandon my client to her fate or I must play this\nlast card. Between ourselves, Watson, it's a sporting duel between\nthis fellow Milverton and me. He had, as you saw, the best of the first\nexchanges; but my self-respect and my reputation are concerned to fight\nit to a finish.\"\n\n\"Well, I don't like it; but I suppose it must be,\" said I. \"When do we\nstart?\"\n\n\"You are not coming.\"\n\n\"Then you are not going,\" said I. \"I give you my word of honour--and\nI never broke it in my life--that I will take a cab straight to the\npolice-station and give you away unless you let me share this adventure\nwith you.\"\n\n\"You can't help me.\"\n\n\"How do you know that? You can't tell what may happen. Anyway, my\nresolution is taken. Other people beside you have self-respect and even\nreputations.\"\n\nHolmes had looked annoyed, but his brow cleared, and he clapped me on\nthe shoulder.\n\n\"Well, well, my dear fellow, be it so. We have shared the same room\nfor some years, and it would be amusing if we ended by sharing the\nsame cell. You know, Watson, I don't mind confessing to you that I have\nalways had an idea that I would have made a highly efficient criminal.\nThis is the chance of my lifetime in that direction. See here!\" He took\na neat little leather case out of a drawer, and opening it he exhibited\na number of shining instruments. \"This is a first-class, up-to-date\nburgling kit, with nickel-plated jemmy, diamond-tipped glass-cutter,\nadaptable keys, and every modern improvement which the march of\ncivilization demands. Here, too, is my dark lantern. Everything is in\norder. Have you a pair of silent shoes?\"\n\n\"I have rubber-soled tennis shoes.\"\n\n\"Excellent. And a mask?\"\n\n\"I can make a couple out of black silk.\"\n\n\"I can see that you have a strong natural turn for this sort of thing.\nVery good; do you make the masks. We shall have some cold supper before\nwe start. It is now nine-thirty. At eleven we shall drive as far as\nChurch Row. It is a quarter of an hour's walk from there to Appledore\nTowers. We shall be at work before midnight. Milverton is a heavy\nsleeper and retires punctually at ten-thirty. With any luck we should be\nback here by two, with the Lady Eva's letters in my pocket.\"\n\nHolmes and I put on our dress-clothes, so that we might appear to be two\ntheatre-goers homeward bound. In Oxford Street we picked up a hansom and\ndrove to an address in Hampstead. Here we paid off our cab, and with our\ngreat-coats buttoned up, for it was bitterly cold and the wind seemed to\nblow through us, we walked along the edge of the Heath.\n\n\"It's a business that needs delicate treatment,\" said Holmes. \"These\ndocuments are contained in a safe in the fellow's study, and the study\nis the ante-room of his bed-chamber. On the other hand, like all these\nstout, little men who do themselves well, he is a plethoric sleeper.\nAgatha--that's my FIANCEE--says it is a joke in the servants' hall that\nit's impossible to wake the master. He has a secretary who is devoted to\nhis interests and never budges from the study all day. That's why we are\ngoing at night. Then he has a beast of a dog which roams the garden. I\nmet Agatha late the last two evenings, and she locks the brute up so\nas to give me a clear run. This is the house, this big one in its own\ngrounds. Through the gate--now to the right among the laurels. We might\nput on our masks here, I think. You see, there is not a glimmer of light\nin any of the windows, and everything is working splendidly.\"\n\nWith our black silk face-coverings, which turned us into two of the most\ntruculent figures in London, we stole up to the silent, gloomy house.\nA sort of tiled veranda extended along one side of it, lined by several\nwindows and two doors.\n\n\"That's his bedroom,\" Holmes whispered. \"This door opens straight into\nthe study. It would suit us best, but it is bolted as well as locked,\nand we should make too much noise getting in. Come round here. There's a\ngreenhouse which opens into the drawing-room.\"\n\nThe place was locked, but Holmes removed a circle of glass and turned\nthe key from the inside. An instant afterwards he had closed the door\nbehind us, and we had become felons in the eyes of the law. The thick,\nwarm air of the conservatory and the rich, choking fragrance of exotic\nplants took us by the throat. He seized my hand in the darkness and led\nme swiftly past banks of shrubs which brushed against our faces. Holmes\nhad remarkable powers, carefully cultivated, of seeing in the dark.\nStill holding my hand in one of his he opened a door, and I was vaguely\nconscious that we had entered a large room in which a cigar had been\nsmoked not long before. He felt his way among the furniture, opened\nanother door, and closed it behind us. Putting out my hand I felt\nseveral coats hanging from the wall, and I understood that I was in a\npassage. We passed along it, and Holmes very gently opened a door upon\nthe right-hand side. Something rushed out at us and my heart sprang into\nmy mouth, but I could have laughed when I realized that it was the cat.\nA fire was burning in this new room, and again the air was heavy with\ntobacco smoke. Holmes entered on tiptoe, waited for me to follow, and\nthen very gently closed the door. We were in Milverton's study, and a\nPORTIERE at the farther side showed the entrance to his bedroom.\n\nIt was a good fire, and the room was illuminated by it. Near the door I\nsaw the gleam of an electric switch, but it was unnecessary, even if it\nhad been safe, to turn it on. At one side of the fireplace was a heavy\ncurtain, which covered the bay window we had seen from outside. On the\nother side was the door which communicated with the veranda. A desk\nstood in the centre, with a turning chair of shining red leather.\nOpposite was a large bookcase, with a marble bust of Athene on the top.\nIn the corner between the bookcase and the wall there stood a tall green\nsafe, the firelight flashing back from the polished brass knobs upon its\nface. Holmes stole across and looked at it. Then he crept to the door of\nthe bedroom, and stood with slanting head listening intently. No sound\ncame from within. Meanwhile it had struck me that it would be wise\nto secure our retreat through the outer door, so I examined it. To my\namazement it was neither locked nor bolted! I touched Holmes on the arm,\nand he turned his masked face in that direction. I saw him start, and he\nwas evidently as surprised as I.\n\n\"I don't like it,\" he whispered, putting his lips to my very ear. \"I\ncan't quite make it out. Anyhow, we have no time to lose.\"\n\n\"Can I do anything?\"\n\n\"Yes; stand by the door. If you hear anyone come, bolt it on the inside,\nand we can get away as we came. If they come the other way, we can\nget through the door if our job is done, or hide behind these window\ncurtains if it is not. Do you understand?\"\n\nI nodded and stood by the door. My first feeling of fear had passed\naway, and I thrilled now with a keener zest than I had ever enjoyed when\nwe were the defenders of the law instead of its defiers. The high object\nof our mission, the consciousness that it was unselfish and chivalrous,\nthe villainous character of our opponent, all added to the sporting\ninterest of the adventure. Far from feeling guilty, I rejoiced and\nexulted in our dangers. With a glow of admiration I watched Holmes\nunrolling his case of instruments and choosing his tool with the calm,\nscientific accuracy of a surgeon who performs a delicate operation. I\nknew that the opening of safes was a particular hobby with him, and I\nunderstood the joy which it gave him to be confronted with this green\nand gold monster, the dragon which held in its maw the reputations of\nmany fair ladies. Turning up the cuffs of his dress-coat--he had placed\nhis overcoat on a chair--Holmes laid out two drills, a jemmy, and\nseveral skeleton keys. I stood at the centre door with my eyes glancing\nat each of the others, ready for any emergency; though, indeed, my plans\nwere somewhat vague as to what I should do if we were interrupted. For\nhalf an hour Holmes worked with concentrated energy, laying down one\ntool, picking up another, handling each with the strength and delicacy\nof the trained mechanic. Finally I heard a click, the broad green door\nswung open, and inside I had a glimpse of a number of paper packets,\neach tied, sealed, and inscribed. Holmes picked one out, but it was hard\nto read by the flickering fire, and he drew out his little dark lantern,\nfor it was too dangerous, with Milverton in the next room, to switch on\nthe electric light. Suddenly I saw him halt, listen intently, and then\nin an instant he had swung the door of the safe to, picked up his\ncoat, stuffed his tools into the pockets, and darted behind the window\ncurtain, motioning me to do the same.\n\nIt was only when I had joined him there that I heard what had alarmed\nhis quicker senses. There was a noise somewhere within the house. A door\nslammed in the distance. Then a confused, dull murmur broke itself into\nthe measured thud of heavy footsteps rapidly approaching. They were in\nthe passage outside the room. They paused at the door. The door opened.\nThere was a sharp snick as the electric light was turned on. The door\nclosed once more, and the pungent reek of a strong cigar was borne\nto our nostrils. Then the footsteps continued backwards and forwards,\nbackwards and forwards, within a few yards of us. Finally, there was a\ncreak from a chair, and the footsteps ceased. Then a key clicked in a\nlock and I heard the rustle of papers.\n\nSo far I had not dared to look out, but now I gently parted the division\nof the curtains in front of me and peeped through. From the pressure\nof Holmes's shoulder against mine I knew that he was sharing my\nobservations. Right in front of us, and almost within our reach, was the\nbroad, rounded back of Milverton. It was evident that we had entirely\nmiscalculated his movements, that he had never been to his bedroom,\nbut that he had been sitting up in some smoking or billiard room in the\nfarther wing of the house, the windows of which we had not seen. His\nbroad, grizzled head, with its shining patch of baldness, was in the\nimmediate foreground of our vision. He was leaning far back in the red\nleather chair, his legs outstretched, a long black cigar projecting\nat an angle from his mouth. He wore a semi-military smoking jacket,\nclaret-coloured, with a black velvet collar. In his hand he held a long\nlegal document, which he was reading in an indolent fashion, blowing\nrings of tobacco smoke from his lips as he did so. There was no promise\nof a speedy departure in his composed bearing and his comfortable\nattitude.\n\nI felt Holmes's hand steal into mine and give me a reassuring shake, as\nif to say that the situation was within his powers and that he was\neasy in his mind. I was not sure whether he had seen what was only too\nobvious from my position, that the door of the safe was imperfectly\nclosed, and that Milverton might at any moment observe it. In my own\nmind I had determined that if I were sure, from the rigidity of his\ngaze, that it had caught his eye, I would at once spring out, throw my\ngreat-coat over his head, pinion him, and leave the rest to Holmes. But\nMilverton never looked up. He was languidly interested by the papers in\nhis hand, and page after page was turned as he followed the argument of\nthe lawyer. At least, I thought, when he has finished the document and\nthe cigar he will go to his room; but before he had reached the end of\neither there came a remarkable development which turned our thoughts\ninto quite another channel.\n\nSeveral times I had observed that Milverton looked at his watch, and\nonce he had risen and sat down again, with a gesture of impatience. The\nidea, however, that he might have an appointment at so strange an\nhour never occurred to me until a faint sound reached my ears from\nthe veranda outside. Milverton dropped his papers and sat rigid in his\nchair. The sound was repeated, and then there came a gentle tap at the\ndoor. Milverton rose and opened it.\n\n\"Well,\" said he, curtly, \"you are nearly half an hour late.\"\n\nSo this was the explanation of the unlocked door and of the nocturnal\nvigil of Milverton. There was the gentle rustle of a woman's dress. I\nhad closed the slit between the curtains as Milverton's face had turned\nin our direction, but now I ventured very carefully to open it once\nmore. He had resumed his seat, the cigar still projecting at an insolent\nangle from the corner of his mouth. In front of him, in the full glare\nof the electric light, there stood a tall, slim, dark woman, a veil over\nher face, a mantle drawn round her chin. Her breath came quick and fast,\nand every inch of the lithe figure was quivering with strong emotion.\n\n\"Well,\" said Milverton, \"you've made me lose a good night's rest,\nmy dear. I hope you'll prove worth it. You couldn't come any other\ntime--eh?\"\n\nThe woman shook her head.\n\n\"Well, if you couldn't you couldn't. If the Countess is a hard mistress\nyou have your chance to get level with her now. Bless the girl, what are\nyou shivering about? That's right! Pull yourself together! Now, let us\nget down to business.\" He took a note from the drawer of his desk. \"You\nsay that you have five letters which compromise the Countess d'Albert.\nYou want to sell them. I want to buy them. So far so good. It only\nremains to fix a price. I should want to inspect the letters, of course.\nIf they are really good specimens--Great heavens, is it you?\"\n\nThe woman without a word had raised her veil and dropped the mantle\nfrom her chin. It was a dark, handsome, clear-cut face which confronted\nMilverton, a face with a curved nose, strong, dark eyebrows shading\nhard, glittering eyes, and a straight, thin-lipped mouth set in a\ndangerous smile.\n\n\"It is I,\" she said; \"the woman whose life you have ruined.\"\n\nMilverton laughed, but fear vibrated in his voice. \"You were so very\nobstinate,\" said he. \"Why did you drive me to such extremities? I\nassure you I wouldn't hurt a fly of my own accord, but every man has his\nbusiness, and what was I to do? I put the price well within your means.\nYou would not pay.\"\n\n\"So you sent the letters to my husband, and he--the noblest gentleman\nthat ever lived, a man whose boots I was never worthy to lace--he broke\nhis gallant heart and died. You remember that last night when I came\nthrough that door I begged and prayed you for mercy, and you laughed in\nmy face as you are trying to laugh now, only your coward heart cannot\nkeep your lips from twitching? Yes, you never thought to see me here\nagain, but it was that night which taught me how I could meet you face\nto face\n\n### Summary:\n\n", "answer": "Watson let's us know that this is a very unusual story and it has to be shrouded in some secrecy in order to protect people's identities. Color us intrigued, Watson. One night Holmes comes in and tells Watson they're about to have a visitor. The visitor is a Charles Augustus Milverton, a professional blackmailer who is scum of the earth in Holmes's opinion. Holmes has been hired by a Lady Eva Blackwell to deal with Milverton, who is blackmailing her with some old love letters on the eve of her wedding to a super-rich nobleman. Milverton comes over and is a friendly looking guy in his 50s. Not typical super-villain material. He toys with Holmes and Watson and demands a huge amount of money from Lady Eva. Holmes says she can't pay it and offers a lower amount. Milverton refuses, and Holmes tries to reason with him. Then Holmes springs up, and he and Watson grab Milverton. Milverton mocks them and says that he isn't stupid enough to carry Lady Eva's letters around with him. He mocks them some more and then leaves. Holmes and Watson just got owned. Sherlock Holmes won't be beat, though, so he gets to work. A few days later, Holmes comes in to announce that he's engaged. A confused Watson wonders if Holmes has had a mental breakdown. Turns out Holmes is fake-engaged to a maid in Milverton's house. Watson questions the morality of such an action, and Holmes brushes him off. He then announces that he pumped his fiancee for intel so that he can break in to Milverton's house. Watson is horrified. Holmes convinces Watson that their illegal actions are morally justifiable in this case, since Milverton is the Devil, or something. Watson then insists that he's coming with Holmes and Holmes argues a bit but finally says OK. He can't do anything without his wingman. Holmes points out that they can share a prison cell this way too. That night the two head off to break in to Milverton's home. They even put on bandanas to hide their faces, which is hilarious. They must've gotten burglary confused with bank robbery. They sneak in to the house and are super stealthy. Once in Milverton's study, Holmes gets out his tools to break in to Milverton's safe, and Watson stands guard. Things are going well until Holmes hears a noise. He and Watson duck behind some curtains and in walks Milverton. Oops. Holmes is totally calling off this engagement now. He got bad intel out of the bargain. Milverton chills out a while and finally a mystery woman knocks at the door. She is let in by Milverton, and he gripes that she's late. Milverton thinks she's there to buy some letters, but he then recognizes her. The lady dramatically removes her veil and then speechifies for a bit about how Milverton blackmailed her, ruined her life, caused her husband to die of a broken heart, etc. Milverton tries to throw her out, but she pulls out a gun and shoots him right in the chest. Milverton dies after some dramatic stumbling around, and the mystery lady scampers away. Holmes and Watson are stunned. Holmes recovers quickly and tosses all of Milverton's papers into the fire. He and Watson then run for it. They are nearly caught scaling a wall in the garden by the cops, who showed up after gun shots were heard. But they dynamic duo make it away safely. The next day our buddy Inspector Lestrade comes by Baker Street and fills Holmes and Watson in on Milverton's shocking murder. Two suspects were seen fleeing the scene, one who looked a bit like Watson. Holmes and Watson just shrug. They never tell anyone anything about what they did and saw. A while later they see a famous lady's picture in a shop window and realize that she's the murderer. They never tell anyone her identity though."}

The Queen of the Field Mice.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"We cannot be far from the road of yellow brick, now,\" remarked the\nScarecrow, as he stood beside the girl, \"for we have come nearly as\nfar as the river carried us away.\"\n\nThe Tin Woodman was about to reply when he heard a low growl, and\nturning his head (which worked beautifully on hinges) he saw a\nstrange beast come bounding over the grass towards them. It was,\nindeed, a great, yellow wildcat, and the Woodman thought it must be\nchasing something, for its ears were lying close to its head and its\nmouth was wide open, showing two rows of ugly teeth, while its red\neyes glowed like balls of fire. As it came nearer the Tin Woodman\nsaw that running before the beast was a little gray field-mouse, and\nalthough he had no heart he knew it was wrong for the wildcat to try\nto kill such a pretty, harmless creature.\n\nSo the Woodman raised his axe, and as the wildcat ran by he gave it a\nquick blow that cut the beast's head clean off from its body, and it\nrolled over at his feet in two pieces.\n\nThe field-mouse, now that it was freed from its enemy, stopped short;\nand coming slowly up to the Woodman it said, in a squeaky little voice,\n\n\"Oh, thank you! Thank you ever so much for saving my life.\"\n\n\"Don't speak of it, I beg of you,\" replied the Woodman. \"I have no\nheart, you know, so I am careful to help all those who may need a\nfriend, even if it happens to be only a mouse.\"\n\n\"Only a mouse!\" cried the little animal, indignantly; \"why, I am a\nQueen--the Queen of all the field-mice!\"\n\n\"Oh, indeed,\" said the Woodman, making a bow.\n\n\"Therefore you have done a great deed, as well as a brave one, in\nsaving my life,\" added the Queen.\n\nAt that moment several mice were seen running up as fast as their\nlittle legs could carry them, and when they saw their Queen they\nexclaimed,\n\n[Illustration: \"_Permit me to introduce to you her Majesty, the\nQueen._\"]\n\n\"Oh, your Majesty, we thought you would be killed! How did you manage\nto escape the great Wildcat?\" and they all bowed so low to the\nlittle Queen that they almost stood upon their heads.\n\n\"This funny tin man,\" she answered, \"killed the Wildcat and saved my\nlife. So hereafter you must all serve him, and obey his slightest wish.\"\n\n\"We will!\" cried all the mice, in a shrill chorus. And then they\nscampered in all directions, for Toto had awakened from his sleep,\nand seeing all these mice around him he gave one bark of delight and\njumped right into the middle of the group. Toto had always loved to\nchase mice when he lived in Kansas, and he saw no harm in it.\n\nBut the Tin Woodman caught the dog in his arms and held him tight,\nwhile he called to the mice: \"Come back! come back! Toto shall not\nhurt you.\"\n\nAt this the Queen of the Mice stuck her head out from a clump of\ngrass and asked, in a timid voice,\n\n\"Are you sure he will not bite us?\"\n\n\"I will not let him,\" said the Woodman; \"so do not be afraid.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nOne by one the mice came creeping back, and Toto did not bark again,\nalthough he tried to get out of the Woodman's arms, and would have\nbitten him had he not known very well he was made of tin. Finally one\nof the biggest mice spoke.\n\n\"Is there anything we can do,\" it asked, \"to repay you for saving the\nlife of our Queen?\"\n\n\"Nothing that I know of,\" answered the Woodman; but the Scarecrow,\nwho had been trying to think, but could not because his head was\nstuffed with straw, said, quickly,\n\n\"Oh, yes; you can save our friend, the Cowardly Lion, who is asleep\nin the poppy bed.\"\n\n\"A Lion!\" cried the little Queen; \"why, he would eat us all up.\"\n\n\"Oh, no;\" declared the Scarecrow; \"this Lion is a coward.\"\n\n\"Really?\" asked the Mouse.\n\n\"He says so himself,\" answered the Scarecrow, \"and he would never\nhurt anyone who is our friend. If you will help us to save him I\npromise that he shall treat you all with kindness.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said the Queen, \"we will trust you. But what shall we do?\"\n\n\"Are there many of these mice which call you Queen and are willing to\nobey you?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; there are thousands,\" she replied.\n\n\"Then send for them all to come here as soon as possible, and let\neach one bring a long piece of string.\"\n\nThe Queen turned to the mice that attended her and told them to go at\nonce and get all her people. As soon as they heard her orders they\nran away in every direction as fast as possible.\n\n\"Now,\" said the Scarecrow to the Tin Woodman, \"you must go to those\ntrees by the river-side and make a truck that will carry the Lion.\"\n\nSo the Woodman went at once to the trees and began to work; and he\nsoon made a truck out of the limbs of trees, from which he chopped\naway all the leaves and branches. He fastened it together with\nwooden pegs and made the four wheels out of short pieces of a big\ntree-trunk. So fast and so well did he work that by the time the mice\nbegan to arrive the truck was all ready for them.\n\nThey came from all directions, and there were thousands of them: big\nmice and little mice and middle-sized mice; and each one brought a\npiece of string in his mouth. It was about this time that Dorothy woke\nfrom her long sleep and opened her eyes. She was greatly astonished\nto find herself lying upon the grass, with thousands of mice standing\naround and looking at her timidly. But the Scarecrow told her about\neverything, and turning to the dignified little Mouse, he said,\n\n\"Permit me to introduce to you her Majesty, the Queen.\"\n\nDorothy nodded gravely and the Queen made a courtesy, after which she\nbecame quite friendly with the little girl.\n\nThe Scarecrow and the Woodman now began to fasten the mice to the\ntruck, using the strings they had brought. One end of a string was\ntied around the neck of each mouse and the other end to the truck.\nOf course the truck was a thousand times bigger than any of the mice\nwho were to draw it; but when all the mice had been harnessed they\nwere able to pull it quite easily. Even the Scarecrow and the Tin\nWoodman could sit on it, and were drawn swiftly by their queer little\nhorses to the place where the Lion lay asleep.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nAfter a great deal of hard work, for the Lion was heavy, they managed\nto get him up on the truck. Then the Queen hurriedly gave her people\nthe order to start, for she feared if the mice stayed among the\npoppies too long they also would fall asleep.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nAt first the little creatures, many though they were, could hardly stir\nthe heavily loaded truck; but the Woodman and the Scarecrow both pushed\nfrom behind, and they got along better. Soon they rolled the Lion out\nof the poppy bed to the green fields, where he could breathe the sweet,\nfresh air again, instead of the poisonous scent of the flowers.\n\nDorothy came to meet them and thanked the little mice warmly for\nsaving her companion from death. She had grown so fond of the big\nLion she was glad he had been rescued.\n\nThen the mice were unharnessed from the truck and scampered away\nthrough the grass to their homes. The Queen of the Mice was the last\nto leave.\n\n\"If ever you need us again,\" she said, \"come out into the field and\ncall, and we shall hear you and come to your assistance. Good bye!\"\n\n\"Good bye!\" they all answered, and away the Queen ran, while Dorothy\nheld Toto tightly lest he should run after her and frighten her.\n\nAfter this they sat down beside the Lion until he should awaken; and\nthe Scarecrow brought Dorothy some fruit from a tree near by, which\nshe ate for her dinner.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter X. The Guardian of the Gate.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\nIt was some time before the Cowardly Lion awakened, for he had lain\namong the poppies a long while, breathing in their deadly fragrance;\nbut when he did open his eyes and roll off the truck he was very glad\nto find himself still alive.\n\n\"I ran as fast as I could,\" he said, sitting down and yawning; \"but\nthe flowers were too strong for me. How did you get me out?\"\n\nThen they told him of the field-mice, and how they had generously\nsaved him from death; and the Cowardly Lion laughed, and said,\n\n\"I have always thought myself very big and terrible; yet such small\nthings as flowers came near to killing me, and such small animals as\nmice have saved my life. How strange it all is! But, comrades, what\nshall we do now?\"\n\n\"We must journey on until we find the road of yellow brick again,\"\nsaid Dorothy; \"and then we can keep on to the Emerald City.\"\n\nSo, the Lion being fully refreshed, and feeling quite himself again,\nthey all started upon the journey, greatly enjoying the walk through\nthe soft, fresh grass; and it was not long before they reached the\nroad of yellow brick and turned again toward the Emerald City where\nthe great Oz dwelt.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe road was smooth and well paved, now, and the country about was\nbeautiful; so that the travelers rejoiced in leaving the forest far\nbehind, and with it the many dangers they had met in its gloomy\nshades. Once more they could see fences built beside the road; but\nthese were painted green, and when they came to a small house, in\nwhich a farmer evidently lived, that also was painted green. They\npassed by several of these houses during the afternoon, and sometimes\npeople came to the doors and looked at them as if they would like to\nask questions; but no one came near them nor spoke to them because of\nthe great Lion, of which they were much afraid. The people were all\ndressed in clothing of a lovely emerald green color and wore peaked\nhats like those of the Munchkins.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"This must be the Land of Oz,\" said Dorothy, \"and we are surely\ngetting near the Emerald City.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered the Scarecrow; \"everything is green here, while in\nthe country of the Munchkins blue was the favorite color. But the\npeople do not seem to be as friendly as the Munchkins and I'm afraid\nwe shall be unable to find a place to pass the night.\"\n\n\"I should like something to eat besides fruit,\" said the girl, \"and\nI'm sure Toto is nearly starved. Let us stop at the next house and\ntalk to the people.\"\n\nSo, when they came to a good sized farm house, Dorothy walked boldly\nup to the door and knocked. A woman opened it just far enough to look\nout, and said,\n\n\"What do you want, child, and why is that great Lion with you?\"\n\n\"We wish to pass the night with you, if you will allow us,\" answered\nDorothy; \"and the Lion is my friend and comrade, and would not hurt\nyou for the world.\"\n\n\"Is he tame?\" asked the woman, opening the door a little wider.\n\n\"Oh, yes;\" said the girl, \"and he is a great coward, too; so that he\nwill be more afraid of you than you are of him.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the woman, after thinking it over and taking another\npeep at the Lion, \"if that is the case you may come in, and I will\ngive you some supper and a place to sleep.\"\n\nSo they all entered the house, where there were, besides the woman,\ntwo children and a man. The man had hurt his leg, and was lying on the\ncouch in a corner. They seemed greatly surprised to see so strange a\ncompany, and while the woman was busy laying the table the man asked,\n\n\"Where are you all going?\"\n\n\"To the Emerald City,\" said Dorothy, \"to see the Great Oz.\"\n\n\"Oh, indeed!\" exclaimed the man. \"Are you sure that Oz will see you?\"\n\n\"Why not?\" she replied.\n\n\"Why, it is said that he never lets any one come into his presence. I\nhave been to the Emerald City many times, and it is a beautiful and\nwonderful place; but I have never been permitted to see the Great Oz,\nnor do I know of any living person who has seen him.\"\n\n\"Does he never go out?\" asked the Scarecrow.\n\n\"Never. He sits day after day in the great throne room of his palace,\nand even those who wait upon him do not see him face to face.\"\n\n\"What is he like?\" asked the girl.\n\n\"That is hard to tell,\" said the man, thoughtfully. \"You see, Oz is a\ngreat Wizard, and can take on any form he wishes. So that some say he\nlooks like a bird; and some say he looks like an elephant; and some\nsay he looks like a cat. To others he appears as a beautiful fairy,\nor a brownie, or in any other form that pleases him. But who the real\nOz is, when he is in his own form, no living person can tell.\"\n\n\"That is very strange,\" said Dorothy; \"but we must try, in some way,\nto see him, or we shall have made our journey for nothing.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Why do you wish to see the terrible Oz?\" asked the man.\n\n\"I want him to give me some brains,\" said the Scarecrow, eagerly.\n\n\"Oh, Oz could do that easily enough,\" declared the man. \"He has more\nbrains than he needs.\"\n\n\"And I want him to give me a heart,\" said the Tin Woodman.\n\n\"That will not trouble him,\" continued the man, \"for Oz has a large\ncollection of hearts, of all sizes and shapes.\"\n\n\"And I want him to give me courage,\" said the Cowardly Lion.\n\n\"Oz keeps a great pot of courage in his throne room,\" said the man,\n\"which he has covered with a golden plate, to keep it from running\nover. He will be glad to give you some.\"\n\n\"And I want him to send me back to Kansas,\" said Dorothy.\n\n\"Where is Kansas?\" asked the man, in surprise.\n\n\"I don't know,\" replied Dorothy, sorrowfully; \"but it is my home, and\nI'm sure it's somewhere.\"\n\n\"Very likely. Well, Oz can do anything; so I suppose he will find\nKansas for you. But first you must get to see him, and that will be\na hard task; for the great Wizard does not like to see anyone, and\nhe usually has his own way. But what do you want?\" he continued,\nspeaking to Toto. Toto only wagged his tail; for, strange to say, he\ncould not speak.\n\n[Illustration: \"_The Lion ate some of the porridge._\"]\n\nThe woman now called to them that supper was ready, so they gathered\naround the table and Dorothy ate some delicious porridge and a dish of\nscrambled eggs and a plate of nice white bread, and enjoyed her meal.\nThe Lion ate some of the porridge, but did not care for it, saying it\nwas made from oats and oats were food for horses, not for lions. The\nScarecrow and the Tin Woodman ate nothing at all. Toto ate a little of\neverything, and was glad to get a good supper again.\n\nThe woman now gave Dorothy a bed to sleep in, and Toto lay down beside\nher, while the Lion guarded the door of her room so she might not be\ndisturbed. The Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman stood up in a corner and\nkept quiet all night, although of course they could not sleep.\n\nThe next morning, as soon as the sun was up, they started on their\nway, and soon saw a beautiful green glow in the sky just before them.\n\n\"That must be the Emerald City,\" said Dorothy.\n\nAs they walked on, the green glow became brighter and brighter, and it\nseemed that at last they were nearing the end of their travels. Yet it\nwas afternoon before they came to the great wall that surrounded the\nCity. It was high, and thick, and of a bright green color.\n\nIn front of them, and at the end of the road of yellow brick, was a big\ngate, all studded with emeralds that glittered so in the sun that even\nthe painted eyes of the Scarecrow were dazzled by their brilliancy.\n\nThere was a bell beside the gate, and Dorothy pushed the button and\nheard a silvery tinkle sound within. Then the big gate swung slowly\nopen, and they all passed through and found themselves in a high\narched room, the walls of which glistened with countless emeralds.\n\nBefore them stood a little man about the same size as the Munchkins.\nHe was clothed all in green, from his head to his feet, and even his\nskin was of a greenish tint. At his side was a large green box.\n\nWhen he saw Dorothy and her companions the man asked,\n\n\"What do you wish in the Emerald City?\"\n\n\"We came here to see the Great Oz,\" said Dorothy.\n\nThe man was so surprised at this answer that he sat down to think it\nover.\n\n\"It has been many years since anyone asked me to see Oz,\" he said,\nshaking his head in perplexity. \"He is powerful and terrible, and if\nyou come on an idle or foolish errand to bother the wise reflections of\nthe Great Wizard, he might be angry and destroy you all in an instant.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"But it is not a foolish errand, nor an idle one,\" replied the\nScarecrow; \"it is important. And we have been told that Oz is a good\nWizard.\"\n\n\"So he is,\" said the green man; \"and he rules the Emerald City wisely\nand well. But to those who are not honest, or who approach him from\ncuriosity, he is most terrible, and few have ever dared ask to see\nhis face. I am the Guardian of the Gates, and since you demand to see\nthe Great Oz I must take you to his palace. But first you must put on\nthe spectacles.\"\n\n\"Why?\" asked Dorothy.\n\n\"Because if you did not wear spectacles the brightness and glory of\nthe Emerald City would blind you. Even those who live in the City\nmust wear spectacles night and day. They are all locked on, for Oz\nso ordered it when the City was first built, and I have the only key\nthat will unlock them.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nHe opened the big box, and Dorothy saw that it was filled with\nspectacles of every size and shape. All of them had green glasses\nin them. The Guardian of the gates found a pair that would just fit\nDorothy and put them over her eyes. There were two golden bands\nfastened to them that passed around the back of her head, where they\nwere locked together by a little key that was at the end of a chain the\nGuardian of the Gates wore around his neck. When they were on, Dorothy\ncould not take them off had she wished, but of course she did not want\nto be blinded by the glare of the Emerald City, so she said nothing.\n\nThen the green man fitted spectacles for the Scarecrow and the Tin\nWoodman and the Lion, and even on little Toto; and all were locked\nfast with the key.\n\nThen the Guardian of the Gates put on his own glasses and told them\nhe was ready to show them to the palace. Taking a big golden key from\na peg on the wall he opened another gate, and they all followed him\nthrough the portal into the streets of the Emerald City.\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter XI. The Wonderful Emerald City of Oz.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nEven with eyes protected by the green spectacles Dorothy and her\nfriends were at first dazzled by the brilliancy of the wonderful City.\nThe streets were lined with beautiful houses all built of green marble\nand studded everywhere with sparkling emeralds. They walked over a\npavement of the same green marble, and where the blocks were joined\ntogether were rows of emeralds, set closely, and glittering in the\nbrightness of the sun. The window panes were of green glass; even the\nsky above the City had a green tint, and the rays of the sun were green.\n\nThere were many people, men, women and children, walking about, and\nthese were all dressed in green clothes and had greenish skins. They\nlooked at Dorothy and her strangely assorted company with wondering\neyes, and the children all ran away and hid behind their mothers when\nthey saw the Lion; but no one spoke to them. Many shops stood in the\nstreet, and Dorothy saw that everything in them was green. Green\ncandy and green pop-corn were offered for sale, as well as green\nshoes, green hats and green clothes of all sorts. At one place a man\nwas selling green lemonade, and when the children bought it Dorothy\ncould see that they paid for it with green pennies.\n\nThere seemed to be no horses nor animals of any kind; the men carried\nthings around in little green carts, which they pushed before them.\nEveryone seemed happy and contented and prosperous.\n\nThe Guardian of the Gates led them through the streets until they\ncame to a big building, exactly in the middle of the City, which was\nthe Palace of Oz, the Great Wizard. There was a soldier before the\ndoor, dressed in a green uniform and wearing a long green beard.\n\n\"Here are strangers,\" said the Guardian of the Gates to him, \"and\nthey demand to see the Great Oz.\"\n\n\"Step inside,\" answered the soldier, \"and I will carry your message\nto him.\"\n\nSo they passed through the Palace gates and were led into a big room\nwith a green carpet and lovely green furniture set with emeralds.\nThe soldier made them all wipe their feet upon a green mat before\nentering this room, and when they were seated he said, politely,\n\n\"Please make yourselves comfortable while I go to the door of the\nThrone Room and tell Oz you are here.\"\n\nThey had to wait a long time before the soldier returned. When, at\nlast, he came back, Dorothy asked,\n\n\"Have you seen Oz?\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Oh, no;\" returned the soldier; \"I have never seen him. But I spoke\nto him as he sat behind his screen, and gave him your message. He\nsays he will grant you an audience, if you so desire; but each one\nof you must enter his presence alone, and he will admit but one each\nday. Therefore, as you must remain in the Palace for several days, I\nwill have you shown to rooms where you may rest in comfort after your\njourney.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" replied the girl; \"that is very kind of Oz.\"\n\nThe soldier now blew upon a green whistle, and at once a young girl,\ndressed in a pretty green silk gown, entered the room. She had\nlovely green hair and green eyes, and she bowed low before Dorothy as\nshe said,\n\n\"Follow me and I will show you your room.\"\n\nSo Dorothy said good-bye to all her friends except Toto, and taking\nthe dog in her arms followed the green girl through seven passages\nand up three flights of stairs until they came to a room at the front\nof the Palace. It was the sweetest little room in the world, with\na soft, comfortable bed that had sheets of green silk and a green\nvelvet counterpane. There was a tiny fountain in the middle of the\nroom, that shot a spray of green perfume into the air, to fall back\ninto a beautifully carved green marble basin. Beautiful green flowers\nstood in the windows, and there was a shelf with a row of little\ngreen books. When Dorothy had time to open these books she found them\nfull of queer green pictures that made her laugh, they were so funny.\n\nIn a wardrobe were many green dresses, made of silk and satin and\nvelvet; and all of them fitted Dorothy exactly.\n\n\"Make yourself perfectly at home,\" said the green girl, \"and if you\nwish for anything ring the bell. Oz will send for you to-morrow\nmorning.\"\n\nShe left Dorothy alone and went back to the others. These she also\nled to rooms, and each one of them found himself lodged in a very\npleasant part of the Palace. Of course this politeness was wasted on\nthe Scarecrow; for when he found himself alone in his room he stood\nstupidly in one spot, just within the doorway, to wait till morning.\nIt would not rest him to lie down, and he could not close his eyes;\nso he remained all night staring at a little spider which was weaving\nits web in a corner of the room, just as if it were not one of the\nmost wonderful rooms in the world. The Tin Woodman lay down on his\nbed from force of habit, for he remembered when he was made of flesh;\nbut not being able to sleep he passed the night moving his joints up\nand down to make sure they kept in good working order. The Lion would\nhave preferred a bed of dried leaves in the forest, and did not like\nbeing shut up in a room; but he had too much sense to let this worry\nhim, so he sprang upon the bed and rolled himself up like a cat and\npurred himself asleep in a minute.\n\nThe next morning, after breakfast, the green maiden came to fetch\nDorothy, and she dressed her in one of the prettiest gowns--made of\ngreen brocaded satin. Dorothy put on a green silk apron and tied a\ngreen ribbon around Toto's neck, and they started for the Throne Room\nof the Great Oz.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nFirst they came to a great hall in which were many ladies and\ngentlemen of the court, all dressed in rich costumes. These people\nhad nothing to do but talk to each other, but they always came to\nwait outside the Throne Room every morning, although they were never\npermitted to see Oz. As Dorothy entered they looked at her curiously,\nand one of them whispered,\n\n\"Are you really going to look upon the face of Oz the Terrible?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" answered the girl, \"if he will see me.\"\n\n\"Oh, he will see you,\" said the soldier who had taken her message\nto the Wizard, \"although he does not like to have people ask to see\nhim. Indeed, at first he was angry, and said I should send you back\nwhere you came from. Then he asked me what you looked like, and when\nI mentioned your silver shoes he was very much interested. At last I\ntold him about the mark upon your forehead, and he decided he would\nadmit you to his presence.\"\n\nJust then a bell rang, and the green girl said to Dorothy,\n\n\"That is the signal. You must go into the Throne Room alone.\"\n\nShe opened a little door and Dorothy walked boldly through and found\nherself in a wonderful place. It was a big, round room with a high\narched roof, and the walls and ceiling and floor were covered with\nlarge emeralds set closely together. In the center of the roof was a\ngreat light, as bright as the sun, which made the emeralds sparkle in\na wonderful manner.\n\nBut what interested Dorothy most was the big throne of green marble\nthat stood in the middle of the room. It was shaped like a chair\nand sparkled with gems, as did everything else. In the center of the\nchair was an enormous Head, without body to support it or any arms or\nlegs whatever. There was no hair upon this head, but it had eyes and\nnose and mouth, and was bigger than the head of the biggest giant.\n\nAs Dorothy gazed upon this in wonder and fear the eyes turned slowly\nand looked at her sharply and steadily. Then the mouth moved, and\nDorothy heard a voice say:\n\n\"I am Oz, the Great and Terrible. Who are you, and why do you seek me?\"\n\nIt was not such an awful voice as she had expected to come from the\nbig Head; so she took courage and answered,\n\n\"I am Dorothy, the Small and Meek. I have come to you for help.\"\n\nThe eyes looked at her thoughtfully for a full minute. Then said the\nvoice:\n\n\"Where did you get the silver shoes?\"\n\n\"I got them from the wicked Witch of the East, when my house fell on\nher and killed her,\" she replied.\n\n\"Where did you get the mark upon your forehead?\" continued the voice.\n\n\"That is where the good Witch of the North kissed me when she bade me\ngood-bye and sent me to you,\" said the girl.\n\nAgain the eyes looked at her sharply, and they saw she was telling\nthe truth. Then Oz asked,\n\n\"What do you wish me to do?\"\n\n\"Send me back to Kansas, where my Aunt Em and Uncle Henry are,\" she\nanswered, earnestly. \"I don't like your country, although it is so\nbeautiful. And I am sure Aunt Em will be dreadfully worried over my\nbeing away so long.\"\n\nThe eyes winked three times, and then they turned up to the ceiling and\ndown to the floor and rolled around so queerly that they seemed to see\nevery part of the room. And at last they looked at Dorothy again.\n\n\"Why should I do this for you?\" asked Oz.\n\n\"Because you are strong and I am weak; because you are a Great Wizard\nand I am only a helpless little girl,\" she answered.\n\n\"But you were strong enough to kill the wicked Witch of the East,\"\nsaid Oz.\n\n\"That just happened,\" returned Dorothy, simply; \"I could not help it.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the Head, \"I will give you my answer. You have no right\nto expect me to send you back to Kansas unless you do something for\nme in return. In this country everyone must pay for everything he\ngets. If you wish me to use my magic power to send you home again you\nmust do something for me first. Help me and I will help you.\"\n\n\"What must I do?\" asked the girl.\n\n\"Kill the wicked Witch of the West,\" answered Oz.\n\n\"But I cannot!\" exclaimed Dorothy, greatly surprised.\n\n\"You killed the Witch of the East and you wear the silver shoes,\nwhich bear a powerful charm. There is now but one Wicked Witch left\nin all this land, and when you can tell me she is dead I will send\nyou back to Kansas--but not before.\"\n\nThe little girl began to weep, she was so much disappointed; and the\neyes winked again and looked upon her anxiously, as if the Great Oz\nfelt that she could help him if she would.\n\n\"I never killed anything, willingly,\" she sobbed; \"and even if I wanted\nto, how could I kill the Wicked Witch? If you, who are Great and\nTerrible, cannot kill her yourself, how do you expect me to do it?\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"I do not know,\" said the Head; \"but that is my answer, and until the\nWicked Witch dies you will not see your Uncle and Aunt again. Remember\nthat the Witch is Wicked--tremendously Wicked--and ought to be killed.\nNow go, and do not ask to see me again until you have done your task.\"\n\nSorrowfully Dorothy left the Throne Room and went back where the\nLion and the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman were waiting to hear what\nOz had said to her.\n\n\"There is no hope for me,\" she said, sadly, \"for Oz will not send me\nhome until I have killed the Wicked Witch of the West; and that I can\nnever do.\"\n\nHer friends were sorry, but could do nothing to help her; so she went\nto her own room and lay down on the bed and cried herself to sleep.\n\nThe next morning the soldier with the green whiskers came to the\nScarecrow and said,\n\n\"Come with me, for Oz has sent for you.\"\n\nSo the Scarecrow followed him and was admitted into the great Throne\nRoom, where he saw, sitting in the emerald throne, a most lovely\nlady. She was dressed in green silk gauze and wore upon her flowing\ngreen locks a crown of jewels. Growing from her shoulders were wings,\ngorgeous in color and so light that they fluttered if the slightest\nbreath of air reached them.\n\nWhen the Scarecrow had bowed, as prettily as his straw stuffing would\nlet him, before this beautiful creature, she looked upon him sweetly,\nand said,\n\n\"I am Oz, the Great and Terrible. Who are you, and why do you seek me?\"\n\nNow the Scarecrow, who had expected to see the great Head Dorothy had\ntold him of, was much astonished; but he answered her brav\n\n### Summary:\n\n", "answer": "The Tin Woodman and The Scarecrow were standing near the edge of the field when they spotted a yellow wildcat chasing a little gray field mouse across the grass. The Tin Woodman knew the mouse was outmatched, so he lifted his axe and swung it, lopping the beast's head off. The field mouse was grateful and told them she was the Queen of the Field Mice and in return for saving her life, her subjects would do anything the Tin Woodman wanted. The Tin Woodman asked if they could help get the Lion out of the field of poppies, and assured the mice that he was cowardly and would not eat them. The Woodman made a truck from tree branches and the mice harnessed themselves to it with bits of string. The Cowardly Lion was finally pulled out of the field and Dorothy was glad, as \"she had grown so fond of the big Lion.\" The mice told them to call if they ever needed anything again. The Lion awoke after a long sleep and they told him what had happened. They were now greatly refreshed and continued along their way along the smooth road in the beautiful country. The people watched them walk along the yellow brick road but did not talk to them. Everything was green in this land. They were tired and hungry and stopped at a farmhouse, where the woman who lived there agreed to let them in. The travelers told the family that they were going to visit Oz, which surprised them greatly. The woman's husband said that Oz took on many forms and no one knew who the real Oz was. He said it might be hard to see him since he does not like to see anyone. They slept and ate at the farmhouse and left the next morning, arriving at a great wall that surrounded the city. There was a massive gate studded with emeralds, and Dorothy pushed a bell that opened the gate and let them enter a high arched room that also sparkled with emeralds. A little man asked them what their purpose was and was perplexed when they said they wanted to see Oz since it had been many years since anyone asked to do that. He finally agreed to take them to Oz but told them to put on spectacles so the \"brightness and glory of the Emerald City blind you.\" All of the travelers were fitted and followed the man inside the Emerald City. Dorothy and her friends were dazzled by the beauty and wealth of the City, and the men, women, and children all clad in green with greenish skins. Everyone \"seemed happy and contented and prosperous.\" They were brought into the Palace of Oz's gates and waited in a big room with green carpets and furniture. The soldier who led them there explained that they could only see Oz one at a time and one per day so they would have to spend the night. This was agreeable, and all of the travelers were shown their rooms. Dorothy thought her room sweet and comfortable. A green girl told her in a friendly manner that she could wear any of the clothes in the wardrobe. The next morning Dorothy was summoned to Oz. They first passed a room where rich and idle men and women gathered and talked, but did not actually see Oz. The soldier informed Dorothy that the Wizard had almost not wanted to see Dorothy until he heard of her silver shoes and the mark on her forehead. A bell rang and Dorothy was told to enter the Throne Room alone. She walked into a large room with an arched roof; everything was covered in emeralds. There was a large throne of green marble and upon it was a huge head that had no limbs or support of any kind. It had no hair but had eyes and a nose and a mouth. It spoke: \"I am Oz, the Great and Terrible. Who are you, and why do you seek me?\" Dorothy gave her name and Oz asked where she got her shoes and the mark on her forehead. She answered him and told him she wanted to go back to Kansas. Oz replied that she had to do something for him if she wanted him to help her - kill the Wicked Witch of the West. Dorothy exclaimed that this was impossible and wept in despair. When she left the Throne Room she told her friends what had happened, and they were very sorry for her. The Scarecrow went in the next day. Oz appeared as a lovely lady upon the throne who had gorgeous wings growing from her shoulders. The Scarecrow told her he wanted brains and Oz replied that he also had to try to kill the Witch. It did not matter who killed her as long as it was done. The Tin Woodman went in the next day, and Oz appeared as a fantastical and terrible beast. Oz told the Tin Woodman to help Dorothy kill the Witch. When the Lion went in the next day, Oz was a Ball of Fire \"so fierce and glowing he could scarcely bear to gaze upon it.\" He asked for courage and was told he needed to bring back proof that the Witch was dead. Dorothy and her friends were confused what to do, but they realized they had to try and kill the Witch. The Lion said he would go but was too much of a coward to kill her. The Tin Woodman said he had no heart to harm even a Witch but he would go. The Scarecrow said he would go but was too much of a fool to help. Thus their plan to travel to the land of the Winkies where the Witch ruled was resolved, and they spent one more night in the Emerald City."}

The way she snapped a person's head off, dear me!'\n\n       The mild Plornish was at first quite unable to get his mind away from Mr\n       F.'s Aunt. 'For,' said he, to excuse himself, 'she is, I do assure you,\n       the winegariest party.'\n\n       At length, by a great effort, he detached himself from the subject\n       sufficiently to observe:\n\n       'But she's neither here nor there just at present. The other lady, she's\n       Mr Casby's daughter; and if Mr Casby an't well off, none better, it an't\n       through any fault of Pancks. For, as to Pancks, he does, he really does,\n       he does indeed!'\n\n       Mr Plornish, after his usual manner, was a little obscure, but\n       conscientiously emphatic.\n\n       'And what she come to our place for,' he pursued, 'was to leave word\n       that if Miss Dorrit would step up to that card--which it's Mr Casby's\n       house that is, and Pancks he has a office at the back, where he really\n       does, beyond belief--she would be glad for to engage her. She was a old\n       and a dear friend, she said particular, of Mr Clennam, and hoped for to\n       prove herself a useful friend to _his_ friend. Them was her words. Wishing\n       to know whether Miss Dorrit could come to-morrow morning, I said I would\n       see you, Miss, and inquire, and look round there to-night, to say yes,\n       or, if you was engaged to-morrow, when?'\n\n       'I can go to-morrow, thank you,' said Little Dorrit. 'This is very kind\n       of you, but you are always kind.'\n\n       Mr Plornish, with a modest disavowal of his merits, opened the room door\n       for her readmission, and followed her in with such an exceedingly bald\n       pretence of not having been out at all, that her father might\n       have observed it without being very suspicious. In his affable\n       unconsciousness, however, he took no heed. Plornish, after a little\n       conversation, in which he blended his former duty as a Collegian with\n       his present privilege as a humble outside friend, qualified again by his\n       low estate as a plasterer, took his leave; making the tour of the prison\n       before he left, and looking on at a game of skittles with the mixed\n       feelings of an old inhabitant who had his private reasons for believing\n       that it might be his destiny to come back again.\n\n       Early in the morning, Little Dorrit, leaving Maggy in high domestic\n       trust, set off for the Patriarchal tent. She went by the Iron Bridge,\n       though it cost her a penny, and walked more slowly in that part of her\n       journey than in any other. At five minutes before eight her hand was on\n       the Patriarchal knocker, which was quite as high as she could reach.\n\n       She gave Mrs Finching's card to the young woman who opened the door, and\n       the young woman told her that 'Miss Flora'--Flora having, on her return\n       to the parental roof, reinvested herself with the title under which she\n       had lived there--was not yet out of her bedroom, but she was to please\n       to walk up into Miss Flora's sitting-room. She walked up into\n       Miss Flora's sitting-room, as in duty bound, and there found a\n       breakfast-table comfortably laid for two, with a supplementary tray\n       upon it laid for one. The young woman, disappearing for a few moments,\n       returned to say that she was to please to take a chair by the fire,\n       and to take off her bonnet and make herself at home. But Little Dorrit,\n       being bashful, and not used to make herself at home on such occasions,\n       felt at a loss how to do it; so she was still sitting near the door with\n       her bonnet on, when Flora came in in a hurry half an hour afterwards.\n\n       Flora was so sorry to have kept her waiting, and good gracious why did\n       she sit out there in the cold when she had expected to find her by the\n       fire reading the paper, and hadn't that heedless girl given her the\n       message then, and had she really been in her bonnet all this time, and\n       pray for goodness sake let Flora take it off! Flora taking it off in the\n       best-natured manner in the world, was so struck with the face disclosed,\n       that she said, 'Why, what a good little thing you are, my dear!' and\n       pressed her face between her hands like the gentlest of women.\n\n       It was the word and the action of a moment. Little Dorrit had hardly\n       time to think how kind it was, when Flora dashed at the breakfast-table\n       full of business, and plunged over head and ears into loquacity.\n\n       'Really so sorry that I should happen to be late on this morning of all\n       mornings because my intention and my wish was to be ready to meet you\n       when you came in and to say that any one that interested Arthur Clennam\n       half so much must interest me and that I gave you the heartiest welcome\n       and was so glad, instead of which they never called me and there I\n       still am snoring I dare say if the truth was known and if you don't like\n       either cold fowl or hot boiled ham which many people don't I dare say\n       besides Jews and theirs are scruples of conscience which we must all\n       respect though I must say I wish they had them equally strong when they\n       sell us false articles for real that certainly ain't worth the money I\n       shall be quite vexed,' said Flora.\n\n       Little Dorrit thanked her, and said, shyly, bread-and-butter and tea was\n       all she usually--\n\n       'Oh nonsense my dear child I can never hear of that,' said Flora,\n       turning on the urn in the most reckless manner, and making herself wink\n       by splashing hot water into her eyes as she bent down to look into the\n       teapot. 'You are coming here on the footing of a friend and companion\n       you know if you will let me take that liberty and I should be ashamed\n       of myself indeed if you could come here upon any other, besides which\n       Arthur Clennam spoke in such terms--you are tired my dear.'\n\n       'No, ma'am.'\n\n       'You turn so pale you have walked too far before breakfast and I dare\n       say live a great way off and ought to have had a ride,' said Flora,\n       'dear dear is there anything that would do you good?'\n\n       'Indeed I am quite well, ma'am. I thank you again and again, but I am\n       quite well.'\n\n       'Then take your tea at once I beg,' said Flora, 'and this wing of fowl\n       and bit of ham, don't mind me or wait for me, because I always carry in\n       this tray myself to Mr F.'s Aunt who breakfasts in bed and a charming\n       old lady too and very clever, Portrait of Mr F. behind the door and very\n       like though too much forehead and as to a pillar with a marble pavement\n       and balustrades and a mountain, I never saw him near it nor not likely\n       in the wine trade, excellent man but not at all in that way.'\n\n       Little Dorrit glanced at the portrait, very imperfectly following the\n       references to that work of art.\n\n       'Mr F. was so devoted to me that he never could bear me out of his\n       sight,' said Flora, 'though of course I am unable to say how long that\n       might have lasted if he hadn't been cut short while I was a new broom,\n       worthy man but not poetical manly prose but not romance.'\n\n       Little Dorrit glanced at the portrait again. The artist had given it a\n       head that would have been, in an intellectual point of view, top-heavy\n       for Shakespeare.\n\n       'Romance, however,' Flora went on, busily arranging Mr F.'s Aunt's\n       toast, 'as I openly said to Mr F. when he proposed to me and you will be\n       surprised to hear that he proposed seven times once in a hackney-coach\n       once in a boat once in a pew once on a donkey at Tunbridge Wells and the\n       rest on his knees, Romance was fled with the early days of Arthur\n       Clennam, our parents tore us asunder we became marble and stern reality\n       usurped the throne, Mr F. said very much to his credit that he was\n       perfectly aware of it and even preferred that state of things\n       accordingly the word was spoken the fiat went forth and such is life you\n       see my dear and yet we do not break but bend, pray make a good breakfast\n       while I go in with the tray.'\n\n       She disappeared, leaving Little Dorrit to ponder over the meaning of her\n       scattered words. She soon came back again; and at last began to take her\n       own breakfast, talking all the while.\n\n       'You see, my dear,' said Flora, measuring out a spoonful or two of some\n       brown liquid that smelt like brandy, and putting it into her tea, 'I am\n       obliged to be careful to follow the directions of my medical man though\n       the flavour is anything but agreeable being a poor creature and it may\n       be have never recovered the shock received in youth from too much giving\n       way to crying in the next room when separated from Arthur, have you\n       known him long?'\n\n       As soon as Little Dorrit comprehended that she had been asked this\n       question--for which time was necessary, the galloping pace of her new\n       patroness having left her far behind--she answered that she had known Mr\n       Clennam ever since his return.\n\n       'To be sure you couldn't have known him before unless you had been in\n       China or had corresponded neither of which is likely,' returned Flora,\n       'for travelling-people usually get more or less mahogany and you are not\n       at all so and as to corresponding what about? that's very true unless\n       tea, so it was at his mother's was it really that you knew him first,\n       highly sensible and firm but dreadfully severe--ought to be the mother\n       of the man in the iron mask.'\n\n       'Mrs Clennam has been kind to me,' said Little Dorrit.\n\n       'Really? I am sure I am glad to hear it because as Arthur's mother it's\n       naturally pleasant to my feelings to have a better opinion of her than\n       I had before, though what she thinks of me when I run on as I am certain\n       to do and she sits glowering at me like Fate in a go-cart--shocking\n       comparison really--invalid and not her fault--I never know or can\n       imagine.'\n\n       'Shall I find my work anywhere, ma'am?' asked Little Dorrit, looking\n       timidly about; 'can I get it?'\n\n       'You industrious little fairy,' returned Flora, taking, in another cup\n       of tea, another of the doses prescribed by her medical man, 'there's\n       not the slightest hurry and it's better that we should begin by being\n       confidential about our mutual friend--too cold a word for me at least\n       I don't mean that, very proper expression mutual friend--than become\n       through mere formalities not you but me like the Spartan boy with the\n       fox biting him, which I hope you'll excuse my bringing up for of all\n       the tiresome boys that will go tumbling into every sort of company that\n       boy's the tiresomest.'\n\n       Little Dorrit, her face very pale, sat down again to listen. 'Hadn't I\n       better work the while?' she asked. 'I can work and attend too. I would\n       rather, if I may.'\n\n       Her earnestness was so expressive of her being uneasy without her work,\n       that Flora answered, 'Well my dear whatever you like best,' and produced\n       a basket of white handkerchiefs. Little Dorrit gladly put it by her\n       side, took out her little pocket-housewife, threaded the needle, and\n       began to hem.\n\n       'What nimble fingers you have,' said Flora, 'but are you sure you are\n       well?'\n\n       'Oh yes, indeed!'\n\n       Flora put her feet upon the fender, and settled herself for a thorough\n       good romantic disclosure. She started off at score, tossing her head,\n       sighing in the most demonstrative manner, making a great deal of use\n       of her eyebrows, and occasionally, but not often, glancing at the quiet\n       face that bent over the work.\n\n       'You must know my dear,' said Flora, 'but that I have no doubt you know\n       already not only because I have already thrown it out in a general way\n       but because I feel I carry it stamped in burning what's his names\n       upon my brow that before I was introduced to the late Mr F. I had\n       been engaged to Arthur Clennam--Mr Clennam in public where reserve is\n       necessary Arthur here--we were all in all to one another it was the\n       morning of life it was bliss it was frenzy it was everything else of\n       that sort in the highest degree, when rent asunder we turned to stone in\n       which capacity Arthur went to China and I became the statue bride of the\n       late Mr F.'\n\n       Flora, uttering these words in a deep voice, enjoyed herself immensely.\n\n       'To paint,' said she, 'the emotions of that morning when all was marble\n       within and Mr F.'s Aunt followed in a glass-coach which it stands to\n       reason must have been in shameful repair or it never could have broken\n       down two streets from the house and Mr F.'s Aunt brought home like the\n       fifth of November in a rush-bottomed chair I will not attempt,\n       suffice it to say that the hollow form of breakfast took place in the\n       dining-room downstairs that papa partaking too freely of pickled salmon\n       was ill for weeks and that Mr F. and myself went upon a continental\n       tour to Calais where the people fought for us on the pier until they\n       separated us though not for ever that was not yet to be.'\n\n       The statue bride, hardly pausing for breath, went on, with the greatest\n       complacency, in a rambling manner sometimes incidental to flesh and\n       blood.\n\n       'I will draw a veil over that dreamy life, Mr F. was in good spirits his\n       appetite was good he liked the cookery he considered the wine weak but\n       palatable and all was well, we returned to the immediate neighbourhood\n       of Number Thirty Little Gosling Street London Docks and settled down,\n       ere we had yet fully detected the housemaid in selling the feathers\n       out of the spare bed Gout flying upwards soared with Mr F. to another\n       sphere.'\n\n       His relict, with a glance at his portrait, shook her head and wiped her\n       eyes.\n\n       'I revere the memory of Mr F. as an estimable man and most indulgent\n       husband, only necessary to mention Asparagus and it appeared or to hint\n       at any little delicate thing to drink and it came like magic in a pint\n       bottle it was not ecstasy but it was comfort, I returned to papa's roof\n       and lived secluded if not happy during some years until one day papa\n       came smoothly blundering in and said that Arthur Clennam awaited me\n       below, I went below and found him ask me not what I found him except\n       that he was still unmarried still unchanged!'\n\n       The dark mystery with which Flora now enshrouded herself might have\n       stopped other fingers than the nimble fingers that worked near her.\n       They worked on without pause, and the busy head bent over them watching\n       the stitches.\n\n       'Ask me not,' said Flora, 'if I love him still or if he still loves me\n       or what the end is to be or when, we are surrounded by watchful eyes and\n       it may be that we are destined to pine asunder it may be never more to\n       be reunited not a word not a breath not a look to betray us all must\n       be secret as the tomb wonder not therefore that even if I should seem\n       comparatively cold to Arthur or Arthur should seem comparatively cold to\n       me we have fatal reasons it is enough if we understand them hush!'\n\n       All of which Flora said with so much headlong vehemence as if she really\n       believed it. There is not much doubt that when she worked herself into\n       full mermaid condition, she did actually believe whatever she said in\n       it.\n\n       'Hush!' repeated Flora, 'I have now told you all, confidence is\n       established between us hush, for Arthur's sake I will always be a friend\n       to you my dear girl and in Arthur's name you may always rely upon me.'\n\n       The nimble fingers laid aside the work, and the little figure rose and\n       kissed her hand. 'You are very cold,' said Flora, changing to her own\n       natural kind-hearted manner, and gaining greatly by the change. 'Don't\n       work to-day. I am sure you are not well I am sure you are not strong.'\n\n       'It is only that I feel a little overcome by your kindness, and by Mr\n       Clennam's kindness in confiding me to one he has known and loved so\n       long.'\n\n       'Well really my dear,' said Flora, who had a decided tendency to be\n       always honest when she gave herself time to think about it, 'it's as\n       well to leave that alone now, for I couldn't undertake to say after all,\n       but it doesn't signify lie down a little!'\n\n       'I have always been strong enough to do what I want to do, and I shall\n       be quite well directly,' returned Little Dorrit, with a faint smile.\n       'You have overpowered me with gratitude, that's all. If I keep near the\n       window for a moment I shall be quite myself.'\n\n       Flora opened a window, sat her in a chair by it, and considerately\n       retired to her former place. It was a windy day, and the air stirring\n       on Little Dorrit's face soon brightened it. In a very few minutes she\n       returned to her basket of work, and her nimble fingers were as nimble as\n       ever.\n\n       Quietly pursuing her task, she asked Flora if Mr Clennam had told her\n       where she lived? When Flora replied in the negative, Little Dorrit said\n       that she understood why he had been so delicate, but that she felt sure\n       he would approve of her confiding her secret to Flora, and that\n       she would therefore do so now with Flora's permission. Receiving an\n       encouraging answer, she condensed the narrative of her life into a few\n       scanty words about herself and a glowing eulogy upon her father; and\n       Flora took it all in with a natural tenderness that quite understood it,\n       and in which there was no incoherence.\n\n       When dinner-time came, Flora drew the arm of her new charge through\n       hers, and led her down-stairs, and presented her to the Patriarch and Mr\n       Pancks, who were already in the dining-room waiting to begin. (Mr F.'s\n               Aunt was, for the time, laid up in ordinary in her chamber.) By those\n       gentlemen she was received according to their characters; the Patriarch\n       appearing to do her some inestimable service in saying that he was glad\n       to see her, glad to see her; and Mr Pancks blowing off his favourite\n       sound as a salute.\n\n       In that new presence she would have been bashful enough under any\n       circumstances, and particularly under Flora's insisting on her\n       drinking a glass of wine and eating of the best that was there; but her\n       constraint was greatly increased by Mr Pancks. The demeanour of that\n       gentleman at first suggested to her mind that he might be a taker of\n       likenesses, so intently did he look at her, and so frequently did he\n       glance at the little note-book by his side. Observing that he made no\n       sketch, however, and that he talked about business only, she began to\n       have suspicions that he represented some creditor of her father's, the\n       balance due to whom was noted in that pocket volume. Regarded from this\n       point of view Mr Pancks's puffings expressed injury and impatience, and\n       each of his louder snorts became a demand for payment.\n\n       But here again she was undeceived by anomalous and incongruous conduct\n       on the part of Mr Pancks himself. She had left the table half an hour,\n       and was at work alone. Flora had 'gone to lie down' in the next room,\n       concurrently with which retirement a smell of something to drink\n       had broken out in the house. The Patriarch was fast asleep, with his\n       philanthropic mouth open under a yellow pocket-handkerchief in the\n       dining-room. At this quiet time, Mr Pancks softly appeared before her,\n       urbanely nodding.\n\n       'Find it a little dull, Miss Dorrit?' inquired Pancks in a low voice.\n\n       'No, thank you, sir,' said Little Dorrit.\n\n       'Busy, I see,' observed Mr Pancks, stealing into the room by inches.\n       'What are those now, Miss Dorrit?'\n\n       'Handkerchiefs.'\n\n       'Are they, though!' said Pancks. 'I shouldn't have thought it.' Not in\n       the least looking at them, but looking at Little Dorrit. 'Perhaps you\n       wonder who I am. Shall I tell you? I am a fortune-teller.'\n\n       Little Dorrit now began to think he was mad.\n\n       'I belong body and soul to my proprietor,' said Pancks; 'you saw my\n       proprietor having his dinner below. But I do a little in the other way,\n       sometimes; privately, very privately, Miss Dorrit.'\n\n       Little Dorrit looked at him doubtfully, and not without alarm. 'I wish\n       you'd show me the palm of your hand,' said Pancks. 'I should like to\n       have a look at it. Don't let me be troublesome.'\n\n       He was so far troublesome that he was not at all wanted there, but she\n       laid her work in her lap for a moment, and held out her left hand with\n       her thimble on it.\n\n       'Years of toil, eh?' said Pancks, softly, touching it with his blunt\n       forefinger. 'But what else are we made for? Nothing. Hallo!' looking\n       into the lines. 'What's this with bars? It's a College! And what's this\n       with a grey gown and a black velvet cap? it's a father! And what's this\n       with a clarionet? It's an uncle! And what's this in dancing-shoes? It's\n       a sister! And what's this straggling about in an idle sort of a way?\n       It's a brother! And what's this thinking for 'em all? Why, this is you,\n       Miss Dorrit!'\n\n       Her eyes met his as she looked up wonderingly into his face, and she\n       thought that although his were sharp eyes, he was a brighter and\n       gentler-looking man than she had supposed at dinner. His eyes were on\n       her hand again directly, and her opportunity of confirming or correcting\n       the impression was gone.\n\n       'Now, the deuce is in it,' muttered Pancks, tracing out a line in her\n       hand with his clumsy finger, 'if this isn't me in the corner here! What\n       do I want here? What's behind me?'\n\n       He carried his finger slowly down to the wrist, and round the wrist, and\n       affected to look at the back of the hand for what was behind him.\n\n       'Is it any harm?' asked Little Dorrit, smiling.\n\n       'Deuce a bit!' said Pancks. 'What do you think it's worth?'\n\n       'I ought to ask you that. I am not the fortune-teller.'\n\n       'True,' said Pancks. 'What's it worth? You shall live to see, Miss\n       Dorrit.'\n\n       Releasing the hand by slow degrees, he drew all his fingers through his\n       prongs of hair, so that they stood up in their most portentous manner;\n       and repeated slowly, 'Remember what I say, Miss Dorrit. You shall live\n       to see.'\n\n       She could not help showing that she was much surprised, if it were only\n       by his knowing so much about her.\n\n       'Ah! That's it!' said Pancks, pointing at her. 'Miss Dorrit, not that,\n       ever!'\n\n       More surprised than before, and a little more frightened, she looked to\n       him for an explanation of his last words.\n\n       'Not that,' said Pancks, making, with great seriousness, an imitation\n       of a surprised look and manner that appeared to be unintentionally\n       grotesque. 'Don't do that. Never on seeing me, no matter when, no matter\n       where. I am nobody. Don't take on to mind me. Don't mention me. Take no\n       notice. Will you agree, Miss Dorrit?'\n\n       'I hardly know what to say,' returned Little Dorrit, quite astounded.\n       'Why?'\n\n       'Because I am a fortune-teller. Pancks the gipsy. I haven't told you so\n       much of your fortune yet, Miss Dorrit, as to tell you what's behind\n       me on that little hand. I have told you you shall live to see. Is it\n       agreed, Miss Dorrit?'\n\n       'Agreed that I--am--to--'\n\n       'To take no notice of me away from here, unless I take on first. Not\n       to mind me when I come and go. It's very easy. I am no loss, I am not\n       handsome, I am not good company, I am only my proprietors grubber.\n       You need do no more than think, \"Ah! Pancks the gipsy at his\n       fortune-telling--he'll tell the rest of my fortune one day--I shall live\n       to know it.\" Is it agreed, Miss Dorrit?'\n\n       'Ye-es,' faltered Little Dorrit, whom he greatly confused, 'I suppose\n       so, while you do no harm.'\n\n       'Good!' Mr Pancks glanced at the wall of the adjoining room, and stooped\n       forward. 'Honest creature, woman of capital points, but heedless and\n       a loose talker, Miss Dorrit.' With that he rubbed his hands as if the\n       interview had been very satisfactory to him, panted away to the door,\n       and urbanely nodded himself out again.\n\n       If Little Dorrit were beyond measure perplexed by this curious conduct\n       on the part of her new acquaintance, and by finding herself involved\n       in this singular treaty, her perplexity was not diminished by ensuing\n       circumstances. Besides that Mr Pancks took every opportunity afforded\n       him in Mr Casby's house of significantly glancing at her and snorting\n       at her--which was not much, after what he had done already--he began to\n       pervade her daily life. She saw him in the street, constantly. When she\n       went to Mr Casby's, he was always there. When she went to Mrs Clennam's,\n       he came there on any pretence, as if to keep her in his sight. A week\n       had not gone by, when she found him to her astonishment in the Lodge one\n       night, conversing with the turnkey on duty, and to all appearance one\n       of his familiar companions. Her next surprise was to find him equally at\n       his ease within the prison; to hear of his presenting himself among\n       the visitors at her father's Sunday levee; to see him arm in arm with\n       a Collegiate friend about the yard; to learn, from Fame, that he had\n       greatly distinguished himself one evening at the social club that held\n       its meetings in the Snuggery, by addressing a speech to the members\n       of the institution, singing a song, and treating the company to five\n       gallons of ale--report madly added a bushel of shrimps. The effect on\n       Mr Plornish of such of these phenomena as he became an eye-witness of in\n       his faithful visits, made an impression on Little Dorrit only second to\n       that produced by the phenomena themselves. They seemed to gag and bind\n       him. He could only stare, and sometimes weakly mutter that it wouldn't\n       be believed down Bleeding Heart Yard that this was Pancks; but he never\n       said a word more, or made a sign more, even to Little Dorrit. Mr Pancks\n       crowned his mysteries by making himself acquainted with Tip in some\n       unknown manner, and taking a Sunday saunter into the College on that\n       gentleman's arm. Throughout he never took any notice of Little Dorrit,\n       save once or twice when he happened to come close to her and there\n       was no one very near; on which occasions, he said in passing,\n       with a friendly look and a puff of encouragement, 'Pancks the\n       gipsy--fortune-telling.'\n\n       Little Dorrit worked and strove as usual, wondering at all this, but\n       keeping her wonder, as she had from her earliest years kept many heavier\n       loads, in her own breast. A change had stolen, and was stealing yet,\n       over the patient heart. Every day found her something more retiring\n       than the day before. To pass in and out of the prison unnoticed, and\n       elsewhere to be overlooked and forgotten, were, for herself, her chief\n       desires.\n\n       To her own room too, strangely assorted room for her delicate youth\n       and character, she was glad to retreat as often as she could without\n       desertion of any duty. There were afternoon times when she was\n       unemployed, when visitors dropped in to play a hand at cards with her\n       father, when she could be spared and was better away. Then she would\n       flit along the yard, climb the scores of stairs that led to her room,\n       and take her seat at the window. Many combinations did those spikes\n       upon the wall assume, many light shapes did the strong iron weave itself\n       into, many golden touches fell upon the rust, while Little Dorrit sat\n       there musing. New zig-zags sprung into the cruel pattern sometimes, when\n       she saw it through a burst of tears; but beautified or hardened still,\n       always over it and under it and through it, she was fain to look in her\n       solitude, seeing everything with that ineffaceable brand.\n\n       A garret, and a Marshalsea garret without compromise, was Little\n       Dorrit's room. Beautifully kept, it was ugly in itself, and had little\n       but cleanliness and air to set it off; for what embellishment she had\n       ever been able to buy, had gone to her father's room. Howbeit, for this\n       poor place she showed an increasing love; and to sit in it alone became\n       her favourite rest.\n\n       Insomuch, that on a certain afternoon during the Pancks mysteries, when\n       she was seated at her window, and heard Maggy's well-known step coming\n       up the stairs, she was very much disturbed by the apprehension of being\n       summoned away. As Maggy's step came higher up and nearer, she trembled\n       and faltered; and it was as much as she could do to speak, when Maggy at\n       length appeared.\n\n       'Please, Little Mother,' said Maggy, panting for breath, 'you must come\n       down and see him. He's here.'\n\n       'Who, Maggy?'\n\n       'Who, o' course Mr Clennam. He's in your father's room, and he says to\n       me, Maggy, will you be so kind and go and say it's only me.'\n\n       'I am not very well, Maggy. I had better not go. I am going to lie down.\n       See! I lie down now, to ease my head. Say, with my grateful regard, that\n       you left me so, or I would have come.'\n\n       'Well, it an't very polite though, Little Mother,' said the staring\n       Maggy, 'to turn your face away, neither!'\n\n       Maggy was very susceptible to personal slights, and very ingenious in\n       inventing them. 'Putting both your hands afore your face too!' she went\n       on. 'If you can't bear the looks of a poor thing, it would be better to\n       tell her so at once, and not go and shut her out like that, hurting her\n       feelings and breaking her heart at ten year old, poor thing!'\n\n       'It's to ease my head, Maggy.'\n\n       'Well, and if you cry to ease your head, Little Mother, let me cry too.\n       Don't go and have all the crying to yourself,' expostulated Maggy, 'that\n       an't not being greedy.' And immediately\n\n### Summary:\n\n", "answer": "Plornish tells Little Dorrit that she's got a new gig at Flora's place. Little Dorrit is psyched, because a little extra coin is always welcome around the Dorrit household of denial. At the Casby's, Flora is super-duper nice. She makes Little Dorrit eat some food, which immediately marks her as some kind of saint in this novel of horrible, horrible people. But being Flora, she also starts in on the whole doomed-love nonsense between herself and Arthur. Flora tells the whole story of their early love affair, but also kind of makes it sound like now that Mr. F is dead and Flora is newly available, Arthur is going to beat down her door any minute. Little Dorrit listens, doesn't realize that it's all nonsense, and starts to feel sick. But she is nothing if not iron-willed, so she gets it together and starts sewing her handkerchiefs. After a couple of hours, Pancks shows up and starts acting all mysterious and bizarre around Little Dorrit. He tells her that he is a fortune-teller and asks to read her palm. On her palm, he sees all the members of her family, and then himself, doing something. He won't say what. Little Dorrit is obviously weirded out by all of this, but Pancks seems like a nice guy. He tells her not to pay any special attention to him and that at some point he will reveal the rest of her fortune to her. Um, OK. Then he starts popping up everywhere in Little Dorrit's life - at the Clennams' house, at the Casbys' obviously, and even in the Marshalsea. Some time later, Arthur comes to the Marshalsea and sends Maggie to get Little Dorrit. But Little Dorrit is crying in her room and doesn't come down. Instead, she tells Maggie a story. Once upon a time, there was a king who had everything. He had a daughter who was perfect and beautiful. Meanwhile, near the palace lived a tiny young woman who kept a secret shadow hidden in her hut. One day she showed the shadow to the princess, then told the princess that she would keep it hidden forever until her death, at which point it would disappear. And so it happened. The end. Boy, they sure don't make fairy tales like they used to! But Maggie seems into it. Oh, and, guess what, folks? The fairy tale is symbolic! Yes, it may surprise you to learn that it actually is meant to mean something. It's a little ambiguous, but Shmoop is guessing that the king is Casby, the princess is Flora, the young tiny woman is Little Dorrit, and the shadow is... um... some feelings. We'll try to avoid spoilers."}

Dodson and Fogg.\nActing upon this resolution with all the energy and decision of his\ncharacter, he mounted to the back seat of the first coach which left\nIpswich on the morning after the memorable occurrences detailed at\nlength in the two preceding chapters; and accompanied by his three\nfriends, and Mr. Samuel Weller, arrived in the metropolis, in perfect\nhealth and safety, the same evening.\n\nHere the friends, for a short time, separated. Messrs. Tupman, Winkle,\nand Snodgrass repaired to their several homes to make such preparations\nas might be requisite for their forthcoming visit to Dingley Dell; and\nMr. Pickwick and Sam took up their present abode in very good, old-\nfashioned, and comfortable quarters, to wit, the George and Vulture\nTavern and Hotel, George Yard, Lombard Street.\n\nMr. Pickwick had dined, finished his second pint of particular port,\npulled his silk handkerchief over his head, put his feet on the fender,\nand thrown himself back in an easy-chair, when the entrance of Mr.\nWeller with his carpet-bag, aroused him from his tranquil meditation.\n\n'Sam,' said Mr. Pickwick.\n\n'Sir,' said Mr. Weller.\n\n'I have just been thinking, Sam,' said Mr. Pickwick, 'that having left a\ngood many things at Mrs. Bardell's, in Goswell Street, I ought to\narrange for taking them away, before I leave town again.'\n\n'Wery good, sir,' replied Mr. Weller.\n\n'I could send them to Mr. Tupman's, for the present, Sam,' continued Mr.\nPickwick, 'but before we take them away, it is necessary that they\nshould be looked up, and put together. I wish you would step up to\nGoswell Street, Sam, and arrange about it.'\n\n'At once, Sir?' inquired Mr. Weller.\n\n'At once,' replied Mr. Pickwick. 'And stay, Sam,' added Mr. Pickwick,\npulling out his purse, 'there is some rent to pay. The quarter is not\ndue till Christmas, but you may pay it, and have done with it. A month's\nnotice terminates my tenancy. Here it is, written out. Give it, and tell\nMrs. Bardell she may put a bill up, as soon as she likes.'\n\n'Wery good, sir,' replied Mr. Weller; 'anythin' more, sir?'\n\n'Nothing more, Sam.'\n\nMr. Weller stepped slowly to the door, as if he expected something more;\nslowly opened it, slowly stepped out, and had slowly closed it within a\ncouple of inches, when Mr. Pickwick called out--\n\n'Sam.'\n\n'Yes, sir,' said Mr. Weller, stepping quickly back, and closing the door\nbehind him.\n\n'I have no objection, Sam, to your endeavouring to ascertain how Mrs.\nBardell herself seems disposed towards me, and whether it is really\nprobable that this vile and groundless action is to be carried to\nextremity. I say I do not object to you doing this, if you wish it,\nSam,' said Mr. Pickwick.\n\nSam gave a short nod of intelligence, and left the room. Mr. Pickwick\ndrew the silk handkerchief once more over his head, And composed himself\nfor a nap. Mr. Weller promptly walked forth, to execute his commission.\n\nIt was nearly nine o'clock when he reached Goswell Street. A couple of\ncandles were burning in the little front parlour, and a couple of caps\nwere reflected on the window-blind. Mrs. Bardell had got company.\n\nMr. Weller knocked at the door, and after a pretty long interval--\noccupied by the party without, in whistling a tune, and by the party\nwithin, in persuading a refractory flat candle to allow itself to be\nlighted--a pair of small boots pattered over the floor-cloth, and Master\nBardell presented himself.\n\n'Well, young townskip,' said Sam, 'how's mother?'\n\n'She's pretty well,' replied Master Bardell, 'so am I.'\n\n'Well, that's a mercy,' said Sam; 'tell her I want to speak to her, will\nyou, my hinfant fernomenon?'\n\nMaster Bardell, thus adjured, placed the refractory flat candle on the\nbottom stair, and vanished into the front parlour with his message.\n\nThe two caps, reflected on the window-blind, were the respective head-\ndresses of a couple of Mrs. Bardell's most particular acquaintance, who\nhad just stepped in, to have a quiet cup of tea, and a little warm\nsupper of a couple of sets of pettitoes and some toasted cheese. The\ncheese was simmering and browning away, most delightfully, in a little\nDutch oven before the fire; the pettitoes were getting on deliciously in\na little tin saucepan on the hob; and Mrs. Bardell and her two friends\nwere getting on very well, also, in a little quiet conversation about\nand concerning all their particular friends and acquaintance; when\nMaster Bardell came back from answering the door, and delivered the\nmessage intrusted to him by Mr. Samuel Weller.\n\n'Mr. Pickwick's servant!' said Mrs. Bardell, turning pale.\n\n'Bless my soul!' said Mrs. Cluppins.\n\n'Well, I raly would not ha' believed it, unless I had ha' happened to\nha' been here!' said Mrs. Sanders.\n\nMrs. Cluppins was a little, brisk, busy-looking woman; Mrs. Sanders was\na big, fat, heavy-faced personage; and the two were the company.\n\nMrs. Bardell felt it proper to be agitated; and as none of the three\nexactly knew whether under existing circumstances, any communication,\notherwise than through Dodson & Fogg, ought to be held with Mr.\nPickwick's servant, they were all rather taken by surprise. In this\nstate of indecision, obviously the first thing to be done, was to thump\nthe boy for finding Mr. Weller at the door. So his mother thumped him,\nand he cried melodiously.\n\n'Hold your noise--do--you naughty creetur!' said Mrs. Bardell.\n\n'Yes; don't worrit your poor mother,' said Mrs. Sanders.\n\n'She's quite enough to worrit her, as it is, without you, Tommy,' said\nMrs. Cluppins, with sympathising resignation.\n\n'Ah! worse luck, poor lamb!' said Mrs. Sanders.\n\nAt all which moral reflections, Master Bardell howled the louder.\n\n'Now, what shall I do?' said Mrs. Bardell to Mrs. Cluppins.\n\n'I think you ought to see him,' replied Mrs. Cluppins. 'But on no\naccount without a witness.'\n\n'I think two witnesses would be more lawful,' said Mrs. Sanders, who,\nlike the other friend, was bursting with curiosity.\n\n'Perhaps he'd better come in here,' said Mrs. Bardell.\n\n'To be sure,' replied Mrs. Cluppins, eagerly catching at the idea; 'walk\nin, young man; and shut the street door first, please.'\n\nMr. Weller immediately took the hint; and presenting himself in the\nparlour, explained his business to Mrs. Bardell thus--\n\n'Wery sorry to 'casion any personal inconwenience, ma'am, as the\nhousebreaker said to the old lady when he put her on the fire; but as me\nand my governor 's only jest come to town, and is jest going away agin,\nit can't be helped, you see.'\n\n'Of course, the young man can't help the faults of his master,' said\nMrs. Cluppins, much struck by Mr. Weller's appearance and conversation.\n\n'Certainly not,' chimed in Mrs. Sanders, who, from certain wistful\nglances at the little tin saucepan, seemed to be engaged in a mental\ncalculation of the probable extent of the pettitoes, in the event of\nSam's being asked to stop to supper.\n\n'So all I've come about, is jest this here,' said Sam, disregarding the\ninterruption; 'first, to give my governor's notice--there it is.\nSecondly, to pay the rent--here it is. Thirdly, to say as all his things\nis to be put together, and give to anybody as we sends for 'em.\nFourthly, that you may let the place as soon as you like--and that's\nall.'\n\n'Whatever has happened,' said Mrs. Bardell, 'I always have said, and\nalways will say, that in every respect but one, Mr. Pickwick has always\nbehaved himself like a perfect gentleman. His money always as good as\nthe bank--always.'\n\nAs Mrs. Bardell said this, she applied her handkerchief to her eyes, and\nwent out of the room to get the receipt.\n\nSam well knew that he had only to remain quiet, and the women were sure\nto talk; so he looked alternately at the tin saucepan, the toasted\ncheese, the wall, and the ceiling, in profound silence.\n\n'Poor dear!' said Mrs. Cluppins.\n\n'Ah, poor thing!' replied Mrs. Sanders.\n\nSam said nothing. He saw they were coming to the subject.\n\n'I raly cannot contain myself,' said Mrs. Cluppins, 'when I think of\nsuch perjury. I don't wish to say anything to make you uncomfortable,\nyoung man, but your master's an old brute, and I wish I had him here to\ntell him so.'\n\nI wish you had,' said Sam.\n\n'To see how dreadful she takes on, going moping about, and taking no\npleasure in nothing, except when her friends comes in, out of charity,\nto sit with her, and make her comfortable,' resumed Mrs. Cluppins,\nglancing at the tin saucepan and the Dutch oven, 'it's shocking!'\n\n'Barbareous,' said Mrs. Sanders.\n\n'And your master, young man! A gentleman with money, as could never feel\nthe expense of a wife, no more than nothing,' continued Mrs. Cluppins,\nwith great volubility; 'why there ain't the faintest shade of an excuse\nfor his behaviour! Why don't he marry her?'\n\n'Ah,' said Sam, 'to be sure; that's the question.'\n\n'Question, indeed,' retorted Mrs. Cluppins, 'she'd question him, if\nshe'd my spirit. Hows'ever, there is law for us women, mis'rable\ncreeturs as they'd make us, if they could; and that your master will\nfind out, young man, to his cost, afore he's six months older.'\n\nAt this consolatory reflection, Mrs. Cluppins bridled up, and smiled at\nMrs. Sanders, who smiled back again.\n\n'The action's going on, and no mistake,' thought Sam, as Mrs. Bardell\nre-entered with the receipt.\n\n'Here's the receipt, Mr. Weller,' said Mrs. Bardell, 'and here's the\nchange, and I hope you'll take a little drop of something to keep the\ncold out, if it's only for old acquaintance' sake, Mr. Weller.'\n\nSam saw the advantage he should gain, and at once acquiesced; whereupon\nMrs. Bardell produced, from a small closet, a black bottle and a wine-\nglass; and so great was her abstraction, in her deep mental affliction,\nthat, after filling Mr. Weller's glass, she brought out three more wine-\nglasses, and filled them too.\n\n'Lauk, Mrs. Bardell,' said Mrs. Cluppins, 'see what you've been and\ndone!'\n\n'Well, that is a good one!' ejaculated Mrs. Sanders.\n\n'Ah, my poor head!' said Mrs. Bardell, with a faint smile.\n\nSam understood all this, of course, so he said at once, that he never\ncould drink before supper, unless a lady drank with him. A great deal of\nlaughter ensued, and Mrs. Sanders volunteered to humour him, so she took\na slight sip out of her glass. Then Sam said it must go all round, so\nthey all took a slight sip. Then little Mrs. Cluppins proposed as a\ntoast, 'Success to Bardell agin Pickwick'; and then the ladies emptied\ntheir glasses in honour of the sentiment, and got very talkative\ndirectly.\n\n'I suppose you've heard what's going forward, Mr. Weller?' said Mrs.\nBardell.\n\n'I've heerd somethin' on it,' replied Sam.\n\n'It's a terrible thing to be dragged before the public, in that way, Mr.\nWeller,' said Mrs. Bardell; 'but I see now, that it's the only thing I\nought to do, and my lawyers, Mr. Dodson and Fogg, tell me that, with the\nevidence as we shall call, we must succeed. I don't know what I should\ndo, Mr. Weller, if I didn't.'\n\nThe mere idea of Mrs. Bardell's failing in her action, affected Mrs.\nSanders so deeply, that she was under the necessity of refilling and re-\nemptying her glass immediately; feeling, as she said afterwards, that if\nshe hadn't had the presence of mind to do so, she must have dropped.\n\n'Ven is it expected to come on?' inquired Sam.\n\n'Either in February or March,' replied Mrs. Bardell.\n\n'What a number of witnesses there'll be, won't there?' said Mrs.\nCluppins.\n\n'Ah! won't there!' replied Mrs. Sanders.\n\n'And won't Mr. Dodson and Fogg be wild if the plaintiff shouldn't get\nit?' added Mrs. Cluppins, 'when they do it all on speculation!'\n\n'Ah! won't they!' said Mrs. Sanders.\n\n'But the plaintiff must get it,' resumed Mrs. Cluppins.\n\n'I hope so,' said Mrs. Bardell.\n\n'Oh, there can't be any doubt about it,' rejoined Mrs. Sanders.\n\n'Vell,' said Sam, rising and setting down his glass, 'all I can say is,\nthat I vish you _may _get it.'\n\n'Thank'ee, Mr. Weller,' said Mrs. Bardell fervently.\n\n'And of them Dodson and Foggs, as does these sort o' things on spec,'\ncontinued Mr. Weller, 'as vell as for the other kind and gen'rous people\no' the same purfession, as sets people by the ears, free gratis for\nnothin', and sets their clerks to work to find out little disputes among\ntheir neighbours and acquaintances as vants settlin' by means of\nlawsuits--all I can say o' them is, that I vish they had the reward I'd\ngive 'em.'\n\n'Ah, I wish they had the reward that every kind and generous heart would\nbe inclined to bestow upon them!' said the gratified Mrs. Bardell.\n\n'Amen to that,' replied Sam, 'and a fat and happy liven' they'd get out\nof it! Wish you good-night, ladies.'\n\nTo the great relief of Mrs. Sanders, Sam was allowed to depart without\nany reference, on the part of the hostess, to the pettitoes and toasted\ncheese; to which the ladies, with such juvenile assistance as Master\nBardell could afford, soon afterwards rendered the amplest justice--\nindeed they wholly vanished before their strenuous exertions.\n\nMr. Weller wended his way back to the George and Vulture, and faithfully\nrecounted to his master, such indications of the sharp practice of\nDodson & Fogg, as he had contrived to pick up in his visit to Mrs.\nBardell's. An interview with Mr. Perker, next day, more than confirmed\nMr. Weller's statement; and Mr. Pickwick was fain to prepare for his\nChristmas visit to Dingley Dell, with the pleasant anticipation that\nsome two or three months afterwards, an action brought against him for\ndamages sustained by reason of a breach of promise of marriage, would be\npublicly tried in the Court of Common Pleas; the plaintiff having all\nthe advantages derivable, not only from the force of circumstances, but\nfrom the sharp practice of Dodson & Fogg to boot.\n\n\nThere still remaining an interval of two days before the time agreed\nupon for the departure of the Pickwickians to Dingley Dell, Mr. Weller\nsat himself down in a back room at the George and Vulture, after eating\nan early dinner, to muse on the best way of disposing of his time. It\nwas a remarkably fine day; and he had not turned the matter over in his\nmind ten minutes, when he was suddenly stricken filial and affectionate;\nand it occurred to him so strongly that he ought to go down and see his\nfather, and pay his duty to his mother-in-law, that he was lost in\nastonishment at his own remissness in never thinking of this moral\nobligation before. Anxious to atone for his past neglect without another\nhour's delay, he straightway walked upstairs to Mr. Pickwick, and\nrequested leave of absence for this laudable purpose.\n\n'Certainly, Sam, certainly,' said Mr. Pickwick, his eyes glistening with\ndelight at this manifestation of filial feeling on the part of his\nattendant; 'certainly, Sam.'\n\nMr. Weller made a grateful bow.\n\n'I am very glad to see that you have so high a sense of your duties as a\nson, Sam,' said Mr. Pickwick.\n\n'I always had, sir,' replied Mr. Weller.\n\n'That's a very gratifying reflection, Sam,' said Mr. Pickwick\napprovingly.\n\n'Wery, Sir,' replied Mr. Weller; 'if ever I wanted anythin' o' my\nfather, I always asked for it in a wery 'spectful and obligin' manner.\nIf he didn't give it me, I took it, for fear I should be led to do\nanythin' wrong, through not havin' it. I saved him a world o' trouble\nthis vay, Sir.'\n\n'That's not precisely what I meant, Sam,' said Mr. Pickwick, shaking his\nhead, with a slight smile.\n\n'All good feelin', sir--the wery best intentions, as the gen'l'm'n said\nven he run away from his wife 'cos she seemed unhappy with him,' replied\nMr. Weller.\n\n'You may go, Sam,' said Mr. Pickwick.\n\n'Thank'ee, Sir,' replied Mr. Weller; and having made his best bow, and\nput on his best clothes, Sam planted himself on the top of the Arundel\ncoach, and journeyed on to Dorking.\n\nThe Marquis of Granby, in Mrs. Weller's time, was quite a model of a\nroadside public-house of the better class--just large enough to be\nconvenient, and small enough to be snug. On the opposite side of the\nroad was a large sign-board on a high post, representing the head and\nshoulders of a gentleman with an apoplectic countenance, in a red coat\nwith deep blue facings, and a touch of the same blue over his three-\ncornered hat, for a sky. Over that again were a pair of flags; beneath\nthe last button of his coat were a couple of cannon; and the whole\nformed an expressive and undoubted likeness of the Marquis of Granby of\nglorious memory. The bar window displayed a choice collection of\ngeranium plants, and a well-dusted row of spirit phials. The open\nshutters bore a variety of golden inscriptions, eulogistic of good beds\nand neat wines; and the choice group of countrymen and hostlers lounging\nabout the stable door and horse-trough, afforded presumptive proof of\nthe excellent quality of the ale and spirits which were sold within. Sam\nWeller paused, when he dismounted from the coach, to note all these\nlittle indications of a thriving business, with the eye of an\nexperienced traveller; and having done so, stepped in at once, highly\nsatisfied with everything he had observed.\n\n'Now, then!' said a shrill female voice the instant Sam thrust his head\nin at the door, 'what do you want, young man?'\n\nSam looked round in the direction whence the voice proceeded. It came\nfrom a rather stout lady of comfortable appearance, who was seated\nbeside the fireplace in the bar, blowing the fire to make the kettle\nboil for tea. She was not alone; for on the other side of the fireplace,\nsitting bolt upright in a high-backed chair, was a man in threadbare\nblack clothes, with a back almost as long and stiff as that of the chair\nitself, who caught Sam's most particular and especial attention at once.\n\nHe was a prim-faced, red-nosed man, with a long, thin countenance, and a\nsemi-rattlesnake sort of eye--rather sharp, but decidedly bad. He wore\nvery short trousers, and black cotton stockings, which, like the rest of\nhis apparel, were particularly rusty. His looks were starched, but his\nwhite neckerchief was not, and its long limp ends straggled over his\nclosely-buttoned waistcoat in a very uncouth and unpicturesque fashion.\nA pair of old, worn, beaver gloves, a broad-brimmed hat, and a faded\ngreen umbrella, with plenty of whalebone sticking through the bottom, as\nif to counterbalance the want of a handle at the top, lay on a chair\nbeside him; and, being disposed in a very tidy and careful manner,\nseemed to imply that the red-nosed man, whoever he was, had no intention\nof going away in a hurry.\n\nTo do the red-nosed man justice, he would have been very far from wise\nif he had entertained any such intention; for, to judge from all\nappearances, he must have been possessed of a most desirable circle of\nacquaintance, if he could have reasonably expected to be more\ncomfortable anywhere else. The fire was blazing brightly under the\ninfluence of the bellows, and the kettle was singing gaily under the\ninfluence of both. A small tray of tea-things was arranged on the table;\na plate of hot buttered toast was gently simmering before the fire; and\nthe red-nosed man himself was busily engaged in converting a large slice\nof bread into the same agreeable edible, through the instrumentality of\na long brass toasting-fork. Beside him stood a glass of reeking hot\npine-apple rum-and-water, with a slice of lemon in it; and every time\nthe red-nosed man stopped to bring the round of toast to his eye, with\nthe view of ascertaining how it got on, he imbibed a drop or two of the\nhot pine-apple rum-and-water, and smiled upon the rather stout lady, as\nshe blew the fire.\n\nSam was so lost in the contemplation of this comfortable scene, that he\nsuffered the first inquiry of the rather stout lady to pass unheeded. It\nwas not until it had been twice repeated, each time in a shriller tone,\nthat he became conscious of the impropriety of his behaviour.\n\n'Governor in?' inquired Sam, in reply to the question.\n\n'No, he isn't,' replied Mrs. Weller; for the rather stout lady was no\nother than the quondam relict and sole executrix of the dead-and-gone\nMr. Clarke; 'no, he isn't, and I don't expect him, either.'\n\n'I suppose he's drivin' up to-day?' said Sam.\n\n'He may be, or he may not,' replied Mrs. Weller, buttering the round of\ntoast which the red-nosed man had just finished. 'I don't know, and,\nwhat's more, I don't care.--Ask a blessin', Mr. Stiggins.'\n\nThe red-nosed man did as he was desired, and instantly commenced on the\ntoast with fierce voracity.\n\nThe appearance of the red-nosed man had induced Sam, at first sight, to\nmore than half suspect that he was the deputy-shepherd of whom his\nestimable parent had spoken. The moment he saw him eat, all doubt on the\nsubject was removed, and he perceived at once that if he purposed to\ntake up his temporary quarters where he was, he must make his footing\ngood without delay. He therefore commenced proceedings by putting his\narm over the half-door of the bar, coolly unbolting it, and leisurely\nwalking in.\n\n'Mother-in-law,' said Sam, 'how are you?'\n\n'Why, I do believe he is a Weller!' said Mrs. W., raising her eyes to\nSam's face, with no very gratified expression of countenance.\n\n'I rayther think he is,' said the imperturbable Sam; 'and I hope this\nhere reverend gen'l'm'n 'll excuse me saying that I wish I was _the\n_Weller as owns you, mother-in-law.'\n\nThis was a double-barrelled compliment. It implied that Mrs. Weller was\na most agreeable female, and also that Mr. Stiggins had a clerical\nappearance. It made a visible impression at once; and Sam followed up\nhis advantage by kissing his mother-in-law.\n\n'Get along with you!' said Mrs. Weller, pushing him away.\n\n'For shame, young man!' said the gentleman with the red nose.\n\n'No offence, sir, no offence,' replied Sam; 'you're wery right, though;\nit ain't the right sort o' thing, ven mothers-in-law is young and good-\nlooking, is it, Sir?'\n\n'It's all vanity,' said Mr. Stiggins.\n\n'Ah, so it is,' said Mrs. Weller, setting her cap to rights.\n\nSam thought it was, too, but he held his peace.\n\nThe deputy-shepherd seemed by no means best pleased with Sam's arrival;\nand when the first effervescence of the compliment had subsided, even\nMrs. Weller looked as if she could have spared him without the smallest\ninconvenience. However, there he was; and as he couldn't be decently\nturned out, they all three sat down to tea.\n\n'And how's father?' said Sam.\n\nAt this inquiry, Mrs. Weller raised her hands, and turned up her eyes,\nas if the subject were too painful to be alluded to.\n\nMr. Stiggins groaned.\n\n'What's the matter with that 'ere gen'l'm'n?' inquired Sam.\n\n'He's shocked at the way your father goes on in,' replied Mrs. Weller.\n\n'Oh, he is, is he?' said Sam.\n\n'And with too good reason,' added Mrs. Weller gravely.\n\nMr. Stiggins took up a fresh piece of toast, and groaned heavily.\n\n'He is a dreadful reprobate,' said Mrs. Weller.\n\n'A man of wrath!' exclaimed Mr. Stiggins. He took a large semi-circular\nbite out of the toast, and groaned again.\n\nSam felt very strongly disposed to give the reverend Mr. Stiggins\nsomething to groan for, but he repressed his inclination, and merely\nasked, 'What's the old 'un up to now?'\n\n'Up to, indeed!' said Mrs. Weller, 'Oh, he has a hard heart. Night after\nnight does this excellent man--don't frown, Mr. Stiggins; I _will _say\nyou _are _an excellent man--come and sit here, for hours together, and\nit has not the least effect upon him.'\n\nWell, that is odd,' said Sam; 'it 'ud have a wery considerable effect\nupon me, if I wos in his place; I know that.'\n\n'The fact is, my young friend,' said Mr. Stiggins solemnly, 'he has an\nobderrate bosom. Oh, my young friend, who else could have resisted the\npleading of sixteen of our fairest sisters, and withstood their\nexhortations to subscribe to our noble society for providing the infant\nnegroes in the West Indies with flannel waistcoats and moral pocket-\nhandkerchiefs?'\n\n'What's a moral pocket-ankercher?' said Sam; 'I never see one o' them\narticles o' furniter.'\n\n'Those which combine amusement With instruction, my young friend,'\nreplied Mr. Stiggins, 'blending select tales with wood-cuts.'\n\n'Oh, I know,' said Sam; 'them as hangs up in the linen-drapers' shops,\nwith beggars' petitions and all that 'ere upon 'em?'\n\nMr. Stiggins began a third round of toast, and nodded assent.\n\n'And he wouldn't be persuaded by the ladies, wouldn't he?' said Sam.\n\n'Sat and smoked his pipe, and said the infant negroes were--what did he\nsay the infant negroes were?' said Mrs. Weller.\n\n'Little humbugs,' replied Mr. Stiggins, deeply affected.\n\n'Said the infant negroes were little humbugs,' repeated Mrs. Weller. And\nthey both groaned at the atrocious conduct of the elder Mr. Weller.\n\nA great many more iniquities of a similar nature might have been\ndisclosed, only the toast being all eaten, the tea having got very weak,\nand Sam holding out no indications of meaning to go, Mr. Stiggins\nsuddenly recollected that he had a most pressing appointment with the\nshepherd, and took himself off accordingly.\n\nThe tea-things had been scarcely put away, and the hearth swept up, when\nthe London coach deposited Mr. Weller, senior, at the door; his legs\ndeposited him in the bar; and his eyes showed him his son.\n\n'What, Sammy!' exclaimed the father.\n\n'What, old Nobs!' ejaculated the son. And they shook hands heartily.\n\n'Wery glad to see you, Sammy,' said the elder Mr. Weller, 'though how\nyou've managed to get over your mother-in-law, is a mystery to me. I\nonly vish you'd write me out the receipt, that's all.'\n\n'Hush!' said Sam, 'she's at home, old feller.'\n\nShe ain't vithin hearin',' replied Mr. Weller; 'she always goes and\nblows up, downstairs, for a couple of hours arter tea; so we'll just\ngive ourselves a damp, Sammy.'\n\nSaying this, Mr. Weller mixed two glasses of spirits-and-water, and\nproduced a couple of pipes. The father and son sitting down opposite\neach other; Sam on one side of the fire, in the high-backed chair, and\nMr. Weller, senior, on the other, in an easy ditto, they proceeded to\nenjoy themselves with all due gravity.\n\n'Anybody been here, Sammy?' asked Mr. Weller, senior, dryly, after a\nlong silence.\n\nSam nodded an expressive assent.\n\n'Red-nosed chap?' inquired Mr. Weller.\n\nSam nodded again.\n\n'Amiable man that 'ere, Sammy,' said Mr. Weller, smoking violently.\n\n'Seems so,' observed Sam.\n\n'Good hand at accounts,' said Mr. Weller. 'Is he?' said Sam.\n\n'Borrows eighteenpence on Monday, and comes on Tuesday for a shillin' to\nmake it up half-a-crown; calls again on Vensday for another half-crown\nto make it five shillin's; and goes on, doubling, till he gets it up to\na five pund note in no time, like them sums in the 'rithmetic book 'bout\nthe nails in the horse's shoes, Sammy.'\n\nSam intimated by a nod that he recollected the problem alluded to by his\nparent.\n\n'So you vouldn't subscribe to the flannel veskits?' said Sam, after\nanother interval of smoking.\n\n'Cert'nly not,' replied Mr. Weller; 'what's the good o' flannel veskits\nto the young niggers abroad? But I'll tell you what it is, Sammy,' said\nMr. Weller, lowering his voice, and bending across the fireplace; 'I'd\ncome down wery handsome\n\n### Summary:\n\n", "answer": "Mr. Pickwick makes arrangements to move out of Mrs. Bardell's house and into a hotel. He sends Sam Weller to pay the rent, give a month's notice, and see about having his possessions moved. Sam is also supposed to find out what is taking place with regard to the lawsuit. Sam's arrival throws Mrs. Bardell and two visiting neighbors into a flurry, but his apparent sympathy invites them to discuss the suit. Sam learns that Mrs. Bardell intends to take Mr. Pickwick to court, and that Dodson and Fogg have a good chance of winning, since they took the case on speculation. Sam reports this to Mr. Pickwick, who is making preparations for his Christmas visit to Dingley Dell. Sam takes two days' leave from Mr. Pickwick to visit his father at Dorking. He finds his stepmother sitting with a seedy, gluttonous evangelist, neither of whom is very pleased to see him. The Reverend Stiggins and Susan Weller are self-righteously united against Sam's father, Tony. It is obvious that Stiggins takes advantage of the Wellers. Mr. Weller arrives and greets Sam warmly, and the two of them discuss Stiggins' hypocrisy. Before he leaves the next day, Sam tells his father that he would get rid of Stiggins, to which Tony replies that it is one of the burdens of marriage."}

One Night\n\n\nNever did the sun go down with a brighter glory on the quiet corner in\nSoho, than one memorable evening when the Doctor and his daughter sat\nunder the plane-tree together. Never did the moon rise with a milder\nradiance over great London, than on that night when it found them still\nseated under the tree, and shone upon their faces through its leaves.\n\nLucie was to be married to-morrow. She had reserved this last evening\nfor her father, and they sat alone under the plane-tree.\n\n\"You are happy, my dear father?\"\n\n\"Quite, my child.\"\n\nThey had said little, though they had been there a long time. When it\nwas yet light enough to work and read, she had neither engaged herself\nin her usual work, nor had she read to him. She had employed herself in\nboth ways, at his side under the tree, many and many a time; but, this\ntime was not quite like any other, and nothing could make it so.\n\n\"And I am very happy to-night, dear father. I am deeply happy in the\nlove that Heaven has so blessed--my love for Charles, and Charles's love\nfor me. But, if my life were not to be still consecrated to you, or\nif my marriage were so arranged as that it would part us, even by\nthe length of a few of these streets, I should be more unhappy and\nself-reproachful now than I can tell you. Even as it is--\"\n\nEven as it was, she could not command her voice.\n\nIn the sad moonlight, she clasped him by the neck, and laid her face\nupon his breast. In the moonlight which is always sad, as the light of\nthe sun itself is--as the light called human life is--at its coming and\nits going.\n\n\"Dearest dear! Can you tell me, this last time, that you feel quite,\nquite sure, no new affections of mine, and no new duties of mine, will\never interpose between us? _I_ know it well, but do you know it? In your\nown heart, do you feel quite certain?\"\n\nHer father answered, with a cheerful firmness of conviction he could\nscarcely have assumed, \"Quite sure, my darling! More than that,\" he\nadded, as he tenderly kissed her: \"my future is far brighter, Lucie,\nseen through your marriage, than it could have been--nay, than it ever\nwas--without it.\"\n\n\"If I could hope _that_, my father!--\"\n\n\"Believe it, love! Indeed it is so. Consider how natural and how plain\nit is, my dear, that it should be so. You, devoted and young, cannot\nfully appreciate the anxiety I have felt that your life should not be\nwasted--\"\n\nShe moved her hand towards his lips, but he took it in his, and repeated\nthe word.\n\n\"--wasted, my child--should not be wasted, struck aside from the\nnatural order of things--for my sake. Your unselfishness cannot entirely\ncomprehend how much my mind has gone on this; but, only ask yourself,\nhow could my happiness be perfect, while yours was incomplete?\"\n\n\"If I had never seen Charles, my father, I should have been quite happy\nwith you.\"\n\nHe smiled at her unconscious admission that she would have been unhappy\nwithout Charles, having seen him; and replied:\n\n\"My child, you did see him, and it is Charles. If it had not been\nCharles, it would have been another. Or, if it had been no other, I\nshould have been the cause, and then the dark part of my life would have\ncast its shadow beyond myself, and would have fallen on you.\"\n\nIt was the first time, except at the trial, of her ever hearing him\nrefer to the period of his suffering. It gave her a strange and new\nsensation while his words were in her ears; and she remembered it long\nafterwards.\n\n\"See!\" said the Doctor of Beauvais, raising his hand towards the moon.\n\"I have looked at her from my prison-window, when I could not bear her\nlight. I have looked at her when it has been such torture to me to think\nof her shining upon what I had lost, that I have beaten my head against\nmy prison-walls. I have looked at her, in a state so dull and lethargic,\nthat I have thought of nothing but the number of horizontal lines I\ncould draw across her at the full, and the number of perpendicular lines\nwith which I could intersect them.\" He added in his inward and pondering\nmanner, as he looked at the moon, \"It was twenty either way, I remember,\nand the twentieth was difficult to squeeze in.\"\n\nThe strange thrill with which she heard him go back to that time,\ndeepened as he dwelt upon it; but, there was nothing to shock her in\nthe manner of his reference. He only seemed to contrast his present\ncheerfulness and felicity with the dire endurance that was over.\n\n\"I have looked at her, speculating thousands of times upon the unborn\nchild from whom I had been rent. Whether it was alive. Whether it had\nbeen born alive, or the poor mother's shock had killed it. Whether it\nwas a son who would some day avenge his father. (There was a time in my\nimprisonment, when my desire for vengeance was unbearable.) Whether it\nwas a son who would never know his father's story; who might even live\nto weigh the possibility of his father's having disappeared of his own\nwill and act. Whether it was a daughter who would grow to be a woman.\"\n\nShe drew closer to him, and kissed his cheek and his hand.\n\n\"I have pictured my daughter, to myself, as perfectly forgetful of\nme--rather, altogether ignorant of me, and unconscious of me. I have\ncast up the years of her age, year after year. I have seen her married\nto a man who knew nothing of my fate. I have altogether perished from\nthe remembrance of the living, and in the next generation my place was a\nblank.\"\n\n\"My father! Even to hear that you had such thoughts of a daughter who\nnever existed, strikes to my heart as if I had been that child.\"\n\n\"You, Lucie? It is out of the Consolation and restoration you have\nbrought to me, that these remembrances arise, and pass between us and\nthe moon on this last night.--What did I say just now?\"\n\n\"She knew nothing of you. She cared nothing for you.\"\n\n\"So! But on other moonlight nights, when the sadness and the silence\nhave touched me in a different way--have affected me with something as\nlike a sorrowful sense of peace, as any emotion that had pain for its\nfoundations could--I have imagined her as coming to me in my cell, and\nleading me out into the freedom beyond the fortress. I have seen her\nimage in the moonlight often, as I now see you; except that I never held\nher in my arms; it stood between the little grated window and the door.\nBut, you understand that that was not the child I am speaking of?\"\n\n\"The figure was not; the--the--image; the fancy?\"\n\n\"No. That was another thing. It stood before my disturbed sense of\nsight, but it never moved. The phantom that my mind pursued, was another\nand more real child. Of her outward appearance I know no more than\nthat she was like her mother. The other had that likeness too--as you\nhave--but was not the same. Can you follow me, Lucie? Hardly, I think?\nI doubt you must have been a solitary prisoner to understand these\nperplexed distinctions.\"\n\nHis collected and calm manner could not prevent her blood from running\ncold, as he thus tried to anatomise his old condition.\n\n\"In that more peaceful state, I have imagined her, in the moonlight,\ncoming to me and taking me out to show me that the home of her married\nlife was full of her loving remembrance of her lost father. My picture\nwas in her room, and I was in her prayers. Her life was active,\ncheerful, useful; but my poor history pervaded it all.\"\n\n\"I was that child, my father, I was not half so good, but in my love\nthat was I.\"\n\n\"And she showed me her children,\" said the Doctor of Beauvais, \"and\nthey had heard of me, and had been taught to pity me. When they passed\na prison of the State, they kept far from its frowning walls, and looked\nup at its bars, and spoke in whispers. She could never deliver me; I\nimagined that she always brought me back after showing me such things.\nBut then, blessed with the relief of tears, I fell upon my knees, and\nblessed her.\"\n\n\"I am that child, I hope, my father. O my dear, my dear, will you bless\nme as fervently to-morrow?\"\n\n\"Lucie, I recall these old troubles in the reason that I have to-night\nfor loving you better than words can tell, and thanking God for my great\nhappiness. My thoughts, when they were wildest, never rose near the\nhappiness that I have known with you, and that we have before us.\"\n\nHe embraced her, solemnly commended her to Heaven, and humbly thanked\nHeaven for having bestowed her on him. By-and-bye, they went into the\nhouse.\n\nThere was no one bidden to the marriage but Mr. Lorry; there was even to\nbe no bridesmaid but the gaunt Miss Pross. The marriage was to make no\nchange in their place of residence; they had been able to extend it,\nby taking to themselves the upper rooms formerly belonging to the\napocryphal invisible lodger, and they desired nothing more.\n\nDoctor Manette was very cheerful at the little supper. They were only\nthree at table, and Miss Pross made the third. He regretted that Charles\nwas not there; was more than half disposed to object to the loving\nlittle plot that kept him away; and drank to him affectionately.\n\nSo, the time came for him to bid Lucie good night, and they separated.\nBut, in the stillness of the third hour of the morning, Lucie came\ndownstairs again, and stole into his room; not free from unshaped fears,\nbeforehand.\n\nAll things, however, were in their places; all was quiet; and he lay\nasleep, his white hair picturesque on the untroubled pillow, and his\nhands lying quiet on the coverlet. She put her needless candle in the\nshadow at a distance, crept up to his bed, and put her lips to his;\nthen, leaned over him, and looked at him.\n\nInto his handsome face, the bitter waters of captivity had worn; but, he\ncovered up their tracks with a determination so strong, that he held the\nmastery of them even in his sleep. A more remarkable face in its quiet,\nresolute, and guarded struggle with an unseen assailant, was not to be\nbeheld in all the wide dominions of sleep, that night.\n\nShe timidly laid her hand on his dear breast, and put up a prayer that\nshe might ever be as true to him as her love aspired to be, and as his\nsorrows deserved. Then, she withdrew her hand, and kissed his lips once\nmore, and went away. So, the sunrise came, and the shadows of the leaves\nof the plane-tree moved upon his face, as softly as her lips had moved\nin praying for him.\n\n\n\n\n\nXVIII. Nine Days\n\n\nThe marriage-day was shining brightly, and they were ready outside the\nclosed door of the Doctor's room, where he was speaking with Charles\nDarnay. They were ready to go to church; the beautiful bride, Mr.\nLorry, and Miss Pross--to whom the event, through a gradual process of\nreconcilement to the inevitable, would have been one of absolute bliss,\nbut for the yet lingering consideration that her brother Solomon should\nhave been the bridegroom.\n\n\"And so,\" said Mr. Lorry, who could not sufficiently admire the bride,\nand who had been moving round her to take in every point of her quiet,\npretty dress; \"and so it was for this, my sweet Lucie, that I brought\nyou across the Channel, such a baby! Lord bless me! How little I thought\nwhat I was doing! How lightly I valued the obligation I was conferring\non my friend Mr. Charles!\"\n\n\"You didn't mean it,\" remarked the matter-of-fact Miss Pross, \"and\ntherefore how could you know it? Nonsense!\"\n\n\"Really? Well; but don't cry,\" said the gentle Mr. Lorry.\n\n\"I am not crying,\" said Miss Pross; \"_you_ are.\"\n\n\"I, my Pross?\" (By this time, Mr. Lorry dared to be pleasant with her,\non occasion.)\n\n\"You were, just now; I saw you do it, and I don't wonder at it. Such\na present of plate as you have made 'em, is enough to bring tears into\nanybody's eyes. There's not a fork or a spoon in the collection,\" said\nMiss Pross, \"that I didn't cry over, last night after the box came, till\nI couldn't see it.\"\n\n\"I am highly gratified,\" said Mr. Lorry, \"though, upon my honour, I\nhad no intention of rendering those trifling articles of remembrance\ninvisible to any one. Dear me! This is an occasion that makes a man\nspeculate on all he has lost. Dear, dear, dear! To think that there\nmight have been a Mrs. Lorry, any time these fifty years almost!\"\n\n\"Not at all!\" From Miss Pross.\n\n\"You think there never might have been a Mrs. Lorry?\" asked the\ngentleman of that name.\n\n\"Pooh!\" rejoined Miss Pross; \"you were a bachelor in your cradle.\"\n\n\"Well!\" observed Mr. Lorry, beamingly adjusting his little wig, \"that\nseems probable, too.\"\n\n\"And you were cut out for a bachelor,\" pursued Miss Pross, \"before you\nwere put in your cradle.\"\n\n\"Then, I think,\" said Mr. Lorry, \"that I was very unhandsomely dealt\nwith, and that I ought to have had a voice in the selection of my\npattern. Enough! Now, my dear Lucie,\" drawing his arm soothingly round\nher waist, \"I hear them moving in the next room, and Miss Pross and\nI, as two formal folks of business, are anxious not to lose the final\nopportunity of saying something to you that you wish to hear. You leave\nyour good father, my dear, in hands as earnest and as loving as your\nown; he shall be taken every conceivable care of; during the next\nfortnight, while you are in Warwickshire and thereabouts, even Tellson's\nshall go to the wall (comparatively speaking) before him. And when, at\nthe fortnight's end, he comes to join you and your beloved husband, on\nyour other fortnight's trip in Wales, you shall say that we have sent\nhim to you in the best health and in the happiest frame. Now, I hear\nSomebody's step coming to the door. Let me kiss my dear girl with an\nold-fashioned bachelor blessing, before Somebody comes to claim his\nown.\"\n\nFor a moment, he held the fair face from him to look at the\nwell-remembered expression on the forehead, and then laid the bright\ngolden hair against his little brown wig, with a genuine tenderness and\ndelicacy which, if such things be old-fashioned, were as old as Adam.\n\nThe door of the Doctor's room opened, and he came out with Charles\nDarnay. He was so deadly pale--which had not been the case when they\nwent in together--that no vestige of colour was to be seen in his face.\nBut, in the composure of his manner he was unaltered, except that to the\nshrewd glance of Mr. Lorry it disclosed some shadowy indication that the\nold air of avoidance and dread had lately passed over him, like a cold\nwind.\n\nHe gave his arm to his daughter, and took her down-stairs to the chariot\nwhich Mr. Lorry had hired in honour of the day. The rest followed in\nanother carriage, and soon, in a neighbouring church, where no strange\neyes looked on, Charles Darnay and Lucie Manette were happily married.\n\nBesides the glancing tears that shone among the smiles of the little\ngroup when it was done, some diamonds, very bright and sparkling,\nglanced on the bride's hand, which were newly released from the\ndark obscurity of one of Mr. Lorry's pockets. They returned home to\nbreakfast, and all went well, and in due course the golden hair that had\nmingled with the poor shoemaker's white locks in the Paris garret, were\nmingled with them again in the morning sunlight, on the threshold of the\ndoor at parting.\n\nIt was a hard parting, though it was not for long. But her father\ncheered her, and said at last, gently disengaging himself from her\nenfolding arms, \"Take her, Charles! She is yours!\"\n\nAnd her agitated hand waved to them from a chaise window, and she was\ngone.\n\nThe corner being out of the way of the idle and curious, and the\npreparations having been very simple and few, the Doctor, Mr. Lorry,\nand Miss Pross, were left quite alone. It was when they turned into\nthe welcome shade of the cool old hall, that Mr. Lorry observed a great\nchange to have come over the Doctor; as if the golden arm uplifted\nthere, had struck him a poisoned blow.\n\nHe had naturally repressed much, and some revulsion might have been\nexpected in him when the occasion for repression was gone. But, it was\nthe old scared lost look that troubled Mr. Lorry; and through his absent\nmanner of clasping his head and drearily wandering away into his own\nroom when they got up-stairs, Mr. Lorry was reminded of Defarge the\nwine-shop keeper, and the starlight ride.\n\n\"I think,\" he whispered to Miss Pross, after anxious consideration, \"I\nthink we had best not speak to him just now, or at all disturb him.\nI must look in at Tellson's; so I will go there at once and come back\npresently. Then, we will take him a ride into the country, and dine\nthere, and all will be well.\"\n\nIt was easier for Mr. Lorry to look in at Tellson's, than to look out of\nTellson's. He was detained two hours. When he came back, he ascended the\nold staircase alone, having asked no question of the servant; going thus\ninto the Doctor's rooms, he was stopped by a low sound of knocking.\n\n\"Good God!\" he said, with a start. \"What's that?\"\n\nMiss Pross, with a terrified face, was at his ear. \"O me, O me! All is\nlost!\" cried she, wringing her hands. \"What is to be told to Ladybird?\nHe doesn't know me, and is making shoes!\"\n\nMr. Lorry said what he could to calm her, and went himself into the\nDoctor's room. The bench was turned towards the light, as it had been\nwhen he had seen the shoemaker at his work before, and his head was bent\ndown, and he was very busy.\n\n\"Doctor Manette. My dear friend, Doctor Manette!\"\n\nThe Doctor looked at him for a moment--half inquiringly, half as if he\nwere angry at being spoken to--and bent over his work again.\n\nHe had laid aside his coat and waistcoat; his shirt was open at the\nthroat, as it used to be when he did that work; and even the old\nhaggard, faded surface of face had come back to him. He worked\nhard--impatiently--as if in some sense of having been interrupted.\n\nMr. Lorry glanced at the work in his hand, and observed that it was a\nshoe of the old size and shape. He took up another that was lying by\nhim, and asked what it was.\n\n\"A young lady's walking shoe,\" he muttered, without looking up. \"It\nought to have been finished long ago. Let it be.\"\n\n\"But, Doctor Manette. Look at me!\"\n\nHe obeyed, in the old mechanically submissive manner, without pausing in\nhis work.\n\n\"You know me, my dear friend? Think again. This is not your proper\noccupation. Think, dear friend!\"\n\nNothing would induce him to speak more. He looked up, for an instant at\na time, when he was requested to do so; but, no persuasion would extract\na word from him. He worked, and worked, and worked, in silence, and\nwords fell on him as they would have fallen on an echoless wall, or on\nthe air. The only ray of hope that Mr. Lorry could discover, was, that\nhe sometimes furtively looked up without being asked. In that, there\nseemed a faint expression of curiosity or perplexity--as though he were\ntrying to reconcile some doubts in his mind.\n\nTwo things at once impressed themselves on Mr. Lorry, as important above\nall others; the first, that this must be kept secret from Lucie;\nthe second, that it must be kept secret from all who knew him. In\nconjunction with Miss Pross, he took immediate steps towards the latter\nprecaution, by giving out that the Doctor was not well, and required a\nfew days of complete rest. In aid of the kind deception to be practised\non his daughter, Miss Pross was to write, describing his having been\ncalled away professionally, and referring to an imaginary letter of\ntwo or three hurried lines in his own hand, represented to have been\naddressed to her by the same post.\n\nThese measures, advisable to be taken in any case, Mr. Lorry took in\nthe hope of his coming to himself. If that should happen soon, he kept\nanother course in reserve; which was, to have a certain opinion that he\nthought the best, on the Doctor's case.\n\nIn the hope of his recovery, and of resort to this third course\nbeing thereby rendered practicable, Mr. Lorry resolved to watch him\nattentively, with as little appearance as possible of doing so. He\ntherefore made arrangements to absent himself from Tellson's for the\nfirst time in his life, and took his post by the window in the same\nroom.\n\nHe was not long in discovering that it was worse than useless to speak\nto him, since, on being pressed, he became worried. He abandoned that\nattempt on the first day, and resolved merely to keep himself always\nbefore him, as a silent protest against the delusion into which he had\nfallen, or was falling. He remained, therefore, in his seat near the\nwindow, reading and writing, and expressing in as many pleasant and\nnatural ways as he could think of, that it was a free place.\n\nDoctor Manette took what was given him to eat and drink, and worked on,\nthat first day, until it was too dark to see--worked on, half an hour\nafter Mr. Lorry could not have seen, for his life, to read or write.\nWhen he put his tools aside as useless, until morning, Mr. Lorry rose\nand said to him:\n\n\"Will you go out?\"\n\nHe looked down at the floor on either side of him in the old manner,\nlooked up in the old manner, and repeated in the old low voice:\n\n\"Out?\"\n\n\"Yes; for a walk with me. Why not?\"\n\nHe made no effort to say why not, and said not a word more. But, Mr.\nLorry thought he saw, as he leaned forward on his bench in the dusk,\nwith his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands, that he was in\nsome misty way asking himself, \"Why not?\" The sagacity of the man of\nbusiness perceived an advantage here, and determined to hold it.\n\nMiss Pross and he divided the night into two watches, and observed him\nat intervals from the adjoining room. He paced up and down for a long\ntime before he lay down; but, when he did finally lay himself down, he\nfell asleep. In the morning, he was up betimes, and went straight to his\nbench and to work.\n\nOn this second day, Mr. Lorry saluted him cheerfully by his name,\nand spoke to him on topics that had been of late familiar to them. He\nreturned no reply, but it was evident that he heard what was said, and\nthat he thought about it, however confusedly. This encouraged Mr. Lorry\nto have Miss Pross in with her work, several times during the day;\nat those times, they quietly spoke of Lucie, and of her father then\npresent, precisely in the usual manner, and as if there were nothing\namiss. This was done without any demonstrative accompaniment, not long\nenough, or often enough to harass him; and it lightened Mr. Lorry's\nfriendly heart to believe that he looked up oftener, and that he\nappeared to be stirred by some perception of inconsistencies surrounding\nhim.\n\nWhen it fell dark again, Mr. Lorry asked him as before:\n\n\"Dear Doctor, will you go out?\"\n\nAs before, he repeated, \"Out?\"\n\n\"Yes; for a walk with me. Why not?\"\n\nThis time, Mr. Lorry feigned to go out when he could extract no answer\nfrom him, and, after remaining absent for an hour, returned. In the\nmeanwhile, the Doctor had removed to the seat in the window, and had\nsat there looking down at the plane-tree; but, on Mr. Lorry's return, he\nslipped away to his bench.\n\nThe time went very slowly on, and Mr. Lorry's hope darkened, and his\nheart grew heavier again, and grew yet heavier and heavier every day.\nThe third day came and went, the fourth, the fifth. Five days, six days,\nseven days, eight days, nine days.\n\nWith a hope ever darkening, and with a heart always growing heavier and\nheavier, Mr. Lorry passed through this anxious time. The secret was\nwell kept, and Lucie was unconscious and happy; but he could not fail to\nobserve that the shoemaker, whose hand had been a little out at first,\nwas growing dreadfully skilful, and that he had never been so intent on\nhis work, and that his hands had never been so nimble and expert, as in\nthe dusk of the ninth evening.\n\n\n\n\n\nXIX. An Opinion\n\nWorn out by anxious watching, Mr. Lorry fell asleep at his post. On the\ntenth morning of his suspense, he was startled by the shining of the sun\ninto the room where a heavy slumber had overtaken him when it was dark\nnight.\n\nHe rubbed his eyes and roused himself; but he doubted, when he had\ndone so, whether he was not still asleep. For, going to the door of the\nDoctor's room and looking in, he perceived that the shoemaker's bench\nand tools were put aside again, and that the Doctor himself sat reading\nat the window. He was in his usual morning dress, and his face (which\nMr. Lorry could distinctly see), though still very pale, was calmly\nstudious and attentive.\n\nEven when he had satisfied himself that he was awake, Mr. Lorry felt\ngiddily uncertain for some few moments whether the late shoemaking might\nnot be a disturbed dream of his own; for, did not his eyes show him his\nfriend before him in his accustomed clothing and aspect, and employed\nas usual; and was there any sign within their range, that the change of\nwhich he had so strong an impression had actually happened?\n\nIt was but the inquiry of his first confusion and astonishment, the\nanswer being obvious. If the impression were not produced by a real\ncorresponding and sufficient cause, how came he, Jarvis Lorry, there?\nHow came he to have fallen asleep, in his clothes, on the sofa in Doctor\nManette's consulting-room, and to be debating these points outside the\nDoctor's bedroom door in the early morning?\n\nWithin a few minutes, Miss Pross stood whispering at his side. If he\nhad had any particle of doubt left, her talk would of necessity have\nresolved it; but he was by that time clear-headed, and had none.\nHe advised that they should let the time go by until the regular\nbreakfast-hour, and should then meet the Doctor as if nothing unusual\nhad occurred. If he appeared to be in his customary state of mind, Mr.\nLorry would then cautiously proceed to seek direction and guidance from\nthe opinion he had been, in his anxiety, so anxious to obtain.\n\nMiss Pross, submitting herself to his judgment, the scheme was worked\nout with care. Having abundance of time for his usual methodical\ntoilette, Mr. Lorry presented himself at the breakfast-hour in his usual\nwhite linen, and with his usual neat leg. The Doctor was summoned in the\nusual way, and came to breakfast.\n\nSo far as it was possible to comprehend him without overstepping those\ndelicate and gradual approaches which Mr. Lorry felt to be the only safe\nadvance, he at first supposed that his daughter's marriage had taken\nplace yesterday. An incidental allusion, purposely thrown out, to\nthe day of the week, and the day of the month, set him thinking and\ncounting, and evidently made him uneasy. In all other respects, however,\nhe was so composedly himself, that Mr. Lorry determined to have the aid\nhe sought. And that aid was his own.\n\nTherefore, when the breakfast was done and cleared away, and he and the\nDoctor were left together, Mr. Lorry said, feelingly:\n\n\"My dear Manette, I am anxious to have your opinion, in confidence, on a\nvery curious case in which I am deeply interested; that is to say, it is\nvery curious to me; perhaps, to your better information it may be less\nso.\"\n\nGlancing at his hands, which were discoloured by his late work, the\nDoctor looked troubled, and listened attentively. He had already glanced\nat his hands more than once.\n\n\"Doctor Manette,\" said Mr. Lorry, touching him affectionately on the\narm, \"the case is the case of a particularly dear friend of mine. Pray\ngive your mind to it, and advise me well for his sake--and above all,\nfor his daughter's--his daughter's, my dear Manette.\"\n\n\"If I understand,\" said the Doctor, in a subdued tone, \"some mental\nshock--?\"\n\n\"Yes!\"\n\n\"Be explicit,\" said the Doctor. \"Spare no detail.\"\n\nMr. Lorry saw that they understood one another, and proceeded.\n\n\"My dear Manette, it is the case of an old and a prolonged shock,\nof great acuteness and severity to the affections, the feelings,\nthe--the--as you express it--the mind. The mind. It is the case of a\nshock under which the sufferer was borne down, one cannot say for how\nlong, because I believe he cannot calculate the time himself, and there\nare no other means of getting at it. It is the case of a shock from\nwhich the sufferer recovered, by a process that he cannot trace\nhimself--as I once heard him publicly relate in a striking manner. It is\nthe case of a shock from which he has recovered, so completely, as to\nbe a highly intelligent man, capable of close application of mind, and\ngreat exertion of body, and of constantly making fresh additions to his\nstock of knowledge, which was already very large. But, unfortunately,\nthere has been,\" he paused and took a deep breath--\"a slight relapse.\"\n\nThe Doctor, in a low voice, asked, \"Of how long duration?\"\n\n\"Nine days and nights.\"\n\n\"How did it show itself? I infer,\" glancing at his hands again, \"in the\nresumption of some old pursuit connected with the shock?\"\n\n\"That is the fact.\"\n\n\"Now, did you ever see him,\" asked the Doctor, distinctly and\ncollectedly, though in the same low voice, \"engaged in that pursuit\noriginally?\"\n\n\"Once.\"\n\n\"And when the relapse fell on him, was he in most respects--or in all\nrespects--as he was then?\"\n\n\"I think in all respects.\"\n\n\"You spoke of his daughter. Does his daughter know of the relapse?\"\n\n\"No. It has been kept from her, and I hope will always be kept from her.\nIt is known only to myself, and to one other who may be trusted.\"\n\nThe Doctor grasped his hand, and murmured, \"That was very kind. That was\nvery thoughtful!\" Mr. Lorry grasped his hand in return, and neither of\nthe two spoke for a little while.\n\n\"Now, my dear Manette,\" said Mr. Lorry, at length, in his most\nconsiderate and most affectionate way, \"I am a mere man of business,\nand unfit to cope with such intricate and difficult matters. I do not\npossess the kind of information necessary; I do not possess the kind of\nintelligence; I want guiding. There is no man in this world on whom\nI could so rely for right guidance, as on you. Tell me, how does this\nrelapse come about? Is there danger of another? Could a repetition of it\nbe prevented? How should a repetition of it be treated? How does it come\nabout at all? What can I do for my friend? No man ever can have been\nmore desirous in his heart to serve a friend, than I am to serve mine,\nif I knew how.\n\n\"But I don't know how\n\n### Summary:\n\n", "answer": "On the eve of Lucie's wedding, she and her father discuss the forthcoming events and Lucie assures her father that her love for Darnay will not interfere with their relationship.

The Rescue of the Tin Woodman\n\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\nWhen Dorothy awoke the sun was shining through the trees and Toto\nhad long been out chasing birds and squirrels. She sat up and looked\naround her. There was the Scarecrow, still standing patiently in his\ncorner, waiting for her.\n\n\"We must go and search for water,\" she said to him.\n\n\"Why do you want water?\" he asked.\n\n\"To wash my face clean after the dust of the road, and to drink, so\nthe dry bread will not stick in my throat.\"\n\n\"It must be inconvenient to be made of flesh,\" said the Scarecrow,\nthoughtfully; \"for you must sleep, and eat and drink. However, you\nhave brains, and it is worth a lot of bother to be able to think\nproperly.\"\n\nThey left the cottage and walked through the trees until they found a\nlittle spring of clear water, where Dorothy drank and bathed and ate\nher breakfast. She saw there was not much bread left in the basket,\nand the girl was thankful the Scarecrow did not have to eat anything,\nfor there was scarcely enough for herself and Toto for the day.\n\nWhen she had finished her meal, and was about to go back to the road\nof yellow brick, she was startled to hear a deep groan near by.\n\n\"What was that?\" she asked, timidly.\n\n\"I cannot imagine,\" replied the Scarecrow; \"but we can go and see.\"\n\nJust then another groan reached their ears, and the sound seemed to\ncome from behind them. They turned and walked through the forest a\nfew steps, when Dorothy discovered something shining in a ray of\nsunshine that fell between the trees. She ran to the place, and then\nstopped short, with a cry of surprise.\n\nOne of the big trees had been partly chopped through, and standing\nbeside it, with an uplifted axe in his hands, was a man made entirely\nof tin. His head and arms and legs were jointed upon his body, but he\nstood perfectly motionless, as if he could not stir at all.\n\nDorothy looked at him in amazement, and so did the Scarecrow, while\nToto barked sharply and made a snap at the tin legs, which hurt his\nteeth.\n\n\"Did you groan?\" asked Dorothy.\n\n\"Yes,\" answered the tin man; \"I did. I've been groaning for more than\na year, and no one has ever heard me before or come to help me.\"\n\n\"What can I do for you?\" she enquired, softly, for she was moved by\nthe sad voice in which the man spoke.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Get an oil-can and oil my joints,\" he answered. \"They are rusted so\nbadly that I cannot move them at all; if I am well oiled I shall soon\nbe all right again. You will find an oil-can on a shelf in my cottage.\"\n\nDorothy at once ran back to the cottage and found the oil-can, and\nthen she returned and asked, anxiously,\n\n\"Where are your joints?\"\n\n\"Oil my neck, first,\" replied the Tin Woodman. So she oiled it, and\nas it was quite badly rusted the Scarecrow took hold of the tin head\nand moved it gently from side to side until it worked freely, and\nthen the man could turn it himself.\n\n\"Now oil the joints in my arms,\" he said. And Dorothy oiled them and\nthe Scarecrow bent them carefully until they were quite free from\nrust and as good as new.\n\nThe Tin Woodman gave a sigh of satisfaction and lowered his axe,\nwhich he leaned against the tree.\n\n\"This is a great comfort,\" he said. \"I have been holding that axe in\nthe air ever since I rusted, and I'm glad to be able to put it down\nat last. Now, if you will oil the joints of my legs, I shall be all\nright once more.\"\n\nSo they oiled his legs until he could move them freely; and he\nthanked them again and again for his release, for he seemed a very\npolite creature, and very grateful.\n\n\"I might have stood there always if you had not come along,\" he said;\n\"so you have certainly saved my life. How did you happen to be here?\"\n\n\"We are on our way to the Emerald City, to see the great Oz,\" she\nanswered, \"and we stopped at your cottage to pass the night.\"\n\n\"Why do you wish to see Oz?\" he asked.\n\n\"I want him to send me back to Kansas; and the Scarecrow wants him to\nput a few brains into his head,\" she replied.\n\nThe Tin Woodman appeared to think deeply for a moment. Then he said:\n\n\"Do you suppose Oz could give me a heart?\"\n\n\"Why, I guess so,\" Dorothy answered; \"it would be as easy as to give\nthe Scarecrow brains.\"\n\n[Illustration: \"_'This is a great comfort,' said the Tin Woodman._\"]\n\n\"True,\" the Tin Woodman returned. \"So, if you will allow me to join\nyour party, I will also go to the Emerald City and ask Oz to help me.\"\n\n\"Come along,\" said the Scarecrow, heartily; and Dorothy added\nthat she would be pleased to have his company. So the Tin Woodman\nshouldered his axe and they all passed through the forest until they\ncame to the road that was paved with yellow brick.\n\nThe Tin Woodman had asked Dorothy to put the oil-can in her basket.\n\"For,\" he said, \"if I should get caught in the rain, and rust again,\nI would need the oil-can badly.\"\n\nIt was a bit of good luck to have their new comrade join the party,\nfor soon after they had begun their journey again they came to a place\nwhere the trees and branches grew so thick over the road that the\ntravellers could not pass. But the Tin Woodman set to work with his axe\nand chopped so well that soon he cleared a passage for the entire party.\n\nDorothy was thinking so earnestly as they walked along that she did\nnot notice when the Scarecrow stumbled into a hole and rolled over to\nthe side of the road. Indeed, he was obliged to call to her to help\nhim up again.\n\n\"Why didn't you walk around the hole?\" asked the Tin Woodman.\n\n\"I don't know enough,\" replied the Scarecrow, cheerfully. \"My head is\nstuffed with straw, you know, and that is why I am going to Oz to ask\nhim for some brains.\"\n\n\"Oh, I see;\" said the Tin Woodman. \"But, after all, brains are not\nthe best things in the world.\"\n\n\"Have you any?\" enquired the Scarecrow.\n\n\"No, my head is quite empty,\" answered the Woodman; \"but once I had\nbrains, and a heart also; so, having tried them both, I should much\nrather have a heart.\"\n\n\"And why is that?\" asked the Scarecrow.\n\n\"I will tell you my story, and then you will know.\"\n\nSo, while they were walking through the forest, the Tin Woodman told\nthe following story:\n\n\"I was born the son of a woodman who chopped down trees in the\nforest and sold the wood for a living. When I grew up I too became a\nwood-chopper, and after my father died I took care of my old mother\nas long as she lived. Then I made up my mind that instead of living\nalone I would marry, so that I might not become lonely.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"There was one of the Munchkin girls who was so beautiful that I\nsoon grew to love her with all my heart. She, on her part, promised\nto marry me as soon as I could earn enough money to build a better\nhouse for her; so I set to work harder than ever. But the girl lived\nwith an old woman who did not want her to marry anyone, for she was\nso lazy she wished the girl to remain with her and do the cooking\nand the housework. So the old woman went to the wicked Witch of the\nEast, and promised her two sheep and a cow if she would prevent the\nmarriage. Thereupon the wicked Witch enchanted my axe, and when I was\nchopping away at my best one day, for I was anxious to get the new\nhouse and my wife as soon as possible, the axe slipped all at once\nand cut off my left leg.\n\n\"This at first seemed a great misfortune, for I knew a one-legged man\ncould not do very well as a wood-chopper. So I went to a tin-smith\nand had him make me a new leg out of tin. The leg worked very well,\nonce I was used to it; but my action angered the wicked Witch of\nthe East, for she had promised the old woman I should not marry the\npretty Munchkin girl. When I began chopping again my axe slipped and\ncut off my right leg. Again I went to the tinner, and again he made\nme a leg out of tin. After this the enchanted axe cut off my arms,\none after the other; but, nothing daunted, I had them replaced with\ntin ones. The wicked Witch then made the axe slip and cut off my\nhead, and at first I thought that was the end of me. But the tinner\nhappened to come along, and he made me a new head out of tin.\n\n\"I thought I had beaten the wicked Witch then, and I worked harder than\never; but I little knew how cruel my enemy could be. She thought of a\nnew way to kill my love for the beautiful Munchkin maiden, and made my\naxe slip again, so that it cut right through my body, splitting me\ninto two halves. Once more the tinner came to my help and made me a\nbody of tin, fastening my tin arms and legs and head to it, by means of\njoints, so that I could move around as well as ever. But, alas! I had\nnow no heart, so that I lost all my love for the Munchkin girl, and did\nnot care whether I married her or not. I suppose she is still living\nwith the old woman, waiting for me to come after her.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"My body shone so brightly in the sun that I felt very proud of it\nand it did not matter now if my axe slipped, for it could not cut me.\nThere was only one danger--that my joints would rust; but I kept an\noil-can in my cottage and took care to oil myself whenever I needed\nit. However, there came a day when I forgot to do this, and, being\ncaught in a rainstorm, before I thought of the danger my joints had\nrusted, and I was left to stand in the woods until you came to help\nme. It was a terrible thing to undergo, but during the year I stood\nthere I had time to think that the greatest loss I had known was\nthe loss of my heart. While I was in love I was the happiest man on\nearth; but no one can love who has not a heart, and so I am resolved\nto ask Oz to give me one. If he does, I will go back to the Munchkin\nmaiden and marry her.\"\n\nBoth Dorothy and the Scarecrow had been greatly interested in the\nstory of the Tin Woodman, and now they knew why he was so anxious to\nget a new heart.\n\n\"All the same,\" said the Scarecrow, \"I shall ask for brains instead\nof a heart; for a fool would not know what to do with a heart if he\nhad one.\"\n\n\"I shall take the heart,\" returned the Tin Woodman; \"for brains do\nnot make one happy, and happiness is the best thing in the world.\"\n\nDorothy did not say anything, for she was puzzled to know which of\nher two friends was right, and she decided if she could only get back\nto Kansas and Aunt Em it did not matter so much whether the Woodman\nhad no brains and the Scarecrow no heart, or each got what he wanted.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nWhat worried her most was that the bread was nearly gone, and another\nmeal for herself and Toto would empty the basket. To be sure neither\nthe Woodman nor the Scarecrow ever ate anything, but she was not made\nof tin nor straw, and could not live unless she was fed.\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter VI. The Cowardly Lion.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration: \"_You ought to be ashamed of yourself!_\"]\n\n[Illustration]\n\nAll this time Dorothy and her companions had been walking through the\nthick woods. The road was still paved with yellow brick, but these\nwere much covered by dried branches and dead leaves from the trees,\nand the walking was not at all good.\n\nThere were few birds in this part of the forest, for birds love the\nopen country where there is plenty of sunshine; but now and then\nthere came a deep growl from some wild animal hidden among the trees.\nThese sounds made the little girl's heart beat fast, for she did not\nknow what made them; but Toto knew, and he walked close to Dorothy's\nside, and did not even bark in return.\n\n\"How long will it be,\" the child asked of the Tin Woodman, \"before we\nare out of the forest?\"\n\n\"I cannot tell,\" was the answer, \"for I have never been to the\nEmerald City. But my father went there once, when I was a boy, and\nhe said it was a long journey through a dangerous country, although\nnearer to the city where Oz dwells the country is beautiful. But I\nam not afraid so long as I have my oil-can, and nothing can hurt the\nScarecrow, while you bear upon your forehead the mark of the good\nWitch's kiss, and that will protect you from harm.\"\n\n\"But Toto!\" said the girl, anxiously; \"what will protect him?\"\n\n\"We must protect him ourselves, if he is in danger,\" replied the Tin\nWoodman.\n\nJust as he spoke there came from the forest a terrible roar, and the\nnext moment a great Lion bounded into the road. With one blow of his\npaw he sent the Scarecrow spinning over and over to the edge of the\nroad, and then he struck at the Tin Woodman with his sharp claws.\nBut, to the Lion's surprise, he could make no impression on the tin,\nalthough the Woodman fell over in the road and lay still.\n\nLittle Toto, now that he had an enemy to face, ran barking toward the\nLion, and the great beast had opened his mouth to bite the dog, when\nDorothy, fearing Toto would be killed, and heedless of danger, rushed\nforward and slapped the Lion upon his nose as hard as she could,\nwhile she cried out:\n\n\"Don't you dare to bite Toto! You ought to be ashamed of yourself, a\nbig beast like you, to bite a poor little dog!\"\n\n\"I didn't bite him,\" said the Lion, as he rubbed his nose with his\npaw where Dorothy had hit it.\n\n\"No, but you tried to,\" she retorted. \"You are nothing but a big\ncoward.\"\n\n\"I know it,\" said the Lion, hanging his head in shame; \"I've always\nknown it. But how can I help it?\"\n\n\"I don't know, I'm sure. To think of your striking a stuffed man,\nlike the poor Scarecrow!\"\n\n\"Is he stuffed?\" asked the Lion, in surprise, as he watched her pick\nup the Scarecrow and set him upon his feet, while she patted him into\nshape again.\n\n\"Of course he's stuffed,\" replied Dorothy, who was still angry.\n\n\"That's why he went over so easily,\" remarked the Lion. \"It astonished\nme to see him whirl around so. Is the other one stuffed, also?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Dorothy, \"he's made of tin.\" And she helped the Woodman up\nagain.\n\n\"That's why he nearly blunted my claws,\" said the Lion. \"When they\nscratched against the tin it made a cold shiver run down my back.\nWhat is that little animal you are so tender of?\"\n\n\"He is my dog, Toto,\" answered Dorothy.\n\n\"Is he made of tin, or stuffed?\" asked the Lion.\n\n\"Neither. He's a--a--a meat dog,\" said the girl.\n\n\"Oh. He's a curious animal, and seems remarkably small, now that I\nlook at him. No one would think of biting such a little thing except\na coward like me,\" continued the Lion, sadly.\n\n\"What makes you a coward?\" asked Dorothy, looking at the great beast\nin wonder, for he was as big as a small horse.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"It's a mystery,\" replied the Lion. \"I suppose I was born that\nway. All the other animals in the forest naturally expect me to be\nbrave, for the Lion is everywhere thought to be the King of Beasts.\nI learned that if I roared very loudly every living thing was\nfrightened and got out of my way. Whenever I've met a man I've been\nawfully scared; but I just roared at him, and he has always run away\nas fast as he could go. If the elephants and the tigers and the bears\nhad ever tried to fight me, I should have run myself--I'm such a\ncoward; but just as soon as they hear me roar they all try to get\naway from me, and of course I let them go.\"\n\n\"But that isn't right. The King of Beasts shouldn't be a coward,\"\nsaid the Scarecrow.\n\n\"I know it,\" returned the Lion, wiping a tear from his eye with the\ntip of his tail; \"it is my great sorrow, and makes my life very\nunhappy. But whenever there is danger my heart begins to beat fast.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you have heart disease,\" said the Tin Woodman.\n\n\"It may be,\" said the Lion.\n\n\"If you have,\" continued the Tin Woodman, \"you ought to be glad, for\nit proves you have a heart. For my part, I have no heart; so I cannot\nhave heart disease.\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" said the Lion, thoughtfully, \"if I had no heart I should\nnot be a coward.\"\n\n\"Have you brains?\" asked the Scarecrow.\n\n\"I suppose so. I've never looked to see,\" replied the Lion.\n\n\"I am going to the great Oz to ask him to give me some,\" remarked the\nScarecrow, \"for my head is stuffed with straw.\"\n\n\"And I am going to ask him to give me a heart,\" said the Woodman.\n\n\"And I am going to ask him to send Toto and me back to Kansas,\" added\nDorothy.\n\n\"Do you think Oz could give me courage?\" asked the cowardly Lion.\n\n\"Just as easily as he could give me brains,\" said the Scarecrow.\n\n\"Or give me a heart,\" said the Tin Woodman.\n\n\"Or send me back to Kansas,\" said Dorothy.\n\n\"Then, if you don't mind, I'll go with you,\" said the Lion, \"for my\nlife is simply unbearable without a bit of courage.\"\n\n\"You will be very welcome,\" answered Dorothy, \"for you will help to\nkeep away the other wild beasts. It seems to me they must be more\ncowardly than you are if they allow you to scare them so easily.\"\n\n\"They really are,\" said the Lion; \"but that doesn't make me any braver,\nand as long as I know myself to be a coward I shall be unhappy.\"\n\nSo once more the little company set off upon the journey, the Lion\nwalking with stately strides at Dorothy's side. Toto did not approve\nthis new comrade at first, for he could not forget how nearly he\nhad been crushed between the Lion's great jaws; but after a time he\nbecame more at ease, and presently Toto and the Cowardly Lion had\ngrown to be good friends.\n\nDuring the rest of that day there was no other adventure to mar the\npeace of their journey. Once, indeed, the Tin Woodman stepped upon a\nbeetle that was crawling along the road, and killed the poor little\nthing. This made the Tin Woodman very unhappy, for he was always\ncareful not to hurt any living creature; and as he walked along he\nwept several tears of sorrow and regret. These tears ran slowly down\nhis face and over the hinges of his jaw, and there they rusted.\nWhen Dorothy presently asked him a question the Tin Woodman could\nnot open his mouth, for his jaws were tightly rusted together. He\nbecame greatly frightened at this and made many motions to Dorothy to\nrelieve him, but she could not understand. The Lion was also puzzled\nto know what was wrong. But the Scarecrow seized the oil-can from\nDorothy's basket and oiled the Woodman's jaws, so that after a few\nmoments he could talk as well as before.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"This will serve me a lesson,\" said he, \"to look where I step. For if\nI should kill another bug or beetle I should surely cry again, and\ncrying rusts my jaw so that I cannot speak.\"\n\nThereafter he walked very carefully, with his eyes on the road,\nand when he saw a tiny ant toiling by he would step over it, so as\nnot to harm it. The Tin Woodman knew very well he had no heart, and\ntherefore he took great care never to be cruel or unkind to anything.\n\n\"You people with hearts,\" he said, \"have something to guide you,\nand need never do wrong; but I have no heart, and so I must be very\ncareful. When Oz gives me a heart of course I needn't mind so much.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter VII. The Journey to The Great Oz.\n                             \n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThey were obliged to camp out that night under a large tree in the\nforest, for there were no houses near. The tree made a good, thick\ncovering to protect them from the dew, and the Tin Woodman chopped a\ngreat pile of wood with his axe and Dorothy built a splendid fire that\nwarmed her and made her feel less lonely. She and Toto ate the last of\ntheir bread, and now she did not know what they would do for breakfast.\n\n\"If you wish,\" said the Lion, \"I will go into the forest and kill a\ndeer for you. You can roast it by the fire, since your tastes are so\npeculiar that you prefer cooked food, and then you will have a very\ngood breakfast.\"\n\n\"Don't! please don't,\" begged the Tin Woodman. \"I should certainly\nweep if you killed a poor deer, and then my jaws would rust again.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nBut the Lion went away into the forest and found his own supper, and no\none ever knew what it was, for he didn't mention it. And the Scarecrow\nfound a tree full of nuts and filled Dorothy's basket with them, so\nthat she would not be hungry for a long time. She thought this was very\nkind and thoughtful of the Scarecrow, but she laughed heartily at the\nawkward way in which the poor creature picked up the nuts. His padded\nhands were so clumsy and the nuts were so small that he dropped almost\nas many as he put in the basket. But the Scarecrow did not mind how\nlong it took him to fill the basket, for it enabled him to keep away\nfrom the fire, as he feared a spark might get into his straw and burn\nhim up. So he kept a good distance away from the flames, and only came\nnear to cover Dorothy with dry leaves when she lay down to sleep. These\nkept her very snug and warm and she slept soundly until morning.\n\nWhen it was daylight the girl bathed her face in a little rippling\nbrook and soon after they all started toward the Emerald City.\n\nThis was to be an eventful day for the travellers. They had hardly\nbeen walking an hour when they saw before them a great ditch that\ncrossed the road and divided the forest as far as they could see on\neither side. It was a very wide ditch, and when they crept up to the\nedge and looked into it they could see it was also very deep, and\nthere were many big, jagged rocks at the bottom. The sides were so\nsteep that none of them could climb down, and for a moment it seemed\nthat their journey must end.\n\n\"What shall we do?\" asked Dorothy, despairingly.\n\n\"I haven't the faintest idea,\" said the Tin Woodman; and the Lion\nshook his shaggy mane and looked thoughtful. But the Scarecrow said:\n\n\"We cannot fly, that is certain; neither can we climb down into this\ngreat ditch. Therefore, if we cannot jump over it, we must stop where\nwe are.\"\n\n\"I think I could jump over it,\" said the Cowardly Lion, after\nmeasuring the distance carefully in his mind.\n\n\"Then we are all right,\" answered the Scarecrow, \"for you can carry\nus all over on your back, one at a time.\"\n\n\"Well, I'll try it,\" said the Lion. \"Who will go first?\"\n\n\"I will,\" declared the Scarecrow; \"for, if you found that you could\nnot jump over the gulf, Dorothy would be killed, or the Tin Woodman\nbadly dented on the rocks below. But if I am on your back it will not\nmatter so much, for the fall would not hurt me at all.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"I am terribly afraid of falling, myself,\" said the Cowardly Lion,\n\"but I suppose there is nothing to do but try it. So get on my back\nand we will make the attempt.\"\n\nThe Scarecrow sat upon the Lion's back, and the big beast walked to\nthe edge of the gulf and crouched down.\n\n\"Why don't you run and jump?\" asked the Scarecrow.\n\n\"Because that isn't the way we Lions do these things,\" he replied.\nThen giving a great spring, he shot through the air and landed safely\non the other side. They were all greatly pleased to see how easily he\ndid it, and after the Scarecrow had got down from his back the Lion\nsprang across the ditch again.\n\nDorothy thought she would go next; so she took Toto in her arms and\nclimbed on the Lion's back, holding tightly to his mane with one\nhand. The next moment it seemed as if she was flying through the air;\nand then, before she had time to think about it, she was safe on the\nother side. The Lion went back a third time and got the Tin Woodman,\nand then they all sat down for a few moments to give the beast a\nchance to rest, for his great leaps had made his breath short, and he\npanted like a big dog that has been running too long.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThey found the forest very thick on this side, and it looked dark\nand gloomy. After the Lion had rested they started along the road\nof yellow brick, silently wondering, each in his own mind, if ever\nthey would come to the end of the woods and reach the bright sunshine\nagain. To add to their discomfort, they soon heard strange noises in\nthe depths of the forest, and the Lion whispered to them that it was\nin this part of the country that the Kalidahs lived.\n\n\"What are the Kalidahs?\" asked the girl.\n\n\"They are monstrous beasts with bodies like bears and heads like\ntigers,\" replied the Lion; \"and with claws so long and sharp that\nthey could tear me in two as easily as I could kill Toto. I'm\nterribly afraid of the Kalidahs.\"\n\n\"I'm not surprised that you are,\" returned Dorothy \"They must be\ndreadful beasts.\"\n\nThe Lion was about to reply when suddenly they came to another gulf\nacross the road; but this one was so broad and deep that the Lion\nknew at once he could not leap across it.\n\nSo they sat down to consider what they should do, and after serious\nthought the Scarecrow said,\n\n\"Here is a great tree, standing close to the ditch. If the Tin\nWoodman can chop it down, so that it will fall to the other side, we\ncan walk across it easily.\"\n\n\"That is a first rate idea,\" said the Lion. \"One would almost suspect\nyou had brains in your head, instead of straw.\"\n\nThe Woodman set to work at once, and so sharp was his axe that the\ntree was soon chopped nearly through. Then the Lion put his strong\nfront legs against the tree and pushed with all his might, and slowly\nthe big tree tipped and fell with a crash across the ditch, with its\ntop branches on the other side.\n\nThey had just started to cross this queer bridge when a sharp growl\nmade them all look up, and to their horror they saw running toward\nthem two great beasts with bodies like bears and heads like tigers.\n\n\"They are the Kalidahs!\" said the Cowardly Lion, beginning to tremble.\n\n\"Quick!\" cried the Scarecrow, \"let us cross over.\"\n\n[Illustration: \"_The tree fell with a crash into the gulf._\"]\n\nSo Dorothy went first, holding Toto in her arms; the Tin Woodman\nfollowed, and the Scarecrow came next. The Lion, although he was\ncertainly afraid, turned to face the Kalidahs, and then he gave so\nloud and terrible a roar that Dorothy screamed and the Scarecrow fell\nover backwards, while even the fierce beasts stopped short and looked\nat him in surprise.\n\nBut, seeing they were bigger than the Lion, and remembering that\nthere were two of them and only one of him, the Kalidahs again rushed\nforward, and the Lion crossed over the tree and turned to see what\nthey would do next. Without stopping an instant the fierce beasts\nalso began to cross the tree, and the Lion said to Dorothy,\n\n\"We are lost, for they will surely tear us to pieces with their sharp\nclaws. But stand close behind me, and I will fight them as long as I\nam alive.\"\n\n\"Wait a minute!\" called the Scarecrow. He had been thinking what was\nbest to be done, and now he asked the Woodman to chop away the end\nof the tree that rested on their side of the ditch. The Tin Woodman\nbegan to use his axe at once, and, just as the two Kalidahs were\nnearly across, the tree fell with a crash into the gulf, carrying the\nugly, snarling brutes with it, and both were dashed to pieces on the\nsharp rocks at the bottom.\n\n\"Well,\" said the Cowardly Lion, drawing a long breath of relief, \"I\nsee we are going to live a little while longer, and I am glad of it,\nfor it must be a very uncomfortable thing not to be alive. Those\ncreatures frightened me so badly that my heart is beating yet.\"\n\n\"Ah.\" said the Tin Woodman, sadly, \"I wish I had a heart to beat.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThis adventure made the travellers more anxious than ever to get out of\nthe forest, and they walked so fast that Dorothy became tired, and had\nto ride on the Lion's back. To their great joy the trees became thinner\nthe further they advanced, and in the afternoon they suddenly came upon\na broad river, flowing swiftly just before them. On the other side of\nthe water they could see the road of yellow brick running through a\nbeautiful country, with green meadows dotted with bright flowers and\nall the road bordered with trees hanging full of delicious fruits. They\nwere greatly pleased to see this delightful country before them.\n\n\"How shall we cross the river?\" asked Dorothy.\n\n\"That is easily done,\" replied the Scarecrow. \"The Tin Woodman must\nbuild us a raft, so we can float to the other side.\"\n\nSo the Woodman took his axe and began to chop down small trees to make\na raft, and while he was busy at this the Scarecrow found on the river\nbank a tree full of fine fruit. This pleased Dorothy, who had eaten\nnothing but nuts all day, and she made a hearty meal of the ripe fruit.\n\nBut it takes time to make a raft, even when one is as industrious and\nuntiring as the Tin Woodman, and when night came the work was not done.\nSo they found a cozy place under the trees where they slept well until\nthe morning; and Dorothy dreamed of the Emerald City, and of the good\nWizard Oz, who would soon send her back to her own home again.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter VIII. The Deadly Poppy Field.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\nOur little party of travellers awakened next morning refreshed and\nfull of hope, and Dorothy breakfasted like a princess off peaches and\nplums from the trees beside the river.\n\nBehind them was the dark forest they had passed safely through,\nalthough they had suffered many discouragements; but before them was a\nlovely, sunny country that seemed to beckon them on to the Emerald City.\n\nTo be sure, the broad river now cut them off from this beautiful\nland; but the raft was nearly done, and after the Tin Woodman had cut\na few more logs and fastened them together with wooden p\n\n### Summary:\n\n", "answer": "When Dorothy woke up she was thirsty so the travelers found a small stream for her to drink from and bathe in. Dorothy and The Scarecrow heard a groaning nearby and went to investigate. They discovered a man made completely of tin who stood motionless. Dorothy asked if he had groaned and he assented, saying he had been rusted for over a year. He told her to run to the cottage and get his oilcan. When Dorothy returned she oiled all of his joints, which made him immensely happy. When he asked where they were going and they responded with the Emerald City, he wondered if he might accompany them to ask the Wizard of Oz for a heart. They readily agreed. On their path The Tin Woodman proved useful as he skillfully axed thick branches in their path. Along the way, he told them his sad story: Once he had been a normal man with brains and a heart. He fell in love with a Munchkin girl and set about building a better house for her, but the old woman she lived with did not want her to marry and appealed to the Wicked Witch of the East to stop the marriage. The Witch made the Tin Woodman's axe slip and cut off all of his limbs one by one, but thankfully a tinner was able to provide limbs of tin for the Woodman. However, in the end the axe split him in half until all that was left of him was tin parts. Without flesh, he no longer had a heart and did not care for the Munchkin girl anymore. He had to oil himself frequently but got caught in a rainstorm over a year ago. He remembered how happy he was in love and decided he wanted a heart so he could go back and marry the maiden. The Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman debated what was more important: brains or a heart. Dorothy was not sure which was correct. The group continued to walk through the woods, which grew deeper and more frightening. They heard many noises. A large lion burst from the trees and pushed the Tin Woodman and the Scarecrow over. He lunged for Toto but Dorothy, \"heedless of danger\" and filled with worry for her dog, leapt at the lion and slapped his nose hard, admonishing him not to bite Toto. The Cowardly Lion stopped and apologized and explained that he was a coward. He did not know why, but all the animals expected him to be King of Beasts, afraid of nothing. Therefore, to keep his cowardice secret, he roared loudly at anything in his path to scare it away. He also asked if he could join their party in order to ask Oz for courage, and they agreed. Toto and the Lion eventually became good friends. Along their journey the Tin Woodman tried to be aware of the living things around him, and wept when he accidentally killed a beetle. He remarked that since he had no heart he had to be more careful. That night the travelers camped under a great tree. The Lion went out to look for food and the Scarecrow brought Dorothy back nuts to eat. The next day their path ended at a great ditch that separated the two sides of the forest and stretched from side to side further than the eye could see. After despairing, the Scarecrow realized the Lion could carry them one by one on his back. The Lion said he was afraid of falling but nevertheless took them all over successfully. The forest on that side was \"dark and gloomy\" and the Lion whispered of the frightening Kalidahs, the beasts with bodies of bears and heads of tigers that inhabited that part of the forest. They reached another ditch that was so broad the Lion could not leap over. This time the Scarecrow realized that the Tin Woodman could cut down a tree and set it across the divide. Everyone began to cross the tree bridge when they saw two fearsome Kalidahs coming for them. The cowardly Lion roared at them, but they followed anyway. Thankfully the Tin Woodman used his axe to cut their bridge down and the monsters plunged into the deep crevasse. The travelers were pleased when the yellow brick road finally led them to a beautiful country with green meadows, bright flowers, and delicious fruit hanging from trees. This country was on the other side of a great river, however, and the Scarecrow realized the Tin Woodman would need to build them a raft. While he worked Dorothy slept and dreamed of Emerald City. The Tin Woodman finished the raft and they were ready to start. The current became swifter as they reached the middle of the river, and they began to worry. The Scarecrow rowed, pushing hard on a pole. Suddenly, the pole got stuck in the mud and the Scarecrow was left clinging to it as the raft sailed away in the whirling water. The travelers could not stop. The Scarecrow called \"Good bye!\" to them and thought of how badly off he now was. Without the pole, the Lion swam the raft valiantly to shore. They did not know what to do about the Scarecrow until a Stork came along and volunteered to fetch their friend. After this adventure they walked along a verdant field with massive and bright flowers, the scent of which Dorothy happily breathed in. Soon the only flowers present were red poppies, which had an overwhelming scent that made living creatures fall asleep. Dorothy and Toto succumbed, and the Scarecrow and Tin Woodman warned the Lion to run away as fast as he could to save himself. The Lion bounded away and the other two travelers made a chair with their hands and carried Dorothy and Toto out of the field. Along the way they saw their friend the Lion fast asleep, but they could do nothing for him as he was too heavy to carry. They laid Dorothy down in fresh air and waited for her to awaken."}

As the most hardened Arab that ever careered across\nthe desert over the hump of a dromedary likes to repose sometimes under\nthe date-trees by the water, or to come into the cities, walk into the\nbazaars, refresh himself in the baths, and say his prayers in the\nmosques, before he goes out again marauding, so Jos's tents and pilau\nwere pleasant to this little Ishmaelite. She picketed her steed, hung\nup her weapons, and warmed herself comfortably by his fire.  The halt\nin that roving, restless life was inexpressibly soothing and pleasant\nto her.\n\nSo, pleased herself, she tried with all her might to please everybody;\nand we know that she was eminent and successful as a practitioner in\nthe art of giving pleasure.  As for Jos, even in that little interview\nin the garret at the Elephant Inn, she had found means to win back a\ngreat deal of his good-will.  In the course of a week, the civilian was\nher sworn slave and frantic admirer.  He didn't go to sleep after\ndinner, as his custom was in the much less lively society of Amelia.\nHe drove out with Becky in his open carriage.  He asked little parties\nand invented festivities to do her honour.\n\nTapeworm, the Charge d'Affaires, who had abused her so cruelly, came to\ndine with Jos, and then came every day to pay his respects to Becky.\nPoor Emmy, who was never very talkative, and more glum and silent than\never after Dobbin's departure, was quite forgotten when this superior\ngenius made her appearance.  The French Minister was as much charmed\nwith her as his English rival. The German ladies, never particularly\nsqueamish as regards morals, especially in English people, were\ndelighted with the cleverness and wit of Mrs. Osborne's charming\nfriend, and though she did not ask to go to Court, yet the most august\nand Transparent Personages there heard of her fascinations and were\nquite curious to know her.  When it became known that she was noble, of\nan ancient English family, that her husband was a Colonel of the Guard,\nExcellenz and Governor of an island, only separated from his lady by\none of those trifling differences which are of little account in a\ncountry where Werther is still read and the Wahlverwandtschaften of\nGoethe is considered an edifying moral book, nobody thought of refusing\nto receive her in the very highest society of the little Duchy; and the\nladies were even more ready to call her du and to swear eternal\nfriendship for her than they had been to bestow the same inestimable\nbenefits upon Amelia.  Love and Liberty are interpreted by those simple\nGermans in a way which honest folks in Yorkshire and Somersetshire\nlittle understand, and a lady might, in some philosophic and civilized\ntowns, be divorced ever so many times from her respective husbands and\nkeep her character in society.  Jos's house never was so pleasant since\nhe had a house of his own as Rebecca caused it to be. She sang, she\nplayed, she laughed, she talked in two or three languages, she brought\neverybody to the house, and she made Jos believe that it was his own\ngreat social talents and wit which gathered the society of the place\nround about him.\n\nAs for Emmy, who found herself not in the least mistress of her own\nhouse, except when the bills were to be paid, Becky soon discovered the\nway to soothe and please her.  She talked to her perpetually about\nMajor Dobbin sent about his business, and made no scruple of declaring\nher admiration for that excellent, high-minded gentleman, and of\ntelling Emmy that she had behaved most cruelly regarding him. Emmy\ndefended her conduct and showed that it was dictated only by the purest\nreligious principles; that a woman once, &c., and to such an angel as\nhim whom she had had the good fortune to marry, was married forever;\nbut she had no objection to hear the Major praised as much as ever\nBecky chose to praise him, and indeed, brought the conversation round\nto the Dobbin subject a score of times every day.\n\nMeans were easily found to win the favour of Georgy and the servants.\nAmelia's maid, it has been said, was heart and soul in favour of the\ngenerous Major.  Having at first disliked Becky for being the means of\ndismissing him from the presence of her mistress, she was reconciled to\nMrs. Crawley subsequently, because the latter became William's most\nardent admirer and champion.  And in those nightly conclaves in which\nthe two ladies indulged after their parties, and while Miss Payne was\n\"brushing their 'airs,\" as she called the yellow locks of the one and\nthe soft brown tresses of the other, this girl always put in her word\nfor that dear good gentleman Major Dobbin.  Her advocacy did not make\nAmelia angry any more than Rebecca's admiration of him.  She made\nGeorge write to him constantly and persisted in sending Mamma's kind\nlove in a postscript.  And as she looked at her husband's portrait of\nnights, it no longer reproached her--perhaps she reproached it, now\nWilliam was gone.\n\nEmmy was not very happy after her heroic sacrifice. She was very\ndistraite, nervous, silent, and ill to please. The family had never\nknown her so peevish.  She grew pale and ill.  She used to try to sing\ncertain songs (\"Einsam bin ich nicht alleine,\" was one of them, that\ntender love-song of Weber's which in old-fashioned days, young ladies,\nand when you were scarcely born, showed that those who lived before you\nknew too how to love and to sing) certain songs, I say, to which the\nMajor was partial; and as she warbled them in the twilight in the\ndrawing-room, she would break off in the midst of the song, and walk\ninto her neighbouring apartment, and there, no doubt, take refuge in\nthe miniature of her husband.\n\nSome books still subsisted, after Dobbin's departure, with his name\nwritten in them; a German dictionary, for instance, with \"William\nDobbin, --th Reg.,\" in the fly-leaf; a guide-book with his initials;\nand one or two other volumes which belonged to the Major.  Emmy cleared\nthese away and put them on the drawers, where she placed her work-box,\nher desk, her Bible, and prayer-book, under the pictures of the two\nGeorges.  And the Major, on going away, having left his gloves behind\nhim, it is a fact that Georgy, rummaging his mother's desk some time\nafterwards, found the gloves neatly folded up and put away in what they\ncall the secret-drawers of the desk.\n\nNot caring for society, and moping there a great deal, Emmy's chief\npleasure in the summer evenings was to take long walks with Georgy\n(during which Rebecca was left to the society of Mr. Joseph), and then\nthe mother and son used to talk about the Major in a way which even\nmade the boy smile.  She told him that she thought Major William was\nthe best man in all the world--the gentlest and the kindest, the\nbravest and the humblest.  Over and over again she told him how they\nowed everything which they possessed in the world to that kind friend's\nbenevolent care of them; how he had befriended them all through their\npoverty and misfortunes; watched over them when nobody cared for them;\nhow all his comrades admired him though he never spoke of his own\ngallant actions; how Georgy's father trusted him beyond all other men,\nand had been constantly befriended by the good William.  \"Why, when\nyour papa was a little boy,\" she said, \"he often told me that it was\nWilliam who defended him against a tyrant at the school where they\nwere; and their friendship never ceased from that day until the last,\nwhen your dear father fell.\"\n\n\"Did Dobbin kill the man who killed Papa?\" Georgy said.  \"I'm sure he\ndid, or he would if he could have caught him, wouldn't he, Mother? When\nI'm in the Army, won't I hate the French?--that's all.\"\n\nIn such colloquies the mother and the child passed a great deal of\ntheir time together.  The artless woman had made a confidant of the\nboy.  He was as much William's friend as everybody else who knew him\nwell.\n\nBy the way, Mrs. Becky, not to be behind hand in sentiment, had got a\nminiature too hanging up in her room, to the surprise and amusement of\nmost people, and the delight of the original, who was no other than our\nfriend Jos.  On her first coming to favour the Sedleys with a visit,\nthe little woman, who had arrived with a remarkably small shabby kit,\nwas perhaps ashamed of the meanness of her trunks and bandboxes, and\noften spoke with great respect about her baggage left behind at\nLeipzig, which she must have from that city.  When a traveller talks to\nyou perpetually about the splendour of his luggage, which he does not\nhappen to have with him, my son, beware of that traveller!  He is, ten\nto one, an impostor.\n\nNeither Jos nor Emmy knew this important maxim.  It seemed to them of\nno consequence whether Becky had a quantity of very fine clothes in\ninvisible trunks; but as her present supply was exceedingly shabby,\nEmmy supplied her out of her own stores, or took her to the best\nmilliner in the town and there fitted her out.  It was no more torn\ncollars now, I promise you, and faded silks trailing off at the\nshoulder.  Becky changed her habits with her situation in life--the\nrouge-pot was suspended--another excitement to which she had accustomed\nherself was also put aside, or at least only indulged in in privacy, as\nwhen she was prevailed on by Jos of a summer evening, Emmy and the boy\nbeing absent on their walks, to take a little spirit-and-water.  But if\nshe did not indulge--the courier did: that rascal Kirsch could not be\nkept from the bottle, nor could he tell how much he took when he\napplied to it.  He was sometimes surprised himself at the way in which\nMr. Sedley's Cognac diminished.  Well, well, this is a painful subject.\nBecky did not very likely indulge so much as she used before she\nentered a decorous family.\n\nAt last the much-bragged-about boxes arrived from Leipzig; three of\nthem not by any means large or splendid; nor did Becky appear to take\nout any sort of dresses or ornaments from the boxes when they did\narrive.  But out of one, which contained a mass of her papers (it was\nthat very box which Rawdon Crawley had ransacked in his furious hunt\nfor Becky's concealed money), she took a picture with great glee, which\nshe pinned up in her room, and to which she introduced Jos.  It was the\nportrait of a gentleman in pencil, his face having the advantage of\nbeing painted up in pink.  He was riding on an elephant away from some\ncocoa-nut trees and a pagoda: it was an Eastern scene.\n\n\"God bless my soul, it is my portrait,\" Jos cried out. It was he\nindeed, blooming in youth and beauty, in a nankeen jacket of the cut of\n1804.  It was the old picture that used to hang up in Russell Square.\n\n\"I bought it,\" said Becky in a voice trembling with emotion; \"I went to\nsee if I could be of any use to my kind friends.  I have never parted\nwith that picture--I never will.\"\n\n\"Won't you?\" Jos cried with a look of unutterable rapture and\nsatisfaction.  \"Did you really now value it for my sake?\"\n\n\"You know I did, well enough,\" said Becky; \"but why speak--why\nthink--why look back!  It is too late now!\"\n\nThat evening's conversation was delicious for Jos. Emmy only came in to\ngo to bed very tired and unwell. Jos and his fair guest had a charming\ntete-a-tete, and his sister could hear, as she lay awake in her\nadjoining chamber, Rebecca singing over to Jos the old songs of 1815.\nHe did not sleep, for a wonder, that night, any more than Amelia.\n\nIt was June, and, by consequence, high season in London; Jos, who read\nthe incomparable Galignani (the exile's best friend) through every day,\nused to favour the ladies with extracts from his paper during their\nbreakfast.  Every week in this paper there is a full account of\nmilitary movements, in which Jos, as a man who had seen service, was\nespecially interested.  On one occasion he read out--\"Arrival of the\n--th regiment.  Gravesend, June 20.--The Ramchunder, East Indiaman,\ncame into the river this morning, having on board 14 officers, and 132\nrank and file of this gallant corps.  They have been absent from\nEngland fourteen years, having been embarked the year after Waterloo,\nin which glorious conflict they took an active part, and having\nsubsequently distinguished themselves in the Burmese war.  The veteran\ncolonel, Sir Michael O'Dowd, K.C.B., with his lady and sister, landed\nhere yesterday, with Captains Posky, Stubble, Macraw, Malony;\nLieutenants Smith, Jones, Thompson, F. Thomson; Ensigns Hicks and\nGrady; the band on the pier playing the national anthem, and the crowd\nloudly cheering the gallant veterans as they went into Wayte's hotel,\nwhere a sumptuous banquet was provided for the defenders of Old\nEngland.  During the repast, which we need not say was served up in\nWayte's best style, the cheering continued so enthusiastically that\nLady O'Dowd and the Colonel came forward to the balcony and drank the\nhealths of their fellow-countrymen in a bumper of Wayte's best claret.\"\n\nOn a second occasion Jos read a brief announcement--Major Dobbin had\njoined the --th regiment at Chatham; and subsequently he promulgated\naccounts of the presentations at the Drawing-room of Colonel Sir\nMichael O'Dowd, K.C.B., Lady O'Dowd (by Mrs. Malloy Malony of\nBallymalony), and Miss Glorvina O'Dowd (by Lady O'Dowd).  Almost\ndirectly after this, Dobbin's name appeared among the Lieutenant-Colonels:\nfor old Marshal Tiptoff had died during the passage of the\n--th from Madras, and the Sovereign was pleased to advance Colonel Sir\nMichael O'Dowd to the rank of Major-General on his return to England,\nwith an intimation that he should be Colonel of the distinguished\nregiment which he had so long commanded.\n\nAmelia had been made aware of some of these movements.  The\ncorrespondence between George and his guardian had not ceased by any\nmeans:  William had even written once or twice to her since his\ndeparture, but in a manner so unconstrainedly cold that the poor woman\nfelt now in her turn that she had lost her power over him and that, as\nhe had said, he was free.  He had left her, and she was wretched.  The\nmemory of his almost countless services, and lofty and affectionate\nregard, now presented itself to her and rebuked her day and night.  She\nbrooded over those recollections according to her wont, saw the purity\nand beauty of the affection with which she had trifled, and reproached\nherself for having flung away such a treasure.\n\nIt was gone indeed.  William had spent it all out.  He loved her no\nmore, he thought, as he had loved her. He never could again.  That sort\nof regard, which he had proffered to her for so many faithful years,\ncan't be flung down and shattered and mended so as to show no scars.\nThe little heedless tyrant had so destroyed it.  No, William thought\nagain and again, \"It was myself I deluded and persisted in cajoling;\nhad she been worthy of the love I gave her, she would have returned it\nlong ago.  It was a fond mistake.  Isn't the whole course of life made\nup of such? And suppose I had won her, should I not have been\ndisenchanted the day after my victory? Why pine, or be ashamed of my\ndefeat?\" The more he thought of this long passage of his life, the more\nclearly he saw his deception.  \"I'll go into harness again,\" he said,\n\"and do my duty in that state of life in which it has pleased Heaven to\nplace me.  I will see that the buttons of the recruits are properly\nbright and that the sergeants make no mistakes in their accounts.  I\nwill dine at mess and listen to the Scotch surgeon telling his stories.\nWhen I am old and broken, I will go on half-pay, and my old sisters\nshall scold me.  I have geliebt und gelebet, as the girl in\n'Wallenstein' says.  I am done.  Pay the bills and get me a cigar:\nfind out what there is at the play to-night, Francis; to-morrow we\ncross by the Batavier.\" He made the above speech, whereof Francis only\nheard the last two lines, pacing up and down the Boompjes at Rotterdam.\nThe Batavier was lying in the basin.  He could see the place on the\nquarter-deck where he and Emmy had sat on the happy voyage out.  What\nhad that little Mrs. Crawley to say to him? Psha; to-morrow we will put\nto sea, and return to England, home, and duty!\n\nAfter June all the little Court Society of Pumpernickel used to\nseparate, according to the German plan, and make for a hundred\nwatering-places, where they drank at the wells, rode upon donkeys,\ngambled at the redoutes if they had money and a mind, rushed with\nhundreds of their kind to gourmandise at the tables d'hote, and idled\naway the summer.  The English diplomatists went off to Teoplitz and\nKissingen, their French rivals shut up their chancellerie and whisked\naway to their darling Boulevard de Gand. The Transparent reigning\nfamily took too to the waters, or retired to their hunting lodges.\nEverybody went away having any pretensions to politeness, and of\ncourse, with them, Doctor von Glauber, the Court Doctor, and his\nBaroness.  The seasons for the baths were the most productive periods\nof the Doctor's practice--he united business with pleasure, and his\nchief place of resort was Ostend, which is much frequented by Germans,\nand where the Doctor treated himself and his spouse to what he called a\n\"dib\" in the sea.\n\nHis interesting patient, Jos, was a regular milch-cow to the Doctor,\nand he easily persuaded the civilian, both for his own health's sake\nand that of his charming sister, which was really very much shattered,\nto pass the summer at that hideous seaport town.  Emmy did not care\nwhere she went much.  Georgy jumped at the idea of a move.  As for\nBecky, she came as a matter of course in the fourth place inside of the\nfine barouche Mr. Jos had bought, the two domestics being on the box in\nfront. She might have some misgivings about the friends whom she should\nmeet at Ostend, and who might be likely to tell ugly stories--but bah!\nshe was strong enough to hold her own.  She had cast such an anchor in\nJos now as would require a strong storm to shake.  That incident of the\npicture had finished him.  Becky took down her elephant and put it into\nthe little box which she had had from Amelia ever so many years ago.\nEmmy also came off with her Lares--her two pictures--and the party,\nfinally, were, lodged in an exceedingly dear and uncomfortable house at\nOstend.\n\nThere Amelia began to take baths and get what good she could from them,\nand though scores of people of Becky's acquaintance passed her and cut\nher, yet Mrs. Osborne, who walked about with her, and who knew nobody,\nwas not aware of the treatment experienced by the friend whom she had\nchosen so judiciously as a companion; indeed, Becky never thought fit\nto tell her what was passing under her innocent eyes.\n\nSome of Mrs. Rawdon Crawley's acquaintances, however, acknowledged her\nreadily enough,--perhaps more readily than she would have desired.\nAmong those were Major Loder (unattached), and Captain Rook (late of\nthe Rifles), who might be seen any day on the Dike, smoking and staring\nat the women, and who speedily got an introduction to the hospitable\nboard and select circle of Mr. Joseph Sedley.  In fact they would take\nno denial; they burst into the house whether Becky was at home or not,\nwalked into Mrs. Osborne's drawing-room, which they perfumed with their\ncoats and mustachios, called Jos \"Old buck,\" and invaded his\ndinner-table, and laughed and drank for long hours there.\n\n\"What can they mean?\" asked Georgy, who did not like these gentlemen.\n\"I heard the Major say to Mrs. Crawley yesterday, 'No, no, Becky, you\nshan't keep the old buck to yourself.  We must have the bones in, or,\ndammy, I'll split.' What could the Major mean, Mamma?\"\n\n\"Major!  don't call him Major!\" Emmy said.  \"I'm sure I can't tell what\nhe meant.\" His presence and that of his friend inspired the little lady\nwith intolerable terror and aversion.  They paid her tipsy compliments;\nthey leered at her over the dinner-table.  And the Captain made her\nadvances that filled her with sickening dismay, nor would she ever see\nhim unless she had George by her side.\n\nRebecca, to do her justice, never would let either of these men remain\nalone with Amelia; the Major was disengaged too, and swore he would be\nthe winner of her. A couple of ruffians were fighting for this innocent\ncreature, gambling for her at her own table, and though she was not\naware of the rascals' designs upon her, yet she felt a horror and\nuneasiness in their presence and longed to fly.\n\nShe besought, she entreated Jos to go.  Not he.  He was slow of\nmovement, tied to his Doctor, and perhaps to some other leading-strings.\nAt least Becky was not anxious to go to England.\n\nAt last she took a great resolution--made the great plunge.  She wrote\noff a letter to a friend whom she had on the other side of the water, a\nletter about which she did not speak a word to anybody, which she\ncarried herself to the post under her shawl; nor was any remark made\nabout it, only that she looked very much flushed and agitated when\nGeorgy met her, and she kissed him, and hung over him a great deal that\nnight.  She did not come out of her room after her return from her\nwalk. Becky thought it was Major Loder and the Captain who frightened\nher.\n\n\"She mustn't stop here,\" Becky reasoned with herself. \"She must go\naway, the silly little fool.  She is still whimpering after that gaby\nof a husband--dead (and served right!) these fifteen years. She shan't\nmarry either of these men.  It's too bad of Loder.  No; she shall marry\nthe bamboo cane, I'll settle it this very night.\"\n\nSo Becky took a cup of tea to Amelia in her private apartment and found\nthat lady in the company of her miniatures, and in a most melancholy\nand nervous condition.  She laid down the cup of tea.\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Amelia.\n\n\"Listen to me, Amelia,\" said Becky, marching up and down the room\nbefore the other and surveying her with a sort of contemptuous\nkindness.  \"I want to talk to you. You must go away from here and from\nthe impertinences of these men.  I won't have you harassed by them:\nand they will insult you if you stay.  I tell you they are rascals: men\nfit to send to the hulks.  Never mind how I know them. I know\neverybody.  Jos can't protect you; he is too weak and wants a protector\nhimself.  You are no more fit to live in the world than a baby in arms.\nYou must marry, or you and your precious boy will go to ruin.  You must\nhave a husband, you fool; and one of the best gentlemen I ever saw has\noffered you a hundred times, and you have rejected him, you silly,\nheartless, ungrateful little creature!\"\n\n\"I tried--I tried my best, indeed I did, Rebecca,\" said Amelia\ndeprecatingly, \"but I couldn't forget--\"; and she finished the sentence\nby looking up at the portrait.\n\n\"Couldn't forget HIM!\" cried out Becky, \"that selfish humbug, that\nlow-bred cockney dandy, that padded booby, who had neither wit, nor\nmanners, nor heart, and was no more to be compared to your friend with\nthe bamboo cane than you are to Queen Elizabeth.  Why, the man was\nweary of you, and would have jilted you, but that Dobbin forced him to\nkeep his word.  He owned it to me.  He never cared for you. He used to\nsneer about you to me, time after time, and made love to me the week\nafter he married you.\"\n\n\"It's false!  It's false!  Rebecca,\" cried out Amelia, starting up.\n\n\"Look there, you fool,\" Becky said, still with provoking good humour,\nand taking a little paper out of her belt, she opened it and flung it\ninto Emmy's lap.  \"You know his handwriting.  He wrote that to\nme--wanted me to run away with him--gave it me under your nose, the day\nbefore he was shot--and served him right!\" Becky repeated.\n\nEmmy did not hear her; she was looking at the letter. It was that which\nGeorge had put into the bouquet and given to Becky on the night of the\nDuchess of Richmond's ball.  It was as she said:  the foolish young man\nhad asked her to fly.\n\nEmmy's head sank down, and for almost the last time in which she shall\nbe called upon to weep in this history, she commenced that work.  Her\nhead fell to her bosom, and her hands went up to her eyes; and there\nfor a while, she gave way to her emotions, as Becky stood on and\nregarded her.  Who shall analyse those tears and say whether they were\nsweet or bitter? Was she most grieved because the idol of her life was\ntumbled down and shivered at her feet, or indignant that her love had\nbeen so despised, or glad because the barrier was removed which modesty\nhad placed between her and a new, a real affection? \"There is nothing\nto forbid me now,\" she thought. \"I may love him with all my heart now.\nOh, I will, I will, if he will but let me and forgive me.\" I believe it\nwas this feeling rushed over all the others which agitated that gentle\nlittle bosom.\n\nIndeed, she did not cry so much as Becky expected--the other soothed\nand kissed her--a rare mark of sympathy with Mrs. Becky.  She treated\nEmmy like a child and patted her head.  \"And now let us get pen and ink\nand write to him to come this minute,\" she said.\n\n\"I--I wrote to him this morning,\" Emmy said, blushing exceedingly.\nBecky screamed with laughter--\"Un biglietto,\" she sang out with Rosina,\n\"eccolo qua!\"--the whole house echoed with her shrill singing.\n\nTwo mornings after this little scene, although the day was rainy and\ngusty, and Amelia had had an exceedingly wakeful night, listening to\nthe wind roaring, and pitying all travellers by land and by water, yet\nshe got up early and insisted upon taking a walk on the Dike with\nGeorgy; and there she paced as the rain beat into her face, and she\nlooked out westward across the dark sea line and over the swollen\nbillows which came tumbling and frothing to the shore. Neither spoke\nmuch, except now and then, when the boy said a few words to his timid\ncompanion, indicative of sympathy and protection.\n\n\"I hope he won't cross in such weather,\" Emmy said.\n\n\"I bet ten to one he does,\" the boy answered.  \"Look, Mother, there's\nthe smoke of the steamer.\" It was that signal, sure enough.\n\nBut though the steamer was under way, he might not be on board; he\nmight not have got the letter; he might not choose to come.  A hundred\nfears poured one over the other into the little heart, as fast as the\nwaves on to the Dike.\n\nThe boat followed the smoke into sight.  Georgy had a dandy telescope\nand got the vessel under view in the most skilful manner. And he made\nappropriate nautical comments upon the manner of the approach of the\nsteamer as she came nearer and nearer, dipping and rising in the water.\nThe signal of an English steamer in sight went fluttering up to the\nmast on the pier.  I daresay Mrs. Amelia's heart was in a similar\nflutter.\n\nEmmy tried to look through the telescope over George's shoulder, but\nshe could make nothing of it. She only saw a black eclipse bobbing up\nand down before her eyes.\n\nGeorge took the glass again and raked the vessel. \"How she does pitch!\"\nhe said.  \"There goes a wave slap over her bows.  There's only two\npeople on deck besides the steersman.  There's a man lying down, and\na--chap in a--cloak with a--Hooray!--it's Dob, by Jingo!\" He clapped to\nthe telescope and flung his arms round his mother.  As for that lady,\nlet us say what she did in the words of a favourite poet--\"Dakruoen\ngelasasa.\" She was sure it was William.  It could be no other.  What\nshe had said about hoping that he would not come was all hypocrisy.  Of\ncourse he would come; what could he do else but come? She knew he would\ncome.\n\nThe ship came swiftly nearer and nearer.  As they went in to meet her\nat the landing-place at the quay, Emmy's knees trembled so that she\nscarcely could run.  She would have liked to kneel down and say her\nprayers of thanks there.  Oh, she thought, she would be all her life\nsaying them!\n\nIt was such a bad day that as the vessel came alongside of the quay\nthere were no idlers abroad, scarcely even a commissioner on the look\nout for the few passengers in the steamer.  That young scapegrace\nGeorge had fled too, and as the gentleman in the old cloak lined with\nred stuff stepped on to the shore, there was scarcely any one present\nto see what took place, which was briefly this:\n\nA lady in a dripping white bonnet and shawl, with her two little hands\nout before her, went up to him, and in the next minute she had\naltogether disappeared under the folds of the old cloak, and was\nkissing one of his hands with all her might; whilst the other, I\nsuppose, was engaged in holding her to his heart (which her head just\nabout reached) and in preventing her from tumbling down.  She was\nmurmuring something about--forgive--dear William--dear, dear, dearest\nfriend--kiss, kiss, kiss, and so forth--and in fact went on under the\ncloak in an absurd manner.\n\nWhen Emmy emerged from it, she still kept tight hold of one of\nWilliam's hands, and\n\n### Summary:\n\n", "answer": "Becky is psyched to live in the comfort and affection of Amelia and Jos's place. Like she usually does when she's taken care of, she starts to try to please everyone around her. She does this quite well. Jos is quickly wrapped around Becky's little finger. He starts to give little parties in her honor, and a part of society immediately accepts her. Amelia is at first kind of put off by having to be yet again second banana to the much more dynamic and personable Becky, but soon enough Becky figures out how to please her. And that's by talking about Dobbin. A lot. Mostly about how super-wonderful he is. Amelia is pretty depressed about Dobbin going away. She talks about him and how good a man he is to George Jr. One day Becky gets her much-discussed luggage from abroad, but there doesn't seem to be anything much in it besides some papers. However, one of the things she takes out of it is...the portrait of Jos on an elephant she and Rawdon bought at the Sedleys' auction! She puts it up in her room and tells Jos how she's kept it all these years because it's...very...sentimentally...meaningful. Hint, hint. This is the final straw, and Jos falls head over heels into Becky-obsession. Jos reads in the paper that Dobbin is going to be promoted from Major to Lieutenant-Colonel. Amelia already knows about this because she makes George Jr. maintain a very steady correspondence with Dobbin . Finally, the season in Pumpernickel is over. Jos's doctor recommends the mineral baths at Ostend, so that's where they go. Unfortunately, they run into some of Becky old gambling and cheating acquaintances there. Two men in particular attach themselves to Amelia in the hopes of marrying her and getting her money. Becky feels terrible about this. She tries to get Jos to leave Ostend, but he is a slow mover. As a last resort, Becky decides to have it all out with Amelia. She brings up Dobbin. Amelia tells her that she really tried to be into him but couldn't ever get over George. At this, Becky shows Amelia the note that George wrote asking her to run off and get it on with him. Amelia cries a little bit but is actually relieved that she is no longer bound to George's memory. Becky tells her to write a letter to Dobbin, and Amelia says...that she already has! Nice! Two days later, Dobbin comes to Ostend, and as soon as he gets off the boat, he and Amelia hug and kiss and make up. Then they get married. The narrator mocks Dobbin for finally getting what he's wanted for eighteen years, because Amelia is clearly no great shakes. But, to each his own. And now, here is what happened to everyone we've met. Peggy O'Dowd's husband is now a Major-General and they live back in Ireland. Colonel Dobbin resigned his army commission and he and Amelia now live near Queen's Crawley. Amelia has a daughter with him. At Queen's Crawley, Pitt is no longer in Parliament as a result of the Reform Bill. Lady Jane and Amelia become fast friends. George Jr. and Rawdon Jr. become good friends too, eventually going to the same college, and then fighting over Jane and Pitt's daughter, with whom they both end up in love. No one mentions Becky. Becky and Jos travel everywhere together, and \"that infatuated man seemed to be entirely her slave\" . Jos takes out a huge life insurance policy, and Dobbin goes to Brussels to find out what the deal is. Turns out Becky and Jos live in different suites in the same hotel. Jos has nice things to say about Becky, who it seems has taken care of him through some weird illnesses, but he also seems very scared of her. He says he insured his life so she would be taken care of if something happens to him. Dobbin asks Jos to get away from her somehow, maybe go back to India. Jos breaks down and says that he'd love to escape, but he's too scared to leave with Dobbin straightaway. Three months later, Jos dies. The insurance company cries foul play and refuses to pay. Becky hires lawyers. Oddly enough, they have the same names as a bunch of recent mass-murderers. Hmm...a hint perhaps? Finally, the money is paid. Rawdon dies at his post in Coventry Island. Pitt dies. The estate and title go to Rawdon Jr. as the next male heir. Rawdon Jr. refuses to have anything to do with Becky, though he does pay her an allowance. Becky lives well at the resort town of Bath. She has friends there who love her, along with some enemies. Dobbin loves Amelia less now. Mostly he loves his daughter and his history books. The end. Woohoo!"}

CAMP LAURENCE.\n\n\n                             \n\n\n                 [Illustration: Beth was post-mistress]\n\nBeth was post-mistress, for, being most at home, she could attend to it\nregularly, and dearly liked the daily task of unlocking the little door\nand distributing the mail. One July day she came in with her hands full,\nand went about the house leaving letters and parcels, like the penny\npost.\n\n\"Here's your posy, mother! Laurie never forgets that,\" she said, putting\nthe fresh nosegay in the vase that stood in \"Marmee's corner,\" and was\nkept supplied by the affectionate boy.\n\n\"Miss Meg March, one letter and a glove,\" continued Beth, delivering the\narticles to her sister, who sat near her mother, stitching wristbands.\n\n\"Why, I left a pair over there, and here is only one,\" said Meg, looking\nat the gray cotton glove.\n\n\"Didn't you drop the other in the garden?\"\n\n\"No, I'm sure I didn't; for there was only one in the office.\"\n\n\"I hate to have odd gloves! Never mind, the other may be found. My\nletter is only a translation of the German song I wanted; I think Mr.\nBrooke did it, for this isn't Laurie's writing.\"\n\nMrs. March glanced at Meg, who was looking very pretty in her gingham\nmorning-gown, with the little curls blowing about her forehead, and very\nwomanly, as she sat sewing at her little work-table, full of tidy white\nrolls; so unconscious of the thought in her mother's mind as she sewed\nand sung, while her fingers flew, and her thoughts were busied with\ngirlish fancies as innocent and fresh as the pansies in her belt, that\nMrs. March smiled, and was satisfied.\n\n\"Two letters for Doctor Jo, a book, and a funny old hat, which covered\nthe whole post-office, stuck outside,\" said Beth, laughing, as she went\ninto the study, where Jo sat writing.\n\n\"What a sly fellow Laurie is! I said I wished bigger hats were the\nfashion, because I burn my face every hot day. He said, 'Why mind the\nfashion? Wear a big hat, and be comfortable!' I said I would if I had\none, and he has sent me this, to try me. I'll wear it, for fun, and show\nhim I _don't_ care for the fashion;\" and, hanging the antique broad-brim\non a bust of Plato, Jo read her letters.\n\nOne from her mother made her cheeks glow and her eyes fill, for it said\nto her,--\n\n    \"MY DEAR:\n\n    \"I write a little word to tell you with how much satisfaction I\n    watch your efforts to control your temper. You say nothing about\n    your trials, failures, or successes, and think, perhaps, that no\n    one sees them but the Friend whose help you daily ask, if I may\n    trust the well-worn cover of your guide-book. _I_, too, have\n    seen them all, and heartily believe in the sincerity of your\n    resolution, since it begins to bear fruit. Go on, dear,\n    patiently and bravely, and always believe that no one\n    sympathizes more tenderly with you than your loving\n\n                                                           \"MOTHER.\"\n\n\"That does me good! that's worth millions of money and pecks of praise.\nO Marmee, I do try! I will keep on trying, and not get tired, since I\nhave you to help me.\"\n\nLaying her head on her arms, Jo wet her little romance with a few happy\ntears, for she _had_ thought that no one saw and appreciated her efforts\nto be good; and this assurance was doubly precious, doubly encouraging,\nbecause unexpected, and from the person whose commendation she most\nvalued. Feeling stronger than ever to meet and subdue her Apollyon, she\npinned the note inside her frock, as a shield and a reminder, lest she\nbe taken unaware, and proceeded to open her other letter, quite ready\nfor either good or bad news. In a big, dashing hand, Laurie wrote,--\n\n                \"DEAR JO,\n                 What ho!\n\n    Some English girls and boys are coming to see me to-morrow and\n    I want to have a jolly time. If it's fine, I'm going to pitch\n    my tent in Longmeadow, and row up the whole crew to lunch and\n    croquet,--have a fire, make messes, gypsy fashion, and all\n    sorts of larks. They are nice people, and like such things.\n    Brooke will go, to keep us boys steady, and Kate Vaughn will\n    play propriety for the girls. I want you all to come; can't let\n    Beth off, at any price, and nobody shall worry her. Don't\n    bother about rations,--I'll see to that, and everything\n    else,--only do come, there's a good fellow!\n\n                \"In a tearing hurry,\n                 Yours ever, LAURIE.\"\n\n\"Here's richness!\" cried Jo, flying in to tell the news to Meg.\n\n\"Of course we can go, mother? it will be such a help to Laurie, for I\ncan row, and Meg see to the lunch, and the children be useful in some\nway.\"\n\n\"I hope the Vaughns are not fine, grown-up people. Do you know anything\nabout them, Jo?\" asked Meg.\n\n\"Only that there are four of them. Kate is older than you, Fred and\nFrank (twins) about my age, and a little girl (Grace), who is nine or\nten. Laurie knew them abroad, and liked the boys; I fancied, from the\nway he primmed up his mouth in speaking of her, that he didn't admire\nKate much.\"\n\n\"I'm so glad my French print is clean; it's just the thing, and so\nbecoming!\" observed Meg complacently. \"Have you anything decent, Jo?\"\n\n\"Scarlet and gray boating suit, good enough for me. I shall row and\ntramp about, so I don't want any starch to think of. You'll come,\nBethy?\"\n\n\"If you won't let any of the boys talk to me.\"\n\n\"Not a boy!\"\n\n\"I like to please Laurie; and I'm not afraid of Mr. Brooke, he is so\nkind; but I don't want to play, or sing, or say anything. I'll work\nhard, and not trouble any one; and you'll take care of me, Jo, so I'll\ngo.\"\n\n\"That's my good girl; you do try to fight off your shyness, and I love\nyou for it. Fighting faults isn't easy, as I know; and a cheery word\nkind of gives a lift. Thank you, mother,\" and Jo gave the thin cheek a\ngrateful kiss, more precious to Mrs. March than if it had given back the\nrosy roundness of her youth.\n\n\"I had a box of chocolate drops, and the picture I wanted to copy,\" said\nAmy, showing her mail.\n\n\"And I got a note from Mr. Laurence, asking me to come over and play to\nhim to-night, before the lamps are lighted, and I shall go,\" added Beth,\nwhose friendship with the old gentleman prospered finely.\n\n\"Now let's fly round, and do double duty to-day, so that we can play\nto-morrow with free minds,\" said Jo, preparing to replace her pen with a\nbroom.\n\nWhen the sun peeped into the girls' room early next morning, to promise\nthem a fine day, he saw a comical sight. Each had made such preparation\nfor the fête as seemed necessary and proper. Meg had an extra row of\nlittle curl-papers across her forehead, Jo had copiously anointed her\nafflicted face with cold cream, Beth had taken Joanna to bed with her to\natone for the approaching separation, and Amy had capped the climax by\nputting a clothes-pin on her nose, to uplift the offending feature. It\nwas one of the kind artists use to hold the paper on their\ndrawing-boards, therefore quite appropriate and effective for the\npurpose to which it was now put. This funny spectacle appeared to amuse\nthe sun, for he burst out with such radiance that Jo woke up, and\nroused all her sisters by a hearty laugh at Amy's ornament.\n\n  [Illustration: Amy capped the climax by putting a clothes-pin on her\n                                 nose]\n\nSunshine and laughter were good omens for a pleasure party, and soon a\nlively bustle began in both houses. Beth, who was ready first, kept\nreporting what went on next door, and enlivened her sisters' toilets by\nfrequent telegrams from the window.\n\n\"There goes the man with the tent! I see Mrs. Barker doing up the lunch\nin a hamper and a great basket. Now Mr. Laurence is looking up at the\nsky, and the weathercock; I wish he would go, too. There's Laurie,\nlooking like a sailor,--nice boy! Oh, mercy me! here's a carriage full\nof people--a tall lady, a little girl, and two dreadful boys. One is\nlame; poor thing, he's got a crutch. Laurie didn't tell us that. Be\nquick, girls! it's getting late. Why, there is Ned Moffat, I do declare.\nLook, Meg, isn't that the man who bowed to you one day, when we were\nshopping?\"\n\n\"So it is. How queer that he should come. I thought he was at the\nMountains. There is Sallie; I'm glad she got back in time. Am I all\nright, Jo?\" cried Meg, in a flutter.\n\n\"A regular daisy. Hold up your dress and put your hat straight; it looks\nsentimental tipped that way, and will fly off at the first puff. Now,\nthen, come on!\"\n\n\"O Jo, you are not going to wear that awful hat? It's too absurd! You\nshall _not_ make a guy of yourself,\" remonstrated Meg, as Jo tied down,\nwith a red ribbon, the broad-brimmed, old-fashioned Leghorn Laurie had\nsent for a joke.\n\n\"I just will, though, for it's capital,--so shady, light, and big. It\nwill make fun; and I don't mind being a guy if I'm comfortable.\" With\nthat Jo marched straight away, and the rest followed,--a bright little\nband of sisters, all looking their best, in summer suits, with happy\nfaces under the jaunty hat-brims.\n\nLaurie ran to meet, and present them to his friends, in the most cordial\nmanner. The lawn was the reception-room, and for several minutes a\nlively scene was enacted there. Meg was grateful to see that Miss Kate,\nthough twenty, was dressed with a simplicity which American girls would\ndo well to imitate; and she was much flattered by Mr. Ned's assurances\nthat he came especially to see her. Jo understood why Laurie \"primmed up\nhis mouth\" when speaking of Kate, for that young lady had a\nstand-off-don't-touch-me air, which contrasted strongly with the free\nand easy demeanor of the other girls. Beth took an observation of the\nnew boys, and decided that the lame one was not \"dreadful,\" but gentle\nand feeble, and she would be kind to him on that account. Amy found\nGrace a well-mannered, merry little person; and after staring dumbly at\none another for a few minutes, they suddenly became very good friends.\n\nTents, lunch, and croquet utensils having been sent on beforehand, the\nparty was soon embarked, and the two boats pushed off together, leaving\nMr. Laurence waving his hat on the shore. Laurie and Jo rowed one boat;\nMr. Brooke and Ned the other; while Fred Vaughn, the riotous twin, did\nhis best to upset both by paddling about in a wherry like a disturbed\nwater-bug. Jo's funny hat deserved a vote of thanks, for it was of\ngeneral utility; it broke the ice in the beginning, by producing a\nlaugh; it created quite a refreshing breeze, flapping to and fro, as she\nrowed, and would make an excellent umbrella for the whole party, if a\nshower came up, she said. Kate looked rather amazed at Jo's proceedings,\nespecially as she exclaimed \"Christopher Columbus!\" when she lost her\noar; and Laurie said, \"My dear fellow, did I hurt you?\" when he tripped\nover her feet in taking his place. But after putting up her glass to\nexamine the queer girl several times, Miss Kate decided that she was\n\"odd, but rather clever,\" and smiled upon her from afar.\n\n              [Illustration: Mr. Laurence waving his hat]\n\nMeg, in the other boat, was delightfully situated, face to face with the\nrowers, who both admired the prospect, and feathered their oars with\nuncommon \"skill and dexterity.\" Mr. Brooke was a grave, silent young\nman, with handsome brown eyes and a pleasant voice. Meg liked his quiet\nmanners, and considered him a walking encyclopædia of useful knowledge.\nHe never talked to her much; but he looked at her a good deal, and she\nfelt sure that he did not regard her with aversion. Ned, being in\ncollege, of course put on all the airs which Freshmen think it their\nbounden duty to assume; he was not very wise, but very good-natured, and\naltogether an excellent person to carry on a picnic. Sallie Gardiner was\nabsorbed in keeping her white piqué dress clean, and chattering with the\nubiquitous Fred, who kept Beth in constant terror by his pranks.\n\nIt was not far to Longmeadow; but the tent was pitched and the wickets\ndown by the time they arrived. A pleasant green field, with three\nwide-spreading oaks in the middle, and a smooth strip of turf for\ncroquet.\n\n\"Welcome to Camp Laurence!\" said the young host, as they landed, with\nexclamations of delight.\n\n\"Brooke is commander-in-chief; I am commissary-general; the other\nfellows are staff-officers; and you, ladies, are company. The tent is\nfor your especial benefit, and that oak is your drawing-room; this is\nthe mess-room, and the third is the camp-kitchen. Now, let's have a game\nbefore it gets hot, and then we'll see about dinner.\"\n\nFrank, Beth, Amy, and Grace sat down to watch the game played by the\nother eight. Mr. Brooke chose Meg, Kate, and Fred; Laurie took Sallie,\nJo, and Ned. The Englishers played well; but the Americans played\nbetter, and contested every inch of the ground as strongly as if the\nspirit of '76 inspired them. Jo and Fred had several skirmishes, and\nonce narrowly escaped high words. Jo was through the last wicket, and\nhad missed the stroke, which failure ruffled her a good deal. Fred was\nclose behind her, and his turn came before hers; he gave a stroke, his\nball hit the wicket, and stopped an inch on the wrong side. No one was\nvery near; and running up to examine, he gave it a sly nudge with his\ntoe, which put it just an inch on the right side.\n\n\"I'm through! Now, Miss Jo, I'll settle you, and get in first,\" cried\nthe young gentleman, swinging his mallet for another blow.\n\n             [Illustration: Now, Miss Jo, I'll settle you]\n\n\"You pushed it; I saw you; it's my turn now,\" said Jo sharply.\n\n\"Upon my word, I didn't move it; it rolled a bit, perhaps, but that is\nallowed; so stand off, please, and let me have a go at the stake.\"\n\n\"We don't cheat in America, but you can, if you choose,\" said Jo\nangrily.\n\n\"Yankees are a deal the most tricky, everybody knows. There you go!\"\nreturned Fred, croqueting her ball far away.\n\nJo opened her lips to say something rude, but checked herself in time,\ncolored up to her forehead, and stood a minute, hammering down a wicket\nwith all her might, while Fred hit the stake, and declared himself out\nwith much exultation. She went off to get her ball, and was a long time\nfinding it, among the bushes; but she came back, looking cool and quiet,\nand waited her turn patiently. It took several strokes to regain the\nplace she had lost; and, when she got there, the other side had nearly\nwon, for Kate's ball was the last but one, and lay near the stake.\n\n\"By George, it's all up with us! Good-by, Kate. Miss Jo owes me one, so\nyou are finished,\" cried Fred excitedly, as they all drew near to see\nthe finish.\n\n\"Yankees have a trick of being generous to their enemies,\" said Jo, with\na look that made the lad redden, \"especially when they beat them,\" she\nadded, as, leaving Kate's ball untouched, she won the game by a clever\nstroke.\n\nLaurie threw up his hat; then remembered that it wouldn't do to exult\nover the defeat of his guests, and stopped in the middle of a cheer to\nwhisper to his friend,--\n\n\"Good for you, Jo! He did cheat, I saw him; we can't tell him so, but he\nwon't do it again, take my word for it.\"\n\nMeg drew her aside, under pretence of pinning up a loose braid, and said\napprovingly,--\n\n\"It was dreadfully provoking; but you kept your temper, and I'm so glad,\nJo.\"\n\n\"Don't praise me, Meg, for I could box his ears this minute. I should\ncertainly have boiled over if I hadn't stayed among the nettles till I\ngot my rage under enough to hold my tongue. It's simmering now, so I\nhope he'll keep out of my way,\" returned Jo, biting her lips, as she\nglowered at Fred from under her big hat.\n\n\"Time for lunch,\" said Mr. Brooke, looking at his watch.\n\"Commissary-general, will you make the fire and get water, while Miss\nMarch, Miss Sallie, and I spread the table? Who can make good coffee?\"\n\n\"Jo can,\" said Meg, glad to recommend her sister. So Jo, feeling that\nher late lessons in cookery were to do her honor, went to preside over\nthe coffee-pot, while the children collected dry sticks, and the boys\nmade a fire, and got water from a spring near by. Miss Kate sketched,\nand Frank talked to Beth, who was making little mats of braided rushes\nto serve as plates.\n\nThe commander-in-chief and his aids soon spread the table-cloth with an\ninviting array of eatables and drinkables, prettily decorated with green\nleaves. Jo announced that the coffee was ready, and every one settled\nthemselves to a hearty meal; for youth is seldom dyspeptic, and exercise\ndevelops wholesome appetites. A very merry lunch it was; for everything\nseemed fresh and funny, and frequent peals of laughter startled a\nvenerable horse who fed near by. There was a pleasing inequality in the\ntable, which produced many mishaps to cups and plates; acorns dropped\ninto the milk, little black ants partook of the refreshments without\nbeing invited, and fuzzy caterpillars swung down from the tree, to see\nwhat was going on. Three white-headed children peeped over the fence,\nand an objectionable dog barked at them from the other side of the river\nwith all his might and main.\n\n        [Illustration: \"A very merry lunch it was.\"--Page 156.]\n\n\"There's salt here, if you prefer it,\" said Laurie, as he handed Jo a\nsaucer of berries.\n\n\"Thank you, I prefer spiders,\" she replied, fishing up two unwary little\nones who had gone to a creamy death. \"How dare you remind me of that\nhorrid dinner-party, when yours is so nice in every way?\" added Jo,\nas they both laughed, and ate out of one plate, the china having run\nshort.\n\n\"I had an uncommonly good time that day, and haven't got over it yet.\nThis is no credit to me, you know; I don't do anything; it's you and Meg\nand Brooke who make it go, and I'm no end obliged to you. What shall we\ndo when we can't eat any more?\" asked Laurie, feeling that his trump\ncard had been played when lunch was over.\n\n\"Have games, till it's cooler. I brought 'Authors,' and I dare say Miss\nKate knows something new and nice. Go and ask her; she's company, and\nyou ought to stay with her more.\"\n\n\"Aren't you company too? I thought she'd suit Brooke; but he keeps\ntalking to Meg, and Kate just stares at them through that ridiculous\nglass of hers. I'm going, so you needn't try to preach propriety, for\nyou can't do it, Jo.\"\n\nMiss Kate did know several new games; and as the girls would not, and\nthe boys could not, eat any more, they all adjourned to the drawing-room\nto play \"Rigmarole.\"\n\n\"One person begins a story, any nonsense you like, and tells as long as\nhe pleases, only taking care to stop short at some exciting point, when\nthe next takes it up and does the same. It's very funny when well done,\nand makes a perfect jumble of tragical comical stuff to laugh over.\nPlease start it, Mr. Brooke,\" said Kate, with a commanding air, which\nsurprised Meg, who treated the tutor with as much respect as any other\ngentleman.\n\nLying on the grass at the feet of the two young ladies, Mr. Brooke\nobediently began the story, with the handsome brown eyes steadily fixed\nupon the sunshiny river.\n\n\"Once on a time, a knight went out into the world to seek his fortune,\nfor he had nothing but his sword and his shield. He travelled a long\nwhile, nearly eight-and-twenty years, and had a hard time of it, till he\ncame to the palace of a good old king, who had offered a reward to any\none who would tame and train a fine but unbroken colt, of which he was\nvery fond. The knight agreed to try, and got on slowly but surely; for\nthe colt was a gallant fellow, and soon learned to love his new master,\nthough he was freakish and wild. Every day, when he gave his lessons to\nthis pet of the king's, the knight rode him through the city; and, as\nhe rode, he looked everywhere for a certain beautiful face, which he had\nseen many times in his dreams, but never found. One day, as he went\nprancing down a quiet street, he saw at the window of a ruinous castle\nthe lovely face. He was delighted, inquired who lived in this old\ncastle, and was told that several captive princesses were kept there by\na spell, and spun all day to lay up money to buy their liberty. The\nknight wished intensely that he could free them; but he was poor, and\ncould only go by each day, watching for the sweet face, and longing to\nsee it out in the sunshine. At last, he resolved to get into the castle\nand ask how he could help them. He went and knocked; the great door flew\nopen, and he beheld--\"\n\n          [Illustration: He went prancing down a quiet street]\n\n\"A ravishingly lovely lady, who exclaimed, with a cry of rapture, 'At\nlast! at last!'\" continued Kate, who had read French novels, and admired\nthe style. \"''Tis she!' cried Count Gustave, and fell at her feet in an\necstasy of joy. 'Oh, rise!' she said, extending a hand of marble\nfairness. 'Never! till you tell me how I may rescue you,' swore the\nknight, still kneeling. 'Alas, my cruel fate condemns me to remain here\ntill my tyrant is destroyed.' 'Where is the villain?' 'In the mauve\nsalon. Go, brave heart, and save me from despair.' 'I obey, and return\nvictorious or dead!' With these thrilling words he rushed away, and\nflinging open the door of the mauve salon, was about to enter, when he\nreceived--\"\n\n                  [Illustration: \"Oh, rise,\" she said]\n\n\"A stunning blow from the big Greek lexicon, which an old fellow in a\nblack gown fired at him,\" said Ned. \"Instantly Sir What's-his-name\nrecovered himself, pitched the tyrant out of the window, and turned to\njoin the lady, victorious, but with a bump on his brow; found the door\nlocked, tore up the curtains, made a rope ladder, got half-way down when\nthe ladder broke, and he went head first into the moat, sixty feet\nbelow. Could swim like a duck, paddled round the castle till he came to\na little door guarded by two stout fellows; knocked their heads together\ntill they cracked like a couple of nuts, then, by a trifling exertion of\nhis prodigious strength, he smashed in the door, went up a pair of stone\nsteps covered with dust a foot thick, toads as big as your fist, and\nspiders that would frighten you into hysterics, Miss March. At the top\nof these steps he came plump upon a sight that took his breath away and\nchilled his blood--\"\n\n       [Illustration: A stunning blow from the big Greek lexicon]\n\n\"A tall figure, all in white with a veil over its face and a lamp in its\nwasted hand,\" went on Meg. \"It beckoned, gliding noiselessly before him\ndown a corridor as dark and cold as any tomb. Shadowy effigies in armor\nstood on either side, a dead silence reigned, the lamp burned blue, and\nthe ghostly figure ever and anon turned its face toward him, showing the\nglitter of awful eyes through its white veil. They reached a curtained\ndoor, behind which sounded lovely music; he sprang forward to enter, but\nthe spectre plucked him back, and waved threateningly before him a--\"\n\n\"Snuff-box,\" said Jo, in a sepulchral tone, which convulsed the\naudience. \"'Thankee,' said the knight politely, as he took a pinch, and\nsneezed seven times so violently that his head fell off. 'Ha! ha!'\nlaughed the ghost; and having peeped through the key-hole at the\nprincesses spinning away for dear life, the evil spirit picked up her\nvictim and put him in a large tin box, where there were eleven other\nknights packed together without their heads, like sardines, who all rose\nand began to--\"\n\n                       [Illustration: He sneezed]\n\n\"Dance a hornpipe,\" cut in Fred, as Jo paused for breath; \"and, as they\ndanced, the rubbishy old castle turned to a man-of-war in full sail. 'Up\nwith the jib, reef the tops'l halliards, helm hard a lee, and man the\nguns!' roared the captain, as a Portuguese pirate hove in sight, with a\nflag black as ink flying from her foremast. 'Go in and win, my\nhearties!' says the captain; and a tremendous fight begun. Of course the\nBritish beat; they always do.\"\n\n\"No, they don't!\" cried Jo, aside.\n\n\"Having taken the pirate captain prisoner, sailed slap over the\nschooner, whose decks were piled with dead, and whose lee-scuppers ran\nblood, for the order had been 'Cutlasses, and die hard!' 'Bosen's mate,\ntake a bight of the flying-jib sheet, and start this villain if he don't\nconfess his sins double quick,' said the British captain. The Portuguese\nheld his tongue like a brick, and walked the plank, while the jolly tars\ncheered like mad. But the sly dog dived, came up under the man-of-war,\nscuttled her, and down she went, with all sail set, 'To the bottom of\nthe sea, sea, sea,' where--\"\n\n            [Illustration: The Portuguese walked the plank]\n\n\"Oh, gracious! what _shall_ I say?\" cried Sallie, as Fred ended his\nrigmarole, in which he had jumbled together, pell-mell, nautical phrases\nand facts, out of one of his favorite books. \"Well they went to the\nbottom, and a nice mermaid welcomed them, but was much grieved on\nfinding the box of headless knights, and kindly pickled them in brine,\nhoping to discover the mystery about them; for, being a woman, she was\ncurious. By and by a diver came down, and the mermaid said, 'I'll give\nyou this box of pearls if you can take it up;' for she wanted to restore\nthe poor things to life, and couldn't raise the heavy load herself. So\nthe diver hoisted it up, and was much disappointed, on opening it, to\nfind no pearls. He left it in a great lonely field, where it was found\nby a--\"\n\n\"Little goose-girl, who kept a hundred fat geese in the field,\" said\nAmy, when Sallie's invention gave out. \"The little girl was sorry for\nthem, and asked an old woman what she should do to help them. 'Your\ngeese will tell you, they know everything,' said the old woman. So she\nasked what she should use for new heads, since the old ones were lost,\nand all the geese opened their hundred mouths and screamed--\"\n\n\"'Cabbages!'\" continued Laurie promptly. \"'Just the thing,' said the\ngirl, and ran to get twelve fine ones from her garden. She put them on,\nthe knights revived at once, thanked her, and went on their way\nrejoicing, never knowing the difference, for there were so many other\nheads like them in the world that no one thought anything of it. The\nknight in whom I'm interested went back to find the pretty face, and\nlearned that the princesses had spun themselves free, and all gone to be\nmarried, but one. He was in a great state of mind at that; and mounting\nthe colt, who stood by him through thick and thin, rushed to the castle\nto see which was left. Peeping over the hedge, he saw the queen of his\naffections picking flowers in her garden. 'Will you give me a rose?'\nsaid he. 'You must come and get it. I can't come to you; it isn't\nproper,' said she, as sweet as honey. He tried to climb over the hedge,\nbut it seemed to grow higher and higher; then he tried to push through,\nbut it grew thicker and thicker, and he was in despair. So he patiently\nbroke twig after twig, till he had made a little hole, through which he\npeeped, saying imploringly, 'Let me in! let me in!' But the pretty\nprincess did not seem to understand, for she picked her roses quietly,\nand left him to fight his way in. Whether he did or not, Frank will tell\nyou.\"\n\n                [Illustration: Will you give me a rose?]\n\n\"I can't; I'm not playing, I never do,\" said Frank, dismayed at the\nsentimental predicament out of which he was to rescue the absurd couple.\nBeth had disappeared behind Jo, and Grace was asleep.\n\n\"So the poor knight is to be left sticking in the hedge, is he?\" asked\nMr. Brooke, still watching the river, and playing with the wild rose in\nhis button-hole.\n\n\"I guess the princess gave him a posy, and opened the gate, after a\nwhile,\" said Laurie, smiling to himself, as he threw acorns at his\ntutor.\n\n\"What a piece of nonsense we have made! With practice we might do\nsomething quite clever. Do you know 'Truth'?\" asked Sallie, after they\nhad laughed over their story.\n\n\"I hope so,\" said Meg soberly.\n\n\"The game, I mean?\"\n\n\"What is it?\" said Fred.\n\n\"Why, you pile up your hands, choose a number, and draw out in turn, and\nthe person who draws at the number has to answer truly any questions put\nby the rest. It's great fun.\"\n\n\"Let's try it,\" said Jo, who liked new experiments.\n\nMiss Kate and Mr. Brooke, Meg, and Ned declined, but Fred, Sallie, Jo,\nand Laurie piled and drew; and the lot fell to Laurie.\n\n\"Who are your heroes?\" asked Jo.\n\n\n\n### Summary:\n\n", "answer": "Camp Laurence Beth's delivery of the post one summer day brings several things. Meg receives one glove and a poem translated from German by Mr. Brooke, which makes Mrs. March wonder about Mr. Brooke's intentions for Meg. Jo receives a note from her Mother admiring how she is working to master her temper, for which she is grateful. Finally, Laurie has sent an invitation for all the girls to spend the day boating and camping with some visiting friends from England, along with a large-brimmed hat. Beth promises to come, despite her shyness, and the girls prepare for the day, Jo wearing her floppy hat against Meg's wishes. The Vaughns, Kate, Fred, Frank, and Grace, are friendly though distinctly British. Kate is standoffish, Fred is a prankster, Frank is lame, and Grace gets on with Amy quite well. Ned Moffat also comes, wanting to see Meg, as does Mr. Brooke, Laurie's tutor, and Sallie Gardiner. Laurie's servants and housemen set up a great tent with food and games, and the party boats up the river and plays croquet. Both teams play well, teasing each other about Yankees and 1776, and Jo wins, despite Fred Vaughn cheating. Jo sees him and works very hard to control her temper, for which Meg and Laurie commend her. They help prepare lunch, then sit and play games. They begin with Rig-marole, a storytelling game, with Mr. Brooke starting a story about a young knight hoping for the hand of a poor princess, then the next person in line taking the story in a different direction, and so on. The next game is Truth, whereby Laurie and Jo make Fred confess that he cheated at croquet and that he thinks the English nation is perfect. While the others play Authors, Kate, Meg, and Mr. Brooke speak. Kate looks down on Meg for being a governess, but Mr. Brooke defends the independence of working men and women in America, and helps Meg read a German poem. It appears that Mr. Brooke is quite fond of Meg, but she has no idea. Ned Moffat makes his intentions more clear, but Meg avoids flirting, having learned from the gossip at the Moffats' party"}

CAMP LAURENCE.\n\n\n                             \n\n\n                 [Illustration: Beth was post-mistress]\n\nBeth was post-mistress, for, being most at home, she could attend to it\nregularly, and dearly liked the daily task of unlocking the little door\nand distributing the mail. One July day she came in with her hands full,\nand went about the house leaving letters and parcels, like the penny\npost.\n\n\"Here's your posy, mother! Laurie never forgets that,\" she said, putting\nthe fresh nosegay in the vase that stood in \"Marmee's corner,\" and was\nkept supplied by the affectionate boy.\n\n\"Miss Meg March, one letter and a glove,\" continued Beth, delivering the\narticles to her sister, who sat near her mother, stitching wristbands.\n\n\"Why, I left a pair over there, and here is only one,\" said Meg, looking\nat the gray cotton glove.\n\n\"Didn't you drop the other in the garden?\"\n\n\"No, I'm sure I didn't; for there was only one in the office.\"\n\n\"I hate to have odd gloves! Never mind, the other may be found. My\nletter is only a translation of the German song I wanted; I think Mr.\nBrooke did it, for this isn't Laurie's writing.\"\n\nMrs. March glanced at Meg, who was looking very pretty in her gingham\nmorning-gown, with the little curls blowing about her forehead, and very\nwomanly, as she sat sewing at her little work-table, full of tidy white\nrolls; so unconscious of the thought in her mother's mind as she sewed\nand sung, while her fingers flew, and her thoughts were busied with\ngirlish fancies as innocent and fresh as the pansies in her belt, that\nMrs. March smiled, and was satisfied.\n\n\"Two letters for Doctor Jo, a book, and a funny old hat, which covered\nthe whole post-office, stuck outside,\" said Beth, laughing, as she went\ninto the study, where Jo sat writing.\n\n\"What a sly fellow Laurie is! I said I wished bigger hats were the\nfashion, because I burn my face every hot day. He said, 'Why mind the\nfashion? Wear a big hat, and be comfortable!' I said I would if I had\none, and he has sent me this, to try me. I'll wear it, for fun, and show\nhim I _don't_ care for the fashion;\" and, hanging the antique broad-brim\non a bust of Plato, Jo read her letters.\n\nOne from her mother made her cheeks glow and her eyes fill, for it said\nto her,--\n\n    \"MY DEAR:\n\n    \"I write a little word to tell you with how much satisfaction I\n    watch your efforts to control your temper. You say nothing about\n    your trials, failures, or successes, and think, perhaps, that no\n    one sees them but the Friend whose help you daily ask, if I may\n    trust the well-worn cover of your guide-book. _I_, too, have\n    seen them all, and heartily believe in the sincerity of your\n    resolution, since it begins to bear fruit. Go on, dear,\n    patiently and bravely, and always believe that no one\n    sympathizes more tenderly with you than your loving\n\n                                                           \"MOTHER.\"\n\n\"That does me good! that's worth millions of money and pecks of praise.\nO Marmee, I do try! I will keep on trying, and not get tired, since I\nhave you to help me.\"\n\nLaying her head on her arms, Jo wet her little romance with a few happy\ntears, for she _had_ thought that no one saw and appreciated her efforts\nto be good; and this assurance was doubly precious, doubly encouraging,\nbecause unexpected, and from the person whose commendation she most\nvalued. Feeling stronger than ever to meet and subdue her Apollyon, she\npinned the note inside her frock, as a shield and a reminder, lest she\nbe taken unaware, and proceeded to open her other letter, quite ready\nfor either good or bad news. In a big, dashing hand, Laurie wrote,--\n\n                \"DEAR JO,\n                 What ho!\n\n    Some English girls and boys are coming to see me to-morrow and\n    I want to have a jolly time. If it's fine, I'm going to pitch\n    my tent in Longmeadow, and row up the whole crew to lunch and\n    croquet,--have a fire, make messes, gypsy fashion, and all\n    sorts of larks. They are nice people, and like such things.\n    Brooke will go, to keep us boys steady, and Kate Vaughn will\n    play propriety for the girls. I want you all to come; can't let\n    Beth off, at any price, and nobody shall worry her. Don't\n    bother about rations,--I'll see to that, and everything\n    else,--only do come, there's a good fellow!\n\n                \"In a tearing hurry,\n                 Yours ever, LAURIE.\"\n\n\"Here's richness!\" cried Jo, flying in to tell the news to Meg.\n\n\"Of course we can go, mother? it will be such a help to Laurie, for I\ncan row, and Meg see to the lunch, and the children be useful in some\nway.\"\n\n\"I hope the Vaughns are not fine, grown-up people. Do you know anything\nabout them, Jo?\" asked Meg.\n\n\"Only that there are four of them. Kate is older than you, Fred and\nFrank (twins) about my age, and a little girl (Grace), who is nine or\nten. Laurie knew them abroad, and liked the boys; I fancied, from the\nway he primmed up his mouth in speaking of her, that he didn't admire\nKate much.\"\n\n\"I'm so glad my French print is clean; it's just the thing, and so\nbecoming!\" observed Meg complacently. \"Have you anything decent, Jo?\"\n\n\"Scarlet and gray boating suit, good enough for me. I shall row and\ntramp about, so I don't want any starch to think of. You'll come,\nBethy?\"\n\n\"If you won't let any of the boys talk to me.\"\n\n\"Not a boy!\"\n\n\"I like to please Laurie; and I'm not afraid of Mr. Brooke, he is so\nkind; but I don't want to play, or sing, or say anything. I'll work\nhard, and not trouble any one; and you'll take care of me, Jo, so I'll\ngo.\"\n\n\"That's my good girl; you do try to fight off your shyness, and I love\nyou for it. Fighting faults isn't easy, as I know; and a cheery word\nkind of gives a lift. Thank you, mother,\" and Jo gave the thin cheek a\ngrateful kiss, more precious to Mrs. March than if it had given back the\nrosy roundness of her youth.\n\n\"I had a box of chocolate drops, and the picture I wanted to copy,\" said\nAmy, showing her mail.\n\n\"And I got a note from Mr. Laurence, asking me to come over and play to\nhim to-night, before the lamps are lighted, and I shall go,\" added Beth,\nwhose friendship with the old gentleman prospered finely.\n\n\"Now let's fly round, and do double duty to-day, so that we can play\nto-morrow with free minds,\" said Jo, preparing to replace her pen with a\nbroom.\n\nWhen the sun peeped into the girls' room early next morning, to promise\nthem a fine day, he saw a comical sight. Each had made such preparation\nfor the fête as seemed necessary and proper. Meg had an extra row of\nlittle curl-papers across her forehead, Jo had copiously anointed her\nafflicted face with cold cream, Beth had taken Joanna to bed with her to\natone for the approaching separation, and Amy had capped the climax by\nputting a clothes-pin on her nose, to uplift the offending feature. It\nwas one of the kind artists use to hold the paper on their\ndrawing-boards, therefore quite appropriate and effective for the\npurpose to which it was now put. This funny spectacle appeared to amuse\nthe sun, for he burst out with such radiance that Jo woke up, and\nroused all her sisters by a hearty laugh at Amy's ornament.\n\n  [Illustration: Amy capped the climax by putting a clothes-pin on her\n                                 nose]\n\nSunshine and laughter were good omens for a pleasure party, and soon a\nlively bustle began in both houses. Beth, who was ready first, kept\nreporting what went on next door, and enlivened her sisters' toilets by\nfrequent telegrams from the window.\n\n\"There goes the man with the tent! I see Mrs. Barker doing up the lunch\nin a hamper and a great basket. Now Mr. Laurence is looking up at the\nsky, and the weathercock; I wish he would go, too. There's Laurie,\nlooking like a sailor,--nice boy! Oh, mercy me! here's a carriage full\nof people--a tall lady, a little girl, and two dreadful boys. One is\nlame; poor thing, he's got a crutch. Laurie didn't tell us that. Be\nquick, girls! it's getting late. Why, there is Ned Moffat, I do declare.\nLook, Meg, isn't that the man who bowed to you one day, when we were\nshopping?\"\n\n\"So it is. How queer that he should come. I thought he was at the\nMountains. There is Sallie; I'm glad she got back in time. Am I all\nright, Jo?\" cried Meg, in a flutter.\n\n\"A regular daisy. Hold up your dress and put your hat straight; it looks\nsentimental tipped that way, and will fly off at the first puff. Now,\nthen, come on!\"\n\n\"O Jo, you are not going to wear that awful hat? It's too absurd! You\nshall _not_ make a guy of yourself,\" remonstrated Meg, as Jo tied down,\nwith a red ribbon, the broad-brimmed, old-fashioned Leghorn Laurie had\nsent for a joke.\n\n\"I just will, though, for it's capital,--so shady, light, and big. It\nwill make fun; and I don't mind being a guy if I'm comfortable.\" With\nthat Jo marched straight away, and the rest followed,--a bright little\nband of sisters, all looking their best, in summer suits, with happy\nfaces under the jaunty hat-brims.\n\nLaurie ran to meet, and present them to his friends, in the most cordial\nmanner. The lawn was the reception-room, and for several minutes a\nlively scene was enacted there. Meg was grateful to see that Miss Kate,\nthough twenty, was dressed with a simplicity which American girls would\ndo well to imitate; and she was much flattered by Mr. Ned's assurances\nthat he came especially to see her. Jo understood why Laurie \"primmed up\nhis mouth\" when speaking of Kate, for that young lady had a\nstand-off-don't-touch-me air, which contrasted strongly with the free\nand easy demeanor of the other girls. Beth took an observation of the\nnew boys, and decided that the lame one was not \"dreadful,\" but gentle\nand feeble, and she would be kind to him on that account. Amy found\nGrace a well-mannered, merry little person; and after staring dumbly at\none another for a few minutes, they suddenly became very good friends.\n\nTents, lunch, and croquet utensils having been sent on beforehand, the\nparty was soon embarked, and the two boats pushed off together, leaving\nMr. Laurence waving his hat on the shore. Laurie and Jo rowed one boat;\nMr. Brooke and Ned the other; while Fred Vaughn, the riotous twin, did\nhis best to upset both by paddling about in a wherry like a disturbed\nwater-bug. Jo's funny hat deserved a vote of thanks, for it was of\ngeneral utility; it broke the ice in the beginning, by producing a\nlaugh; it created quite a refreshing breeze, flapping to and fro, as she\nrowed, and would make an excellent umbrella for the whole party, if a\nshower came up, she said. Kate looked rather amazed at Jo's proceedings,\nespecially as she exclaimed \"Christopher Columbus!\" when she lost her\noar; and Laurie said, \"My dear fellow, did I hurt you?\" when he tripped\nover her feet in taking his place. But after putting up her glass to\nexamine the queer girl several times, Miss Kate decided that she was\n\"odd, but rather clever,\" and smiled upon her from afar.\n\n              [Illustration: Mr. Laurence waving his hat]\n\nMeg, in the other boat, was delightfully situated, face to face with the\nrowers, who both admired the prospect, and feathered their oars with\nuncommon \"skill and dexterity.\" Mr. Brooke was a grave, silent young\nman, with handsome brown eyes and a pleasant voice. Meg liked his quiet\nmanners, and considered him a walking encyclopædia of useful knowledge.\nHe never talked to her much; but he looked at her a good deal, and she\nfelt sure that he did not regard her with aversion. Ned, being in\ncollege, of course put on all the airs which Freshmen think it their\nbounden duty to assume; he was not very wise, but very good-natured, and\naltogether an excellent person to carry on a picnic. Sallie Gardiner was\nabsorbed in keeping her white piqué dress clean, and chattering with the\nubiquitous Fred, who kept Beth in constant terror by his pranks.\n\nIt was not far to Longmeadow; but the tent was pitched and the wickets\ndown by the time they arrived. A pleasant green field, with three\nwide-spreading oaks in the middle, and a smooth strip of turf for\ncroquet.\n\n\"Welcome to Camp Laurence!\" said the young host, as they landed, with\nexclamations of delight.\n\n\"Brooke is commander-in-chief; I am commissary-general; the other\nfellows are staff-officers; and you, ladies, are company. The tent is\nfor your especial benefit, and that oak is your drawing-room; this is\nthe mess-room, and the third is the camp-kitchen. Now, let's have a game\nbefore it gets hot, and then we'll see about dinner.\"\n\nFrank, Beth, Amy, and Grace sat down to watch the game played by the\nother eight. Mr. Brooke chose Meg, Kate, and Fred; Laurie took Sallie,\nJo, and Ned. The Englishers played well; but the Americans played\nbetter, and contested every inch of the ground as strongly as if the\nspirit of '76 inspired them. Jo and Fred had several skirmishes, and\nonce narrowly escaped high words. Jo was through the last wicket, and\nhad missed the stroke, which failure ruffled her a good deal. Fred was\nclose behind her, and his turn came before hers; he gave a stroke, his\nball hit the wicket, and stopped an inch on the wrong side. No one was\nvery near; and running up to examine, he gave it a sly nudge with his\ntoe, which put it just an inch on the right side.\n\n\"I'm through! Now, Miss Jo, I'll settle you, and get in first,\" cried\nthe young gentleman, swinging his mallet for another blow.\n\n             [Illustration: Now, Miss Jo, I'll settle you]\n\n\"You pushed it; I saw you; it's my turn now,\" said Jo sharply.\n\n\"Upon my word, I didn't move it; it rolled a bit, perhaps, but that is\nallowed; so stand off, please, and let me have a go at the stake.\"\n\n\"We don't cheat in America, but you can, if you choose,\" said Jo\nangrily.\n\n\"Yankees are a deal the most tricky, everybody knows. There you go!\"\nreturned Fred, croqueting her ball far away.\n\nJo opened her lips to say something rude, but checked herself in time,\ncolored up to her forehead, and stood a minute, hammering down a wicket\nwith all her might, while Fred hit the stake, and declared himself out\nwith much exultation. She went off to get her ball, and was a long time\nfinding it, among the bushes; but she came back, looking cool and quiet,\nand waited her turn patiently. It took several strokes to regain the\nplace she had lost; and, when she got there, the other side had nearly\nwon, for Kate's ball was the last but one, and lay near the stake.\n\n\"By George, it's all up with us! Good-by, Kate. Miss Jo owes me one, so\nyou are finished,\" cried Fred excitedly, as they all drew near to see\nthe finish.\n\n\"Yankees have a trick of being generous to their enemies,\" said Jo, with\na look that made the lad redden, \"especially when they beat them,\" she\nadded, as, leaving Kate's ball untouched, she won the game by a clever\nstroke.\n\nLaurie threw up his hat; then remembered that it wouldn't do to exult\nover the defeat of his guests, and stopped in the middle of a cheer to\nwhisper to his friend,--\n\n\"Good for you, Jo! He did cheat, I saw him; we can't tell him so, but he\nwon't do it again, take my word for it.\"\n\nMeg drew her aside, under pretence of pinning up a loose braid, and said\napprovingly,--\n\n\"It was dreadfully provoking; but you kept your temper, and I'm so glad,\nJo.\"\n\n\"Don't praise me, Meg, for I could box his ears this minute. I should\ncertainly have boiled over if I hadn't stayed among the nettles till I\ngot my rage under enough to hold my tongue. It's simmering now, so I\nhope he'll keep out of my way,\" returned Jo, biting her lips, as she\nglowered at Fred from under her big hat.\n\n\"Time for lunch,\" said Mr. Brooke, looking at his watch.\n\"Commissary-general, will you make the fire and get water, while Miss\nMarch, Miss Sallie, and I spread the table? Who can make good coffee?\"\n\n\"Jo can,\" said Meg, glad to recommend her sister. So Jo, feeling that\nher late lessons in cookery were to do her honor, went to preside over\nthe coffee-pot, while the children collected dry sticks, and the boys\nmade a fire, and got water from a spring near by. Miss Kate sketched,\nand Frank talked to Beth, who was making little mats of braided rushes\nto serve as plates.\n\nThe commander-in-chief and his aids soon spread the table-cloth with an\ninviting array of eatables and drinkables, prettily decorated with green\nleaves. Jo announced that the coffee was ready, and every one settled\nthemselves to a hearty meal; for youth is seldom dyspeptic, and exercise\ndevelops wholesome appetites. A very merry lunch it was; for everything\nseemed fresh and funny, and frequent peals of laughter startled a\nvenerable horse who fed near by. There was a pleasing inequality in the\ntable, which produced many mishaps to cups and plates; acorns dropped\ninto the milk, little black ants partook of the refreshments without\nbeing invited, and fuzzy caterpillars swung down from the tree, to see\nwhat was going on. Three white-headed children peeped over the fence,\nand an objectionable dog barked at them from the other side of the river\nwith all his might and main.\n\n        [Illustration: \"A very merry lunch it was.\"--Page 156.]\n\n\"There's salt here, if you prefer it,\" said Laurie, as he handed Jo a\nsaucer of berries.\n\n\"Thank you, I prefer spiders,\" she replied, fishing up two unwary little\nones who had gone to a creamy death. \"How dare you remind me of that\nhorrid dinner-party, when yours is so nice in every way?\" added Jo,\nas they both laughed, and ate out of one plate, the china having run\nshort.\n\n\"I had an uncommonly good time that day, and haven't got over it yet.\nThis is no credit to me, you know; I don't do anything; it's you and Meg\nand Brooke who make it go, and I'm no end obliged to you. What shall we\ndo when we can't eat any more?\" asked Laurie, feeling that his trump\ncard had been played when lunch was over.\n\n\"Have games, till it's cooler. I brought 'Authors,' and I dare say Miss\nKate knows something new and nice. Go and ask her; she's company, and\nyou ought to stay with her more.\"\n\n\"Aren't you company too? I thought she'd suit Brooke; but he keeps\ntalking to Meg, and Kate just stares at them through that ridiculous\nglass of hers. I'm going, so you needn't try to preach propriety, for\nyou can't do it, Jo.\"\n\nMiss Kate did know several new games; and as the girls would not, and\nthe boys could not, eat any more, they all adjourned to the drawing-room\nto play \"Rigmarole.\"\n\n\"One person begins a story, any nonsense you like, and tells as long as\nhe pleases, only taking care to stop short at some exciting point, when\nthe next takes it up and does the same. It's very funny when well done,\nand makes a perfect jumble of tragical comical stuff to laugh over.\nPlease start it, Mr. Brooke,\" said Kate, with a commanding air, which\nsurprised Meg, who treated the tutor with as much respect as any other\ngentleman.\n\nLying on the grass at the feet of the two young ladies, Mr. Brooke\nobediently began the story, with the handsome brown eyes steadily fixed\nupon the sunshiny river.\n\n\"Once on a time, a knight went out into the world to seek his fortune,\nfor he had nothing but his sword and his shield. He travelled a long\nwhile, nearly eight-and-twenty years, and had a hard time of it, till he\ncame to the palace of a good old king, who had offered a reward to any\none who would tame and train a fine but unbroken colt, of which he was\nvery fond. The knight agreed to try, and got on slowly but surely; for\nthe colt was a gallant fellow, and soon learned to love his new master,\nthough he was freakish and wild. Every day, when he gave his lessons to\nthis pet of the king's, the knight rode him through the city; and, as\nhe rode, he looked everywhere for a certain beautiful face, which he had\nseen many times in his dreams, but never found. One day, as he went\nprancing down a quiet street, he saw at the window of a ruinous castle\nthe lovely face. He was delighted, inquired who lived in this old\ncastle, and was told that several captive princesses were kept there by\na spell, and spun all day to lay up money to buy their liberty. The\nknight wished intensely that he could free them; but he was poor, and\ncould only go by each day, watching for the sweet face, and longing to\nsee it out in the sunshine. At last, he resolved to get into the castle\nand ask how he could help them. He went and knocked; the great door flew\nopen, and he beheld--\"\n\n          [Illustration: He went prancing down a quiet street]\n\n\"A ravishingly lovely lady, who exclaimed, with a cry of rapture, 'At\nlast! at last!'\" continued Kate, who had read French novels, and admired\nthe style. \"''Tis she!' cried Count Gustave, and fell at her feet in an\necstasy of joy. 'Oh, rise!' she said, extending a hand of marble\nfairness. 'Never! till you tell me how I may rescue you,' swore the\nknight, still kneeling. 'Alas, my cruel fate condemns me to remain here\ntill my tyrant is destroyed.' 'Where is the villain?' 'In the mauve\nsalon. Go, brave heart, and save me from despair.' 'I obey, and return\nvictorious or dead!' With these thrilling words he rushed away, and\nflinging open the door of the mauve salon, was about to enter, when he\nreceived--\"\n\n                  [Illustration: \"Oh, rise,\" she said]\n\n\"A stunning blow from the big Greek lexicon, which an old fellow in a\nblack gown fired at him,\" said Ned. \"Instantly Sir What's-his-name\nrecovered himself, pitched the tyrant out of the window, and turned to\njoin the lady, victorious, but with a bump on his brow; found the door\nlocked, tore up the curtains, made a rope ladder, got half-way down when\nthe ladder broke, and he went head first into the moat, sixty feet\nbelow. Could swim like a duck, paddled round the castle till he came to\na little door guarded by two stout fellows; knocked their heads together\ntill they cracked like a couple of nuts, then, by a trifling exertion of\nhis prodigious strength, he smashed in the door, went up a pair of stone\nsteps covered with dust a foot thick, toads as big as your fist, and\nspiders that would frighten you into hysterics, Miss March. At the top\nof these steps he came plump upon a sight that took his breath away and\nchilled his blood--\"\n\n       [Illustration: A stunning blow from the big Greek lexicon]\n\n\"A tall figure, all in white with a veil over its face and a lamp in its\nwasted hand,\" went on Meg. \"It beckoned, gliding noiselessly before him\ndown a corridor as dark and cold as any tomb. Shadowy effigies in armor\nstood on either side, a dead silence reigned, the lamp burned blue, and\nthe ghostly figure ever and anon turned its face toward him, showing the\nglitter of awful eyes through its white veil. They reached a curtained\ndoor, behind which sounded lovely music; he sprang forward to enter, but\nthe spectre plucked him back, and waved threateningly before him a--\"\n\n\"Snuff-box,\" said Jo, in a sepulchral tone, which convulsed the\naudience. \"'Thankee,' said the knight politely, as he took a pinch, and\nsneezed seven times so violently that his head fell off. 'Ha! ha!'\nlaughed the ghost; and having peeped through the key-hole at the\nprincesses spinning away for dear life, the evil spirit picked up her\nvictim and put him in a large tin box, where there were eleven other\nknights packed together without their heads, like sardines, who all rose\nand began to--\"\n\n                       [Illustration: He sneezed]\n\n\"Dance a hornpipe,\" cut in Fred, as Jo paused for breath; \"and, as they\ndanced, the rubbishy old castle turned to a man-of-war in full sail. 'Up\nwith the jib, reef the tops'l halliards, helm hard a lee, and man the\nguns!' roared the captain, as a Portuguese pirate hove in sight, with a\nflag black as ink flying from her foremast. 'Go in and win, my\nhearties!' says the captain; and a tremendous fight begun. Of course the\nBritish beat; they always do.\"\n\n\"No, they don't!\" cried Jo, aside.\n\n\"Having taken the pirate captain prisoner, sailed slap over the\nschooner, whose decks were piled with dead, and whose lee-scuppers ran\nblood, for the order had been 'Cutlasses, and die hard!' 'Bosen's mate,\ntake a bight of the flying-jib sheet, and start this villain if he don't\nconfess his sins double quick,' said the British captain. The Portuguese\nheld his tongue like a brick, and walked the plank, while the jolly tars\ncheered like mad. But the sly dog dived, came up under the man-of-war,\nscuttled her, and down she went, with all sail set, 'To the bottom of\nthe sea, sea, sea,' where--\"\n\n            [Illustration: The Portuguese walked the plank]\n\n\"Oh, gracious! what _shall_ I say?\" cried Sallie, as Fred ended his\nrigmarole, in which he had jumbled together, pell-mell, nautical phrases\nand facts, out of one of his favorite books. \"Well they went to the\nbottom, and a nice mermaid welcomed them, but was much grieved on\nfinding the box of headless knights, and kindly pickled them in brine,\nhoping to discover the mystery about them; for, being a woman, she was\ncurious. By and by a diver came down, and the mermaid said, 'I'll give\nyou this box of pearls if you can take it up;' for she wanted to restore\nthe poor things to life, and couldn't raise the heavy load herself. So\nthe diver hoisted it up, and was much disappointed, on opening it, to\nfind no pearls. He left it in a great lonely field, where it was found\nby a--\"\n\n\"Little goose-girl, who kept a hundred fat geese in the field,\" said\nAmy, when Sallie's invention gave out. \"The little girl was sorry for\nthem, and asked an old woman what she should do to help them. 'Your\ngeese will tell you, they know everything,' said the old woman. So she\nasked what she should use for new heads, since the old ones were lost,\nand all the geese opened their hundred mouths and screamed--\"\n\n\"'Cabbages!'\" continued Laurie promptly. \"'Just the thing,' said the\ngirl, and ran to get twelve fine ones from her garden. She put them on,\nthe knights revived at once, thanked her, and went on their way\nrejoicing, never knowing the difference, for there were so many other\nheads like them in the world that no one thought anything of it. The\nknight in whom I'm interested went back to find the pretty face, and\nlearned that the princesses had spun themselves free, and all gone to be\nmarried, but one. He was in a great state of mind at that; and mounting\nthe colt, who stood by him through thick and thin, rushed to the castle\nto see which was left. Peeping over the hedge, he saw the queen of his\naffections picking flowers in her garden. 'Will you give me a rose?'\nsaid he. 'You must come and get it. I can't come to you; it isn't\nproper,' said she, as sweet as honey. He tried to climb over the hedge,\nbut it seemed to grow higher and higher; then he tried to push through,\nbut it grew thicker and thicker, and he was in despair. So he patiently\nbroke twig after twig, till he had made a little hole, through which he\npeeped, saying imploringly, 'Let me in! let me in!' But the pretty\nprincess did not seem to understand, for she picked her roses quietly,\nand left him to fight his way in. Whether he did or not, Frank will tell\nyou.\"\n\n                [Illustration: Will you give me a rose?]\n\n\"I can't; I'm not playing, I never do,\" said Frank, dismayed at the\nsentimental predicament out of which he was to rescue the absurd couple.\nBeth had disappeared behind Jo, and Grace was asleep.\n\n\"So the poor knight is to be left sticking in the hedge, is he?\" asked\nMr. Brooke, still watching the river, and playing with the wild rose in\nhis button-hole.\n\n\"I guess the princess gave him a posy, and opened the gate, after a\nwhile,\" said Laurie, smiling to himself, as he threw acorns at his\ntutor.\n\n\"What a piece of nonsense we have made! With practice we might do\nsomething quite clever. Do you know 'Truth'?\" asked Sallie, after they\nhad laughed over their story.\n\n\"I hope so,\" said Meg soberly.\n\n\"The game, I mean?\"\n\n\"What is it?\" said Fred.\n\n\"Why, you pile up your hands, choose a number, and draw out in turn, and\nthe person who draws at the number has to answer truly any questions put\nby the rest. It's great fun.\"\n\n\"Let's try it,\" said Jo, who liked new experiments.\n\nMiss Kate and Mr. Brooke, Meg, and Ned declined, but Fred, Sallie, Jo,\nand Laurie piled and drew; and the lot fell to Laurie.\n\n\"Who are your heroes?\" asked Jo.\n\n\n\n### Summary:\n\n", "answer": "On a day in July, Beth is delivering the \"mail\" from the little \"Post Office\" in the hedge between the March and Laurence houses. This batch of mail includes a small bunch of flowers for Mrs. March from Laurie, a translation of a German song by Mr. Brooke for Meg , and two letters, a hat, and a book for Jo. Jo unfolds and reads the first letter. It is from her mother and commends her for her efforts to keep her temper and learn to be a calmer person. The letter makes her tear up happily, because she thought that nobody had noticed. Jo unfolds and reads the second letter. It is from Laurie, telling her that some English boys and girls about their age, the Vaughns, are going to be visiting him. Laurie invites Jo and her sisters to come to a picnic with them tomorrow. The girls ask their mother if they can attend the picnic and she agrees. They talk about what it will be like. Jo tells Meg that there are four Vaughns, Kate, Fred, Frank, and Grace. Kate is a little older than Meg, Fred and Frank are twins of Jo's age, and Grace is a little girl around Amy's age. Jo and Meg talk about what they will wear to the picnic. Jo convinces Beth to come to the picnic despite her extreme shyness. Amy comes in and shows the mail that she received - a box of chocolates and a picture. Beth has received a letter from Mr. Laurence asking her to come over and play the piano for him. The girls spend the rest of the day doing extra chores so that they will be free to attend the picnic tomorrow. Overnight, each of the girls makes extra preparations for the picnic. Meg has the hair around her face in curling papers, Jo has slept wearing face cream , Beth slept with her favorite doll to apologize for leaving it behind all day, and Amy slept with a clothespin on her nose because she wants to reshape it. In the morning, the girls dress for the picnic and watch the preparations next door. The notice several other people they know, including Sallie Gardiner and Ned Moffat, arriving also. They also notice that one of the Vaughn boys is on crutches. The March girls are ready to go. Meg is distressed to learn that Jo is planning to wear the silly hat Laurie sent her. Laurie introduces the March girls to the Vaughns on the lawn in front of their houses. Everyone notices that Kate Vaughn is kind of stuck-up. Beth feels compassion for Frank, the sickly twin. Amy and Grace, the two little girls, hit it off well. The party sets off for the picnic site in several boats. Jo and Laurie row one boat, while Mr. Brooke and Ned row the other. Fred Vaughn paddles around in a little boat of his own making mischief. Soon they arrive at Longmeadow, where a tent has been pitched and a croquet ground prepared. They start by playing a game of croquet. Frank, Beth, Amy, and Grace, who are too unwell, too shy, or too young to play, sit and watch. The others divide into two teams: Mr. Brooke, Meg, Kate, and Fred on one team, and Laurie, Sallie, Jo, and Ned on the other. The English play well, but the Americans play better. At one point, Jo is ahead of Fred, who is close behind her. He goes over to look at his croquet ball and cheats by pushing it through the wicket. Jo accuses Fred of cheating and he denies it. There's a lot of banter about Brits versus Yankees. Jo starts to get really angry, but takes some time by herself looking for her croquet ball to cool down. Jo manages to get ahead in the game again and, in the end, she wins for her team. Laurie and Meg both privately congratulate Jo on keeping her temper. Jo says that she is still pretty angry. Next, everyone lends a hand making preparations for lunch. The meal is jolly and fun, even though there are insects in the food and the table keeps wobbling and spilling things. Jo and Laurie sit together and share a plate. Laurie asks Jo what they should do next. Jo says they should play a quiet game until the afternoon sun cools off a little. She tells Laurie to ask Kate to suggest the game, out of politeness to the guests. Kate suggests a game that she calls \"Rig-marole.\" One person starts telling a story and then breaks off at an exciting point. The next person continues the story and does the same thing. Kate orders Mr. Brooke to start. Mr. Brooke begins the story and describes a lonely knight on a quest who falls in love with a captive princess. Kate continues the story and makes it dramatic and sensational. Ned takes a turn telling the story, and his narration is action-packed and exciting. Next Meg tells part of the story, giving it a creepy, Gothic feel. Jo starts to take up the story and make it comical, but when she pauses to take a breath, Fred jumps in and turns it into a story about pirates. Sallie is next and doesn't know what to say. She adds some mermaids and a fairy-tale feel. Amy tells a little of the story, introducing a little goosegirl and making it more like a fable. Laurie jumps in and tries to tie up most of the loose ends in the story - he brings several murdered knights back to life and reunites the first knight with the princess. Then he turns to Frank to finish. Frank says that he's not playing. Beth is hiding behind Jo because she is too shy to take a turn, and Grace is asleep, so that's as far as the story goes. Next, they decide to play Truth. They draw lots, and whoever is chosen has to answer three questions put by the group truthfully. Laurie is first. In answer to his friends' questions, he says that his grandfather and Napoleon are his heroes, Meg is the prettiest girl there, and Jo is his favorite. Jo is next. She admits that a quick temper is her worst fault, that her greatest desire is to be a genius, and that the virtues she most admires in a man are courage and honesty. Fred is next. Jo and Laurie gang up on him; Jo makes him admit that he cheated at croquet, and Laurie makes him admit that he took his part of the story out of The Sea-Lion. He also says, in response to Sallie's question, that he thinks England is perfect. Sallie is next. She claims in a flirtatious way that she's not a flirt, says that she hates spiders and rice pudding, and that she loves dancing and French gloves. Next the group play Authors, which is a card game kind of like Go Fish, in which the cards have pictures of famous authors and you try to collect sets of them. While the others play, Meg watches Kate sketch and Mr. Brooke lies near them, sort of reading a book. Kate and Meg, who are the two oldest girls there, chat about their circumstances. Kate is patronizing and snobby when she discovers that Meg works as a governess. Mr. Brooke intervenes and defends the hard-working character of the American woman. Mr. Brooke tutors Meg in German. Even though Kate is a much more correct reader of German, Meg has more of a feel for the musical quality of the language and for the poetic form. Kate leaves Mr. Brooke and Meg alone, deciding that she doesn't need to chaperone a mere governess. Meg and Mr. Brooke talk about their respective jobs as teachers. Mr. Brooke says that there's no place like America for workers. Meg asks Mr. Brooke what he will do after Laurie goes to college next year. Mr. Brooke says that he will enlist as a solider. Meg says that she's glad Mr. Brooke is going to serve his country. Mr. Brooke says that he's alone in the world and nobody cares whether he lives or dies anyway. Meg says that the Laurences and Marches all care. Meanwhile, Amy and Grace are talking about riding. Grace, as an upper-class English girl, goes riding a lot and has her own pony. Amy rides \"Ellen Tree,\" which is a low-hanging branch on the family's apple tree. Sometimes Jo puts a saddle on the tree branch and Amy pretends to ride it. Close by, Beth and Frank are talking. They don't have much in common, but Beth lets Frank talk about the differences in hunting between England and America, and they end up discussing buffaloes. They play some more games, and at sunset they take down the tent and row their boats back home. On the way back, Ned tries to flirt with Meg, who is too sweet and proper to flirt back. As the March girls return home, Kate says that American girls are quite nice when you get to know them, and Mr. Brooke agrees."}

In return for the news which Lestrade would\nbring, Holmes was always ready to listen with attention to the\ndetails of any case upon which the detective was engaged, and was able\noccasionally, without any active interference, to give some hint or\nsuggestion drawn from his own vast knowledge and experience.\n\nOn this particular evening Lestrade had spoken of the weather and the\nnewspapers. Then he had fallen silent, puffing thoughtfully at his\ncigar. Holmes looked keenly at him.\n\n\"Anything remarkable on hand?\" he asked.\n\n\"Oh, no, Mr. Holmes, nothing very particular.\"\n\n\"Then tell me about it.\"\n\nLestrade laughed.\n\n\"Well, Mr. Holmes, there is no use denying that there IS something on my\nmind. And yet it is such an absurd business that I hesitated to\nbother you about it. On the other hand, although it is trivial, it is\nundoubtedly queer, and I know that you have a taste for all that is out\nof the common. But in my opinion it comes more in Dr. Watson's line than\nours.\"\n\n\"Disease?\" said I.\n\n\"Madness, anyhow. And a queer madness too! You wouldn't think there was\nanyone living at this time of day who had such a hatred of Napoleon the\nFirst that he would break any image of him that he could see.\"\n\nHolmes sank back in his chair.\n\n\"That's no business of mine,\" said he.\n\n\"Exactly. That's what I said. But then, when the man commits burglary\nin order to break images which are not his own, that brings it away from\nthe doctor and on to the policeman.\"\n\nHolmes sat up again.\n\n\"Burglary! This is more interesting. Let me hear the details.\"\n\nLestrade took out his official note-book and refreshed his memory from\nits pages.\n\n\"The first case reported was four days ago,\" said he. \"It was at the\nshop of Morse Hudson, who has a place for the sale of pictures and\nstatues in the Kennington Road. The assistant had left the front shop\nfor an instant when he heard a crash, and hurrying in he found a plaster\nbust of Napoleon, which stood with several other works of art upon the\ncounter, lying shivered into fragments. He rushed out into the road,\nbut, although several passers-by declared that they had noticed a man\nrun out of the shop, he could neither see anyone nor could he find any\nmeans of identifying the rascal. It seemed to be one of those senseless\nacts of Hooliganism which occur from time to time, and it was reported\nto the constable on the beat as such. The plaster cast was not worth\nmore than a few shillings, and the whole affair appeared to be too\nchildish for any particular investigation.\n\n\"The second case, however, was more serious and also more singular. It\noccurred only last night.\n\n\"In Kennington Road, and within a few hundred yards of Morse Hudson's\nshop, there lives a well-known medical practitioner, named Dr. Barnicot,\nwho has one of the largest practices upon the south side of the Thames.\nHis residence and principal consulting-room is at Kennington Road, but\nhe has a branch surgery and dispensary at Lower Brixton Road, two miles\naway. This Dr. Barnicot is an enthusiastic admirer of Napoleon, and his\nhouse is full of books, pictures, and relics of the French Emperor. Some\nlittle time ago he purchased from Morse Hudson two duplicate plaster\ncasts of the famous head of Napoleon by the French sculptor, Devine. One\nof these he placed in his hall in the house at Kennington Road, and the\nother on the mantelpiece of the surgery at Lower Brixton. Well, when Dr.\nBarnicot came down this morning he was astonished to find that his house\nhad been burgled during the night, but that nothing had been taken save\nthe plaster head from the hall. It had been carried out and had been\ndashed savagely against the garden wall, under which its splintered\nfragments were discovered.\"\n\nHolmes rubbed his hands.\n\n\"This is certainly very novel,\" said he.\n\n\"I thought it would please you. But I have not got to the end yet. Dr.\nBarnicot was due at his surgery at twelve o'clock, and you can imagine\nhis amazement when, on arriving there, he found that the window had been\nopened in the night, and that the broken pieces of his second bust were\nstrewn all over the room. It had been smashed to atoms where it stood.\nIn neither case were there any signs which could give us a clue as to\nthe criminal or lunatic who had done the mischief. Now, Mr. Holmes, you\nhave got the facts.\"\n\n\"They are singular, not to say grotesque,\" said Holmes. \"May I ask\nwhether the two busts smashed in Dr. Barnicot's rooms were the exact\nduplicates of the one which was destroyed in Morse Hudson's shop?\"\n\n\"They were taken from the same mould.\"\n\n\"Such a fact must tell against the theory that the man who breaks them\nis influenced by any general hatred of Napoleon. Considering how many\nhundreds of statues of the great Emperor must exist in London, it is\ntoo much to suppose such a coincidence as that a promiscuous iconoclast\nshould chance to begin upon three specimens of the same bust.\"\n\n\"Well, I thought as you do,\" said Lestrade. \"On the other hand, this\nMorse Hudson is the purveyor of busts in that part of London, and these\nthree were the only ones which had been in his shop for years. So,\nalthough, as you say, there are many hundreds of statues in London, it\nis very probable that these three were the only ones in that district.\nTherefore, a local fanatic would begin with them. What do you think, Dr.\nWatson?\"\n\n\"There are no limits to the possibilities of monomania,\" I answered.\n\"There is the condition which the modern French psychologists have\ncalled the 'idee fixe,' which may be trifling in character, and\naccompanied by complete sanity in every other way. A man who had read\ndeeply about Napoleon, or who had possibly received some hereditary\nfamily injury through the great war, might conceivably form such\nan 'idee fixe' and under its influence be capable of any fantastic\noutrage.\"\n\n\"That won't do, my dear Watson,\" said Holmes, shaking his head; \"for no\namount of 'idee fixe' would enable your interesting monomaniac to find\nout where these busts were situated.\"\n\n\"Well, how do YOU explain it?\"\n\n\"I don't attempt to do so. I would only observe that there is a certain\nmethod in the gentleman's eccentric proceedings. For example, in Dr.\nBarnicot's hall, where a sound might arouse the family, the bust was\ntaken outside before being broken, whereas in the surgery, where there\nwas less danger of an alarm, it was smashed where it stood. The affair\nseems absurdly trifling, and yet I dare call nothing trivial when I\nreflect that some of my most classic cases have had the least promising\ncommencement. You will remember, Watson, how the dreadful business of\nthe Abernetty family was first brought to my notice by the depth which\nthe parsley had sunk into the butter upon a hot day. I can't afford,\ntherefore, to smile at your three broken busts, Lestrade, and I shall\nbe very much obliged to you if you will let me hear of any fresh\ndevelopments of so singular a chain of events.\"\n\n\nThe development for which my friend had asked came in a quicker and an\ninfinitely more tragic form than he could have imagined. I was still\ndressing in my bedroom next morning when there was a tap at the door and\nHolmes entered, a telegram in his hand. He read it aloud:--\n\n\"Come instantly, 131, Pitt Street, Kensington.--Lestrade.\"\n\n\"What is it, then?\" I asked.\n\n\"Don't know--may be anything. But I suspect it is the sequel of the\nstory of the statues. In that case our friend, the image-breaker, has\nbegun operations in another quarter of London. There's coffee on the\ntable, Watson, and I have a cab at the door.\"\n\nIn half an hour we had reached Pitt Street, a quiet little backwater\njust beside one of the briskest currents of London life. No. 131 was one\nof a row, all flat-chested, respectable, and most unromantic dwellings.\nAs we drove up we found the railings in front of the house lined by a\ncurious crowd. Holmes whistled.\n\n\"By George! it's attempted murder at the least. Nothing less will hold\nthe London message-boy. There's a deed of violence indicated in that\nfellow's round shoulders and outstretched neck. What's this, Watson? The\ntop steps swilled down and the other ones dry. Footsteps enough, anyhow!\nWell, well, there's Lestrade at the front window, and we shall soon know\nall about it.\"\n\nThe official received us with a very grave face and showed us into a\nsitting-room, where an exceedingly unkempt and agitated elderly\nman, clad in a flannel dressing-gown, was pacing up and down. He was\nintroduced to us as the owner of the house--Mr. Horace Harker, of the\nCentral Press Syndicate.\n\n\"It's the Napoleon bust business again,\" said Lestrade. \"You seemed\ninterested last night, Mr. Holmes, so I thought perhaps you would be\nglad to be present now that the affair has taken a very much graver\nturn.\"\n\n\"What has it turned to, then?\"\n\n\"To murder. Mr. Harker, will you tell these gentlemen exactly what has\noccurred?\"\n\nThe man in the dressing-gown turned upon us with a most melancholy face.\n\n\"It's an extraordinary thing,\" said he, \"that all my life I have been\ncollecting other people's news, and now that a real piece of news has\ncome my own way I am so confused and bothered that I can't put two\nwords together. If I had come in here as a journalist I should have\ninterviewed myself and had two columns in every evening paper. As it is\nI am giving away valuable copy by telling my story over and over to a\nstring of different people, and I can make no use of it myself. However,\nI've heard your name, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, and if you'll only explain\nthis queer business I shall be paid for my trouble in telling you the\nstory.\"\n\nHolmes sat down and listened.\n\n\"It all seems to centre round that bust of Napoleon which I bought for\nthis very room about four months ago. I picked it up cheap from Harding\nBrothers, two doors from the High Street Station. A great deal of my\njournalistic work is done at night, and I often write until the early\nmorning. So it was to-day. I was sitting in my den, which is at the back\nof the top of the house, about three o'clock, when I was convinced that\nI heard some sounds downstairs. I listened, but they were not repeated,\nand I concluded that they came from outside. Then suddenly, about five\nminutes later, there came a most horrible yell--the most dreadful sound,\nMr. Holmes, that ever I heard. It will ring in my ears as long as I\nlive. I sat frozen with horror for a minute or two. Then I seized the\npoker and went downstairs. When I entered this room I found the window\nwide open, and I at once observed that the bust was gone from the\nmantelpiece. Why any burglar should take such a thing passes my\nunderstanding, for it was only a plaster cast and of no real value\nwhatever.\n\n\"You can see for yourself that anyone going out through that open window\ncould reach the front doorstep by taking a long stride. This was clearly\nwhat the burglar had done, so I went round and opened the door. Stepping\nout into the dark I nearly fell over a dead man who was lying there. I\nran back for a light, and there was the poor fellow, a great gash in his\nthroat and the whole place swimming in blood. He lay on his back, his\nknees drawn up, and his mouth horribly open. I shall see him in my\ndreams. I had just time to blow on my police-whistle, and then I must\nhave fainted, for I knew nothing more until I found the policeman\nstanding over me in the hall.\"\n\n\"Well, who was the murdered man?\" asked Holmes.\n\n\"There's nothing to show who he was,\" said Lestrade. \"You shall see the\nbody at the mortuary, but we have made nothing of it up to now. He is a\ntall man, sunburned, very powerful, not more than thirty. He is poorly\ndressed, and yet does not appear to be a labourer. A horn-handled clasp\nknife was lying in a pool of blood beside him. Whether it was the weapon\nwhich did the deed, or whether it belonged to the dead man, I do not\nknow. There was no name on his clothing, and nothing in his pockets save\nan apple, some string, a shilling map of London, and a photograph. Here\nit is.\"\n\nIt was evidently taken by a snap-shot from a small camera. It\nrepresented an alert, sharp-featured simian man with thick eyebrows, and\na very peculiar projection of the lower part of the face like the muzzle\nof a baboon.\n\n\"And what became of the bust?\" asked Holmes, after a careful study of\nthis picture.\n\n\"We had news of it just before you came. It has been found in the front\ngarden of an empty house in Campden House Road. It was broken into\nfragments. I am going round now to see it. Will you come?\"\n\n\"Certainly. I must just take one look round.\" He examined the carpet and\nthe window. \"The fellow had either very long legs or was a most active\nman,\" said he. \"With an area beneath, it was no mean feat to reach\nthat window-ledge and open that window. Getting back was comparatively\nsimple. Are you coming with us to see the remains of your bust, Mr.\nHarker?\"\n\nThe disconsolate journalist had seated himself at a writing-table.\n\n\"I must try and make something of it,\" said he, \"though I have no doubt\nthat the first editions of the evening papers are out already with\nfull details. It's like my luck! You remember when the stand fell at\nDoncaster? Well, I was the only journalist in the stand, and my journal\nthe only one that had no account of it, for I was too shaken to write\nit. And now I'll be too late with a murder done on my own doorstep.\"\n\nAs we left the room we heard his pen travelling shrilly over the\nfoolscap.\n\nThe spot where the fragments of the bust had been found was only a\nfew hundred yards away. For the first time our eyes rested upon this\npresentment of the great Emperor, which seemed to raise such frantic\nand destructive hatred in the mind of the unknown. It lay scattered in\nsplintered shards upon the grass. Holmes picked up several of them and\nexamined them carefully. I was convinced from his intent face and his\npurposeful manner that at last he was upon a clue.\n\n\"Well?\" asked Lestrade.\n\nHolmes shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"We have a long way to go yet,\" said he. \"And yet--and yet--well, we\nhave some suggestive facts to act upon. The possession of this trifling\nbust was worth more in the eyes of this strange criminal than a human\nlife. That is one point. Then there is the singular fact that he did not\nbreak it in the house, or immediately outside the house, if to break it\nwas his sole object.\"\n\n\"He was rattled and bustled by meeting this other fellow. He hardly knew\nwhat he was doing.\"\n\n\"Well, that's likely enough. But I wish to call your attention very\nparticularly to the position of this house in the garden of which the\nbust was destroyed.\"\n\nLestrade looked about him.\n\n\"It was an empty house, and so he knew that he would not be disturbed in\nthe garden.\"\n\n\"Yes, but there is another empty house farther up the street which he\nmust have passed before he came to this one. Why did he not break it\nthere, since it is evident that every yard that he carried it increased\nthe risk of someone meeting him?\"\n\n\"I give it up,\" said Lestrade.\n\nHolmes pointed to the street lamp above our heads.\n\n\"He could see what he was doing here and he could not there. That was\nhis reason.\"\n\n\"By Jove! that's true,\" said the detective. \"Now that I come to think of\nit, Dr. Barnicot's bust was broken not far from his red lamp. Well, Mr.\nHolmes, what are we to do with that fact?\"\n\n\"To remember it--to docket it. We may come on something later which will\nbear upon it. What steps do you propose to take now, Lestrade?\"\n\n\"The most practical way of getting at it, in my opinion, is to identify\nthe dead man. There should be no difficulty about that. When we have\nfound who he is and who his associates are, we should have a good start\nin learning what he was doing in Pitt Street last night, and who it was\nwho met him and killed him on the doorstep of Mr. Horace Harker. Don't\nyou think so?\"\n\n\"No doubt; and yet it is not quite the way in which I should approach\nthe case.\"\n\n\"What would you do, then?\"\n\n\"Oh, you must not let me influence you in any way! I suggest that you\ngo on your line and I on mine. We can compare notes afterwards, and each\nwill supplement the other.\"\n\n\"Very good,\" said Lestrade.\n\n\"If you are going back to Pitt Street you might see Mr. Horace Harker.\nTell him from me that I have quite made up my mind, and that it is\ncertain that a dangerous homicidal lunatic with Napoleonic delusions was\nin his house last night. It will be useful for his article.\"\n\nLestrade stared.\n\n\"You don't seriously believe that?\"\n\nHolmes smiled.\n\n\"Don't I? Well, perhaps I don't. But I am sure that it will interest Mr.\nHorace Harker and the subscribers of the Central Press Syndicate.\nNow, Watson, I think that we shall find that we have a long and rather\ncomplex day's work before us. I should be glad, Lestrade, if you could\nmake it convenient to meet us at Baker Street at six o'clock this\nevening. Until then I should like to keep this photograph found in the\ndead man's pocket. It is possible that I may have to ask your company\nand assistance upon a small expedition which will have be undertaken\nto-night, if my chain of reasoning should prove to be correct. Until\nthen, good-bye and good luck!\"\n\nSherlock Holmes and I walked together to the High Street, where he\nstopped at the shop of Harding Brothers, whence the bust had been\npurchased. A young assistant informed us that Mr. Harding would be\nabsent until after noon, and that he was himself a newcomer who could\ngive us no information. Holmes's face showed his disappointment and\nannoyance.\n\n\"Well, well, we can't expect to have it all our own way, Watson,\" he\nsaid, at last. \"We must come back in the afternoon if Mr. Harding\nwill not be here until then. I am, as you have no doubt surmised,\nendeavouring to trace these busts to their source, in order to find if\nthere is not something peculiar which may account for their remarkable\nfate. Let us make for Mr. Morse Hudson, of the Kennington Road, and see\nif he can throw any light upon the problem.\"\n\nA drive of an hour brought us to the picture-dealer's establishment. He\nwas a small, stout man with a red face and a peppery manner.\n\n\"Yes, sir. On my very counter, sir,\" said he. \"What we pay rates and\ntaxes for I don't know, when any ruffian can come in and break one's\ngoods. Yes, sir, it was I who sold Dr. Barnicot his two statues.\nDisgraceful, sir! A Nihilist plot, that's what I make it. No one but an\nAnarchist would go about breaking statues. Red republicans, that's what\nI call 'em. Who did I get the statues from? I don't see what that has to\ndo with it. Well, if you really want to know, I got them from Gelder\nand Co., in Church Street, Stepney. They are a well-known house in the\ntrade, and have been this twenty years. How many had I? Three--two and\none are three--two of Dr. Barnicot's and one smashed in broad daylight\non my own counter. Do I know that photograph? No, I don't. Yes, I do,\nthough. Why, it's Beppo. He was a kind of Italian piece-work man, who\nmade himself useful in the shop. He could carve a bit and gild and\nframe, and do odd jobs. The fellow left me last week, and I've heard\nnothing of him since. No, I don't know where he came from nor where he\nwent to. I have nothing against him while he was here. He was gone two\ndays before the bust was smashed.\"\n\n\"Well, that's all we could reasonably expect to get from Morse Hudson,\"\nsaid Holmes, as we emerged from the shop. \"We have this Beppo as a\ncommon factor, both in Kennington and in Kensington, so that is worth a\nten-mile drive. Now, Watson, let us make for Gelder and Co., of Stepney,\nthe source and origin of busts. I shall be surprised if we don't get\nsome help down there.\"\n\nIn rapid succession we passed through the fringe of fashionable London,\nhotel London, theatrical London, literary London, commercial London,\nand, finally, maritime London, till we came to a riverside city of a\nhundred thousand souls, where the tenement houses swelter and reek with\nthe outcasts of Europe. Here, in a broad thoroughfare, once the abode\nof wealthy City merchants, we found the sculpture works for which we\nsearched. Outside was a considerable yard full of monumental masonry.\nInside was a large room in which fifty workers were carving or moulding.\nThe manager, a big blond German, received us civilly, and gave a clear\nanswer to all Holmes's questions. A reference to his books showed that\nhundreds of casts had been taken from a marble copy of Devine's head of\nNapoleon, but that the three which had been sent to Morse Hudson a year\nor so before had been half of a batch of six, the other three being sent\nto Harding Brothers, of Kensington. There was no reason why those six\nshould be different to any of the other casts. He could suggest no\npossible cause why anyone should wish to destroy them--in fact, he\nlaughed at the idea. Their wholesale price was six shillings, but the\nretailer would get twelve or more. The cast was taken in two moulds from\neach side of the face, and then these two profiles of plaster of Paris\nwere joined together to make the complete bust. The work was usually\ndone by Italians in the room we were in. When finished the busts were\nput on a table in the passage to dry, and afterwards stored. That was\nall he could tell us.\n\nBut the production of the photograph had a remarkable effect upon the\nmanager. His face flushed with anger, and his brows knotted over his\nblue Teutonic eyes.\n\n\"Ah, the rascal!\" he cried. \"Yes, indeed, I know him very well. This has\nalways been a respectable establishment, and the only time that we have\never had the police in it was over this very fellow. It was more than a\nyear ago now. He knifed another Italian in the street, and then he came\nto the works with the police on his heels, and he was taken here. Beppo\nwas his name--his second name I never knew. Serve me right for engaging\na man with such a face. But he was a good workman, one of the best.\"\n\n\"What did he get?\"\n\n\"The man lived and he got off with a year. I have no doubt he is out\nnow; but he has not dared to show his nose here. We have a cousin of his\nhere, and I dare say he could tell you where he is.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" cried Holmes, \"not a word to the cousin--not a word, I beg\nyou. The matter is very important, and the farther I go with it the more\nimportant it seems to grow. When you referred in your ledger to the sale\nof those casts I observed that the date was June 3rd of last year. Could\nyou give me the date when Beppo was arrested?\"\n\n\"I could tell you roughly by the pay-list,\" the manager answered. \"Yes,\"\nhe continued, after some turning over of pages, \"he was paid last on May\n20th.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Holmes. \"I don't think that I need intrude upon your\ntime and patience any more.\" With a last word of caution that he should\nsay nothing as to our researches we turned our faces westward once more.\n\nThe afternoon was far advanced before we were able to snatch a hasty\nluncheon at a restaurant. A news-bill at the entrance announced\n\"Kensington Outrage. Murder by a Madman,\" and the contents of the paper\nshowed that Mr. Horace Harker had got his account into print after\nall. Two columns were occupied with a highly sensational and flowery\nrendering of the whole incident. Holmes propped it against the\ncruet-stand and read it while he ate. Once or twice he chuckled.\n\n\"This is all right, Watson,\" said he. \"Listen to this: 'It is\nsatisfactory to know that there can be no difference of opinion upon\nthis case, since Mr. Lestrade, one of the most experienced members of\nthe official force, and Mr. Sherlock Holmes, the well-known consulting\nexpert, have each come to the conclusion that the grotesque series of\nincidents, which have ended in so tragic a fashion, arise from lunacy\nrather than from deliberate crime. No explanation save mental aberration\ncan cover the facts.' The Press, Watson, is a most valuable institution\nif you only know how to use it. And now, if you have quite finished,\nwe will hark back to Kensington and see what the manager of Harding\nBrothers has to say to the matter.\"\n\nThe founder of that great emporium proved to be a brisk, crisp little\nperson, very dapper and quick, with a clear head and a ready tongue.\n\n\"Yes, sir, I have already read the account in the evening papers. Mr.\nHorace Harker is a customer of ours. We supplied him with the bust some\nmonths ago. We ordered three busts of that sort from Gelder and Co., of\nStepney. They are all sold now. To whom? Oh, I dare say by consulting\nour sales book we could very easily tell you. Yes, we have the entries\nhere. One to Mr. Harker, you see, and one to Mr. Josiah Brown, of\nLaburnum Lodge, Laburnum Vale, Chiswick, and one to Mr. Sandeford, of\nLower Grove Road, Reading. No, I have never seen this face which you\nshow me in the photograph. You would hardly forget it, would you, sir,\nfor I've seldom seen an uglier. Have we any Italians on the staff? Yes,\nsir, we have several among our workpeople and cleaners. I dare say\nthey might get a peep at that sales book if they wanted to. There is no\nparticular reason for keeping a watch upon that book. Well, well, it's\na very strange business, and I hope that you'll let me know if anything\ncomes of your inquiries.\"\n\nHolmes had taken several notes during Mr. Harding's evidence, and I\ncould see that he was thoroughly satisfied by the turn which affairs\nwere taking. He made no remark, however, save that, unless we hurried,\nwe should be late for our appointment with Lestrade. Sure enough, when\nwe reached Baker Street the detective was already there, and we found\nhim pacing up and down in a fever of impatience. His look of importance\nshowed that his day's work had not been in vain.\n\n\"Well?\" he asked. \"What luck, Mr. Holmes?\"\n\n\"We have had a very busy day, and not entirely a wasted one,\" my friend\nexplained. \"We have seen both the retailers and also the wholesale\nmanufacturers. I can trace each of the busts now from the beginning.\"\n\n\"The busts!\" cried Lestrade. \"Well, well, you have your own methods, Mr.\nSherlock Holmes, and it is not for me to say a word against them, but\nI think I have done a better day's work than you. I have identified the\ndead man.\"\n\n\"You don't say so?\"\n\n\"And found a cause for the crime.\"\n\n\"Splendid!\"\n\n\"We have an inspector who makes a specialty of Saffron Hill and the\nItalian quarter. Well, this dead man had some Catholic emblem round his\nneck, and that, along with his colour, made me think he was from the\nSouth. Inspector Hill knew him the moment he caught sight of him. His\nname is Pietro Venucci, from Naples, and he is one of the greatest\ncut-throats in London. He is connected with the Mafia, which, as you\nknow, is a secret political society, enforcing its decrees by murder.\nNow you see how the affair begins to clear up. The other fellow is\nprobably an Italian also, and a member of the Mafia. He has broken\nthe rules in some fashion. Pietro is set upon his track. Probably the\nphotograph we found in his pocket is the man himself, so that he may not\nknife the wrong person. He dogs the fellow, he sees him enter a house,\nhe waits outside for him, and in the scuffle he receives his own\ndeath-wound. How is that, Mr. Sherlock Holmes?\"\n\nHolmes clapped his hands approvingly.\n\n\"Excellent, Lestrade, excellent!\" he cried. \"But I didn't quite follow\nyour explanation of the destruction of the busts.\"\n\n\"The busts! You never can get those busts out of your head. After all,\nthat is nothing; petty larceny, six months at the most. It is the murder\nthat we are really investigating, and I tell you that I am gathering all\nthe threads into my hands.\"\n\n\"And the next stage?\"\n\n\"Is a very simple one. I shall go down with Hill to the Italian quarter,\nfind the man whose photograph we have got, and arrest him on the charge\nof murder. Will you come with us?\"\n\n\"I think not. I fancy we can attain our end in a simpler way. I can't\nsay for certain, because it all depends--well, it all depends upon\na factor which is completely outside our control. But I have great\nhopes--in fact, the betting is exactly two to one--that if you will come\nwith us to-night I shall be able to help you to lay him by the heels.\"\n\n\"In the Italian quarter?\"\n\n\"No; I fancy Chiswick is an address which is more likely to find him. If\nyou will come with me to Chiswick to-night, Lestrade, I'll promise to go\nto the Italian quarter with you to-morrow, and no harm will be done by\nthe delay. And now I think that a few hours' sleep would do us all good,\nfor I do not propose to leave before eleven o'clock, and it is unlikely\nthat we shall be back before morning. You'll dine with us, Lestrade, and\nthen you are welcome to the sofa until it is time for us to start. In\nthe meantime, Watson, I should be glad if you would ring for an express\nmessenger, for I have a letter to send, and it is important that it\nshould go at once.\"\n\nHolmes spent the evening in rummaging among the files of the old daily\npapers with which one of our lumber-rooms was packed. When at last he\ndescended it was with triumph in his eyes, but he said nothing to\neither of us as to the result of his researches. For my own part, I had\nfollowed step by step the methods by which he had traced the various\nwindings of this complex case, and, though I could not yet perceive the\ngoal which we would reach, I understood clearly that Holmes expected\nthis grotesque criminal to make an attempt upon the two remaining busts,\none of which, I remembered, was at Chiswick. No doubt the object of our\njourney was to catch him in the very act, and I could not but admire the\ncunning with which my friend had inserted a wrong clue in the evening\n\n\n### Summary:\n\n", "answer": "Inspector Lestrade is back yet again. He is chilling at Baker Street and he is distracted. Lestrade has a case that seems really stupid and weird, but it's bothering him. Holmes tells him to spill it. Lestrade tells us that a guy named Morse Hudson, who ran the 1890s version of Pier One, had someone smash a bust of Napoleon in his shop and run off. Lestrade at first thought that this was \"hooliganism.\" But then a man named Mr. Barnicot had the same thing happen to him. He used to be the proud owner of two discount busts of Napoleon bought from Morse Hudson. But some person recently broke in to Barnicot's home and office and broke his Napoleon busts. Tragic. All three Napoleon busts were made from the same mould. Lestrade is wondering if some crazy person has some sort of Napoleon obsession. Dr. Watson helpfully notes that there are lots of mental disorders, so who knows. Thanks for that tip, Watson. Holmes finds this all shifty, and says to keep him updated since seemingly dumb cases often turn out to be major ones. The next morning Holmes barges in on Watson and shows him a telegram from Lestrade telling them to come to an address. They do so and find a dead body. The dead body is outside the house of journalist Horace Harker, who had his Napoleon bust stolen last night. Holmes and Watson go to talk to the upset Harker. Harker is partially upset because he is too upset to write, and his newspaper will miss out on his eyewitness inside scoop. Harker gives them a quick run-down of events and notes that he bought his Napoleon bust from the Harding Brothers store and not Morse Hudson. Shop rivalry. The dynamic duo goes back outside to chat with Lestrade. There's no identification on the body, but he was carrying a picture of a man that Watson describes as \"ape-like.\" The cops have also found a smashed Napoleon bust nearby under a street-lamp. Holmes theorizes that this person is breaking these busts for a deliberate purpose and not just to satisfy a Napoleon vendetta or something. Watson and Holmes leave to go talk to the people at the Harding Brothers' shop and at Morse Hudson's shop. Morse is able to identify the man in the photograph found on the dead body as Beppo, an Italian workman who did stuff like carving and framing at Gelder and Co. Then Holmes and Watson head to Gelder and Co., which is where the Napoleon busts were made originally. Beppo's former boss at Gelder and Co. tells about what a punk he was and how he got arrested on the job after fleeing the cops. Beppo had knifed another Italian in the street. He was a good worker until that incident though. The ex-boss also gives Holmes more info on the Napoleon busts. There were six total made from the same mold. Later Holmes and Watson see a hilarious account in the newspaper about a homicidal nut with a Napoleon complex running around London. They go back to the Harding Brothers shop and find out who owns the other two Napoleon busts. Holmes contacts both men. Lestrade comes back and fills them in on his day's work. Lestrade found out the identity of the dead body: Pietro Venucci. He's an Italian with mafia connections. Lestrade wants to go hunt for Beppo in the Italian Quarter but Holmes says they can let Beppo come to them. So Lestrade, Holmes, and Watson go stake-out the house of Josiah Brown. Eventually Beppo shows up to steal Josiah's Napoleon bust. Beppo is caught and arrested. Beppo smashes the bust before he's caught, depriving Josiah of some nice decoration in his home. Then Bepo is hauled off to jail, and Lestrade goes back to Baker Street with the dynamic duo. A Mr. Sandeford comes by to sell Holmes his Napoleon bust. He can't figure why Holmes is willing to pay so much for it, but Holmes convinces him it's cool and shoves him out the door. Then Holmes breaks the statue open and reveals a black pearl hidden inside. Holmes explains that this is a famous pearl that was stolen years ago. Holmes couldn't solve the case until now. Pietro had a sister, Lucretia, who stole the pearl. He doesn't know if Beppo was in on the scam or if he robbed Pietro, but Beppo hid the pearl in one of the Napoleon busts as the plaster was drying. But then he was arrested and had to wait until he got out of jail to find the pearl."}

One Night\n\n\nNever did the sun go down with a brighter glory on the quiet corner in\nSoho, than one memorable evening when the Doctor and his daughter sat\nunder the plane-tree together. Never did the moon rise with a milder\nradiance over great London, than on that night when it found them still\nseated under the tree, and shone upon their faces through its leaves.\n\nLucie was to be married to-morrow. She had reserved this last evening\nfor her father, and they sat alone under the plane-tree.\n\n\"You are happy, my dear father?\"\n\n\"Quite, my child.\"\n\nThey had said little, though they had been there a long time. When it\nwas yet light enough to work and read, she had neither engaged herself\nin her usual work, nor had she read to him. She had employed herself in\nboth ways, at his side under the tree, many and many a time; but, this\ntime was not quite like any other, and nothing could make it so.\n\n\"And I am very happy to-night, dear father. I am deeply happy in the\nlove that Heaven has so blessed--my love for Charles, and Charles's love\nfor me. But, if my life were not to be still consecrated to you, or\nif my marriage were so arranged as that it would part us, even by\nthe length of a few of these streets, I should be more unhappy and\nself-reproachful now than I can tell you. Even as it is--\"\n\nEven as it was, she could not command her voice.\n\nIn the sad moonlight, she clasped him by the neck, and laid her face\nupon his breast. In the moonlight which is always sad, as the light of\nthe sun itself is--as the light called human life is--at its coming and\nits going.\n\n\"Dearest dear! Can you tell me, this last time, that you feel quite,\nquite sure, no new affections of mine, and no new duties of mine, will\never interpose between us? _I_ know it well, but do you know it? In your\nown heart, do you feel quite certain?\"\n\nHer father answered, with a cheerful firmness of conviction he could\nscarcely have assumed, \"Quite sure, my darling! More than that,\" he\nadded, as he tenderly kissed her: \"my future is far brighter, Lucie,\nseen through your marriage, than it could have been--nay, than it ever\nwas--without it.\"\n\n\"If I could hope _that_, my father!--\"\n\n\"Believe it, love! Indeed it is so. Consider how natural and how plain\nit is, my dear, that it should be so. You, devoted and young, cannot\nfully appreciate the anxiety I have felt that your life should not be\nwasted--\"\n\nShe moved her hand towards his lips, but he took it in his, and repeated\nthe word.\n\n\"--wasted, my child--should not be wasted, struck aside from the\nnatural order of things--for my sake. Your unselfishness cannot entirely\ncomprehend how much my mind has gone on this; but, only ask yourself,\nhow could my happiness be perfect, while yours was incomplete?\"\n\n\"If I had never seen Charles, my father, I should have been quite happy\nwith you.\"\n\nHe smiled at her unconscious admission that she would have been unhappy\nwithout Charles, having seen him; and replied:\n\n\"My child, you did see him, and it is Charles. If it had not been\nCharles, it would have been another. Or, if it had been no other, I\nshould have been the cause, and then the dark part of my life would have\ncast its shadow beyond myself, and would have fallen on you.\"\n\nIt was the first time, except at the trial, of her ever hearing him\nrefer to the period of his suffering. It gave her a strange and new\nsensation while his words were in her ears; and she remembered it long\nafterwards.\n\n\"See!\" said the Doctor of Beauvais, raising his hand towards the moon.\n\"I have looked at her from my prison-window, when I could not bear her\nlight. I have looked at her when it has been such torture to me to think\nof her shining upon what I had lost, that I have beaten my head against\nmy prison-walls. I have looked at her, in a state so dull and lethargic,\nthat I have thought of nothing but the number of horizontal lines I\ncould draw across her at the full, and the number of perpendicular lines\nwith which I could intersect them.\" He added in his inward and pondering\nmanner, as he looked at the moon, \"It was twenty either way, I remember,\nand the twentieth was difficult to squeeze in.\"\n\nThe strange thrill with which she heard him go back to that time,\ndeepened as he dwelt upon it; but, there was nothing to shock her in\nthe manner of his reference. He only seemed to contrast his present\ncheerfulness and felicity with the dire endurance that was over.\n\n\"I have looked at her, speculating thousands of times upon the unborn\nchild from whom I had been rent. Whether it was alive. Whether it had\nbeen born alive, or the poor mother's shock had killed it. Whether it\nwas a son who would some day avenge his father. (There was a time in my\nimprisonment, when my desire for vengeance was unbearable.) Whether it\nwas a son who would never know his father's story; who might even live\nto weigh the possibility of his father's having disappeared of his own\nwill and act. Whether it was a daughter who would grow to be a woman.\"\n\nShe drew closer to him, and kissed his cheek and his hand.\n\n\"I have pictured my daughter, to myself, as perfectly forgetful of\nme--rather, altogether ignorant of me, and unconscious of me. I have\ncast up the years of her age, year after year. I have seen her married\nto a man who knew nothing of my fate. I have altogether perished from\nthe remembrance of the living, and in the next generation my place was a\nblank.\"\n\n\"My father! Even to hear that you had such thoughts of a daughter who\nnever existed, strikes to my heart as if I had been that child.\"\n\n\"You, Lucie? It is out of the Consolation and restoration you have\nbrought to me, that these remembrances arise, and pass between us and\nthe moon on this last night.--What did I say just now?\"\n\n\"She knew nothing of you. She cared nothing for you.\"\n\n\"So! But on other moonlight nights, when the sadness and the silence\nhave touched me in a different way--have affected me with something as\nlike a sorrowful sense of peace, as any emotion that had pain for its\nfoundations could--I have imagined her as coming to me in my cell, and\nleading me out into the freedom beyond the fortress. I have seen her\nimage in the moonlight often, as I now see you; except that I never held\nher in my arms; it stood between the little grated window and the door.\nBut, you understand that that was not the child I am speaking of?\"\n\n\"The figure was not; the--the--image; the fancy?\"\n\n\"No. That was another thing. It stood before my disturbed sense of\nsight, but it never moved. The phantom that my mind pursued, was another\nand more real child. Of her outward appearance I know no more than\nthat she was like her mother. The other had that likeness too--as you\nhave--but was not the same. Can you follow me, Lucie? Hardly, I think?\nI doubt you must have been a solitary prisoner to understand these\nperplexed distinctions.\"\n\nHis collected and calm manner could not prevent her blood from running\ncold, as he thus tried to anatomise his old condition.\n\n\"In that more peaceful state, I have imagined her, in the moonlight,\ncoming to me and taking me out to show me that the home of her married\nlife was full of her loving remembrance of her lost father. My picture\nwas in her room, and I was in her prayers. Her life was active,\ncheerful, useful; but my poor history pervaded it all.\"\n\n\"I was that child, my father, I was not half so good, but in my love\nthat was I.\"\n\n\"And she showed me her children,\" said the Doctor of Beauvais, \"and\nthey had heard of me, and had been taught to pity me. When they passed\na prison of the State, they kept far from its frowning walls, and looked\nup at its bars, and spoke in whispers. She could never deliver me; I\nimagined that she always brought me back after showing me such things.\nBut then, blessed with the relief of tears, I fell upon my knees, and\nblessed her.\"\n\n\"I am that child, I hope, my father. O my dear, my dear, will you bless\nme as fervently to-morrow?\"\n\n\"Lucie, I recall these old troubles in the reason that I have to-night\nfor loving you better than words can tell, and thanking God for my great\nhappiness. My thoughts, when they were wildest, never rose near the\nhappiness that I have known with you, and that we have before us.\"\n\nHe embraced her, solemnly commended her to Heaven, and humbly thanked\nHeaven for having bestowed her on him. By-and-bye, they went into the\nhouse.\n\nThere was no one bidden to the marriage but Mr. Lorry; there was even to\nbe no bridesmaid but the gaunt Miss Pross. The marriage was to make no\nchange in their place of residence; they had been able to extend it,\nby taking to themselves the upper rooms formerly belonging to the\napocryphal invisible lodger, and they desired nothing more.\n\nDoctor Manette was very cheerful at the little supper. They were only\nthree at table, and Miss Pross made the third. He regretted that Charles\nwas not there; was more than half disposed to object to the loving\nlittle plot that kept him away; and drank to him affectionately.\n\nSo, the time came for him to bid Lucie good night, and they separated.\nBut, in the stillness of the third hour of the morning, Lucie came\ndownstairs again, and stole into his room; not free from unshaped fears,\nbeforehand.\n\nAll things, however, were in their places; all was quiet; and he lay\nasleep, his white hair picturesque on the untroubled pillow, and his\nhands lying quiet on the coverlet. She put her needless candle in the\nshadow at a distance, crept up to his bed, and put her lips to his;\nthen, leaned over him, and looked at him.\n\nInto his handsome face, the bitter waters of captivity had worn; but, he\ncovered up their tracks with a determination so strong, that he held the\nmastery of them even in his sleep. A more remarkable face in its quiet,\nresolute, and guarded struggle with an unseen assailant, was not to be\nbeheld in all the wide dominions of sleep, that night.\n\nShe timidly laid her hand on his dear breast, and put up a prayer that\nshe might ever be as true to him as her love aspired to be, and as his\nsorrows deserved. Then, she withdrew her hand, and kissed his lips once\nmore, and went away. So, the sunrise came, and the shadows of the leaves\nof the plane-tree moved upon his face, as softly as her lips had moved\nin praying for him.\n\n\n\n\n\nXVIII. Nine Days\n\n\nThe marriage-day was shining brightly, and they were ready outside the\nclosed door of the Doctor's room, where he was speaking with Charles\nDarnay. They were ready to go to church; the beautiful bride, Mr.\nLorry, and Miss Pross--to whom the event, through a gradual process of\nreconcilement to the inevitable, would have been one of absolute bliss,\nbut for the yet lingering consideration that her brother Solomon should\nhave been the bridegroom.\n\n\"And so,\" said Mr. Lorry, who could not sufficiently admire the bride,\nand who had been moving round her to take in every point of her quiet,\npretty dress; \"and so it was for this, my sweet Lucie, that I brought\nyou across the Channel, such a baby! Lord bless me! How little I thought\nwhat I was doing! How lightly I valued the obligation I was conferring\non my friend Mr. Charles!\"\n\n\"You didn't mean it,\" remarked the matter-of-fact Miss Pross, \"and\ntherefore how could you know it? Nonsense!\"\n\n\"Really? Well; but don't cry,\" said the gentle Mr. Lorry.\n\n\"I am not crying,\" said Miss Pross; \"_you_ are.\"\n\n\"I, my Pross?\" (By this time, Mr. Lorry dared to be pleasant with her,\non occasion.)\n\n\"You were, just now; I saw you do it, and I don't wonder at it. Such\na present of plate as you have made 'em, is enough to bring tears into\nanybody's eyes. There's not a fork or a spoon in the collection,\" said\nMiss Pross, \"that I didn't cry over, last night after the box came, till\nI couldn't see it.\"\n\n\"I am highly gratified,\" said Mr. Lorry, \"though, upon my honour, I\nhad no intention of rendering those trifling articles of remembrance\ninvisible to any one. Dear me! This is an occasion that makes a man\nspeculate on all he has lost. Dear, dear, dear! To think that there\nmight have been a Mrs. Lorry, any time these fifty years almost!\"\n\n\"Not at all!\" From Miss Pross.\n\n\"You think there never might have been a Mrs. Lorry?\" asked the\ngentleman of that name.\n\n\"Pooh!\" rejoined Miss Pross; \"you were a bachelor in your cradle.\"\n\n\"Well!\" observed Mr. Lorry, beamingly adjusting his little wig, \"that\nseems probable, too.\"\n\n\"And you were cut out for a bachelor,\" pursued Miss Pross, \"before you\nwere put in your cradle.\"\n\n\"Then, I think,\" said Mr. Lorry, \"that I was very unhandsomely dealt\nwith, and that I ought to have had a voice in the selection of my\npattern. Enough! Now, my dear Lucie,\" drawing his arm soothingly round\nher waist, \"I hear them moving in the next room, and Miss Pross and\nI, as two formal folks of business, are anxious not to lose the final\nopportunity of saying something to you that you wish to hear. You leave\nyour good father, my dear, in hands as earnest and as loving as your\nown; he shall be taken every conceivable care of; during the next\nfortnight, while you are in Warwickshire and thereabouts, even Tellson's\nshall go to the wall (comparatively speaking) before him. And when, at\nthe fortnight's end, he comes to join you and your beloved husband, on\nyour other fortnight's trip in Wales, you shall say that we have sent\nhim to you in the best health and in the happiest frame. Now, I hear\nSomebody's step coming to the door. Let me kiss my dear girl with an\nold-fashioned bachelor blessing, before Somebody comes to claim his\nown.\"\n\nFor a moment, he held the fair face from him to look at the\nwell-remembered expression on the forehead, and then laid the bright\ngolden hair against his little brown wig, with a genuine tenderness and\ndelicacy which, if such things be old-fashioned, were as old as Adam.\n\nThe door of the Doctor's room opened, and he came out with Charles\nDarnay. He was so deadly pale--which had not been the case when they\nwent in together--that no vestige of colour was to be seen in his face.\nBut, in the composure of his manner he was unaltered, except that to the\nshrewd glance of Mr. Lorry it disclosed some shadowy indication that the\nold air of avoidance and dread had lately passed over him, like a cold\nwind.\n\nHe gave his arm to his daughter, and took her down-stairs to the chariot\nwhich Mr. Lorry had hired in honour of the day. The rest followed in\nanother carriage, and soon, in a neighbouring church, where no strange\neyes looked on, Charles Darnay and Lucie Manette were happily married.\n\nBesides the glancing tears that shone among the smiles of the little\ngroup when it was done, some diamonds, very bright and sparkling,\nglanced on the bride's hand, which were newly released from the\ndark obscurity of one of Mr. Lorry's pockets. They returned home to\nbreakfast, and all went well, and in due course the golden hair that had\nmingled with the poor shoemaker's white locks in the Paris garret, were\nmingled with them again in the morning sunlight, on the threshold of the\ndoor at parting.\n\nIt was a hard parting, though it was not for long. But her father\ncheered her, and said at last, gently disengaging himself from her\nenfolding arms, \"Take her, Charles! She is yours!\"\n\nAnd her agitated hand waved to them from a chaise window, and she was\ngone.\n\nThe corner being out of the way of the idle and curious, and the\npreparations having been very simple and few, the Doctor, Mr. Lorry,\nand Miss Pross, were left quite alone. It was when they turned into\nthe welcome shade of the cool old hall, that Mr. Lorry observed a great\nchange to have come over the Doctor; as if the golden arm uplifted\nthere, had struck him a poisoned blow.\n\nHe had naturally repressed much, and some revulsion might have been\nexpected in him when the occasion for repression was gone. But, it was\nthe old scared lost look that troubled Mr. Lorry; and through his absent\nmanner of clasping his head and drearily wandering away into his own\nroom when they got up-stairs, Mr. Lorry was reminded of Defarge the\nwine-shop keeper, and the starlight ride.\n\n\"I think,\" he whispered to Miss Pross, after anxious consideration, \"I\nthink we had best not speak to him just now, or at all disturb him.\nI must look in at Tellson's; so I will go there at once and come back\npresently. Then, we will take him a ride into the country, and dine\nthere, and all will be well.\"\n\nIt was easier for Mr. Lorry to look in at Tellson's, than to look out of\nTellson's. He was detained two hours. When he came back, he ascended the\nold staircase alone, having asked no question of the servant; going thus\ninto the Doctor's rooms, he was stopped by a low sound of knocking.\n\n\"Good God!\" he said, with a start. \"What's that?\"\n\nMiss Pross, with a terrified face, was at his ear. \"O me, O me! All is\nlost!\" cried she, wringing her hands. \"What is to be told to Ladybird?\nHe doesn't know me, and is making shoes!\"\n\nMr. Lorry said what he could to calm her, and went himself into the\nDoctor's room. The bench was turned towards the light, as it had been\nwhen he had seen the shoemaker at his work before, and his head was bent\ndown, and he was very busy.\n\n\"Doctor Manette. My dear friend, Doctor Manette!\"\n\nThe Doctor looked at him for a moment--half inquiringly, half as if he\nwere angry at being spoken to--and bent over his work again.\n\nHe had laid aside his coat and waistcoat; his shirt was open at the\nthroat, as it used to be when he did that work; and even the old\nhaggard, faded surface of face had come back to him. He worked\nhard--impatiently--as if in some sense of having been interrupted.\n\nMr. Lorry glanced at the work in his hand, and observed that it was a\nshoe of the old size and shape. He took up another that was lying by\nhim, and asked what it was.\n\n\"A young lady's walking shoe,\" he muttered, without looking up. \"It\nought to have been finished long ago. Let it be.\"\n\n\"But, Doctor Manette. Look at me!\"\n\nHe obeyed, in the old mechanically submissive manner, without pausing in\nhis work.\n\n\"You know me, my dear friend? Think again. This is not your proper\noccupation. Think, dear friend!\"\n\nNothing would induce him to speak more. He looked up, for an instant at\na time, when he was requested to do so; but, no persuasion would extract\na word from him. He worked, and worked, and worked, in silence, and\nwords fell on him as they would have fallen on an echoless wall, or on\nthe air. The only ray of hope that Mr. Lorry could discover, was, that\nhe sometimes furtively looked up without being asked. In that, there\nseemed a faint expression of curiosity or perplexity--as though he were\ntrying to reconcile some doubts in his mind.\n\nTwo things at once impressed themselves on Mr. Lorry, as important above\nall others; the first, that this must be kept secret from Lucie;\nthe second, that it must be kept secret from all who knew him. In\nconjunction with Miss Pross, he took immediate steps towards the latter\nprecaution, by giving out that the Doctor was not well, and required a\nfew days of complete rest. In aid of the kind deception to be practised\non his daughter, Miss Pross was to write, describing his having been\ncalled away professionally, and referring to an imaginary letter of\ntwo or three hurried lines in his own hand, represented to have been\naddressed to her by the same post.\n\nThese measures, advisable to be taken in any case, Mr. Lorry took in\nthe hope of his coming to himself. If that should happen soon, he kept\nanother course in reserve; which was, to have a certain opinion that he\nthought the best, on the Doctor's case.\n\nIn the hope of his recovery, and of resort to this third course\nbeing thereby rendered practicable, Mr. Lorry resolved to watch him\nattentively, with as little appearance as possible of doing so. He\ntherefore made arrangements to absent himself from Tellson's for the\nfirst time in his life, and took his post by the window in the same\nroom.\n\nHe was not long in discovering that it was worse than useless to speak\nto him, since, on being pressed, he became worried. He abandoned that\nattempt on the first day, and resolved merely to keep himself always\nbefore him, as a silent protest against the delusion into which he had\nfallen, or was falling. He remained, therefore, in his seat near the\nwindow, reading and writing, and expressing in as many pleasant and\nnatural ways as he could think of, that it was a free place.\n\nDoctor Manette took what was given him to eat and drink, and worked on,\nthat first day, until it was too dark to see--worked on, half an hour\nafter Mr. Lorry could not have seen, for his life, to read or write.\nWhen he put his tools aside as useless, until morning, Mr. Lorry rose\nand said to him:\n\n\"Will you go out?\"\n\nHe looked down at the floor on either side of him in the old manner,\nlooked up in the old manner, and repeated in the old low voice:\n\n\"Out?\"\n\n\"Yes; for a walk with me. Why not?\"\n\nHe made no effort to say why not, and said not a word more. But, Mr.\nLorry thought he saw, as he leaned forward on his bench in the dusk,\nwith his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands, that he was in\nsome misty way asking himself, \"Why not?\" The sagacity of the man of\nbusiness perceived an advantage here, and determined to hold it.\n\nMiss Pross and he divided the night into two watches, and observed him\nat intervals from the adjoining room. He paced up and down for a long\ntime before he lay down; but, when he did finally lay himself down, he\nfell asleep. In the morning, he was up betimes, and went straight to his\nbench and to work.\n\nOn this second day, Mr. Lorry saluted him cheerfully by his name,\nand spoke to him on topics that had been of late familiar to them. He\nreturned no reply, but it was evident that he heard what was said, and\nthat he thought about it, however confusedly. This encouraged Mr. Lorry\nto have Miss Pross in with her work, several times during the day;\nat those times, they quietly spoke of Lucie, and of her father then\npresent, precisely in the usual manner, and as if there were nothing\namiss. This was done without any demonstrative accompaniment, not long\nenough, or often enough to harass him; and it lightened Mr. Lorry's\nfriendly heart to believe that he looked up oftener, and that he\nappeared to be stirred by some perception of inconsistencies surrounding\nhim.\n\nWhen it fell dark again, Mr. Lorry asked him as before:\n\n\"Dear Doctor, will you go out?\"\n\nAs before, he repeated, \"Out?\"\n\n\"Yes; for a walk with me. Why not?\"\n\nThis time, Mr. Lorry feigned to go out when he could extract no answer\nfrom him, and, after remaining absent for an hour, returned. In the\nmeanwhile, the Doctor had removed to the seat in the window, and had\nsat there looking down at the plane-tree; but, on Mr. Lorry's return, he\nslipped away to his bench.\n\nThe time went very slowly on, and Mr. Lorry's hope darkened, and his\nheart grew heavier again, and grew yet heavier and heavier every day.\nThe third day came and went, the fourth, the fifth. Five days, six days,\nseven days, eight days, nine days.\n\nWith a hope ever darkening, and with a heart always growing heavier and\nheavier, Mr. Lorry passed through this anxious time. The secret was\nwell kept, and Lucie was unconscious and happy; but he could not fail to\nobserve that the shoemaker, whose hand had been a little out at first,\nwas growing dreadfully skilful, and that he had never been so intent on\nhis work, and that his hands had never been so nimble and expert, as in\nthe dusk of the ninth evening.\n\n\n\n\n\nXIX. An Opinion\n\nWorn out by anxious watching, Mr. Lorry fell asleep at his post. On the\ntenth morning of his suspense, he was startled by the shining of the sun\ninto the room where a heavy slumber had overtaken him when it was dark\nnight.\n\nHe rubbed his eyes and roused himself; but he doubted, when he had\ndone so, whether he was not still asleep. For, going to the door of the\nDoctor's room and looking in, he perceived that the shoemaker's bench\nand tools were put aside again, and that the Doctor himself sat reading\nat the window. He was in his usual morning dress, and his face (which\nMr. Lorry could distinctly see), though still very pale, was calmly\nstudious and attentive.\n\nEven when he had satisfied himself that he was awake, Mr. Lorry felt\ngiddily uncertain for some few moments whether the late shoemaking might\nnot be a disturbed dream of his own; for, did not his eyes show him his\nfriend before him in his accustomed clothing and aspect, and employed\nas usual; and was there any sign within their range, that the change of\nwhich he had so strong an impression had actually happened?\n\nIt was but the inquiry of his first confusion and astonishment, the\nanswer being obvious. If the impression were not produced by a real\ncorresponding and sufficient cause, how came he, Jarvis Lorry, there?\nHow came he to have fallen asleep, in his clothes, on the sofa in Doctor\nManette's consulting-room, and to be debating these points outside the\nDoctor's bedroom door in the early morning?\n\nWithin a few minutes, Miss Pross stood whispering at his side. If he\nhad had any particle of doubt left, her talk would of necessity have\nresolved it; but he was by that time clear-headed, and had none.\nHe advised that they should let the time go by until the regular\nbreakfast-hour, and should then meet the Doctor as if nothing unusual\nhad occurred. If he appeared to be in his customary state of mind, Mr.\nLorry would then cautiously proceed to seek direction and guidance from\nthe opinion he had been, in his anxiety, so anxious to obtain.\n\nMiss Pross, submitting herself to his judgment, the scheme was worked\nout with care. Having abundance of time for his usual methodical\ntoilette, Mr. Lorry presented himself at the breakfast-hour in his usual\nwhite linen, and with his usual neat leg. The Doctor was summoned in the\nusual way, and came to breakfast.\n\nSo far as it was possible to comprehend him without overstepping those\ndelicate and gradual approaches which Mr. Lorry felt to be the only safe\nadvance, he at first supposed that his daughter's marriage had taken\nplace yesterday. An incidental allusion, purposely thrown out, to\nthe day of the week, and the day of the month, set him thinking and\ncounting, and evidently made him uneasy. In all other respects, however,\nhe was so composedly himself, that Mr. Lorry determined to have the aid\nhe sought. And that aid was his own.\n\nTherefore, when the breakfast was done and cleared away, and he and the\nDoctor were left together, Mr. Lorry said, feelingly:\n\n\"My dear Manette, I am anxious to have your opinion, in confidence, on a\nvery curious case in which I am deeply interested; that is to say, it is\nvery curious to me; perhaps, to your better information it may be less\nso.\"\n\nGlancing at his hands, which were discoloured by his late work, the\nDoctor looked troubled, and listened attentively. He had already glanced\nat his hands more than once.\n\n\"Doctor Manette,\" said Mr. Lorry, touching him affectionately on the\narm, \"the case is the case of a particularly dear friend of mine. Pray\ngive your mind to it, and advise me well for his sake--and above all,\nfor his daughter's--his daughter's, my dear Manette.\"\n\n\"If I understand,\" said the Doctor, in a subdued tone, \"some mental\nshock--?\"\n\n\"Yes!\"\n\n\"Be explicit,\" said the Doctor. \"Spare no detail.\"\n\nMr. Lorry saw that they understood one another, and proceeded.\n\n\"My dear Manette, it is the case of an old and a prolonged shock,\nof great acuteness and severity to the affections, the feelings,\nthe--the--as you express it--the mind. The mind. It is the case of a\nshock under which the sufferer was borne down, one cannot say for how\nlong, because I believe he cannot calculate the time himself, and there\nare no other means of getting at it. It is the case of a shock from\nwhich the sufferer recovered, by a process that he cannot trace\nhimself--as I once heard him publicly relate in a striking manner. It is\nthe case of a shock from which he has recovered, so completely, as to\nbe a highly intelligent man, capable of close application of mind, and\ngreat exertion of body, and of constantly making fresh additions to his\nstock of knowledge, which was already very large. But, unfortunately,\nthere has been,\" he paused and took a deep breath--\"a slight relapse.\"\n\nThe Doctor, in a low voice, asked, \"Of how long duration?\"\n\n\"Nine days and nights.\"\n\n\"How did it show itself? I infer,\" glancing at his hands again, \"in the\nresumption of some old pursuit connected with the shock?\"\n\n\"That is the fact.\"\n\n\"Now, did you ever see him,\" asked the Doctor, distinctly and\ncollectedly, though in the same low voice, \"engaged in that pursuit\noriginally?\"\n\n\"Once.\"\n\n\"And when the relapse fell on him, was he in most respects--or in all\nrespects--as he was then?\"\n\n\"I think in all respects.\"\n\n\"You spoke of his daughter. Does his daughter know of the relapse?\"\n\n\"No. It has been kept from her, and I hope will always be kept from her.\nIt is known only to myself, and to one other who may be trusted.\"\n\nThe Doctor grasped his hand, and murmured, \"That was very kind. That was\nvery thoughtful!\" Mr. Lorry grasped his hand in return, and neither of\nthe two spoke for a little while.\n\n\"Now, my dear Manette,\" said Mr. Lorry, at length, in his most\nconsiderate and most affectionate way, \"I am a mere man of business,\nand unfit to cope with such intricate and difficult matters. I do not\npossess the kind of information necessary; I do not possess the kind of\nintelligence; I want guiding. There is no man in this world on whom\nI could so rely for right guidance, as on you. Tell me, how does this\nrelapse come about? Is there danger of another? Could a repetition of it\nbe prevented? How should a repetition of it be treated? How does it come\nabout at all? What can I do for my friend? No man ever can have been\nmore desirous in his heart to serve a friend, than I am to serve mine,\nif I knew how.\n\n\"But I don't know how\n\n### Summary:\n\n", "answer": "Book II Chapter 17-20 The night before Lucie Manette is to marry Charles Darnay she and her father sit under the plane tree in their yard and she reassures him that he love for Charles and all the ties that marriage will bring will not intrude upon her feelings for her father. He assures her that he knows this to be true and that her marriage will only make him happier. He speaks of the time he spent in prison, something Lucie has only heard him mention once before, and describes how he imagined what his child might be, son or daughter, and worried that they would never know him. He explains that in his furthest flights of solitary imagining he never would have believed that he could be as happy as his present life has made him. Later that night Lucie sneaks into her father's bedroom and, placing her hand on his breast, she prays that she will always be true to him. The morning of the wedding Mr. Lorry and Miss Pross fuss over the beautiful bride while Dr. Manette and Charles Darnay confer in the adjoining room. When Mr. Lorry suggests that he should have married before he grew old, Miss Pross insists that he was born to be a bachelor. Mr. Lorry promises Lucie that he and Miss Pross will take good care of her father while she and Charles spend two weeks honeymooning in Warwickshire and will send him to Wales to join them in good health. When Darnay and the Doctor emerge from their conference Mr. Lorry notices that the Doctor is pale and seems cowed. The wedding, which is private at a small church, goes smoothly and after breakfast the newly married couple are on their way. Mr. Lorry again notices the doctor's changed demeanor and when he returns later in the evening he is alarmed to find Doctor Manette at his old occupation of making shoes. The doctor does not recognize either Mr. Lorry or Miss Pross. Mr. Lorry, for the first time in his life, takes a leave of absence from Tellson's in order to attend to his sick friend. For nine days he tries to bring the doctor to his senses by making small talk about ordinary affairs. On the morning of the tenth day Mr. Lorry awakes in the doctor's room where he had unintentionally fallen asleep. The doctor has returned to normal but is not aware that nine days have passed since Lucie's wedding. After breakfast Mr. Lorry engages his friend in a discussion regarding a hypothetical friend who recently experienced the recurrence of an old mental debility. The doctor understands that they are in fact discussing himself but continues with the conceit. When the doctor learns that Mr. Lorry's \"friend's\" daughter is unaware of the relapse he is very thankful. The doctor admits that the relapse was foreseen by its subject and dreaded. The doctor expresses his belief that the relapse might not return. Mr. Lorry asks if perhaps if his friend works too hard and the doctor denies that this is the cause. Mr. Lorry then suggests that the tools that accompany the relapse should be thrown away. The doctor argues that they were once so important to the subject's survival as to have become dear to him. He relents, however, that they should be disposed of in the subject's absence. Accordingly, as soon as the doctor has left for Wales to meet his daughter and son-in-law, Mr. Lorry with Miss Pross assisting utterly destroys the shoemaking implements. Soon after Charles and Lucie return their first visitor is Sydney Carton. He pulls Charles aside and asks him if they could be friends so he might have the privilege of calling upon the couple informally about four times a year. Charles asserts that they have always been friends, which Carton dismisses, but readily accepts Charles' offer to call upon them whenever he feels the need. Later that night Charles makes comments about Carton being reckless and careless. Later, in private, Lucie begs him to show more leniency in his opinion of Carton and expresses her belief that he is capable of great things. Charles is touched by the reminder that while they are happy Carton is miserable. He promises to remember her advice."}
