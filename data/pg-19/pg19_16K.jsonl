MACKENZIE.\n\n1909\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTO\n\nMiss YULE, of TARRADALE.\n\n\n\n\nPREFACE.\n\n\nTHE ELVES.\n\nThe immemorial folk-beliefs of our native land are passing away, but\nthey still retain for us a poetic appeal, not only on account of the\nglamour of early associations, but also because they afford us inviting\nglimpses of the mental habits and inherent characteristics of the men\nand women of past generations. When we re-tell the old tales of our\nancestors, we sit beside them over the peat-fire; and, as we glory with\nthem in their strong heroes, and share their elemental joys and fears,\nwe breathe the palpitating air of that old mysterious world of theirs,\npeopled by spirits beautiful, and strange, and awe-inspiring.\n\nThe attitude of the Gael towards the supernatural, and his general\noutlook upon life in times gone by, was not associated with unbroken\ngloom; nor was he always an ineffectual dreamer and melancholy fatalist.\nThese attributes belong chiefly to the Literary Celt of latter-day\nconception--the Celt of Arnold and Renan, and other writers following in\ntheir wake, who have woven misty impressions of a people whom they have\nmet as strangers, and never really understood. Celtic literature is not\na morbid literature. In Highland poetry there is more light than shadow,\nmuch symbolism, but no vagueness; pictures are presented in minute\ndetail; stanzas are cunningly wrought in a spirit of keen artistry; and\nthe literary style is direct and clear and comprehensible. In Highland\nfolklore we find associated with the haunting \"fear of things\ninvisible,\" common to all peoples in early stages of development, a\nconfident feeling of security inspired by the minute observances of\nceremonial practices. We also note a distinct tendency to discriminate\nbetween spirits, some of which are invariably friendly, some merely\npicturesque, and perhaps fearsome, and others constantly harbouring a\ndesire to work evil upon mankind. Associated with belief in the efficacy\nof propitiatory offerings and \"ceremonies of riddance,\" is the ethical\nsuggestion that good wishes and good deeds influence spirits to perform\nacts of kindly intent.\n\nOf fairies the Highlanders spoke, as they are still prone to do in these\ndistricts where belief in them is not yet extinct, with no small degree\nof regard and affection. It may be that \"the good folk\" and the\n\"peace-people\" (_sitchean_) were so called that good intention might be\ncompelled by the conjuring influence of a name, as well as to avoid\ngiving offence by uttering real names, as if it were desired to exercise\na magical influence by their use. Be that as it may, it is evident from\nHighland folk-tales that the fairies were oftener the friends than the\nfoes of mankind. When men and women were lured to their dwellings they\nrarely suffered injury; indeed, the fairies appeared to have taken\npleasure in their company. To such as they favoured they imparted the\nsecrets of their skill in the arts of piping, of sword-making, etc. At\nsowing time or harvest they were at the service of human friends. On the\nneedy they took pity. They never failed in a promise; they never forgot\nan act of kindness, which they invariably rewarded seven-fold. Against\nthose who wronged them they took speedy vengeance. It would appear that\non these humanised spirits of his conception the Highlander left, as one\nwould expect him to do, the impress of his own character--his shrewdness\nand high sense of honour, his love of music and gaiety, his warmth of\nheart and love of comrades, and his indelible hatred of tyranny and\nwrong.\n\nThe Highland \"wee folk\" are not so diminutive as the fairies of\nEngland--at least that type of fairy, beloved of the poet, which hovers\nbee-like over flowers and feeds on honey-dew. Power they had to shrink\nin stature and to render themselves invisible, but they are invariably\n\"little people,\" from three to four feet high. It may be that the Gael's\nconception of humanised spirits may not have been uninfluenced by the\ntraditions of that earlier diminutive race whose arrow-heads of flint\nwere so long regarded as \"elf-bolts.\" The fairies dwelt only in grassy\nknolls, on the summits of high hills, and inside cliffs. Although\ncapable of living for several centuries, they were not immortal. They\nrequired food, and borrowed meal and cooking utensils from human beings,\nand always returned what they received on loan. They could be heard\nwithin the knolls grinding corn and working at their anvils, and they\nwere adepts at spinning and weaving and harvesting. When they went on\nlong journeys they became invisible, and were carried through the air on\neddies of western wind.\n\nAt the seasonal changes of the year, \"the wee folk\" were for several\ndays on end inspired, like all other supernatural furies, with enmity\nagainst mankind. Their evil influences were negatived by spells and\ncharms. We who still hang on our walls at Christmas the mystic holly,\nare unconsciously perpetuating an old-world custom connected with belief\nin the efficacy of the magical circle to protect us against evil\nspirits. And in our concern about luck, our proneness to believe in\nomens, the influence of colours and numbers, in dreams and in prophetic\nwarnings, we retain as much of the spirit as the poetry of the religion\nof our remote ancestors.\n\n\nTHE HEROES.\n\nThe heroes, with the exception of Cuchullin, who appear in this volume,\nfigure in the tales and poems of the Ossianic or Fian Cycle, which is\ncommon to Ireland and to Scotland. They have been neglected by our\nScottish poets since Gavin Douglas and Barbour. In Ireland the Fians are\na band of militia--the original Fenians. In Scotland the tales vary\nconsiderably, and belong to the hunting period before the introduction\nof agriculture. But in this country, as well as in Ireland, they are\nevidently influenced by historic happenings. There are tales of Norse\nconflicts, as well as tales of adventure among giants and spirits.\n\nThe cycle had evidently remote beginnings. When we find Diarmid and\nGrainne, like Paris and Helen, the cause of conflict and disaster; and\nDiarmid, like Achilles, charmed of body, and vulnerable only on his\nheel-spot, we incline to the theory that from a mid-European centre\nmigrating \"waves\" swept over prehistoric Greece, and left traces of\ntheir mythology and folk-lore in Homer, while other \"waves,\" sweeping\nnorthward, bequeathed to us as a literary inheritance the Celtic\nfolk-tales, in which the deeds and magical attributes of remote tribal\nheroes and humanised deities are co-mingled and perpetuated.\n\nOn fragments of these folk-tales the poet Macpherson reared his Ossianic\nepic, in imitation of the Iliad and Paradise Lost.\n\nThe \"Death of Cuchullin\" is a rendering in verse of an Irish prose\ntranslation of a fragment of the Cuchullin Cycle, which moves in the\nBronze Age period. Cuchullin, with \"the light of heroes\" on his\nforehead, is also reminiscent of Achilles. One of the few Cuchullin\ntales found in Scotland is that which relates his conflict with his son,\nand bears a striking similarity to the legend of Sohrab and Rustum.\nMacpherson also drew from this Cycle in composing his Ossian, and\nmingled it with the other, with which it has no connection.\n\nThe third great Celtic Cycle--the Arthurian--bears close resemblances,\nas Campbell, of \"The West Highland Tales,\" has shown, to the Fian Cycle,\nand had evidently a common origin. Its value as a source of literary\ninspiration has been fully appreciated, but the Fian and Cuchullin\ncycles still await, like virgin soil, to yield an abundant harvest for\nthe poets of the future.\n\nNotes on the folk-beliefs and tales will be found at the end of this\nvolume.\n\nSome of the short poems have appeared in the \"Glasgow Herald\" and\n\"Inverness Courier\"; the three tales appeared in the \"Celtic Review.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCONTENTS.\n\n\nPreface\n\nThe Wee Folk\n\nThe Remnant Bannock\n\nThe Banshee\n\nConn, Son of the Red\n\nThe Song of Goll\n\nThe Blue Men of the

folk bide;\nThey'll flit among the heather,\n  And trip upon the brae--\nThe wee folk, the green folk, the red folk and grey.\n\nAs o'er the moor at midnight\n  The wee folk pass,\nThey whisper '<DW41> the rushes\n  And o'er the green grass;\nAll through the marshy places\n  They glint and pass away--\nThe light folk, the lone folk, the folk that will not stay.\n\nO many a fairy milkmaid\n  With the one eye blind,\nIs'mid the lonely mountains\n  By the red deer hind;\nNot one will wait to greet me,\n  For they have naught to say--\nThe hill folk, the still folk, the folk that flit away.\n\nWhen the golden moon is glinting\n  In the deep, dim wood,\nThere's a fairy piper playing\n  To the elfin brood;\nThey dance and shout and turn about,\n  And laugh and swing and sway--\nThe droll folk, the knoll folk, the folk that dance alway.\n\nO we that bless the wee folk\n  Have naught to fear,\nAnd ne'er an elfin arrow\n  Will come us near;\nFor they'll give skill in music,\n  And every wish obey--\nThe wise folk, the peace folk, the folk that work and play.\n\nThey'll hasten here at harvest,\n  They will shear and bind;\nThey'll come with elfin music\n  On a western wind;\nAll night they'll sit among the sheaves,\n  Or herd the kine that stray--\nThe quick folk, the fine folk, the folk that ask no pay.\n\nBetimes they will be spinning\n  The while we sleep,\nThey'll clamber down the chimney,\n  Or through keyholes creep;\nAnd when they come to borrow meal\n  We'll ne'er them send away--\nThe good folk, the honest folk, the folk that work alway.\n\nO never wrong the wee folk--\n  The red folk and green,\nNor name them on the Fridays,\n  Or at Hallowe'en;\nThe helpless and unwary then\n  And bairns they lure away--\nThe fierce folk, the angry folk, the folk that steal and slay.\n\n\n\n\nBONNACH FALLAIDH.\n\n(THE REMNANT BANNOCK.)\n\n\nO, the good-wife will be singing\n  When her meal is all but done--\nNow all my bannocks have I baked,\n  I've baked them all but one;\nAnd I'll dust the board to bake it,\n  I'll bake it with a spell--\nO, it's Finlay's little bannock\n  For going to the well.\n\nThe bannock on the brander\n  Smells sweet for your desire--\nO my crisp ones I will count not\n  On two sides of the fire;\nAnd not a farl has fallen\n  Some evil to foretell!--\nO it's Finlay's little bannock\n  For going to the well.\n\nThe bread would not be lasting,\n  'Twould crumble in your hand;\nWhen fairies would be coming here\n  To turn the meal to sand--\nBut what will keep them dancing\n  In their own green dell?\nO it's Finlay's little bannock\n  For going to the well.\n\nNow, not a fairy finger\n  Will do my baking harm--\nThe little bannock with the hole,\n  O it will be the charm.\nI knead it, I knead it, 'twixt my palms,\n  And all the bairns I tell--\nO it's Finlay's little bannock\n  For going to the well.\n\n\n\n\nTHE BANSHEE.\n\n\nKnee-deep she waded in the pool--\n  The Banshee robed in green--\nShe sang yon song the whole night long,\n  And washed the linen clean;\nThe linen that would wrap the dead\n  She beetled on a stone,\nShe stood with dripping hands, blood-red,\n  Low singing all alone--\n\n_His linen robes are pure and white,\nFor Fergus More must die to-night!_\n\n'Twas Fergus More rode o'er the hill,\n  Come back from foreign wars,\nHis horse's feet were clattering sweet\n  Below the pitiless stars;\nAnd in his heart he would repeat--\n  \"O never again I'll roam;\nAll weary is the going forth,\n  But sweet the coming home!\"\n\n_His linen robes are pure and white,\nFor Fergus More must die to-night!_\n\nHe saw the blaze upon his hearth\n  Come gleaming down the glen;\nFor he was fain for home again,\n  And rode before his men--\n\"'Tis many a weary day,\" he'd sigh,\n  \"Since I would leave her side;\nI'll never more leave Scotland's shore\n  And yon, my dark-eyed bride.\"\n\n_His linen robes are pure and white,\nFor Fergus More must die to-night!_\n\nSo dreaming of her tender love,\n  Soft tears his eyes would blind--\nWhen up there crept and swiftly leapt\n  A man who stabbed behind--\n\"'Tis you,\" he cried, \"who stole my bride,\n  This night shall be your last!\"...\nWhen Fergus fell, the warm, red tide\n  Of life came ebbing fast...\n\n_His linen robes are pure and white,\nFor Fergus More must die to-night!_\n\n\n\n\nCONN, SON OF THE RED.\n\n\nThe Fians sojourned by the shore\nOf comely Cromarty, and o'er\nThe wooded hill pursued the chase\nWith ardour. 'Twas a full moon's space\nEre Beltane[1] rites would be begun\nWith homage to the rising sun--\nEre to the spirits of the dead\nWould sacrificial blood be shed\nIn yon green grove of Navity--[2]\nWhen Conn came over the Eastern Sea,\nHis heart aflame with vengeful ire,\nTo seek for Goll, who slew his sire\nWhen he was seven years old.\n\n                             Finn saw\nIn dreams, ere yet he came, with awe\nThe Red One's son, so fierce and bold,\nIn combat with his hero old--\nThe king-like Goll of valorous might--\nA stormy billow in the fight\nNo foe could ere withstand.\n\n                            He knew\nThe strange ship bore brave Conn, and blew\nClear on his horn the Warning Call;\nAnd round him thronged the Fians all\nWith wond'ring gaze.\n\n                     The sun drew nigh\nThe bale-fires of the western sky,\nAnd <DW19> clouds with blood-red glare,\nCaught flame, and in the radiant air\nLone Wyvis like a jewel shone--\nThe Fians, as they stared at Conn,\nWere stooping on the high Look-Out.\nThey watched the ship that tacked about,\nNow slant across the firth, and now\nLaid bare below the cliff's broad brow,\nAnd heaving on a billowy steep,\nLike to a monster of the deep\nThat wallowed, labouring in pain--\nAnd Conn stared back with cold disdain.\n\nPondering, he sat alone behind\nThe broad sail swallowing the wind,\nAs over the hollowing waves that leapt\nAnd snarled with foaming lips, and swept\nAround the bows in querulous fray,\nAnd tossed in curves of drenching spray,\nThe belching ship with ardour drove;\nThen like a lordly elk that strove\nAmid the hounds and, charging, rent\nThe pack asunder as it went,\nIt bore round and in beauty sprang--\nThe sea-wind through the cordage sang\nWith high and wintry merriment\nThat stirred the heart of Conn, intent\nOn vengeance, and for battle keen--\nSo hard, so steadfast, and serene.\n\nThen Ossian, sweet of speech, spake low,\nWith musing eyes upon the foe,\n\"Is Conn more noble than The Red,\nWhom Goll in battle vanquished?\"\n\"The Red was fiercer,\" Conan cried--\n\"Nay, Conn is nobler,\" Finn replied,\n\"More comely, stalwart, mightier far--\nWhat sayest thou, Goll, my man of war?\"\nThen Goll made answer on the steep,\nNor ceased to gaze on Conn full deep--\n\"His equal never came before\nAcross the seas to Alban shore,\nNor ever have I peered upon\nA nobler, mightier man than Conn\"\n\nThe ship flew seaward, tacking wide,\nContending with the wind and tide,\nAnd when upon the broad stream's track\nIt baffled hung, or drifted back,\nWith grunt and shriek, like battling boars,\nThe shock and swing of bladed oars\nCame sounding o'er the sea\n\n                           The dusk\nGrew round the twilight, like a husk\nThat holds a kernel choice, and keen,\nCold stars impaled the sky serene,\nWhen Conn's ship through the slackening tide\nDrew round the wistful bay and wide,\nBehind the headlands high that snout\nThe seas like giant whales, and spout\nThe salt foam high and loud\n\n                            Then sighed\nThe gasping men who all day plied\nTheir oars in plunging seas, with hands\nGrown stiff, and arms, like twisted bands\nDrawn numbly, as they rose outspent,\nAnd staggering from their benches went\nThe sail napped quarrelling, and drank\nThe wind in broken gasps, and sank\nWith sullen pride upon the boards,\nAnd smote the mast and shook the cords\n\nDarkly loomed that alien land,\nAnd darkly lowered the Fian band,\nFor hovering on the shoreland grey\nThe ship they followed round the bay\nNor sought the sheltering woods until\nThe shadows folded o'er the hill\nFull heavily, and night fell blind,\nAnd laid its spell upon the wind\n\nThe swelling waters sank with sip\nAnd hollow gurgle round the ship,\nThe long mast rocked against the dim,\nSoft heaven above the headland's rim\n\nBut while the seamen crouched to sleep,\nConn sat alone in reverie deep,\nAnd saw before him in a maze\nThe mute procession of his days,\nIn gloom and glamour wending fast--\nHis heart a-hungering for the past--\nAgain he leapt, a tender boy,\nTo greet his sire with eager joy,\nWhen he came over the wide North Sea,\nEnriched with spoils of victory--\nThen heavily loomed that fateful morn\nWhen tidings of his fall were borne\nFrom Alban shore... Again he saw\nThe youth who went alone with awe\nTo swear the avenging oath before\nThe smoking altar red with gore.\n\nAh! strange to him it seemed to be\nThat hour was drawing nigh when he\nWould vengeance take... And still more strange,\nO sorrow! it would bring no change\nThough blood for blood be spilled, and life\nFor life be taken in fierce strife;\n'Twill ne'er recall the life long sped,\nOr break the silence of the dead.\n\nBut when he heard his mother's wail,\nOnce more uplifted on the gale,\nMoaning The Red who ne'er returned--\nHis cheeks with sudden passion burned;\nAnd darkly frowned that valiant man,\nAs through his quivering body ran\nThe lightnings of impelling ire\nAnd impulses of fierce desire,\nThat surged, with a consuming hate\nAgainst a world made desolate,\nUnceasing and unreconciled,\nAnd ever clamouring... like wild,\nDark-deeded waves that stun the shore,\nAnd through the anguished twilight roar\nThe hungry passions of the wide\nAnd gluttonous deep unsatisfied.\n\n\n\n\nII.\n\nThe shredding dawn in beauty spread\nIts shafts of splendour, golden-red,\nHigh over the eastern heaven, and broke\nThrough flaking clouds in silvern smoke\nThat burst aflame, and fold o'er fold,\nLet loose their oozing floods of gold,\nSplashed over the foamless deep that lay\nTremulous and clear. In fiery play\nThe rippling beams that swept between\nThe sea-cleft Sutor crags serene,\nBroke quivering where the waters bore\nThe soft reflection of the shore.\n\nThe pipes of morn were sounding shrill\nThrough budding woods on plain and hill,\nAnd stirred the air with song to wake\nThe sweet-toned birds within the brake.\n\nThe Fians from their sheilings came,\nWith offerings to the god a-flame,\nAnd round them thrice they sun-wise went;\nThen naked-kneed in silence bent\nBeside the pillar stones...\n\n                             But now\nBrave Conn upon the ship's high prow\nHath raised his burnished blade on high,\nAnd calls on Woden and on Tigh\nWith boldness, to avenge the death\nOf his great sire... In one deep breath\nHe drains the hero's draught that burns\nWith valour of the gods; then turns\nHis long-sought foe to meet... Great Conn\nSweeps, stooping in a boat, alone.\nShoreward, with rapid blades and bright,\nThat shower the foam-rain pearly white,\nAnd rip the waters, bending lithe,\nIn hollowing swirls that hiss and writhe\nLike adders, ere they dart away\nBright-spotted with the flakes of spray.\n\nWhen, furrowing the sand, he drew\nHis boat the shallowing water through,\nA giant he in stature rose\nStraight as a mast before his foes,\nWith head thrown high, and shoulders wide\nAnd level, and set back with pride;\nHis bared and supple arms were long\nAs shapely oars: firm as a thong\nHis right hand grasped his gleaming blade,\nGold-hilted, and of keen bronze made\nIn leafen shape.\n\n                      With stately stride\nHe crossed the level sands and wide,\nThen on his shield the challenge gave--\nHis broad sword thund'ring like a wave--\nFor single combat.\n\n                      Red as gold\nHis locks upon his shoulders rolled;\nA brazen helmet on his head\nFlashed fire; his cheeks were white and red;\nAnd all the Fians watched with awe\nThat hero young with knotted jaw,\nWhose eyes, set deep, and blue and hard,\nSurveyed their ranks with cold regard;\nWhile his broad forehead, seamed with care,\nDrooped shadowily: his eyebrows fair\nWere sloping sideways o'er his eyes\nWith pondering o'er the mysteries.\n\nThe eyes of all the Fians sought\nHeroic Groll, whose face was wrought\nWith lines of deep, perplexing thought--\nFor gazing on the valiant Conn,\nHe mourned that his own youth was gone,\nWhen, strong and fierce and bold, he shed\nThe life-blood of the boastful Red,\nWhom none save he would meet. He heard\nThe challenge, and nor spake, nor stirred,\nNor feared; but now grown old, when hate\nAnd lust of glory satiate--\nHis heart took pride in Conn, and shared\nThe kinship of the brave.\n\n                          Who dared\nTo meet the Viking bold, if he\nThe succour of the band, should be\nFound faltering or in despair?\nUntil that day the Fians ne'er\nOf one man had such fear.\n\n                          Old Goll\nSat musing on a grassy knoll,\nThey deemed he shared their dread... Not so\nWise Finn, who spake forth firm and slow--\n\"Goll, son of Morna, peerless man,\nThe keen desire of every clan,\nFar-famed for many a valiant deed,\nStrong hero in the time of need.\nI vaunt not Conn... nor deem that thou\nDost falter, save with meekness, now--\nBut why shouldst thou not take the head\nOf this bold youth, as of The Red,\nHis sire, in other days?\"\n\n                          Goll spake--\n\"O noble Finn, for thy sweet sake\nMine arms I'd seize with ready hand,\nAlthough to answer thy command\nMy blood to its last drop were spilled--\nBy Crom! were all the Fians killed,\nMy sword would never fail to be\nA strong defence to succour thee.\"\n\nUpon his hard right arm with haste\nHis crooked and pointed shield he braced,\nHe clutched his sword in his left hand--\nWhile round that hero of the band\nThe Fian warriors pressed, and praised\nHis valour... Mute was Goll... They raised,\nSmiting their hands, the battle-cry,\nTo urge him on to victory.\n\nThe one-eyed Goll went forth alone,\nHis face was like a mountain stone,--\nCold, hard, and grey; his deep-drawn breath\nCame heavily, like a man nigh death--\nBut his firm mouth, with lips drawn thin,\nDeep sunken in his wrinkled skin,\nWas cunningly crooked; his hair was white,\nOn his bald forehead gleamed a bright\nAnd livid scar that Conn's great sire\nHad cloven when their swords struck fire--\nBurly and dauntless, full of might,\nOld Goll went humbly forth to fight\nWith arrogant Conn... It seemed The Red\nIn greater might was from the dead,\nRestored in his fierce son...\n\n                                A deep\nSwift silence fell, like sudden sleep,\nOn all the Fians waiting there\nIn sharp suspense and half despair...\nThe morn was still. A skylark hung\nIn mid-air flutt'ring, and sung\nA lullaby that grew more sweet\nAmid the stillness, in the heat\nAnd splendour of the sun: the lisp\nOf faint wind in the herbage crisp\nWent past them; and around the bare\nAnd foam-striped sand-banks gleaming fair,\nThe faintly-panting waves were cast\nBy the wan deep fatigued and vast.\n\nO great was Conn in that dread hour,\nAnd all the Fians feared his power,\nAnd watched, as in a darksome dream,\nThe warriors meet... They saw the gleam\nOf swift, up-lifted swords, and then\nA breathless moment came, as when\nThe lithe and living lightning's flash\nMakes pause, until the thunder's crash\nIs splintered through the air.\n\n                                Loud o'er\nThe blue sea and the shining shore\nBroke forth the crash of arms... The roll\nOf Conn's fierce blows that baffled Goll\nOn sword and shield resounding rang,\nWhile that old warrior stooped and sprang\nSideways, and swerved, or backward leapt,\nAs swiftly as the bronze blade swept\nAbove him and around... He swayed,\nStumbling, but rose... But, though his blade\nWas ever nimble to defend,\nThe Fians feared the fight would end\nIn victory for Conn.\n\n                   ... 'Twas like\nAs when an eagle swoops to strike,\nBut swerves with flutt'ring wings, as nigh\nIts head a javelin gleams... A cry\nThat banished fear of Conn's great blows\nFrom out the Fian ranks arose,\nAs, like a plumed reed in a gust,\nGoll suddenly stooped--a deadly thrust\nThat drew the first blood in the fray\nHe darting gave... With quick dismay\nThe valiant Conn drew back...\n\n                               Again\nHe leapt at Goll, but sought in vain\nTo blind him with his blows that fell\nLike snowflakes on a sullen well--\nFor Goll was calm, while great Conn raged,\nAs hour by hour the conflict waged;\nHe was a blast-defying tree--\nA crag that spurned a furious sea,\nAnd all the Fians with one mind\nSet firm their faith in Goll\n\n                             The wind\nRose like a startled bird from out\nThe heather at the huntsman's shout\nIn swift and blust'ring flight At noon\nThe sun rolled in a cloudy swoon\nDimly, and over the rolling deep\nGust followed gust with shadowy sweep;\nAnd waves that streamed their snowy locks\nWere tossing high against the rocks\nSeaward, while round the sands ebbed wide\nScrambled the fierce devouring tide\n\nO, Conn was like a hound at morn,\nThat springs upon an elk forlorn\nAmong the hills. He was a proud\nCascade that leaps a cliff with loud\nUnspending fall So fierce, so fair\nWas arrogant Conn, but Goll fought there\nKeen-eyed, with ready guard, at bay--\nHe was as a boar in that fierce fray.\n\nThe waves were humbled on the shore,\nAnd silent fell, amid the roar\nAnd crash of battle Mute and still\nThe Fians watched; while on the hill\nThe little elves came out and gazed,\nTo be amused and were amazed...\nThey saw upon the shrinking sands\nThe warriors with restless hands\nAnd busy blades, with shields that rose\nTo buffet the unceasing blows;\nThey saw before the rising flood\nThe flash of fire, the flash of blood;\nAnd watched the men with panting breath,\nStriving to be the slaves of death;\nNow darting wide, now swerving round,\nNow clashed together in a bound,\nWith splitting swords that smote so fast,\nAs hour by hour unheeded past.\n\nThe sands were torn and tossed like spray\nBefore the whirlwind of the fray,\nThat waged in fury till the sun\nSank, and the day's last loops were spun--\nThen terrible was Goll... He rose\nA tempest of increasing blows,\nMore furious and fast, as dim,\nUncertain twilight fell... More grim\nAnd great he grew as, looming large,\nHe fought, and pressing to the marge\nOf ocean, he o'erpowered and drave\nThe Viking hero back; till wave\nO'er ready wave that hurried fleet,\nSnuffled and snarled about their feet...\n\nThen with a mighty shout that made\nThe rocks around him ring, his blade\nSwept like a flash of fire to smite\nThe last fell blow in that fierce fight--\nSo great Conn perished like The Red\nBy Goll's left hand... his life-blood spread\nOver the quenching sands where rolled\nHis head entwined with locks of gold.\nThen passed like thunder o'er the sea\nThe Fian shout of victory.\nAnd, trembling on the tossing ships,\nThe Vikings heard, with voiceless lips\nAnd dim, despairing eyes... Alone\nStood Goll, and like a silent stone\nBulking upon a ben-side bare,\nHe bent above the hero fair--\nRemembering the mighty Red,\nAnd wondering that Conn lay dead.\n\n\n[Footnote 1: May Day.]\n\n[Footnote 2: Traditional Holy Hill]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE SONG OF GOLL.\n\nO Son of The Red,\nUndone and laid dead--\n  The blood of a hero\nMy cold blade hath shed.\n\nWho fought me to-day?\nWho sought me to slay?--\n  The son of yon High King\nI slew in the fray.\n\nO blade that yon brave\nLow laid in the grave,\n  Ye gladdened the Fians\nBut grief to Conn gave.\n\nStone-hearted and strong,\nLone-hearted with long,\n  Dark brooding, he sought to\nAvenge his deep wrong.\n\nFair Son of The Red,\nCare none thou art dead?--\n  Old Goll of Clan Morna\nWill mourn thou hast bled.\n\nO where shall be found\nTo share with thee round\n  The halls of Valhalla\nThy glory renowned?\n\nO true as the blade\nThat slew thee, and made\n  My fear and thine anger\nFor ever to fade--\n\nAh! when upon earth\nAgain will have birth\n  A son of such honour\nAnd bravery and worth?\n\nAbove thee in splendour\nA love that could render\n  Brave service, burned star-like\nAnd constant and tender.\n\nWith fearing my name,\nWith hearing my fame,\n  O none would dare combat\nWith Goll till Conn came?...\n\nO great was thine ire--\nThe fate of thy sire,\n  Awaiting thy coming,\nConsumed thee like fire.\n\nO Son of The Red,\nUndone and laid dead--\n  The blood of a hero\nMy cold blade hath shed.\n\n\n\n\nTHE BLUE MEN OF THE MINCH.\n\n\nWhen the tide is at the turning and the wind is fast asleep,\nAnd not a wave is curling on the wide, blue Deep,\nO the waters will be churning on the stream that never smiles,\nWhere the Blue Men are splashing round the charmed isles.\n\nAs the summer wind goes droning o'er the sun-bright seas,\nAnd the Minch is all a-dazzle to the Hebrides;\nThey will skim along like salmon--you can see their shoulders gleam,\nAnd the flashing of their fingers in the Blue Men's Stream.\n\nBut when the blast is raving and the wild tide races,\nThe Blue Men ere breast-high with foam-grey faces;\nThey'll plunge along with fury while they sweep the spray behind,\nO, they'll bellow o'er the billows and wail upon the wind.\n\nAnd if my boat be storm-toss'd and beating for the bay,\nThey'll be howling and be growling as they drench it with their spray--\nFor they'd like to heel it over to their laughter when it lists,\nOr crack the keel between them, or stave it with their fists.\n\nO weary on the Blue Men, their anger and their wiles!\nThe whole day long, the whole night long, they're splashing round the isles;\nThey'll follow every fisher--ah! they'll haunt the fisher's dream--\nWhen billows toss, O who would cross the Blue Men's Stream?\n\n\n\n\nTHE URISK.\n\n\nO the night I met the Urisk on the wide, lone moor!\nAh! would I be forgetting of The Thing that came with me?\nFor it was big and black as black, and it was dour as dour,\nIt shrank and grew and had no shape of aught I e'er did see.\n\nFor it came creeping like a cloud that's moving all alone,\nWithout the sound of footsteps... and I heard its heavy sighs...\nIts face was old and grey, and like a lichen-covered stone,\nAnd its tangled locks were dropping o'er its sad and weary eyes.\n\nO it's never the word it had to say in anger or in woe--\nIt would not seek to harm me that had never done it wrong,\nAs fleet--O like the deer!--I went, or I went panting slow,\nThe waesome thing came with me on that lonely road and long.\n\nO eerie was the Urisk that convoy'd me o'er the moor!\nWhen I was all so helpless and my heart was full of fear,\nNor when it was beside me or behind me was I sure--\nI knew it would be following--I knew it would be near!\n\n\n\n\nTHE NIMBLE MEN.\n\n(AURORA BOREALIS.)\n\n\n    When Angus Ore, the wizard,\n      His fearsome wand will raise,\n    The night is filled with splendour,\n      And the north is all ablaze;\n    From clouds of raven blackness,\n      Like flames that leap on high--\nAll merrily dance the Nimble Men across the Northern Sky.\n\n    Now come the Merry Maidens,\n      All gowned in white and green,\n    While the bold and ruddy fellows\n      Will be flitting in between--\n    O to hear the fairy piper\n      Who will keep them tripping by!--\nThe men and maids who merrily dance across the Northern Sky.\n\n    O the weird and waesome music,\n      And the never-faltering feet!\n    O their fast and strong embraces,\n      And their kisses hot and sweet!\n    There's a lost and languished lover\n      With a fierce and jealous eye,\nAs merrily flit the Nimble Folk across the Northern Sky.\n\nSo now the dance is over,\n      And the dancers sink to rest--\n    There's a maid that has two lovers,\n      And there's one she loves the best;\n    He will cast him down before her,\n      She will raise him with a sigh--\nHer love so bright who danced to-night across the Northern Sky.\n\n    Then up will leap the other,\n      And up will leap his clan--\n    O the lover and his company\n      Will fight them man to man--\n    All shrieking from the conflict\n      The merry maidens fly--\nThere's a Battle Royal raging now across the Northern Sky.\n\n    Through all the hours of darkness\n      The fearsome fight will last;\n    They are leaping white with anger,\n      And the blows are falling fast--\n    And where the slain have tumbled\n      A pool of blood will lie--\nO it's dripping on the dark green stones from out the Northern Sky.\n\n    When yon lady seeks her lover\n      In the cold and pearly morn,\n    She will find that he has fallen\n      By the hand that she would scorn,--\n    She will clasp her arms about him,\n      And in her anguish die!--\nO never again will trip the twain across the Northern Sky.\n\n\n\n\nMY GUNNA.\n\n\nWhen my kine are on the hill,\nWho will charm them from all ill?\nWhile I'll sleep at ease until\n  All the cocks are crowing clear.\nWho'll be herding them for me?\nIt's the elf I fain would see--\nFor they're safe as safe can be\n  When the Gunna will be near.\n\nHe will watch the long weird night,\nWhen the stars will shake with fright,\nOr the ghostly moon leaps bright\n  O'er the ben like Beltane fire.\nIf my kine would seek the corn,\nHe will turn them by the horn--\nAnd I'll find them all at morn\n  Lowing sweet beside the byre.\n\nCroumba's bard has second-sight,\nAnd he'll moan the Gunna's plight,\nWhen the frosts are flickering white,\n  And the kine are housed till day;\nFor he'll see him perched alone\nOn a chilly old grey stone,\nNibbling, nibbling at a bone\n  That we'll maybe throw away.\n\nHe's so hungry, he's so thin,\nIf he'd come we'd let him in,\nFor a rag of fox's skin\n  Is the only thing he'll wear.\nHe'll be chittering in the cold\nAs he hovers round the fold,\nWith his locks of glimmering gold\n  Twined about his shoulders bare.\n\n\n\n\nTHE GRUAGACH.\n\n(MILKMAID'S SONG.)\n\n\nThe lightsome lad wi' yellow hair,\nThe elfin lad that is so fair,\nHe comes in rich and braw attire--\nTo loose the kine within the byre--\n\n    My lightsome lad, my leering lad,\n      He's tittering here; he's tittering there--\n    I'll hear him plain, but seek in vain\n      To find my lad wi' yellow hair.\n\nHe's dressed so fine, he's dressed so grand,\nA supple switch is in his hand;\nI've seen while I a-milking sat\nThe shadow of his beaver hat.\n\n    My lightsome lad, my leering lad,\n      He's tittering here; he's tittering there--\n    I'll hear him plain, but seek in vain\n      To find my lad wi' yellow hair.\n\nMy chuckling lad, so full o' fun,\nAround the corners he will run;\nBehind the door he'll sometimes jink,\nAnd blow to make my candle blink.\n\n    My lightsome lad, my leering lad,\n      He's tittering here; he's tittering there--\n    I'll hear him plain, but seek in vain\n      To find my lad wi' yellow hair.\n\nThe elfin lad that is so braw,\nHe'll sometimes hide among the straw;\nHe's sometimes leering from the loft--\nHe's tittering low and tripping soft.\n\n    My lightsome lad, my leering lad,\n      He's tittering here; he's tittering there--\n    I'll hear him plain, but seek in vain\n      To find my lad wi' yellow hair.\n\nAnd every time I'll milk the kine\nHe'll have his share--the luck be mine!\nI'll pour it in yon hollowed stone,\nHe'll sup it when he's all alone--\n\n    My lightsome lad, my leering lad,\n      He's tittering here; he's tittering there--\n    I'll hear him plain, but seek in vain\n      To find my lad wi' yellow hair.\n\nO me! if I'd his milk forget,\nNor cream, nor butter I would get;\nYe needna' tell--I ken full well--\nOn all my kine he'd cast his spell.\n\n    My lightsome lad, my leering lad,\n      He's tittering here; he's tittering there--\n    I'll hear him plain, but seek in vain\n      To find my lad wi' yellow hair.\n\nOn nights when I would rest at ease,\nThe merry lad begins to tease;\nHe'll loose the kine to take me out,\nAnd titter while I move about.\n\n    My lightsome lad, my leering lad,\n      He's tittering here; he's tittering there--\n    I'll hear him plain, but seek in vain\n      To find my lad wi' yellow hair.\n\n\n\n\nTHE LITTLE OLD MAN OF THE BARN.\n\n\nWhen all the big lads will be hunting the deer,\nAnd no one for helping Old Callum comes near,\nO who will be busy at threshing his corn?\nWho will come in the night and be going at morn?\n\n    The Little Old Man of the Barn,\n    Yon Little Old Man--\n    A bodach forlorn will be threshing his corn,\n    The Little Old Man of the Barn.\n\nWhen the peat will turn grey and the shadows fall deep,\nAnd weary Old Callum is snoring asleep;\nWhen yon plant by the door will keep fairies away,\nAnd the horse-shoe sets witches a-wandering till day.\n\n    The Little Old Man of the Barn,\n    Yon Little Old Man--\n    Will thresh with no light in the mouth of the night,\n    The Little Old Man of the Barn.\n\nFor the bodach is strong though his hair is so grey,\nHe will never be weary when he goes away--\nThe bodach is wise--he's so wise, he's so dear--\nWhen the lads are all gone, he will ever be near.\n\n    The Little Old Man of the Barn,\n    Yon Little Old Man--\n    So tight and so braw he will bundle the straw--\n    The Little Old Man of the Barn.\n\n\n\n\nYON FAIRY DOG.\n\n\n'Twas bold MacCodrum of the Seals,\n  Whose heart would never fail,\nWould hear yon fairy ban-dog fierce\n  Come howling down the gale;\nThe patt'ring of the paws would sound\nLike horse's hoofs on frozen ground,\nWhile o'er its back and curling round\n  Uprose its fearsome tail.\n\n'Twas bold MacCodrum of the Seals--\n  Yon man that hath no fears--\nBeheld the dog with dark-green back\n  That bends not when it rears;\nIts sides were blacker than the night,\nBut underneath the hair was white;\nIts paws were yellow, its eyes were bright,\n  And blood-red were its ears.\n\n'Twas bold MacCodrum of the Seals--\n  The man who naught will dread--\nWould wait it, stooping with his spear,\n  As nigh to him it sped;\nThe big black head it turn'd and toss'd,\n\"I'll strike,\" cried he, \"ere I'll be lost,\"\nFor every living thing that cross'd\n  Its path would tumble dead.\n\n'Twas bold MacCodrum of the Seals--\n  The man who ne'er took fright--\nWould watch it bounding from the hills\n  And o'er the moors in flight.\nWhen it would leave the Uist shore,\nAcross the Minch he heard it roar--\nLike yon black cloud it bounded o'er\n  The Coolin Hills that night.\n\n\n\n\nTHE WATER-HORSE.\n\n\nO the Water-Horse will come over the heath,\n  With the foaming mouth and the flashing eyes,\nHe's black above and he's white beneath--\n  The hills are hearing the awesome cries;\nThe sand lies thick in his dripping hair,\nAnd his hoofs are twined with weeds and ware.\n\nAlas! for the man who would clutch the mane--\n  There's no spell to help and no charm to save!\nWho rides him will never return again,\n  Were he as strong, O were he as brave\nAs Fin-mac-Coul, of whom they'll tell--\nHe thrashed the devil and made him yell.\n\nHe'll gallop so fierce, he'll gallop so fast,\n  So high he'll rear, and so swift he'll bound--\nLike the lightning flash he'll go prancing past,\n  Like the thunder-roll will his hoofs resound--\nAnd the man perchance who sees and hears,\nHe would blind his eyes, he would close his ears.\n\nThe horse will bellow, the horse will snort,\n  And the gasping rider will pant for breath--\nLet the way be long, or the way be short,\n  It will have one end, and the end is death;\nIn yon black loch, from off the shore,\nThe horse will splash, and be seen no more.\n\n\n\n\nTHE CHANGELING.\n\n\nBy night they came and from my bed\n  They stole my babe, and left behind\nA thing I hate, a thing I dread--\n  A changeling who is old and blind;\nHe's moaning all the night and day\nFor those who took my babe away.\n\nMy little babe was sweet and fair,\n  He crooned to sleep upon my breast--\nBut O the burden I must bear!\n  This drinks all day and will not rest--\nMy little babe had hair so light--\nAnd his is growing dark as night.\n\nYon evil day when I would leave\n  My little babe the stook behind!--\nThe fairies coming home at eve\n  Upon an eddy of the wind,\nWould cast their eyes with envy deep\nUpon my heart's-love in his sleep.\n\nWhat holy woman will ye find\n  To weave a spell and work a charm?\nA holy woman, pure and kind,\n  Who'll keep my little babe from harm--\nWho'll make the evil changeling flee,\nAnd bring my sweet one back to me?\n\n\n\n\nMY FAIRY LOVER.\n\n\nMy fairy lover, my fairy lover,\n  My fair, my rare one, come back to me--\nAll night I'm sighing, for thee I'm crying,\n  I would be dying, my love, for thee.\n\nThine eyes were glowing like blue-bells blowing,\n  With dew-drops twinkling their silvery fires;\nThine heart was panting with love enchanting,\n  For mine was granting its fond desires.\n\n    My fairy lover, my fairy lover,\n      My fair, my rare one, come back to me--\n    All night I'm sighing, for thee I'm crying,\n      I would be dying, my love, for thee.\n\nThy brow had brightness and lily-whiteness,\n  Thy cheeks were clear as yon crimson sea;\nLike broom-buds gleaming, thy locks were streaming,\n  As I lay dreaming, my love, of thee.\n\n    My fairy lover, my fairy lover,\n      My fair, my rare one, come back to me--\n    All night I'm sighing, for thee I'm crying,\n      I would be dying, my love, for thee.\n\nThy lips that often with love would soften,\n  They beamed like blooms for the honey-bee;\nThy voice came ringing like some bird singing\n  When thou wert bringing thy gifts to me.\n\n    My fairy lover, my fairy lover,\n      My fair, my rare one, come back to me--\n    All night I'm sighing, for thee I'm crying,\n      I would be dying, my love, for thee.\n\nO thou'rt forgetting the hours we met in\n  The Vale of Tears at the even-tide,\nOr thou'd come near me to love and cheer me,\n  And whisper clearly, \"O be my bride!\"\n\n    My fairy lover, my fairy lover,\n      My fair, my rare one, come back to me--\n    All night I'm sighing, for thee I'm crying,\n      I would be dying, my love, for thee.\n\nWhat spell can bind thee? I search to find thee\n  Around the knoll that thy home would be--\nWhere thou did'st hover, my fairy lover,\n  The clods will cover and comfort me.\n\n    My fairy lover, my fairy lover,\n      My fair, my rare one, come back to me--\n    All night I'm sighing, on thee I'm crying,\n      I would be dying, my love, for thee.\n\n\n\n\nTHE FIANS OF KNOCKFARREL.\n\n(A Ross-shire Legend.)\n\n\nI.\n\nOn steep Knockfarrel had the Fians made,\nFor safe retreat, a high and strong stockade\nAround their dwellings. And when winter fell\nAnd o'er Strathpeffer laid its barren spell--\nWhen days were bleak with storm, and nights were drear\nAnd dark and lonesome, well they loved to hear\nThe songs of Ossian, peerless and sublime--\nTheir blind, grey bard, grown old before his time,\nLamenting for his son--the young, the brave\nOscar, who fell beside the western wave\nIn Gavra's bloody and unequal fight.\n\nRound Ossian would they gather in the night,\nBeseeching him for song... And when he took\nHis clarsach, from the magic strings he shook\nA maze of trembling music, falling sweet\nAs mossy waters in the summer heat;\nAnd soft as fainting moor-winds when they leave\nThe fume of myrtle, on a dewy eve,\nBound flush'd and teeming tarns that all night hear\nLow elfin pipings in the woodlands near.\n\n'Twas thus he sang of love, and in a dream\nThe fair maids sighed to hear. But when his theme\nWas the long chase that Finn and all his men\nFollowed with lightsome heart from glen to glen--\nHis song was free as morn, and clear and loud\nAs skylarks carolling below a cloud\nIn sweet June weather... And they heard the fall\nOf mountain streams, the huntsman's windy call\nAcross the heaving hills, the baying hound\nAmong the rocks, while echoes answered round--\nThey heard, and shared the gladness of the chase.\n\nHe sang the glories of the Fian race,\nWhose fame is flashed through Alba far and wide--\nTheir valorous deeds he sang with joy and pride...\nWhen their dark foemen from the west came o'er\nThe ragged hills, and when on Croumba's shore\nThe Viking hordes descending, fought and fled--\nAnd when brave Conn, who would avenge the Red,\nBy one-eyed Goll was slain. Of Finn he sang,\nAnd Dermaid, while the clash of conflict rang\nIn billowy music through the heroes' hall--\nAnd many a Fian gave the battle-call\nWhen Ossian sang.\n\n                  Haggard and old, with slow\nAnd falt'ring steps, went Winter through the snow,\nAs if its dreary round would ne'er be done--\nThe last long winter of their days--begun\nEre yet the latest flush of falling leaves\nHad faded in the breath of chilling eves;\nNor ended in the days of longer light,\nWhen dawn and eve encroached upon the night--\nA weary time it was! The long Strath lay\nSnow-wreathed and pathless, and from day to day\nThe tempests raved across the low'ring skies,\nAnd they grew weak and pale, with hollow eyes,\nThe while their stores shrank low, waiting the dawn\nOf that sweet season when through woodlands wan\nFresh flowers flutter and the wild birds sing--\nFor Winter on the forelock of the Spring\nIts icy fingers laid. The huntsmen pined\nIn their dim dwellings, wearily confined,\nWhile the loud, hungry tempest held its sway--\nThe red-eyed wolves grew bold and came by day,\nAnd birds fell frozen in the snow.\n\n                                   Then through\nThe trackless Strath a balmy south wind blew\nTo usher lusty Spring. Lo! in a night\nThe snows 'gan shrinking upon plain and height,\nAnd morning broke in brightness to the sound\nOf falling waters, while a peace profound\nPossessed the world around them, and the blue\nBared heaven above... Then all the Fians knew\nThat Winter's spell was broken, and each one\nMade glad obeisance to the golden sun.\n\nThree days around Knockfarrel they pursued\nThe chase across the hills and through the wood,\nRound Ussie Loch and Dingwall's soundless shore;\nBut meagre were the burdens that they bore\nAt even to their dwellings. To the west\n\"But sorrow not,\" said Finn, when all dismay'd\nThey hastened on a drear and bootless quest--\nWith weary steps they turned to their stockade,\n\"To-morrow will we hunt towards the east\nTo high Dunskaith, and then make gladsome feast\nBy night when we return.\"\n\n                          Or ever morn\nHad broken, Finn arose, and on his horn\nBlew loud the huntsman's blast that round the ben\nWas echoed o'er and o'er... Then all his men\nGathered about him in the dusk, nor knew\nWhat dim forebodings filled his heart and drew\nHis brows in furrowed care. His eyes a-gleam\nStill stared upon the horrors of a dream\nOf evil omen that in vain he sought\nTo solve... His voice came faint from battling thought,\nAs he to Garry spake--\"Be thou the ward\nStrong son of Morna: who, like thee, can guard\nOur women from all peril!\"... Garry turned\nFrom Finn in sullen silence, for he yearned\nTo join the chase once more. In stature he\nWas least of all the tribe, but none could be\nMore fierce in conflict, fighting in the van,\nThan that grim, wolfish, and misshapen man!\n\nThen Finn to Caoilte spake, and gave command\nTo hasten forth before the Fian band--\nThe King of Scouts was he! And like the deer\nHe sped to find if foemen had come near--\nFierce, swarthy hillmen, waiting at the fords\nFor combat eager, or red Viking hordes\nFrom out the Northern isles... In Alba wide\nNo runner could keep pace by Caoilte's side,\nAnd ere the Fians, following in his path,\nHad wended from the deep and dusky strath,\nHe swept o'er Clyne, and heard the awesome owls\nThat hoot afar and near in woody Foulis,\nAnd he had reached the <DW72>s of fair Rosskeen\nEre Finn by Fyrish came.\n\n                         The dawn broke green--\nFor the high huntsman of the morn had flung\nHis mantle o'er his back: stooping, he strung\nHis silver bow; then rising, bright and bold,\nHe shot a burning arrow of pure gold\nThat rent the heart of Night.\n\n                              As far behind\nThe Fians followed, Caoilte, like the wind,\nSped on--yon son of Ronan--o'er the wide\nAnd marshy moor, and 'thwart the mountain side,--\nBy Delny's shore far-ebbed, and wan, and brown,\nAnd through the woods of beautous Balnagown:\nThe roaring streams he vaulted on his spear,\nAnd foaming torrents leapt, as he drew near\nThe sandy <DW72>s of Nigg.\n\n### Summary:"}

E. DROOD.\n\nAN ADAPTATION.\n\nBY ORPHEUS C. KERR.\n\nCHAPTER XXIV.\n\nMR. CLEWS AT HIS NOVEL.[1]\n\nThrown into Rembrandtish relief by the light of a garish kerosene lamp\nupon the table: with one discouraged lock of hair hanging over his nose,\nand straw hat pushed so far back from his phrenological brow that its\nvast rim had the fine artistic effect of a huge saintly nimbus: Mr.\nBUMSTEAD sat gynmastically crosswise in an easy-chair, over an arm of\nwhich his slender lower limbs limply dangled, and elaborately performed\none of the grander works of BACH upon an irritable accordion. Now,\nwinking with intense rapidity, and going through the muscular motions of\nan excitable person resolutely pulling out an obstinate and inexplicable\ndrawer from somewhere about his knees, he produced sustained and\nmournful notes, as of canine distress in the backyard; anon, with eyes\nnearly closed and the straw nimbus sliding still further back, his\nmanipulation was that of an excessively weary gentleman slowly\ncompressing a large sponge, thereby squeezing out certain choking,\nsnorting, guttural sounds, as of a class softly studying the German\nlanguage in another room; and, finally, with an impatient start from the\nunexpected slumber into which the last shaky _pianissimo_ had\nmomentarily betrayed him, he caught the untamed instrument in mid-air,\njust as it was treacherously getting away from him, frantically balanced\nit there for an instant on all his clutching finger-tips, and had it\nprisoner again for a renewal of the weird symphony.\n\nSeriously offended at the discovery that he could not drop asleep in his\nown room, for a minute, without the music stopping and the accordion\ntrying to slip off, the Ritualistic organist was not at all softened in\ntemper by almost simultaneously realizing that the farther skirt of his\nlong linen coat was standing out nearly straight from his person, and,\napparently, fluttering in a heavy draught.\n\n\"Who's-been-ope'nin'-th'-window?\" he sternly asked,\n\"What's-meaning-'f-such-a-gale-at thistime-'f-year?\"\n\n\"Do I intrude?\" inquired a voice close at hand.\n\nLooking very carefully along the still extended skirt of his coat\ntowards exactly the point of the compass from which the voice seemed to\ncome, Mr. BUMSTEAD at last awoke to the conviction that the tension of\nhis garment and its breezy agitation were caused by the tugging of a\nhuman figure.\n\n\"Do I intrude?\" repeated Mr. TRACEY CLEWS, dropping the skirt as he\nspoke. \"Have I presumed too greatly in coming to request the favor of a\nshort private interview?\"\n\nSlipping quickly into a more genteel but rather rigid position on his\nchair, the Ritualistic organist made an airy pass at him with the\naccordion.\n\n\"Any doors where youwasborn, sir?\"\n\n\"There were, Mr. BUMSTEAD.\"\n\n\"People ever knock when th' wanted t'-come-in, sir?\"\n\n\"Why, I did knock at your door,\" answered Mr. CLEWS, conciliatingly. \"I\nknocked and knocked, but you kept on playing; and after I finally took\nthe liberty to come in and pull you by the coat, it was ten minutes\nbefore you found it out.\"\n\nIn an attempt to look into the speaker's inmost soul, Mr. BUMSTEAD fell\ninto a doze, from which the crash of his accordion to the floor aroused\nhim in time to behold a very curious proceeding on the part of Mr.\nCLEWS. That gentleman successively peered up the chimney, through the\nwindows, and under the furniture of the room, and then stealthily took a\nseat near his rather languid observer.\n\n\"Mr. BUMSTEAD, you know me as a temporary boarder under the same roof\nwith you. Other people know me merely as a dead-beat. May I trust you\nwith a secret?\"\n\nA pair of blurred and glassy eyes looked into his from under a huge\nstraw hat, and a husky question followed his:\n\n\"Did y' ever read WORDSWORTH'S poem-'f-th' Excursion, sir?\"\n\n\"Not that I remember.\"\n\n\"Then, sir,\" exclaimed the organist, with spasmodic animation--\"then's\nnot in your hicsperience to know howssleepy-I am-jus'-now.\"\n\n\"You had a nephew,\" said his subtle companion, raising his voice, and\nnot appearing to heed the last remark.\n\n\"An' 'numbrella,\" added Mr. BUMSTEAD, feebly.\n\n\"I say you had a nephew,\" reiterated the other, \"and that nephew\ndisappeared in a very mysterious manner. Now I'm a literary man--\"\n\n\"C'd tell that by y'r-headerhair,\" murmured the Ritualistic organist.\nLeft y'r wife yet, sir?\"\n\n\"I say I'm a literary man,\" persisted TRACEY CLEWS, sharply. \"I'm going\nto write a great American Novel, called 'The Amateur Detective,' founded\nupon the story of this very EDWIN DROOD, and have come to Bumsteadville\nto get all the particulars. I've picked up considerable from Gospeler\nSIMPSON, JOHN MCLAUGHLIN, and even the woman from the Mulberry street\nplace who came after you the other morning. But now I want to know\nsomething from you.--What has become of your nephew?\"\n\nHe put the question suddenly, and with a kind of suppressed leap at him\nwhom he addressed. Immeasurable was his surprise at the perfectly calm\nanswer--\n\n\"I can't r'member hicsactly, sir.\"\n\n\"Can't remember!--Can't remember what?\"\n\n\"Where-I-put't.\"\n\n\"_It?_\"\n\n\"Yes. Th' umbrella.\"\n\n\"What on earth are you talking about?\" exclaimed Mr. CLEWS, in a rage.\n\"--Come! Wake up!--What have umbrellas to do with this?\"\n\nRousing himself to something like temporary consciousness, Mr. BUMSTEAD\nslowly climbed to his feet, and, with a wild kind of swoop, came heavily\ndown with both hands upon the shoulders of his questioner.\n\n\"What now?\" asked that startled personage.\n\n\"You want t' know 'bout th' umbrella?\" said BUMSTEAD, with straw hat\namazingly awry, and linen coat a perfect map of creases.\n\n\"Yes!--You're crushing me!\" panted Mr. CLEWS.\n\n\"Th' umbrella!\" cried Mr. BUMSTEAD, suddenly withdrawing his hands and\nswaying before his visitor like a linen person on springs--\"This's what\nthere's 'bout 't: _Where th' umbrella is, there is Edwin also!_\"\n\nAstounded by, this bewildering confession, and fearful that the uncle of\nMr. DROOD would be back in his chair and asleep again if he gave him a\nchance, the excited inquisitor sprang from his chair, and slowly and\ncarefully backed the wildly glaring object of his solicitation until his\nshoulders and elbows were safely braced against the mantel-piece. Then,\nlike one inspired, he grasped a bottle of soda water from the table, and\nforced the reviving liquid down his staring patient's throat; as quickly\ntore off his straw hat, newly moistened the damp sponge in it at a\nneighboring washstand, and replaced both on the aching head; and,\nfinally, placed in one of his tremulous hands a few cloves from a saucer\non the mantel-shelf.\n\n\"You are better now? You can tell me more?\" he said, resting a moment\nfrom his violent exertions.\n\nWith the unsettled air of one coming out of a complicated dream, Mr.\nBUMSTEAD chewed the cloves musingly; then, after nodding excessively,\nwith a hideous smile upon his countenance, suddenly threw an arm about\nthe neck of his restorer and wept loudly upon his bosom.\n\n\"My fr'en',\" he wailed, in a damp voice, \"lemme confess to you. I'm a\nmis'able man, my fr'en'; perfectly mis'able. These cloves--these\ninsidious tropical spices--have been thebaneofmyexistence. On Chrishm's\nnight--_that_ Chrishm's night--I toogtoomany. Wha'scons'q'nce? I put m'\nnephew an' m' umbrella away somewhere, an've neverb'n able\nterremembersince!\"\n\nStill sustaining his weight, the author of \"The Amateur Detective\" at\nfirst seemed nonplussed; but quickly changed his expression to one of\nabrupt intelligence.\n\n\"I see, now; I begin to see,\" he answered, slowly, and almost in a\nwhisper. \"On the night of that Christmas dinner here, you were in a\nclove-trance, and made some secret disposition, (which you have not\nsince been able to remember,) of your umbrella--and nephew. Until very\nlately--until now, when you are nearly, but _not quite_, as much under\nthe influence of cloves again--you have had a vague general idea that\nsomebody else must have killed Mr. DROOD and stolen your umbrella. But\nnow, that you are partially in the same condition, physiologically and\npsychologically, as on the night of the disappearance, you have once\nmore a partial perception of what were the facts of the case. Am I\nright?\"\n\n\"That's it, sir. You're a ph'los'pher,\" murmured Mr. BUMSTEAD, trying to\nbrush from above his nose the pendent lock of hair, which he took for a\nfly.\n\n\"Very well, then,\" continued TRACEY CLEWS, his extraordinary head of\nhair fairly bristling with electrical animation: \"You've only to get\nyourself into _exactly the same_ clove-y condition as on the night of\nthe double disappearance, when you put your umbrella and nephew away\nsomewhere, and you'll remember all about it again. You have two distinct\nstates of existence, you see: a cloven one, and an uncloven one; and\nwhat you have done in one you are totally oblivious of in the other.\"\n\nSomething like an occult wink trembled for a moment in the right eye of\nMr. BUMSTEAD.\n\n\"Tha's ver' true,\" said he, thoughtfully. \"I've been 'blivious m'self,\nfrequently. Never c'd r'member wharIowed.\"\n\n\"The idea I've suggested to you for the solution of this mystery,\" went\non Mr. CLEWS, \"Is expressed by one of the greatest of English writers;\nwho, in his very last work, says; '--in some cases of drunkenness, and\nin others of animal magnetism, there are two states of consciousness\nwhich never clash, but each of which pursues its separate course as\nthough it were continuous instead of broken. Thus, if I hide my watch\nwhen I am drunk, I must be drunk again before I can remember where.'[2]\"\n\n\"I'm norradrink'n'man, sir,\" returned Mr. BUMSTEAD, drawing coldly back\nfrom him, and escaping a fall into the fireplace by a dexterous surge\ninto the nearest chair. \"Th' lemon tea which I take for my cold, or to\npr'vent the cloves from disagreeing with me, is norrintoxicating.\"\n\n\"Of course not,\" assented his subtle counsellor; \"but, in this country,\nat least, chronic inebriation, clove-eating, and even opium-taking, are\nstrikingly alike in their aspects, and the same rules may be safely\napplied to all. My advice to you is what I have given. Cause a table to\nbe spread in this room, exactly as it was for that memorable\nChristmas-dinner; sit down to it exactly as then, and at the same hour;\ngo through all the same processes as nearly as you can remember; and, by\nthe mere force of association, you will enact all the final performances\nwith your umbrella and your nephew.\"\n\nMr. BUMSTEAD'S arms were folded tightly across his manly breast, and the\nfine head with the straw hat upon it tilted heavily towards his bosom.\n\n\"I see't now,\" said he softly; \"bone han'le 'n ferule. I r'member\nthreshing'm with it. I can r'memb'r carry'ng--\" Here Mr. BUMSTEAD burst\ninto tears, and made a frenzied dash at the lock of hair which he again\nmistook for a fly.\n\n\"To sum up all,\" concluded Mr. TRACEY CLEWS, shaking him violently by\nthe shoulder, that he might remain awake long enough to hear it,--\"to\nsum up all, I am satisfied, from the familiar knowledge of this mystery\nI have already gained, that the end will have something to do with\nexercise in the Open Air! You'll have to go outdoors for something\nimportant. And now good night.\"\n\n\"Goornight, sir.\"\n\nRetiring softly to his own room, under the same roof, the author of \"The\nAmateur Detective\" smiled at himself before the mirror with marked\ncomplacency. \"You're a long-headed one, my dead-beat friend,\" he said,\narchly, \"and your great American Novel is likely to be a respectable\nsuccess.\"\n\nThere sounded a crash upon a floor, somewhere in the house, and he held\nhis breath to listen. It was the Ritualistic organist going to bed.\n\n(_To be Continued._)\n\n[Footnote 1: The few remaining chapters with which it is proposed to\nconclude this Adaptation of \"_The Mystery of Edwin Drood_,\" should not\nbe construed as involving presumptuous attempt to divine that full\nsolution of the latter which the pen of its lamented author was not\npermitted to reach. No further correspondence with the tenor of the\nunfinished English story is intended than the Adapter will endeavor to\njustify to his own conscience, and that of his reader, by at least one\nunmistakable foreshadowing circumstance of the original publication,\nwhich, strangely enough, has been wholly overlooked, thus far, by those\nspeculating upon the fate of the missing hero.]\n\n[Footnote 2: See Chapter III., _The Mystery of Edwin Drood._]\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAn Old Saw with a Modern Instance.\n\nThe Farthing Candle of New York journalism appears to be trying to find\nwhat political party he can best bully into offering the largest reward\nfor his conscientious support. As a looker on, PUNCHINELLO would suggest\nto the political parties, as applicable in this case, the following\nquotation from VIRGIL:\n\n----\"_timeo Dana-os et dona ferentes_.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSOME TRAITS OF THE CHINESE.\n\n[Illustration: 'O']\n\nOf all human races, next to the monkies, the Mongolians are the most\nimitative. They are only a little lower than the monkies in this\nrespect, and we have seen some trained ones that could successfully\ncompete with the Simians on their own ground.\n\nA Chinaman employed in the North Adams shoe factory, for instance, was\nasked to imitate exactly a boot of a particular style, which was shown\nto him. After a few trials, he imitated the boot so perfectly, that a\ncustomer who came in took him to be the fellow of it, and was not\nundeceived until he went to try him on. No wonder that the regular\nCrispins are jealous of a foreign cordwainer who can do this.\n\nIn the art of dress-making for ladies the Chinese display wonderful\nskill. Their taste and inventiveness in this branch are unrivalled even\nby the best French _modistes_. The _panier_ with which it pleases the\nladies of the period to protuberate their persons was of Chinese origin.\nIt was revealed in an opium dream to a celebrated male mantua-maker of\nPekin, who sold the idea to a Yankee-Notions man travelling in China for\na Paris house. The inventor was so chagrined at hearing afterwards of\nthe immense fortune realized from it by the man of the West, that he\ncommitted suicide by hanging himself on a willow-pattern plate.\n\nAlthough the Chinaman does not naturally possess an ear for music,\naccording to our standard, yet his imitative power enables him to adapt\nhimself very readily to the production of melody. One of the Coolies\nemployed in the great HERVEY wash-house at South Belleville, N.J., was\nobserved to watch with great interest an itinerant performer on the\naccordion. Shortly afterwards, catching up a sucking-pig by the tail and\nsnout, he manipulated it precisely as the player did the accordion,\nproducing--accordion to the testimony of several credible\nwitnesses,--strains quite as good as, if not worse than, those drawn out\nby that musician.\n\nAs soon as the 200,000 Chinamen ordered by Mynheer KOOPMAN-SCHOOP arrive\nin this country, a good business can be driven by Yankee toothpick\nmakers in supplying them with chopsticks. This word was originally\n\"stop-chick,\" being so called from the use occasionally made of it by\nChinamen for knocking down young poultry. It became corrupted, like\neverything that is good and pure, by contact with extreme civilization.\nAnybody who can make a shoe-peg or wooden toothpick can make a\nchopstick. It is to be hoped that the chopstick may ultimately be\nadopted here instead of the knife and fork. It would preclude the\npossibility of people carrying their food into their mouths with the\nknife--an outrage so commonly to be remarked at hotel tables.\n\nA very intelligent Chinaman told the writer, not long since, that there\nis absolutely nothing to be seen or heard of in this country that the\nChinese were not familiar with several thousand years ago. Among them he\nenumerated target-companies, sewing-machines, patent baby-jumpers,\nnitro-glycerine, shoo-fly chewing-tobacco, wooden hams, stuffed\nballot-boxes, and a hundred other things which we are prone to brag of\nas being purely Yankee and original. We are too conceited about\nourselves, by a great deal, and it is good for us that even Chinese\nshoemakers should come here once in a while, to \"take us out of our\nboots.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA Midnight Reflection.\n\nThe man who commits suicide may be said to show his contempt for the\nhollowness of the world by putting his foot in it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n[Illustration: _Gentleman, (reading.)_ \"THE MILITARY AUTHORITIES OF\nPARIS HAVE CUT DOWN AND UTTERLY DESTROYED THE BOIS DE BOULOGNE.\"\n\n_Old Lady._ \"POOR BOYS!--AND TO THINK WHAT THEIR DEAR MOTHERS MUST\nSUFFER!\"]\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNAPOLEON'S CORRESPONDENCE.\n\nThe following letters were yesterday discovered among the private papers\nof the late Emperor--L.N.

Once it was called the French theatre, and was devoted to the\nwitty comedies of SCRIBE, and the luxurious legs of OFFENBACH. But a woe\nhas been denounced against the SCRIBES and OFFENBACHS--(there is\nconsiderable difference between the latter and the Pharisees)--of that\nonce gay theatre. Like many other French frivolities, it has lately\nyielded to Teutonic tragedy. The cold and calculating German\n\"MEPHISTOPHELES\" treads the stage where once tripped the light feet of\nParisian beauty. The burlesque Germans of the Grand Duchy of Gerolstein\nhave vanished before the grim and earnest countrymen of grand and simple\nold King WILLIAM. It will be long before the French players find heart\nto burlesque anew the German soldiery. It will be some time, let us\nhope, before the German players at the Fourteenth Street theatre give\nway to the shameless antics of French Opera-Bouffe buffoons.\n\nPUNCHINELLO gives a glad farewell--with no thought of saying _au\nrevoir_--to the French follies that have given the French theatre so\nunenviable a reputation; and he waves his pointed hat in joyful welcome\nto SEEBACH and her German friends who have made the Fourteenth Street\ntheatre a temple of the classic drama. Like other places which can\nproperly be called dramatic temples, the theatre now partakes of the\nsolemnity of a religious temple. One goes to see SEEBACH, not to laugh,\nbut to test one's ability to suppress the desire to weep over the woes\nof MARGARET, and to mourn with MARY STUART. Fortify yourself, O reader,\nwith a substantial dinner and much previous sleep, and come with me for\na night of German tragedy. Come to the Fourteenth Street theatre, not to\nlook back regretfully at departed opera-bouffe, but to SEEBACH. It is\nwith such reckless puns as the foregoing, that I endeavor to brace your\nspirits for the exhausting struggle with six hours of tragedy played in\nthe most tragic and awful of modern languages. You are to hear _Faust_\nin German. No man who has accomplished this feat can wonder at the\nstolid bravery of the German infantry. It is said that the new recruit\nis forced to hear _Faust_ once a week during his first year of service.\nThis terrible discipline has the natural effect of giving him that\nsteadiness under fire, at which the world marvels. He will stand with\nhis regiment for hours under the merciless fire of the mitrailleuse with\nno thought of flight. What terrors can shot or shell have for him who\nhas been taught to listen unmoved to the dialogue of \"FAUST\" and\n\"MEPHISTOPHELES\" in the first thirty-two acts of _Faust_?\n\nWe find the theatre full of Germans, wearing that grave and earnest\nexpression of countenance wherewith the German takes his legitimate\ntragedy. Sprinkled among the Germans are several Americans, more grave\nand more in earnest than even their Teutonic neighbors, for they are\nstraining their attention to detect a familiar German word--such as\n\"Mein Herr,\" or \"Ach.\" When once they have heard the expected syllables,\nthey smile a placid smile of contentment, and remark, one to another, \"I\ncan understand pretty nearly everything that is said,--with the\nexception, of course, of an occasional word.\"\n\nWe take our seats and wait for the entrance of SEEBACH. The curtain\nrises upon \"FAUST\" pursuing his studies in middle-age, respectability,\nand a dressing-gown. To him, after hours of soliloquy, enters\n\"MEPHISTOPHELES.\" We observe, with surprise, that those estimable\ngentlemen, Col. THOMAS W. KNOX and Hon. ERASTUS BROOKS, have been\nengaged to play \"FAUST\" and \"MEPHISTOPHELES\" respectively, To be sure\nthe programme informs us that these parts are taken by two newly\nimported German actors, but we prefer the evidence of our senses to the\nassertions of the programme. Have KNOX and BROOKS been copied in German?\nIf not, they are now playing in Fourteenth Street. Don't tell me that it\nis merely an accidental resemblance. Haven't I played billiards with the\ngallant COLONEL, and gone to sleep when the Honorable EDITOR was\nspeaking in Congress? And shall I now be told that I don't know them\nwhen I see them? But this is irrelevant.\n\nHours of dialogue succeed to the previous hours of soliloquy. At\nintervals of fifteen minutes the curtain is dropped to enable the actors\nto discuss mugs of beer and the audience to discuss the actors. During\nthese intervals we hear such remarks as these:\n\n1ST GERMAN. \"Subjectively considered, _Faust_ is a tragedy. Objectively,\nwe might regard it as a comedy. To the subjective-objective view, it is\ncertainly a ballet pantomime. Ach! he was many-sided, our GOETHE. Here\nin this drama he has accomplished everything. There is food for our\nlaughter and our tears. It excites us and calms us.\"\n\n1ST AMERICAN. \"I should think it did calm us. That's why the old fellow\nwent to sleep and snored all through the last twelve acts. I think it's\nthe heaviest and stupidest play that was ever put on the stage. Of\ncourse it's the greatest thing ever written, but then I prefer DALY'S\n_Gaslight_, myself.\"\n\n2ND GERMAN. \"Ah, my friend, how this sublime creation stirs the inner\ndepths of our spiritual natures. Ach, Himmel! it is the poem of\nHumanity. Let us go out for beer.\"\n\n2D AMERICAN. \"When are we going to see SEEBACH?\"\n\nUSHER. \"She don't appear until the twenty-third act, sir. That will be\non about three hours from now.\"\n\n2D AMERICAN. \"Come, TOM, let's go and have supper. I am getting\nexhausted.\"\n\nUSHER. \"Step this way, sir. Mr. GRAU has some refreshments at your\nservice.\"\n\nAnd they go in search of the cold ham and beer which the beneficent GRAU\nhas kindly provided. Refreshed by much beer, and enlivened by the cheery\ninfluence of the genial sandwich, they return for a few more hours of\nsoliloquy and dialogue.\n\nTime passes slowly, but surely. At last we reach an act in which SEEBACH\nwalks quietly across the stage. The curtain instantly drops amid the\nsobs of the excited audience.\n\n1ST GERMAN. \"Lend me your handkerchief, my friend, that I may wipe away\nmy tears. I have a sausage wrapped up in mine, but what are sausages\ncompared with art! How divinely SEEBACH walks. To me, she seems like an\nincarnation of Pure Reason, an Avatar of the spirit of transcendental\nphilosophy. Come, we will pledge her in beer.\"\n\n1ST AMERICAN. \"What are they making all that row about--just because\nSEEBACH walked across the stage? Why, she never said a word.\"\n\n2D AMERICAN. \"Let's go round to the hotel and take a quiet sleep till\nshe comes on again. I've got my night-clothes with me. Always bring 'em\nwhen I go to see German tragedy.\"\n\nThen ensue other hours of dialogue, interspersed with soliloquies of\nhalf an hour each. Interspersed also with perpetual dropping of the\ncurtain, whereby the play is made to last some eight or ten hours longer\nthan would otherwise be the case. Most of the German music that has been\nwritten during the last three centuries is played by the orchestra\nduring these intermissions. But in course of time SEEBACH gives us the\nGarden scene, winning our frantic admiration by her inimitable\ntenderness and grace, and finally we reach that grandest scene ever\nwritten by dramatist, that most pathetic poem ever conceived by\npoet--the meeting of \"FAUST\" and \"MARGARET\" in prison. At last we are\nmore than repaid for the dreary hours that have gone before. We have\nseen SEEBACH'S \"MARGARET\"--the most powerful, the most pathetic, the\nmost beautiful, the most perfect creation of the stage.\n\nAnd as we pass slowly up the tortuous, steep stairways of the theatre,\nwhile the Germans, all talking at once, burden the air with\nunintelligible gutturals, you say to me--if you are the intelligent\nperson that you ought to be--\"SEEBACH is the greatest actress of this\ncentury--greater than RISTORI, subtler and more tender than RACHEL.\"\n\nWith which opinion the undersigned concurs with all the emphasis of\nconviction; and over our late breakfast, to which we immediately sit\ndown, we discuss the question, Which is the greatest--the poet who drew\n\"MARGARET,\" or the actress who made the poet's picture warm with\npassionate life?\n\nMATADOR.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAbsolutely True.\n\nFor the last fifty years or so the metaphysical thinkers of Germany have\nbeen engaged in seeking for the Absolute. From present indications it\nwould seem as though they are about to find it--where perhaps they least\nexpected it--in the imperial reign of King WILLIAM, aided and abetted by\nCount VON BISMARCK.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"THE RIGHT PARTY.\"\n\nA few days ago PUNCHINELLO officially announced his adhesion to the\nRight Party.\n\nPUNCHINELLO hadn't the slightest idea which party was the right one, but\nthought that, as some party must be right, he could not go very for\nwrong. But mark the _denouement_. Every party imagines itself the right\nparty, and welcomes him joyfully to its bosom. Republicans love him,\nIndependents worship him, while Democrats would endure even the\nFifteenth Amendment for his sake. In order to reciprocate their\nsentiments Mr. P. would have to resolve himself into a kind of\nDemo-Independent-Republican, which he has no idea of doing. Here's what\nsome of the \"organs\" say of him:\n\n_The Sun_.\n\n\"We hail with joy the accession of PUNCHINELLO to the ranks of\nindependent journalism as embodied in the _Sun_, with a circulation of\nover 100,000, CHAS. B. DANA Editor, price two cents. Reinforced by this\npowerful journal, we shall continue with renewed vigor to demand of\nHORACE GREELEY his reasons why J.C. BANCROFT DAVIS should not be removed\nfrom the Assistant Secretaryship of State. We shall persevere in our\nattempts to make Gen. GRANT understand that to move four and a half\ninches from the White House is an infraction of the Constitution.\nRegardless of the tears of the thousands of advertisers who carry their\nannouncements to our office, we shall devote our entire space to the\nvilifying of BORIE, FISH, the _Disreputable Times and False Reporting\nTribune_. Those elaborate attacks upon moral corruption and the Erie\nRing, for which we have become famous, will remain specialties with us.\nAll this by PUNCHINELLO'S aid. Bully for PUNCHINELLO.\"\n\n_The Tribune_.\n\n\"The moral influence of this paper, which retains the only correspondent\nat the seat of war, and whose dispatches, procured at a cost of over\n$2,000,000, are copied by the _Herald_, _Sun_ and _World_,--(and whoever\ndenies it lies damnably, with intent to malign, etc.,)--the moral\ninfluence of this paper is rapidly extending itself throughout the\ncountry. As a late instance, we note that PUNCHINELLO has given in its\nadhesion to the only true and pure republican agricultural party, which\nit appropriately names the \"Right Party.\" PUNCHINELLO was once a\nfrivolous, good-for-nothing sheet, devoted to low jokes and witticisms.\nThe conversion of its editor to the temperance cause is the reason of\nthe recent change in its tenets. We bid it God speed.\"\n\n_The World_.\n\n\"As the irrefutable and all-enduring truths of Democracy receive\nexemplification in contemporaneous events, the reflecting and refined\nmasses of this city purchase the _World_ in preference to that decrepit\nand fast decaying sheet, the _Herald_. PUNCHINELLO, recognizing with\nethereal foresight the exigencies of the situation, proclaims itself for\nthe \"Right Party\"--our party. We welcome with acclamation this valuable\naddition to the Democratic ranks.\"\n\n_The Star_.\n\n\"PUNCHINELLO has joined the Right Party, by which he obviously means the\n_Star_, whose circulation last Sunday exceeded 375,005 copies.\n\n\"But this has nothing to do with the domestic policy of the Peruvians,\nas expounded by the first CAESAR.\n\n\"PUNCHINELLO will prove a pillar of strength to Tammany Hall, unless the\nsiege of Paris should prove disastrous to the consumption of lager-bier,\nas set forth in 'Boiled for her Bones' and other tales by the best\nauthors.\"\n\nBut Personals, my dear _Star_, Personals are the things that pay. If\nthus, why not? As thus:\n\n\"EDITOR OF PUNCHINELLO. The Editor of PUNCHINELLO has an income of about\n$500,000. He usually dines at the Hoffman House when out of State's\nPrison. He owns some fine lots somewhere underneath the East River,\nbesides a brown stone front in Alaska.\"\n\n\"PUBLISHER OF PUNCHINELLO. This gentleman's income does not exceed\n$350,000 per annum. He expends it principally in beautifying his\ndelightful summer residence in Mackerelville. It has been his misfortune\nto pass many years of his life in a lunatic asylum, the unhappy result\nof organizing plans for American Comic Papers. All is joy and peace with\nhim now, however; he looks hopefully forward to the time when\nPUNCHINELLO shall have attained to his legitimate rank of the Foremost\nJournal in the Nation. Meanwhile he lunches daily at a leading\nrestaurant on thirteen oysters, (a dozen and one over) with vinegar,\npepper and a bottle of Bass.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"ONE MORE UNFORTUNATE.\"\n\nMR. PUNCHINELLO: I fancy myself a victim of imposition, and I wish to\nplace my case before you. Having, for a period of six months, \"honorably\nand persistently,\" (to use the language of my friends,) held the office\nof third Deputy-Assistant Register of Caramels, in and for the city and\ncounty of New York, my associates in office and my friends in general\nhave determined to present me with a testimonial of their distinguished\nregards. Accordingly, they have ordered a massive and handsomely\nengraved pair of silver tongs, and a splendid silver fire-shovel. This\nis all very well, so far, but the committee informed me yesterday that\nthe shovel and tongs would cost four hundred and twenty-five dollars,\nand that, as only eight dollars and a half had been collected, it was\nconsidered highly important that I should immediately hand over the\nbalance of the price, in order that the presentation and banquet, (to\ntake place at my house on next Saturday evening,) might not be\npostponed, to the great disappointment of my associates in office and my\nfriends in general.\n\nNow, Mr. PUNCHINELLO, is not this a little hard on me? I know very well\nthat it is customary for the recipients of testimonials to pay\nthree-quarters of the cost of the present, and I am perfectly willing to\nabide by this custom; but forty-nine fiftieths is, I think, rather too\nheavy, especially as my house is heated by a furnace in the cellar and I\nhave no use for a shovel and tongs--particularly silver ones.\n\nYours perturbedly, A.

E. DROOD,\n\nAN ADAPTATION.\n\nBY ORPHEUS C. KERR\n\nCHAPTER XXVI.\n\nFOR BETTER, FOR WORSE.\n\nMiss CARROWTHERS having gone out with Mrs. SKAMMERHORN to skirmish with\nthe world of dry-goods clerks for one of those alarming sacrifices in\nfeminine apparel which woman unselfishly, yet never needlessly, is\nalways making, FLORA sat alone in her new home, working the latest\nbeaded pin-cushion of her useful life. Frequently experiencing the truth\nof the adage, that as you sew so shall you rip, the fair young thing was\npassing half her valuable time in ripping out the mistaken stitches she\nhad made in the other half; and the severe moral discipline thus\nendured, made her mad, as equivalent vexation would have made a man the\nreverse of that word. Flippant social satirists cannot dwell with\nsufficient sarcasm upon the difference between the invincible amiability\naffected by artless girls in society and their occasional bitterness of\naspect in the privacy of home; never stopping to reflect that there are\nsore private trials for these industrious young crochet creatures in\nwhich the thread of the most equable female existence is necessarily\nworsted. Miss POTTS, then, although looking up from her trying worsted\noccupation at the servant who entered with a rather snappish expression\nof countenance, was guilty of no particularly hypocritical assumption in\nat once suffering her features to relax into a sweetly pensive smile\nupon learning that there was a gentleman to see her in the parlor.\n\n\"'MONTGOMERY PENDRAGON,'\" she softly read from the card presented. \"Is\nhe alone, BRIDGET, dear?\"\n\n\"Sorra any wan with him but his cane, Miss; and that he axed me wud I\nsthand it behind the dure for him.\"\n\nThere was a look of desperate purpose about this. When a sentimental\nyoung man seeks a private interview with a marriageable young woman, and\nrecklessly refuses at the outset to retain at least his cane for the\nsolution of the intricate conversational problem of what to do with his\nhands, it is an infallible sign that some madly rash intention has\ntemporarily overpowered his usual sheepish imbecility, and that he may\nbe expected to speak and act with almost human intelligence.\n\nWith hand instinctively pressed upon her heart, to moderate its too\nsanguine pulsations and show the delicate lace around her cuffs, FLORA\nshyly entered the parlor, and surprised Mr. PENDRAGON striding up and\ndown the apartment like one of the more comic of the tragic actors of\nthe day.\n\n\"Miss POTTS!\" ejaculated the wild young Southern pedestrian, pausing\nsuddenly at her approach, with considerable excitement of manner, \"scorn\nme, spurn me, if you will; but do not let sectional embitterment blind\nyou to the fact that I am here by the request of Mr. DIBBLE.\"\n\n\"I wasn't scorning and spurning anybody,\" explained the startled orphan,\ncoyly accepting the chair he pushed forward. \"I'm sure I don't feel any\nsectional hatred, nor any other ridiculous thing.\"\n\n\"Forgive me!\" pleaded MONTGOMERY. \"I reckon I'm a heap too sensitive\nabout my Southern birth; but only think, Miss POTTS, what I've had to go\nthrough since I've been amongst you Yankees! Fancy what it is to be\nsuspected of a murder, and have no political influence.\"\n\n\"It must be _so_ absurd!\" murmured FLORA.\n\n\"I've felt wretched enough about it to become a contributor to the\nfirst-class American comic paper on the next floor below me,\" he\ncontinued, gloomily. \"And here, to-day, without any explanation, your\nguardian desires me to come here and wait for him.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry that's such a trial for you, Mr. PENDRAGON,\" simpered the\nFlowerpot. \"Perhaps you'd prefer to wait on the front stoop and appear\nas though you'd just come, you know?\"\n\n\"And can you think,\" cried the young man with increased agitation \"that\nit would be any trial for me to be in your society, if--? But tell me,\nMiss POTTS, has your guardian the right to dispose of your hand in\nmarriage?\"\n\n\"I suppose so,\" answered FLORA, with innocent surprise and a pretty\nblush; \"he has charge of _all_ my money matters, you know.\"\n\n\"Then it is as I feared,\" groaned her questioner, smiting his forehead.\n\"He is coming here to-day to tell you what man of opulence he wants you\nto have, and I am to be witness to my own hopelessness!\"\n\n\"What makes you think anything so ridiculous, you absurd thing?\" asked\nthe orphan, not unkindly.\n\n\"He as good as said so,\" sighed the unhappy Southerner. \"He told me,\nwith his own mouth, that he wanted to get you off his hands as soon as\npossible, and thought he saw his way clear to do it.\"\n\nThe girl knew what bitter, intolerable emotions were tearing the heart\nof the ill-fated secessionist before her, and, in her own gentle heart,\npitied him.\n\n\"He needn't be so sure about it,\" she said, with indignant spirit. \"I'll\nnever marry _any_ stranger, unless he's awful rich--oh, as rich as\nanything!\"\n\n\"Oh, Miss POTTS!\" roared MONTGOMERY, suddenly, folding-down upon one\nknee before her, and scratching his nose with a ring upon the hand he\nsought to kiss, \"why will you not bestow upon me the heart so generously\ndisdainful of everything except the most extreme wealth? Why waste your\nbest years in waiting for proposals from a class of Northern men who\noccasionally expect that their brides, also, shall have property, when\nhere I offer you the name and hand of a loving Southern gentleman, who\nonly needs the paying off of a few mortgages on his estate in the South\nto be beyond all immediate danger of starvation?\"\n\nTurning her pretty head aside, but unconsciously allowing him to retain\nher hand, she faintly asked how they were to live?\n\n\"Live!\" repeated the impetuous lover. \"On love, hash, mutual trust,\nbread pudding: anything that's cheap. I'll do the washing and ironing\nmyself.\"\n\n\"How perfectly ridiculous!\" said the orphan, bashfully turning her head\nstill further aside, and bringing one ear-ring to bear strongly upon\nhim. \"You'd never be able to do fluting and pinking in the world.\"\n\n\"I could do anything, with you by my side!\" he retorted, eagerly. Oh,\nMiss POTTS!--FLORA!--think how lonely I am. My sister, as on may have\nheard, has accepted Gospeler SIMPSON'S proposal, by mail, for her hand,\nand is already so busy quarrelling with his mother that she is no longer\nany company for me. My fate is in your hands; it is in woman's power to\neither make or marry the roan who loves her--\"\n\n\"Provided, always, that her legal guardian consents,\" interrupted the\nbenignant voice of Mr. DIBBLE, who, unperceived by them, had entered the\nroom in time to finish the sentence.\n\nSpringing alertly to an upright position, and coughing excessively, Mr.\nPENDRAGON was a shamefaced reproach to his whole sex, while the young\nlady used the edge of her right foot against a seam of the carpet with\nthat extreme solicitude as to the result which is always so entirely\ndeceiving to those who have hoped to see her show signs of painful\nembarrassment.\n\nAfter surveying them in thoughtful silence for a moment, the old lawyer\nbent over his ward, and hugged and kissed her with an unctuousness\njustified by his great age and extreme goodness. It was his fine old way\nof bestowing an inestimable blessing upon all the plump younger women of\nhis acquaintance, and the benediction was conferred on the slightest\npretexts, and impartially, up to a certain age.\n\n\"Am I to construe what I have seen and heard, my dear, as equivalent to\nthe conclusion of my guardianship?\" he asked, smilingly.\n\n\"Oh, please don't be so ridiculous--oh, I never was so exquisitely\nnervous,\" pleaded the helpless, fluttered young creature.\n\n\"I reckon I've betrayed your confidence, sir,\" said MONTGOMERY,\ndesperately; \"but you must have known, from hearsay at least, how I have\nfelt toward this young lady ever since our first meeting, and should not\nhave exposed me to a temptation stronger than I could bear. I have,\nindeed, done myself the honor to offer her the hand and heart if one\nwho, although but a poor gentleman, will be richer than kings if she\ndeigns to make him so.\"\n\n\"Why, how absurd!\" ejaculated the orphan, quickly. \"It's perfectly\nridiculous to call me well off: and how could I make you richer than\nkings and things, you know?\"\n\nThe old and the young men exchanged looks of unspeakable admiration at\nsuch touching artlessness.\n\n\"Sweet innocence!\" exclaimed her guardian, playfully pinching her cheek\nand privately surprised at its floury feeling. \"What would you say if I\ntold you that, since our shrewd EDDY retired from the contest, I have\nbeen wishing to see you and our Southern friend here brought to just\nsuch terms as you appear to have reached? What would you say if I added\nthat, such consummation seeming to be the best you or your friends could\ndo for yourself, I have determined to deal with you as a daughter, in\nthe matter of seeing to it that you begin your married life with a\ndaughter's portion from my own estate?\"\n\nBoth the young people had his hands in theirs, on either side of him, in\nan instant.\n\n\"There! there!\" continued the excellent old gentleman, \"don't try to\nexpress yourselves. FLORA, place one of your hands in the breast of my\ncoat, and draw out the parcel you find there. * * * That's it. The\narticle it contains once belonged to your mother, my dear, and has been\nreturned to me by the hands to which I once committed it in the hope\nthat they would present it to you. I loved your mother well, my child,\nbut had not enough property at the time to contend with your father.\nOpen the parcel in private, and be warned by its moral: Better is wilful\nwaist than woeful want of it.\"\n\nIt was the stay-lace by which Mrs. POTTS, from too great persistence in\ndrawing herself up proudly, had perished in her prime.\n\n\"Now come into the open air with me, and let us walk to Central Park,\"\ncontinued Mr. DIBBLE, shaking off his momentary fit of gloom, \"I have\nstrange things to tell you both. I have to teach you, in justice to a\nmuch-injured man, that we have, in our hearts, cruelly wronged that\nexcellent and devout Mr. BUMSTEAD, by suspecting him of a crime whereof\nhe is now proved innocent at least _I_ suspected him. To-morrow night we\nmust all be in Bumsteadville. I will tell you why as we walk.\"\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII.\n\nSOLUTION.\n\nIn the darkness of a night made opaque by approaching showers, a man\nstands under the low-drooping branches of the edge of a wood skirting\nthe cross-road leading down to Gospeler's Gulch.\n\n\"Not enough saved from the wreck even to buy the merciful rope that\nshould end all my humor and impecuniosity!\" he mutters, over his folded\narms and heaving chest. \"I have come to this out-of-the-way suburb to\nend my miserable days, and not so much as one clothes-line have I seen\nyet. There is the pond, however; I can jump into that, I suppose: but\nhow much more decent were it to make one's quietus under the merry\ngreenwood tree with a cord--\"\n\nHe stops suddenly, holding his breath; and, almost simultaneously with a\nsharp, rushing noise in the leaves overhead, something drops upon his\nshoulder. He grasps it, cautiously feels of it, and, to his unspeakable\namazement, discovers that it is a rope apparently fastened to the\nbranches above!\n\n\"Wonderful!\" he ejaculates, in an awe-stricken whisper. \"Providence\nhelps a wretch to die, if not to live. At any other time I should think\nthis very strange, but just now I've got but one thing to do. Here's my\nrope, here's my neck, and here goes!\"\n\nHeedless of everything but his dread intention, he rapidly ties the rope\nabout his throat, and is in the act of throwing forward his whole weight\nupon it, when there is a sharp jerk of the rope, he is drawn up about\nthree feet in the air, and, before he can collect his thoughts, is as\nabruptly let down upon his feet again. Simultaneously, a sound almost\nlike suppressed swearing comes very clearly to his ear, and he is\nconscious of something dimly white in the profound darkness, not far\naway.\n\n\"Sold again: signed, J. BUMSTEAD,\" exclaims a deep voice. \"I thought the\nrope was caught in a crotch; but 'twasn't. Try't once more.\"\n\nThe astounded hearer feels the rope tugging at his own neck again, and,\nwith a half comprehension of the situation, calls \"Stop!\" in a\nsuffocating voice.\n\n\"Who's there?\" comes from the darkness.\n\n\"JEREMY BENTHAM, late proprietor of first-class American Comic\nPaper.--Died of Comic Serial.--Want to hang myself,\" is the jerky reply\nfrom the other side.\n\n\"Got your own rope, sir?\"\n\n\"No. One fell down on my shoulders just as I was wishing for it; but it\nseems to be too elastic.\"\n\n\"That's the other end 'f _my_ rope, air,\" rejoins the second voice, as\nin wrath. \"I threw't over the branches and thought it had caught,\ninstead of that it let me down, sir.\"\n\n\"And drew me up,\" says Mr. BENTHAM.\n\nBefore another word can be spoken by either, the light of a dark-lantern\nis flashed upon them. There is Mr. BUMSTEAD, not three yards from Mr.\nBENTHAM; each with an end of the same rope about his neck, and the head\nof the former turbaned with a damp towel.\n\n\"Are ye men?\" exclaims the deep voice of Mr. MELANCTHON SCHENCK from\nbehind the lantern, \"and would ye madly incur death before having taken\nout life-policies in the Boreal?\"\n\n\"And would my uncle celebrate my return in this style?\" cried still\nanother voice from the darkness.\n\n\"Who's that spoke just then?\" cries the Ritualistic organist.\n\nThe answer comes like the note of a trumpet:--\n\n\"EDWIN DROOD!\"\n\nAt the same instant a great glare of light breaks upon the scene from a\nbonfire of tar-barrels, ignited at the higher end of the cross-road by\nyoung SMALLEY; and, to the mingled bewilderment and exasperation of Mr.\nBUMSTEAD, the radiance reveals, as in noonday, Mr. SCHENCK and his\nlong-lost nephew standing before him; and, coming towards them in\nfestive procession from Gospeler's Gulch. MONTGOMERY PENDRAGON with\nFLORA on his arm, the Reverend OCTAVIUS SIMPSON escorting MAGNOLIA, Mr.\nDIBBLE guarding Mrs. SIMPSON, Mr. CLEW'S arm in arm with JOHN\nMcLAUGHLIN. Father DEAN and Judge SWEENEY, Miss CAROWTHERS, and the\nSMYTHES.\n\n\"Trying to hang yourselves!\" exclaims Mr. DIBBLE, as the throng gathers\ncuriously around the two gentlemen of the rope.\n\n\"And my old friend BENTHAM, too!\" cries the Gospeler.\n\n\"How perfectly ridiculous!\" warbles FLORA.\n\nStaring majestically from one face to the other, and from thence towards\nthe illuminating bonfire, Mr. BUMSTEAD, quite unconscious of the\npicturesque effect of the towel on his head, deliberately draws an\nantique black bottle from his pocket, moistens his lips therewith,\npasses it to the Comic Paper man, and eats a clove.\n\n\"What is the meaning of this general intoxication?\" he then asks quite\nseverely. \"Why does this mass-meeting, greatly under the influence of\ninferior liquor as it plainly is, intrude thus upon the last hours of a\nRitualistic gentleman and a humorous publisher?\"\n\n\"Because, Uncle JACK,\" returns EDWIN DROOD, holding his hands curiously\nbehind him as he speaks, \"this is a night of general rejoicing\nBumsteadville, in honor of my reappearance; and, directed by your\nlandlord, Mr. SMYTHE, we have come out to make you join in our cheer. We\nare all heartily sorry for the great anguish you have endured in\nconsequence of my unexplained absence. Let me tell you ow it was, as I\nhave already told all our friends here. You know where you placed me\nwhile you were in your clove-trance, and I was o unbecomingly asleep, on\nChristmas night. Well, I was discovered there, in less than three hours\nthereafter, by JOHN MCLAUGHLIN, who carried me to his own house, and\nthere managed to awaken me. Recovering my senses, I was disgusted with\nmyself, ashamed of what had happened, and anxious to leave\nBumsteadville. I swore 'Old Mortarity' to secrecy--\"\n\n\"--Which I have observed,\" explains MCLAUGHLIN, nodding.\n\n\"--And started immediately for Egypt, in Illinois,\" continues Mr. DROOD.\n\"There I went into railroading; am engaged to a nice little girl there;\nand came back two days ago to explain myself all around, returning here,\nI saw JOHN MCLAUGHLIN first, who told me that a certain Mr. CLEWS was\nhere to unravel the Mystery about me, and persuaded me to let Mr. CLEWS\nwork you into another visit to the cellar the Pauper Burial Ground, and\nthere appear to you as my own ghost, before finally revealing myself as\nI now do.\"\n\nThe glassy eyes of the Ritualistic organist are fixed upon him in a most\nuncomfortable manner, but no comment comes.\n\n\"And I, Mr. BUMSTEAD,\" says the old lawyer, \"must apologize to you for\nhaving indulged a wrong suspicion. Possibly you were rather rash in\ncharging everybody else with assassination and larceny, and offering to\nmarry my ward upon the strength of her dislike to you; but we'll say no\nmore of those things now. Miss POTTS has consented to become Mrs.\nPENDRAGON; Miss PENDRAGON is the betrothed of Rev. Mr. SIMPSON,--\"\n\n\"--Miss CAROWTHERS honors me with a matrimonial preference,\"\ninterpolates Judge SWEENEY, gallantly bowing to that spinster.--\n\n\"--Breachy Mr. BLODGETT!\" sighs the lady, to herself.--\n\n\"--And three weddings will help us to forget everything but that which\nis bright and pleasant,\" concludes the lawyer.\n\nNext steps to the front Mr. TRACEY CLEWS, with his surprising head of\nhair, and archly remarks:\n\n\"I believe you take me for a literary man, Mr. BUMSTEAD.\"\n\n\"What is that to me, sir? _I've_ no money to lend,\" returns the\norganist, with marked uneasiness.\n\n\"To tell you the truth,\" proceeds the author of \"The Amateur Detective,\"\n--\"to tell you the whole truth, I have been playing the detective with\nyou by order of Mr. DIBBLE, and hope you will excuse my practice upon\nyou.\"\n\n\"He is my clerk,\" explains Mr. DIBBLE.\n\nWhereupon Mr. TRACEY CLEWS dexterously whips off his brush of red hair,\nand stands revealed as Mr. BLADAMS.\n\nMerely waiting to granulate one more clove, Mr. BUMSTEAD settles the\nrope about his neck anew, squints around under the wet towel in a\ncuriously ghastly manner, and thus addresses the meeting:--\n\n\"Ladies and gen'l'men--I've listened to y'r impudence with patience, and\non any other 'casion would be happy to see y'all safe home. At present,\nhowever, Mr. BENTHAM and I desire to be left alone, if 'ts all th' same\nt' you. You can come for the bodies in th' morning.\"\n\n\"BENTHAM! BENTHAM!\" calls the Gospeler, \"I can't see you acting in that\nway, old friend. Come home with me to-night, and we'll talk of starting\na Religious Weekly together. That's your only successful American Comic\nPaper.\"\n\n\"By Jove! so it is!\" bawls JEREMY BENTHAM, like one possessed. \"I never\nthought of that before! I'm with you, my boy.\" And, hastily slipping the\nrope from his neck, he hurries to his friend's side.\n\n\"And you, Uncle JACK--look at this!\" exclaims Mr. E. DROOD, bringing\nfrom behind his back and presenting to the melancholy organist a thing\nthat looks, at first glance, like an incredibly slim little black girl,\nheadless, with no waist at all, and balanced on one leg.\n\nMr. BUMSTEAD reaches for it mechanically; a look of intelligence comes\ninto his glassy eyes; then they fairly flame.\n\n\"ALLIE!\" he cries, dancing ecstatically.\n\nIt is the Umbrella--old familiar bone-handle, brass ferrule--in a\nbran-new dress of alpaca!\n\nAll gaze at him with unspeakable emotion, as, with the rope cast from\nhim, he pats his dear old friend, opens her half way, shuts her again,\nand the while smiles with ineffable tenderness.\n\nSuddenly a shriek--the voice of FLORA--breaks the silence:--\n\n\"It rains!--oh, my complexion!\"\n\n\"Rains?\" thunders the regenerated BUMSTEAD, in a tone of inconceivable\ntriumph. \"So it does. Now then, ALLIE, do your duty;\" and, with a softly\nwooing, hospitable air, he opens the umbrella and holds it high over his\nhead.\n\nBy a common instinct they all swarm in upon him, craning their heads far\nover each other's shoulders to secure a share of the Providential\nshelter. The glare of the great bonfire falls upon the scene; the rain\npours down in torrents: they crowd in upon him on all sides, until what\nwas once a stately Ritualistic man resembles some tremendous monster\nwith seventeen wriggling bodies, thirty-four legs, and an alpaca canopy\nabove all.\n\nTHE END.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTHE RACE OF THE DAUNTLESS AND CAMBRIA.\n\nPunchinello's Sporting Special went down to Sandy Hook last week to\nsupervise the race between the _Dauntless_ and the _Cambria_. The affair\nwas consequently a great success.\n\nAttired in white corduroy breeches, a blue velvet waistcoat, and a light\nboating-jacket of yellow flannel, your reporter left the Battery at 6\nhrs. 22 m, and 5 secs, on Friday morning, and steamed slowly down the\nbay in the editorial row-boat _Punchinelletto_, which was manned by an\nindividual of remarkable oar-acular powers. So highly was he gifted\nindeed in this respect, that your special was enabled to predict the\nresult of the aquatic gambols with perfect accuracy, as it afterward\nappeared. Having got the yachts in position, he gave Messrs. BENNETT and\nASHBURY an audience, in which it was settled by your representative\nthat, owing to a split in the _Cambria's_ club-topsail, both parties\nshould carry their block-headed jibs; and the contest was begun.\n\nIn his anxiety to see fair play, however, your reporter at first\ninnocently took the lead, shooting off, at the given signal, far in\nadvance of the two yachts. His surprise was therefore great when the\nlatter suddenly hove to on their beam-ends, and declared an armistice,\nto permit of Mr. ASHBURY'S publishing the following:\n\n_Card_.\n\nMuch as I appreciate the kindness and attention extended to me on all\nprevious occasions in these waters, I must still politely insist that\nthe _Punchinelletto_ relinquish her natural and perhaps unavoidable\ntendency to take the wind out of everybody's sails, and submit to remain\nin the wake of these yachts during the continuance of the race. And I\nhereby challenge all fast-sailing yachts of over 100 tons burthen, and\nunder 50, to a 15-mile race dead to windward and back again alive.\n\n(Signed) ASHBURY.\n\nUpon this your reporter manned the yard-arms, fired a salute of 100\nguns, and directed the Oar-acular to back water; thereby giving the\n_Dauntless_ the lead, which she retained up to the end of the race. By\nthe clever management of her Tacks she succeeded in completely Nailing\nthe _Cambria_. On the home-stretch, however, the latter began \"eating\nup\" on her to such an alarming degree, that it was feared the provisions\nof the Dauntless would not hold out. By putting the crew on half-rations\nof champagne and sponge-cake this awful calamity was averted.\n\nExcited by the presence of danger, your reporter forgot his habitual\ncaution, and giving his Oar-ist a hearing, made all sail for the\nmark-boat. The tow-line was passed from the bows aft, and there attached\nto the boat-hook, held by your representative. Upon this impromptu\nclothes-line was crowded all the canvas, velvet, linen, and other\ndry-goods appertaining to the gallant captain and his self-sacrificing\ncrew. The latter gentleman might have been seen under this gay cloud of\ndrapery working fitfully but energetically to and fro. But 't was all in\nvain! The _Dauntless_ passed the mark-boat, and the race was won. Won?\nBut by whom?\n\nThe daily papers, with their usual inaccuracy, have made it appear that\nthe _Dauntless_ was the winner, but among thinking men there is but one\nopinion in regard to the matter, an opinion fully explained and\ncorroborated in the following, published by Mr. ASHBURY, immediately on\nthe _Punchinelletto_ passing the mark-boat:\n\n_Card_.\n\nI take this opportunity of saying that whatever misunderstanding may\nhave arisen in the early part of this race as to the position of the\n_Punchinelletto_, it is now but just to admit that she has shown herself\nworthy, both in point of speed and management, to take rank among the\nfirst-class yachts of the fleet, and I hereby challenge, &c., &c.\n\n(Signed) ASHBURY.\n\nThis was further supplemented by a\n\n_Card_ from Mr. BENNETT.\n\nIn token of my concurrence in the brilliant success of the\n_Punchinelletto_, and my personal esteem for her commander, I hereby\nbeg to place at his disposal my yacht _Dauntless_, together with all her\nstores, ordnance, by-laws, and small arms.\n\n(Signed) BENNETT.\n\nIn reply to both of which your reporter circulated the following:\n\n_Reply_.\n\nIt is my express desire that no public mention shall be made of the part\nby which the _Dauntless_ was permitted apparently to win the race. It is\nthe duty of him who might have been victor to display a magnanimous\nspirit to those who in that case would have been the vanquished. I must,\nhowever, regret that circumstances of a peculiar nature prevent my\navailing myself of Mr. BENNETT's kind offer. Though this will not stand\nin the way of my accepting with pleasure--nay, even with alacrity--the $250\nsilver cup appointed for the winner of to-day's race, as the just meed\nof one who, though of a naturally retiring disposition, is forced on the\npresent occasion to acknowledge himself _facile princeps_.\n\n(Signed) Sporting Spec, _vice_ PUNCHINELLO.\n\nAfter waiting for Mr. BENNETT'S gig, or water-buggy, to row up and award\nthe prize, your special nodded majestically to the Oar-acular, who\nthereupon steamed slowly up the bay again, arriving at the Battery in\nthe rosy dawn.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPRUSSIA'S POSITION PHILOSOPHICALLY PUT.\n\nGerman metaphysicians have settled so completely to the satisfaction of\ntheir countrymen that \"being\" and \"not being\" are identical, that this\nmay serve to explain how, while holding possession of her share in the\npartition of Poland, Prussia professes to be virtuously indignant at\nFrance for retaining Alsace and Lorraine.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOUT OF THE PAN INTO THE FIRE.\n\nWhat with BISMARCK'S pangerrmanism, the CZAR'S panslavism, NAPOLEON'S\npanlatinism, the spread of pantheism, the threatened metamorphosis\nof pantalettes into pantaloons, ANDREWS' pantarchy, and\nFox's pantomime, the old regime seems going precipitately to pot.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA JUDICIOUS JEW.\n\nSuch was the one who wished to contract for the sweepings of Steinway\nHall when he heard that NILSSON showered throughout the room\nher precious tones.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEXIT \"SUN.\"\n\nThe newsboys in the streets no longer cry _The Sun_, with stentorian\nvoices, but in gentle whispers, fearing to disturb the repose of that\nwaning luminary.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTAPPING THE TILL.\n\nIs there any connection between the quite common offence in New\nYork of \"tapping the till,\" and the nomination of a Mr. TAPPAN for\nComptroller by the JOHN REAL Democracy?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTHE PLAYS AND SHOWS\n\nPretty _Fraeulein_ Margarat asks me to go to church with her. She is not\na New Yorker--or, as Webster would probably say,--a New Yorkeress. She\nis rural in her ways and thoughts, a daisy of the fields. Never having\nseen the interior of a city church, she asks me to go with her to any\nProtestant church that I may select. So we go to the shrine of St.\nAPOLLOS, which, I am told, is regarded as one of the most fashionable\nhouses in the city.\n\nIt is a matinee service that we elect to attend. A long procession of\ncarriages is drawn up beside the building as we enter, and I recognize\nin the coachmen the familiar faces that wait outside the ACADEMY on\nopera nights. The organ overture is already begun, and the audience is\nrapidly assembling. We enter the parquette--I should say, the body of\nthe church--and, standing in picturesque attitudes against the wall,\nwait for the coming of the usher. We continue to wait. Evidently the\nusher, in common with his kind, despises those who are not holders of\nreserved seats. He welcomes with a smile the owners of private\nboxes--pews, I mean--and shows them politely up the aisle; but for us,\nwho have not even an order from the mana--, sexton, I should say--he\nhas neither smile nor glance.\n\nBy and by I pluck up courage and pluck him by the sleeve. So, with a\nsevere air of suppressed indignation, he shows us to a couple of\nineligible seats, where the draft disarranges MARGARET'S hair, and the\ncharity children drop books of the op--, that is to say, prayer-books,\nand molasses candy in unpleasant proximity to our helpless feet.\n\nNeither MARGARET nor I possess a libret--, a prayer-book I mean.\nHowever, that is a matter of no consequence, as we are both familiar\nwith the dialog--, or rather the service. The organist having ended his\noverture, the service begins. Not even the wretched method of the\ntenor--I refer of course to the clerk--and his miserably affected\nexecution of the recitative passages, can mar the beauty of the words.\nThe audience evidently feels their solemn import. The young lady and the\nyoung male person who sit immediately in front of me clasp surreptitious\nhands as they bow their heads to repeat the confession that they are\nmiserable sinners, and she whispers by no means softly to him of the\n\"frightful bonnets the SMITH girls have on.\" Presently the recitative of\nthe clerk is succeeded by a contest in chanting--probably for the\nchampionship--by two rival choruses of shrill-voiced boys, who hurl\nalternate verses of the Psalms at one another with the fiercest\nintensity. MARGARET is betrayed into an inadvertent competition with\nthem, by reading a verse aloud, as had been her custom elsewhere, but\nthe charity children smile aloud at her, and the usher frowns, so she\nsits down again with reddened cheeks.\n\nI say to her, \"that this choir contest is an excellent feature, one that\nis sure to draw.\" But she answers nothing, and busily reads the\nlibret--, the psalm, to herself.\n\nThen comes the litany. And here again MARGARET betrays her rural habits,\nby repeating audibly the first response, thus encroaching on the\nprovince of the choir-boys, who have now united, and form a fine and\npowerful chorus, less picturesque perhaps than the Druidical chorus in\nthe first act of _Norma_, but quite as religious in its effect. After\nwhich comes a hymn, executed by a soprano, who is really a deserving\nlittle girl, and whom I little expected to find doing the leading\nbusiness in a first-class church, when I first saw her in the chorus at\nthe Stadt Theatre, seven years ago. MARGARET, warned by experience, does\nnot venture to interfere with the singing, to the evident disappointment\nof the usher, who is watching her with the intention, plainly expressed\non his face, of peremptorily putting her out, if she sings a single\nnote. Then comes a recitation of the commandments by the leading male\nperfor--, that is to say, by the rector, supported by the double chorus,\nand the orches--, the organ, I should say; and then we have the sermon.\n\nI like the sermon. It is delivered with admirable effect, and is, on the\nwhole, more soothing than the average syrup of the apocryphal Mrs.\nWINSLOW. The rector compliments us all on our many virtues, and\ncontrasts us with the supposititious sinners who are presumed to abound\nsomewhere in the vicinity of rival houses. The middle-aged men evidently\nfeel that he will make no mistake worth noticing, and so go to sleep as\ncalmly as though they were at BOOTH'S THEATRE. The middle-aged ladies\ncontemplate the dresses of their neighbors, and the young people flirt\nwith cautious glances. When the curtain--when it is over, I mean--we go\ncheerfully away, like an audience that has slept through a Shakesperean\nplay, and feels that it has done its duty. And when we are once more in\nthe street, I say to MARGARET: \"This has been a delightful performance.\nThere has been nothing said to make one feel disagreeably discontented\nwith one's self, nor has there been any impolite suggestions as to the\nundesirable future of anybody, except the low wretches who, of course,\ndon't go to any church. How much better this is than the solemn service,\nand, the unpleasantly personal sermons that we used to hear at your\nlittle rural church.\"\n\nMARGARET.--\"I do not like it. Why should boys be hired to pray, and\nwomen to sing for me? Why should I be told by the preacher that I am\nperfectly good, when I have just confessed that I am a'miserable\nsinner?' Why do you call this service religious, and Rip Van Winkle\ntheatrical? Believe me, St. APOLLOS deserves a place among your 'Plays\nand Shows' quite as much as does BOOTH'S or WALLACK'S.\"'\n\nAnd I to her--\"St. APOLLOS shall take its proper place in PUNCHINELLO'S\nshow. But permit me to say that you are very unreasonable. What do you\ngo to church for? To be made uncomfortable and dissatisfied with\nyourself?\"\n\nMARGARET,--\"To be made better.\"\n\nMATADOR.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA PASTOR ON POLITICS.\n\nThe Reverend Mr. CREAMCHEESE congratulated the hearers of his last\nsermon upon the encouraging religious aspects of the time, remarking how\npleasant it was in this fall season to find all the political parties in\nthe country so interested in making their election sure. We maybe\nmistaken, but we think the Rev. gentleman's zeal outruns his discretion.\nThe preying of politicians is of a kind which we trust the clergy will\nnever seek to imitate; but now that Congress has undertaken to supervise\nthis matter of election, there no knowing what it may become in the\nfuture.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAN EVASIVE REPLY.\n\nA Correspondent suggests that in No. 30 our artist has given Mr. C. A.\nDANA, in representing him as refusing a bribe with virtuous indignation,\na two-cent-imental an expression. In reply, Mr. PUNCHINELLO--although\nhis own opinion is that the mistake has been in making it rather\ndollar-ous than cent-imental--would refer his correspondent to the\nartist.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA QUERY FOR SOL-UTION.\n\nIs it a fact that, because _Sol_ is the Latin for _Sun_, being on the\n_Sun_ is therefore equivalent to being a SOLON?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTO THE DIPLOMATISTS OF THE HUB.\n\nWhether the Boston dip is a penny one or not, it is nevertheless\nscandalous.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPOEMS OF THE CRADLE.\n\n\nCANTO IX.\n\n    Rub-a-dub, dub,\n    Three men in a tub,\n    The Butcher, the Baker, the Candlestick-Maker,\n    They all jumped into a rotten potato.\n\nBehold the gentle Poet, now in the midst of the tumult of war. How\ncalmly he surveys from his elevated position the situation of the hosts\nand the signs of the times. He hears the drums beat and the bugle call\nto arms, and his soul is filled with martial ardor. Unable to wield the\nsword, he seizes his poetical pen, resolved to become the Chronicler and\nHistorian of the war, and thus add his little mite for the improvement\nof future generations. He decided that it must be characteristic, and in\nkeeping in style with his other productions: short, pithy, and\ncomprehensive; simple and amusing enough for a child; deep and sarcastic\nenough for the most astute mind.\n\nHe begins by describing in graphic style the sounds that first struck on\nhis ear and fired his manly soul--the beat of the rolling drum. Then\ncomes a description of the terrible conflict that occurred in his native\nvillage, between the three most prominent men of the day. This, not to\nbe too verbose, he simply likens to being \"in a tub.\"\n\nBILLY the butcher, stout, red-faced, and pugilistic, with his particular\nfriend MARC the baker, having become jealous of the beautiful shop and\nimmense patronage of JOHNNY the candlestick-maker, resolve to put an end\nto it in some way, even if they have to fight him.\n\nThat showy candlestick shop, with its gay trimmings and beautiful\nornaments, open every day before their face and eyes, and attracting\ncrowds of idlers who stand gazing in at the windows, or lounging around\nthe doors, is a little too much for the Butcher, who in vain displays\nbefore his door the fresh-cut meat and the tempting sausage. True, he\nhas plenty of customers; but they come because they need what he has to\nsell; they come of necessity, not for pleasure. The Baker experiences\nthe same vexation, as he sees his loaves passed by and mockingly made\nlight of.\n\nThey bear awhile in silent envy the annoying sight of the rollicking\ncrowd and the joyful JOHNNY with his troop of apprentices, who have all\nthey can possibly do to attend to their numerous customers, and who\nreceive their broad pieces of money with a careless ease that makes the\nfingers of the lookers-on tingle.\n\nAt last human nature can stand it no longer. The two malicious\nstorekeepers put their heads together, and resolve to draw their\nprosperous enemy into a fight that will ruin him and enable them to\nsmash his windows.\n\n### Summary:"}

CHIPPER ISN'T THE LEAST FUNNY\nNOWADAYS--PREACHES THE REGULAR OLD MISERABLE SINNER SORT OF BUSINESS.\"]\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGREAT MEN OF AMERICA.\n\nBy MOSE SKINNER\n\nDANIEL WEBSTER\n\nWas the sort of a man you don't find laying round loose nowadays to any\ngreat extent. It's a pity his brains wasn't preserved in a glass case,\nwhere the imbecile lunatics at Washington could take a whiff\noccasionally. It would do 'em good.\n\nWe are told that as a boy DANIEL was stupid, but this has been said of\nso many great men that it's getting stale. Some talented men were\nundoubtedly stupid boys, but it doesn't follow that every idiotic youth\nwill make an eminent statesman. But there are plenty of vacancies in the\nstatesman business. A great many men go into it, but they fail for want\nof capital. If they would only stick to their legitimate business of\nclam-digging, or something of that sort, we should appreciate them, and\ntheir obituary notice would be a thing to love, because 'twould be short.\n\nBut D. WEBSTER wasn't one of this sort. He didn't force Nature. He\nforgot enough every day to set five modern politicians up for life. When\nhe opened his mouth to speak, it didn't act upon the audience like\nchloroform, nor did the senate-chamber look five minutes after like a\nreceiving tomb, with the bodies laying round promiscuously. I should say\nnot. He could wade right into the middle of a dictionary and drag out\nsome ideas that were wholesome. Yes, when DANIEL in that senatorial den\n_did_ get his back up, the political lions just stood back and growled.\n\nTake him altogether he was our biggest gun, and it's a pity he went off\nas he did, for he was the Great Expounder of the Constitution.\n\nHON. JOHN MORRISSEY\n\nIs also a Great Ex-pounder. Even greater than WEBSTER, for the\nconstitution of the United States is a trifling affair, compared with\nthe constitution of J.C. HEENAN.\n\nMr. MORRISSEY is a very able man and made his mark early in life. Before\nhe could write his name, I'm told. No man has made more brilliant hits,\nand his speeches are concise and full of originality. \"I'll take mine\nstraight.\" \"No sugar for me,\" &c., have become as household words.\n\nA man like this, though he may be vilified and slandered for awhile,\nwill eventually come in on the home stretch with a right bower to spare.\n\nThat's a nice place JOHN has got at Saratoga. Fitted up so elegantly,\nand with so much money in it, it looks like a Fairy bank with the\nfairies gambolling upon the green. It's all very pretty, no doubt, but\nexcuse me if I pass.\n\nGEORGE FRANCIS TRAIN.\n\nThis gentleman is yet destined to send a thrill of joy to our hearts,\nand flood our souls with a calm and tranquil joy. This will come off\nwhen his funeral takes place. He wasn't born like other people. He was\nmade to order for the position of common scold in a country\nsewing-circle.\n\nBut he wasn't satisfied. He wanted to be an Eminent Lunatic and found\nprivate mad-houses. And so he began to lecture. He used to rehearse in a\ngraveyard, and it was a common thing for a newly-buried corpse to\norganize a private resurrection and make for the woods, howling\ndismally.\n\nA village out West was singularly unfortunate last summer. In the first\nplace the cholera raged, then they had an earthquake, and then G.F.\nTRAIN lectured three nights. Owing to this accumulation of horrors the\nvillage is no longer to be found on the maps. TRAIN'S second night did\nthe business for 'em. The once happy villagers are now aimless\nwanderers, and one poor old man was found in the churchyard, studying a\nwar map of Paris and vicinity in a late New York paper.\n\nIt is said that TRAIN has his eye on the White House, and is indeed a\nshrewd, far-seeing man. When he visited Europe and kissed all the little\nIrish girls, could he have had in his mind the time when they, as\nnaturalized American Female Suffragers, would cast their votes for G.F.\nTRAIN as President?\n\nThat the mind of the reader may not become hopelessly dazed by\ncontemplating this last paragraph, I will stop.\n\nMOTHER GOOSE.\n\nI cannot close these memoirs without a simple tribute to this remarkable\nwoman, who has probably done more to mould the destinies of this\nRepublic than any other man put together. She was an eminently pious\nwoman, devoted body and soul to Foreign Missions, and to the great work\nof sending the gospel to New Jersey.\n\nBut it was as a composer that her brilliant talents stand preeminent.\nMOZART, BEETHOVEN, and a host of others excelled in this respect, but\nthey all lack that exquisite pathos and graceful rhetoric which so\ndistinguished this queen of literature. The beautiful creations of that\nfruitful brain are as a passing panorama of constant delight. Her style\nis singularly free from affectation, and, while we are at one moment\nrapt in wonder at her chaste and vigorous description of the annoyances\nof a female in the autumn of life, training up a large family in the\nlimited accommodations afforded by a common shoe, we cannot but feel a\ntwinge of compassion for the singular Mrs. HUBBARD and her lovely dog,\nwho \"had none,\" only to have those tears chased away by the arch and\nguileless portrayal of the eccentric JOHN HORNER.\n\nThat we cannot to-day gaze upon the classic lineaments of her who welded\nsuch a facile pen, is a source of the most poignant regret. It is a\ncrying shame, for I think I am correct when I say that there does not\nexist on the civilized globe a statue of this peerless woman, but she\nwill always live as long as there are infant minds to form, or tender\nrecollections of childhood to remember.\n\nP.S.--I forgot to say that I hold a copyright of old GRANNY GOOSE'S\nworks. I have just got it renewed, and it is as vigorous as a\nkicking-mule. Send in your orders. Contributions to the old gal's statue\nwill be duly acknowledged, and deposited with my tailor.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTHE PLAYS AND SHOWS.\n\nJANAUSCHEK is a Bohemian, and with the Bohemian propensity for picking\nup things, has picked up the English language. The public is somewhat\ndivided in its estimate of her skill in speaking English. One-half of\nher average audience insists that she speaks better English than\nnine-tenths of our native actresses: the other half asserts that she is\nat times nearly unintelligible. Neither of these statements necessarily\ncontradicting the other, they might both be easily true. The fact is,\nhowever, that she speaks English like a foreigner. Mud itself--or a Sun\neditorial--could not be plainer than this definition of her exact\nproficiency in our unmelodious tongue.\n\nIf we go to see her play \"Lady Macbeth,\" we meet evidences at every step\nof her want of familiarity with English, or at all events with American\ncustoms. We find her playing at the ACADEMY, and we at once remark that\nno one but an unnecessarily foreign actress would dare to awaken the\nsepulchral echoes of that dismal tomb. We find, too, that at the very\nthreshold of the house she defies the one of the most time-honored\ninstitutions of our stage, by employing a pleasant and courteous\ndoor-keeper--instead of the snarling Cerberus who lies in wait at the\ndoors of other theatres. We find again that she outrages the public by\nthe presence of decent and civil ushers, who neither insult the male\nspectators by their surly impudence, nor annoy the lady visitor by\ncoloring her train with tobacco juice. So that before the curtain rises\nwe are prepared to lament over her unfamiliarity with American customs,\nand to predict her ignorance of the American, as well as the English\nlanguage.\n\nDivers well-meaning persons repeat the dialogue of the earlier scenes of\nthe play. There is a good deal of dramatic force in the legs of Mr.\nMONTGOMERY, who plays \"Macbeth,\" much animation in the feathers which\nMr. STUDLEY'S \"Macduff\" wears in his hat, and a foreshadowing of ghostly\npeculiarities in the solemn stride of Mr. DE VERE'S \"Banquo.\" We listen\nto these gentlemen with polite patience, waiting for the appearance of\n\"Lady Macbeth.\" When at length that strong-minded female strides across\nthe stage, we hail her with rapturous applause, and listen for the\nstrident voice with which the average \"Lady Macbeth\" reads her husband's\nletter.\n\nWe don't hear it, however, for JANAUSCHEK reads in a tone as low as that\nwhich a sensible woman who was plotting treason and murder would be apt\nto use. Why \"Lady Macbeth\" should proclaim her deadly purpose at the top\nof her lungs is quite incomprehensible, except upon the theory that\nstage traditions have confounded the Scotch with the Irish, and that the\n\"Macbeths\" husband and wife--being the typical Fenians of the period,\nwere accustomed to roar their secrets to the listening world.\n\nBe that as it may, we are constrained to note the actress's\nunfamiliarity with the language, as evinced in the tone in which she\nreads the letter, and also in the way in which she urges her husband\nonward in the path of crime. The usual \"Lady Macbeth\" \"goes for\" her\nweakminded spouse, and drives him by threats and strong-language to\nconsent to her little game. JANAUSCHEK, on the contrary, does not raise\na broom-stick, or even her voice, at \"Macbeth,\" but actually coaxes him\nto be so good as to kill the king, so that she can bring all her\nrelations to court, and appoint them surveyors, and internal revenue\ncollectors, and foreign ministers. This is not the tone of other\nactresses in the same part, and we therefore at once charge her\ndeparture from the common standard to her ignorance of English.\n\nWe listen with fortitude to the dismal singing of the witches and their\nfriends in mask and domino. The music, we are told, is \"LOCKE'S music.\"\nWhat is the proper key for LOCKE'S music, is a question which we have\nnever attempted to solve, but we heartily wish that the key were lost\nforever, since by its aid the singers open vistas of musical dreariness\nwhich are disheartening to the last degree. But we sustain our spirits\nwith the thought of the bloody murder that is coming. Talk as we ill, we\nall enjoy our murders, whether we read of them in the _Sun_ and the\n_Police Gazette_, or witness them upon the stage.\n\nWhen JANAUSCHEK comes upon \"Macbeth\" with his bloody hands, and explains\nto him that it is now too late to repent, either of murder or matrimony,\nshe furnishes us with more instances of her unfamiliarity with the\nlanguage. Her night-dress is not at all the sort of thing which an\nEnglish-speaking woman would be willing to sleep in. We are confident\nupon this point, and we have on our side the testimony of a married man\nwho has lived four years in Chicago, and has been annually married with\ngreat regularity. If he doesn't know what the average female regards as\nthe proper thing in night-dresses, it would be difficult to find a man\nwho does. Then, too, her gross ignorance of English is shown in her back\nhair, which is a foot longer than the average hair of previous \"Lady\nMacbeths,\" and is as thick and massive as a lion's mane. Wicked and\npunnish persons go so far as to call it her mane attraction. They are\nwrong, however. JANAUSCHEK does not draw by the force of capillary\nattraction. By the bye, did any one ever notice the fact that while a\npainter cannot be considered an artist unless he draws well, an actress\nmay be the greatest of artists and not be able to draw a hundred people?\nBut this is wandering.\n\nOwing to the imperfections of her English, JANAUSCHEK does not indulge\nin drinking from the gilded pasteboard goblets which grace the banquet\nscene. She also shows her lingual weakness in the sleep-walking scene.\nFor instance, when, after having reigned queen of Scotland for several\nmonths, the happy thought of washing her hands strikes her, she commits\nthe absurdity of scrubbing them with her hair. On the other hand, she\npronounces the words \"damned spot\" with a, perfection of accent that\nconstrains us to believe that she must have taken at least a few lessons\nin pronunciation from some of the leading members of WALLACK'S company.\nStill, her way of walking blindly into the table, and falling over\ncasual chairs, ought to convince the most skeptical person that her\nEnglish accent is not yet what it should be. And in general, her walk\nand conversation in this scene demonstrate that even the most carefully\nsimulated somnambulism may not resemble in all respects the most\napproved Oxford pronunciation.\n\nBut when we are freed from the depressing influences of the Academical\nCrypt, we forget all but our admiration of JANAUSCHEK'S superb acting,\nand the exceptional command which she has gained over a language so\nvexatious in its villanous consonants as our own. And we express to\nevery available listener the earnest hope that SKEBACH and FECHTER will\nprofit by her success, and at once begin the study of English, with the\nview of devoting their efforts hereafter to the American stage.\n\nMATADOR.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPOISONING THE PLUGS.\n\nA Rampant Virginia editor proposes to kill off the Yankees by putting\npoison in chewing-tobacco, so that we shall meet mortality in\nmastication, fate in fine-cut, and perdition in the soothing plug! In\nshort, Virginia not having got the best of it in political quiddities,\nthis pen-patriot is for trying the other kind. The short-sightedness of\nthis policy will be evident, when we remember how many Republicans\nconsider the weed to be the abomination of desolation. Virginia might\npoison chewing-tobacco till the crack of doom, but what effect would\nthat have upon the eschewing (not chewing) GREELEY, who, even if he used\nit, has bitten T(he) WEED so many times that he can consider himself\npoison-proof. When, moreover, this LUCRETIA BORGIA in pantaloons\nremembers that his scheme might prove more fatal to his friends than his\nenemies, perhaps he will take rather a larger quid than usual, and grow\nbenevolent under its bland influences.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFIRM AS A ROCK.\n\nAll the newspapers are full of descriptions of the earthquake of the\n20th of October, and of the panic thereby occasioned. We are proud to\nstate, although massive buildings quivered and great cities were scared,\nthat Mr. PUNCHINELLO was not in the least shaken. At the moment of the\nquake (11h. 26m. A.M.) he must have been seated upon his drum partaking\nof a lunch of sandwiches and small beer. He did not perceive the\nslightest reverberation, nor did the drum give the least vibratory sign.\nMr. PUNCHINELLO has prepared a most elaborate and scientific paper,\ngiving a full and elaborate and intensely scientific description of the\nvarious phenomena which he did not perceive, and which he proposes to\nread before any scientific associations which may invite him to do so.\nTerms, $50 and expenses.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n[Illustration: THE PREVAILING DISORDER.\n\n_Planet (responsively)_. \"WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH ME, EH?--GOT THE FEVER\nAND EARTHQUAKER--GOT 'EM BAD.\"]\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\nEDITOR'S DRAWER.\n\nOH YES! PUNCHINELLO has an Editor's Drawer, and a very nice one, too.\n(As no allusion is here made to any of the artists of the paper, you\nneedn't be getting ready to laugh.) This Drawer--and no periodical in\nthe country possesses a better one--is chock full of the most splendid\nanecdotes, and as it is impossible to keep them shut up any longer (for\nsome of them are getting very old and musty), a few of the bottom ones\nwill now be given to the public.\n\nA GENTLEMAN just returned from a tour in Western Asia sends to the\nDrawer the following account of a little bit of pleasantry which took\nplace in the gala town of South Amboy:--\n\nA young doctor, clever, rich, pure-minded, and just, but of somewhat\nambigufied principles, was strenuously married to a sweet young\ncreature, delicate as a daffodil, and altogether loveliacious. One\nnight, having been entreated by a select party of his most aged patients\nto go with them on a horniferous bendation, he gradually dropped, by\ndramific degrees, in a state of absolute tipsidity, and four clergymen,\nwho happened to be passing, carried him home on a shutter, and thus\nushered him in all his drunkosity, into the presence of his little\nbetter-half, who was drawing in crayons in the back parlor. \"My dear,\"\nsaid she, looking up with an angelic smile, \"why did you come home in\nthat odd manner, upon a shutter?\" \"Because, _mon ange_,\" said he, \"you\nsee that these worthy gentlemen, all good men and true, _mon_ only\n_ange_, brought me home upon a shutter because they were not able to get\nany of the doors off of their hinges. (Hic.)\"\n\nThis is almost _too_ funny.\n\n\nThe descendant of the Hamnisticorious sojourner in the ark knows what is\ngood for him. For pungent proof, hear this: A young lady, a daughter of\nthe venerable and hospitable General G-----, of Upper Guilford, Conn.,\nwas once catechizing a black camp-meeting, and when the exercises were\nover, a  brother approached her and said:\n\n\"Look-a-yar now,'s MARY, jist gib dis <DW65> one obdem catekidgeble\nbooks.\"\n\n\"But what would you do with it, CUDJO, if I gave it to you?\"\n\n\"Oh, _dis chile 'ud take it_!\"\n\nHa! ha! ha! Our  brother will have his wild hilarity.\n\n\nTwo septennialated youngsters of Boston. Mass, (so writes their gifted\nmother), thus recently dialogued:\n\n\"PERSEUS,\" said the younger, \"why was the noble WASHINGTON buried at\nMount Vernon?\"\n\n\"Because he was dead,\" boldly answered his brother.\n\nOh! the tender-aged! How their sub-corrected longings curb our much\nmaturer yearnings.\n\n\nHere is an anecdote of a \"four-year old,\" which we give in the exact\nwords of our correspondent, an aged and respected resident of Oswego\ncounty, in this State:\n\n\"Well, now, ye see, I couldn't do nothing at all with this 'ere\nfour-year old 'o mine, fur he was jist as wild an onruly as anything ye\never see; and so I jist knocked him in the head, and kep the hide and\nthe taller, and got thirteen cents a pound for the beef, which wasn't so\nbad, ye see.\"\n\nStrange, practical man! We could not do thus with all our little\ntid-toddlers of but four bright summers.\n\n\nA correspondent in San Francisco sends the Drawer these epitaphs, which\nare entirely too good to be lost.\n\nThe first is from the grave of a farmer, much notorified for his\n\"forehandidification,\" and who, it is needless to say, was buried on his\nown farm:--\n\n    \"Here lies JOHN SIMMS, who always did\n      Good farming understand;\n    E'en now he's gratified to think\n      He benefits his land.\"\n\nHere is one upon a gambler, who died of some sort of sickness,\nsuperinduced by some description of disease:--\n\n    \"His hand was so bad that he laid him down here;\n      But up he will certainly jump,\n    And quick follow suit for the rest of the game\n      When Gabriel plays his last trump.\"\n\nHere is one on a truly unfortunate member of the human race:--\n\n                      \"Here lies CORNELIUS COX,\n    who, on account of a series of unhappy occurrences, the principal\n        of which were a greatly increased rent and consumption of\n                              the lungs,\n                     Got himself into a tight box.\"\n\nThe ladies must not be neglected.

One morning, just as he was\nabout to get down from his horse.--(NOTE BY ED.--The middle of this\nanecdote is so long, so dull, and has so little connection with either\nthe head or the tail, that it is necessarily omitted.)\n\n\"Well,\" said the Judge, \"what would you do then?\"\n\n\"_I don't know_,\" said the Senator. \"Do you?\"\n\nIf our public men were, at all times, as thoughtful as these two, the\ncountry would be better for it.\n\n\nNECESSARY NOTE.--Persons sending anecdotes to this Drawer (or those\nreading them), need not expect to make anything by the operation.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPRUSSIAN PRACTICE AND PROFESSION.\n\nKING WILLIAM of Prussia thinks he has a mission to perform, and goes on\nhis present raid in France as a missionary.

The higher you get, the smaller and more\ninsignificant do earthly things appear. A balloon is the best pulpit\nimaginable from which to preach a sermon upon the littleness of mundane\nrealities, first--because no one can hear you, and your congregation\ncannot therefore be held responsible for indifference to your teaching;\nand second--because at that height you are fully impressed with the\ntruth of what you say.\n\nAspirations of whatever kind, all longings and emotions of the\n\"Excelsior\" order, all appeals to \"look aloft,\" come handier when you\ncan \"do\" them in an aerial car.\n\nYou will pardon this philosophic digression in respect to the peculiar\nfeelings of a man who has just been \"up in a balloon.\" Our air-ship had\nbeen anchored in the _Champ de Mars_ two days, waiting for a fair wind.\nAn hour before we started, a Yorkshireman, who had evidently never seen\nsuch a creation before, annoyed me with incessant questions as to what\nit was. His large, wondering, stupid eyes never ceased gazing at the\nmonster as it tugged heavily at the stake which held it. \"Na' wha' maun\n_that_ be?\" he exclaimed, starting back as it gave a very violent jerk.\nI could stand it no longer, and thus broke forth:--\n\n\"See here, my good fellow, you've got plenty of cheek to be bothering me\nwith your confounded ridiculous questions; and so I'll answer you once\nfor all. What you see tied fast there is called a balloon, and it's only\na French method of drawing Englishmen's teeth.\" He left me--I trust not\nin anger; but that was the last I saw of the Yorkshireman.\n\nWe got off, (M. GODARD and I) about four o'clock P.M., and ascended\nsteadily till Paris, with its rim of fortifications, looked more like\nthe crater of a volcano than anything else. I brought out my opera-glass\nas we moved in the direction of Versailles, and reconnoitred the\nsituation. In a field adjoining the palace I saw an object that looked\nlike a post driven into the ground, and capped with a large-sized\nclam-shell. GODARD levelled his glass and examined it. His lip curled\nproudly with scorn as he said:--\n\n\"That is the butcher himself, WILLIAM of Prussia. The clam-like\nappearance you notice is due to the baldness of his head.\"\n\nI only said: \"Can it be possible?\" and we moved on. How my blood\nthrobbed as we cavorted through the blue depths of heaven! I was far\nfrom feeling blue myself, and GODARD said that if anything I was green.\nThe bearings of the remark did not strike me at the time, as a\ncannon-ball from the direction of Versailles whirled within twenty feet\nof the balloon and lifted the right flank (a military expression) of my\nmoustache into your subscriber's eye, notwithstanding it was waxed with\nLOUVET'S best, warranted to keep each hair _en regle_, even in the worst\ngales. From that moment I renounced LOUVET. Following the cannon-shot\ncame a miscellaneous assortment of small projectiles, which had the\neffect of creating some excitement among the atmospheric _animalculae_,\nbut failed to disturb the serenity of M. GODARD or myself. When about\nten miles from Blois I detected what I supposed was a large vein of\nchalk-pits. It was very white, and apparently motionless. My companion\nexpressed his surprise at the difficulty I had in distinguishing objects\ncorrectly, and seemed to lose patience.\n\n\"_Bigarre_, you no know zat? It ees ze dirty Proosien linen vashed out,\nand hoong zere to dry!\"\n\nI told him in Arabic that he needn't get his back up; but he understood\nme not, and continued playing with the cats which we were transporting\nto Tours to protect the Commissary stores from the ravages of the rats\nthat the Prussians had despatched to eat up the provisions of the\ngarrison. Towards night I began to have a queer sensation in the\nstomach. It wasn't like sea-sickness, nor like the feeling produced by\nswinging. If a man just recovering from the effects of his first cigar\nwere offered a bowl of hot goose-grease for supper, I suppose he would\nhave felt as I felt. At the moment a queer twinge took me; I ejaculated:\n\"Oh! Lord!\"\n\n\"Vat ees de matter?\" inquired GODARD. If the man had had any other\nnationality, I might have talked sense to him; but he was a Frenchman,\nso I said:--\n\n\"Do you love me?\"\n\n\"Do I loves you?\"\n\n\"Yes!\" I roared frantically, \"do you love me?\"\n\n\"_Begaire_ I dunno, but I zinks so.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said I, dimly discerning a chance of relief from my suffering,\n\"throw me out as ballast.\"\n\n\"Oh, _horrible! horrible! Mon Dieu!_ vat a man!\"\n\nI turned my sickly gaze upon him and saw that he was deadly pale, and\nthat the perspiration stood out in great drops upon his forehead. The\nexplanation was plain enough--he took me for a maniac. I would have\nprotested and moved the previous question, but taking a small phial from\nhis pocket he broke off the head and threw the contents in my face. Ten\nseconds later I was totally oblivious, and upon recovering found myself\nin this place, where such strange things are going on that my fingers\nprick to write them.\n\nDICK TINTO.\n\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAN EX-MONSTER.\n\nIt is a bad day for monarchs.

The captive was shown for the\nridiculously small sum of two shillings, and great was the gathering to\ngaze upon the spouter, who would have come just in time to attend the\npolitical caucuses, only he happens to be dead, and cannot spout any\nmore, albeit his jaw is still tremendous. His defunct condition renders\nit unnecessary to feed him upon JONAHS, which is lucky for a good many\nsuperfluous voyagers upon the Ship of State. If the King of All the\nFishes can draw such crowds at a quarter a head, what a chance is there\nfor our friend LOUIS NAPOLEON! If he will but make an Exhibition of\nhimself in this country, we promise him full houses, and a greater\nfortune than that which he has lost.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTHE MICROSCOPIC MAN.\n\nBumps have a great deal to answer for. Of course we refer to\nphrenological bumps, from which, possibly, the powerful adjective\n\"bumptious\" is derived, it being applicable to a person whose\nconflicting bumps keep him continually on the rampage.\n\nOf all such persons, the one with microscopes in his bumps for eyes is\nthe most bumptious. He is continually detecting pernicious particles in\neverything that he eats and drinks. One such will seize a pepper-castor,\ninvert it over his mashed turnips, spank it as if it were a child, and\nthen, peering at the dark particles with which the succulent heap of\nvegetable matter is dusted, proceed to deliver a lecture upon the\npoisons that we swallow with our daily food. He sees iron-filings in the\npepper. Also particles of the tail-feathers of Spanish flies. He will\ntell you that if you continue to use pepper like that for a long\nduration--say seventy or eighty years--you will have iron enough in your\nstomach, from the filings, to make a ten-pound dumb-bell, and blistering\nstuff sufficient from the Spanish fly to draw all the interest of the\nNational Debt. If the pepper happens to belong to the Cayenne\npersuasion, he magnifies it into a hod of bricks. It is his hod way of\naccounting for it. Keep using it daily for half-a-century, says he, and\nsee if you don't wake up some fine morning and find yourself a brick\nchimney stuck up on the roof of a house for bats to live in. It will be\na just judgment on you; and small will be to you the consolation should\nsome poetical friend pen an epigrammatical threnody to your memory,\ntelling in \"In Memoriam\" stanzas how you \"went up like a thousand of\nbricks.\"\n\n\"Beef?\" says the microscopic man, probing the meat with a pencil of\nlight that beams from his right eye (the other being closed for\nconcentration purposes), \"Beef, sir?--not a bit of the _bos taurus_\nabout it, sir. Horse, donkey, mule, zebra--what you will, but not a\nsingle fibre of ox. Did you ever see the fibres of beef run in a\ndirection due north and south, like these? If you did I should like to\nknow it, sir. I inspected this meat raw, sir, to-day, on the butcher's\nstall, and the minute _ova_ perceptible in it were those of the horse\ngad-fly, not the ox gad-fly, sir. Yes, begad, sir, and I'm prepared to\nmaintain the fact upon oath, sir.\"\n\nPorter and other malt liquors are favorite subjects for the analysis of\nthe microscopic man. As you are placidly enjoying your pint of\nGUINNESS'S brown stout, he will look at you for minutes with a\ncompassionate smile. Then, suddenly plunging into his favorite horror\nknee-deep, he will ask you if you know what becomes of all the ends of\nsmoked-out cigars. Of course you submit that little boys pick them up\nand smoke them to everlasting annihilation. \"Pshaw! sir,\" exclaims the\nmicroscopic person; \"there is a man in the City of Dublin, sir--I\nbelieve he is a baronet now, but will not force that as a fact--and he\nmade an enormous fortune by going about the streets at early dawn and\npicking up all the cigar-stumps he could find, and they were not few, as\nyou may suppose, in that smokingest of cities. He used to furnish these\nby the ton to old GUINNESS, who used them for giving color and body to\nhis famous 'Stout.' Body?--I should think so rather!--but only think\nwhere the body came from! Just recall to mind the filthiest gutter that\never you saw in your life, with the numerous ends of cigars that you\nperfectly remember having observed sweltering in it, and then take\nanother pull at your GUINNESS, sir, and I wish you joy of it, sir!\"\n\nOnce we remember to have heard the subject of the possibility of lizards\nsnakes, frogs, and other cheerful reptiles having resided for indefinite\nperiods in the stomachs of human subjects, discussed in the presence of\nthe microscopic man. A lady of the party was skeptical on the subject,\ndwelling especially upon the impossibility of any person swallowing a\nreptile unawares. \"Observe those water-cresses of which you have been\npartaking so freely, madam,\" said the microscopic man. \"Beneath each\nleaf I discern _ova_ of things that it might horrify you to enumerate in\nfull. Suffice it to say, then, for the present, that on the leaves of\nthis small sprig culled by me at random from the cluster, are to be\ndetected the germs of the _trigonocephalus contortrix_, than which, when\nfully developed, no more deadly reptile wriggles upon earth. See this\nminute agglomeration of yellowish specks on the stalk of the cress.\nThese are the eggs of the _lacerta horrida_, a lizard that within the\nlarge warts with which its epidermis is studded secretes a poison of the\nmost virulent character. Others, too, I discern, but they are too\ndisagreeable to dwell upon--not to speak of one having _them_ dwell\ninside one, instead--ha! ha! Now, remember that all these germs are\nhatched by gentle warmth. No degree of temperature that we know of is\nmore gentle than that of the human stom--\"\n\nAt this point the lady fainted, and the microscopic man was thrown\npromptly out of the window by her husband, who has since been presented\nby a committee of grateful citizens with a gold-mounted cane, as a mark\nof consideration for his services in ridding the world of a monster.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"GREEK MEETS GREEK.\"\n\n    Oh, lovers of your lager beer,\n      Drinkers of wine and ale,\n    Ye editors and ministers,\n      Come listen to my tale,\n    And learn the very slight basis\n      Characters are built on,\n    By reading of the fight between\n      FULTON and friend TILTON.\n\n    In New York City, Broadway street,\n      Friend FULTON took his way,\n    Squinting in ev'ry restaurant,\n      For it was then mid-day;\n    He saw a bottle on a stand,\n      With words all in gilt on,\n    While right before that awful stand\n      Guzzling wine sat TILTON.\n\n    On Sunday night, while walking down\n      Bow'ry to the ferry,\n    TILTON did spy a lager shop\n      Where the folks were merry,\n    And saw a sight that op'd his eyes,\n      For, in that beery vat,\n    Nine lagers foaming by his side,\n      Reverend FULTON sat.\n\n    With spirit sword bound at his side,\n      And his hand the hilt on,\n    Brave FULTON smote at hip and thigh\n      Of our little TILTON;\n    Then TILTON took a mighty quill,\n      Called FULTON a liar,\n    FULTON took that to his church,\n      Will he take it higher?\n\n    Now TILTON says that FULTON lies,\n      FULTON says 'tis TILTON;\n    I wish this epic was told by\n      HOMER or by MILTON.\n    _I_ cannot tell which yarn is true,\n      Nor what each is built on,\n    But surely there's been lying by\n      FULTON or else TILTON.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA FINE OLD LADY.\n\nIn this day of monetary papyrus, it is pleasing to read of an ancient\nmatron in Lafayette, Ind., who, at the age of eighty-nine, has gone to\nher reward, leaving no property save a $20 gold piece. For several\nyears, she has been reserving this honest coin to pay her funeral\nexpenses; and one cannot help surmising that she must have been\ndistantly related to the late Old Bullion BENTON. \"No National Bank\nnonsense at my tomb!\" said she; \"no grimed and greasy currency for my\nundertaker! I will have a specie-paying funeral or none at all.\" As we\nhave the precedent of a great many Old Ladies in the Cabinet, we are\nrather sorry that it is too late to invite this clear-headed dame to\ntake a chair in Washington.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n[Illustration: A MODEST REQUEST.\n\n_Disbursing Agent of Political Organization [to Delegation on biz.]_:\n\"AH!

They have\nbeen trying this gun over at Shoeburyness (how is that, for a name?) in\nEngland, to see whether they had not better order a few, in time for the\nnext war. It seems that they conducted their experiments by firing at\n\"dummies, representing men.\" (Oh, if they had _only_ had some of our\nAmerican Dummies there, who Represent Men so inadequately.) There were\n136 of these _simulacra_, \"99 of whom,\" says the report \"would have been\nkilled.\" That is, if it had been possible to kill them. In fact, they\nwould have been killed four or five times over. \"Kilt intirely.\"\n\nWe shall always feel that a great opportunity was here lost of ridding\nthe country of certain nuisances, who, if anything at all, are _worse_\nthan dummies, and deserve not four only, but four hundred balls in them,\n\"forty-two one-hundredths of an inch in diameter,\" or even larger. There\nare so many, it would be useless to attempt to specify them: and\nbesides, everybody knows who they are. We would begin with the\nPoliticians, and end with the Brokers. And then the Millennium would\nbegin, \"sure pop.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTROUBLE FOR THE RISING GENERATION.\n\nMr. PUNCHINELLO has often thought with what melancholy feelings the\nnaughty boys must gaze upon a fine grove of growing birches; but what\npangs would a knowing child experience upon finding himself in Randolph\ncounty, Illinois, where they raise twelve bushels of castor-oil beans to\nthe acre! Of what depths of juvenile wretchedness and precocious\nmisanthropy is that crop suggestive! We see it all--the anxious\nparent--the solemn doctor--the writhing patient--the glass--the spoon!\nHowls like those of a battle-field, only less so, fill the air. The\nwretched victim of pharmacy, conquered at last, gives one desperate gulp\nto save himself from strangulation, and all is over! Ye who remember\nyour boyhood's home! tell us if there was any joke in all this!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTHE GREAT MODERN O MISSION.--The English Mission.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n[Illustration: THE LITERARY PIRATES.\n\nSUGGESTED BY BIARD'S PICTURE, AND SHOWING THE PIRATICAL ROVER \"HARPY\"\nSPRINGING A TRAP UPON THE GOOD SHIP \"AUTHOR\" IN A FAVOURABLE TRADE WIND.]\n\n\n\"THE HARPY.\"\n\n    With literary ventures stowed\n      As full as ship can be,\n    The good ship \"Author\" holds her way\n      Over the fickle sea;\n    Now sings the wind, and, all serene,\n      The ripples forth and back\n    Lap lightly round her gleaming sides\n      And whiten on her track.\n\n### Summary:"}

My wife ran it four years, and earned between |\n  |   $700 and $800, besides doing her housework. I have never   |\n  |  expended fifty cents on it for repairs. It is, to-day, in   |\n  |   the best of order, stitching fine linen bosoms nicely. I   |\n  | started manufacturing shirts with this machine, and now have |\n  | over one hundred of them in use. I have paid at least $3,000 |\n  |  for the stitching done by this old machine, and it will do  |\n  |              as much now as any machine I have.              |\n  |                                                              |\n  |                         W.F.

Our N.Y. _Sun_, however, does not always\nmanufacture its own beams. By far the most brilliant of the \"sunbeams,\"\nfor instance, published in that journal of November 1st, is the quaint\nand charming little poem there headed \"Sally Salter,\" and written\noriginally for Punchinello, in the issue of which publication for Oct.\n1st it made its first appearance, under the title of \"The Lovers.\" We\ncongratulate the _Sun_ on having thus successfully lit its pipe with\nPunchinello's fire, though we think it might have been gracious enough\nto have acknowledged the favor.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA PEOPLE OF TASTE.\n\nThe extraordinary liberality of the generous people of Connecticut has\nfrequently excited apprehension in the minds of their friends, that,\nsooner or later, as the result of their spendthrift career, they must\ncome to beggary. But we are glad to hear that they are making an effort\nin New Haven to reform. The grocery men there say that their customers\ntaste so much before they can make up their minds to buy anything, that\nwhat with gratuitous slices of cheese and specimen mouthfuls of sugar\nand sample spoonfuls of molasses, the shop-keeper's profits are most\ndolefully diminished. A particularly BLUE LAW against this economical\ncustom will have the effect of sobering down these brilliant Cullers.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"What Answer?\"\n\nIs it likely that HORACE GREELEY, or any other man, could steer this\ncountry through its difficulties by means of the tillers of the soil?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nANY MORE CAVES?\n\nAbout the dreariest magazine or other reading we know of--and we get a\ndeal of it, too--is that which describes the visits of enthusiastic\npersons to big caves underground, very dark, damp, dreary, ugly,\nfunereal--with winding ways and huge holes, water with eyeless fish, and\ncertain drippings called stalagmites and stalactites. The enthusiasts,\nwho always possess that priceless treasure self-satisfaction, and a\nboundless capacity for wonder (which is always ready to exercise itself\nwith anything that is big, however ugly), and the \"Palaces,\" and\n\"Halls,\" and \"Cascades,\" and \"Altars,\" and \"Bridal Wreaths\" they see\nthere are not only finer than real ones (if you would believe them!) but\nso grand and wonderful as to be really indescribable. So we find them,\nby their turgid and stupid reports, which are all alike, and all dreary\nand silly. We have never heard of anybody who got excited over these\npictures (except the artists themselves); and positively there is no\nflatter reading anywhere than these gushing notes about big caves.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGEOMETRICAL.\n\nWhy is it that we hear so much of the proper \"Sphere\" of woman? Here is\nthat noble exile, the Princess Editha Montez, lecturing again, and her\nsubject, of course, is the Spherical one. So when Mesdames Stanton,\nDickinson, Anthony, Howe--all the lovely lecturers--discourse, they\nforget the platform which is plane, and discuss the \"sphere\" which is\nmysterious. Can it possibly be that it is because these amiable\ngentlewomen are always going round? Or is it because they cannot help\nreasoning in a circle? Or is there some occult relation between spheres\nand hoops? Or has the wedding-ring something to do with it? It should be\nunderstood, that these are questions addressed solely to male\nmathematicians; for Mr. P. is unlike John Graham, and doesn't care to\ncross-examine ladies.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSECRETION EXTRAORDINARY.\n\nIt is done by Mollusks. We can tell you even the precise kind--it is the\nGasteropod kind. Not only this, we know the very devil himself that does\nit. (And you will say that \"devil\" is not a particle too rough a term,\nwhen we come to tell what it is he \"secretes.\") It is the _Dolium\ngalea_, good friends, and we could tell you six other kinds that are\nsuspected of this meanness. One of 'em is the _Pleurobranchidium_\n--which, of course, you have often heard of.\n\nWell, what do these wretched Mollusks go and secrete? We can tell\nyou--we, who know everything. It is sulphuric acid! What! do they steal\nit? Oh, no; they \"evolve\" it--probably from the \"depths of their own\nconsciousness.\"\n\nAnd what do they do it for? Well, they bore with it. Give 'em a chance,\nand they'll go through _you_. The acid eats its way, and then they eat\n_their_ way. That way is not ours, exactly; but we have known human\nbeings about as venomous as this creature, and with precisely the same\ntendency to pierce one. They do it with their tongues, it is true, but\nthe perforation is complete.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTHE WRONG PLACE.\n\nWe are unusually astonished to find the Female Reformers holding their\nmeeting in this city in Apollo Hall. It is well known that Apollo was a\ngod of the male persuasion; and to have everything \"mix up well,\" these\nphilosophical dames should have a Minerva Hall or a Diana Hall of their\nown. Besides, was not Apollo the God of Harmony? Precious little of that\nsame was there at this meeting; for there was the Medical Mary Walker\ntrying to make a speech, while the Chairwoman put her down, causing Mary\nde Medici to cry out with shrill indignation: \"Tyrant!\" Bless us! we\nthought all the tyrants were we Bearded Ones.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA LETTER FROM CHICAGO.\n\nPurposely or otherwise, we are all on our way to California now--men,\nwomen, and children--graybeards and babies. We did Europe two or three\nyears ago, so that idea is obsolete, excepting as a bridal tour; then,\ntoo, the more peaceably inclined, who have not seen the European\nelephant, would prefer to wait until that country is again in a state of\nquiescence. But Chicago is constantly sending out her adventure-loving\ncitizens upon the Pacific road, each one of whom looks, sees, admires,\nand suddenly develops an epistolary talent hitherto undreamed of by his\nmost enthusiastic friends. There's our MELISSA, for instance--she never\nused to have a pen in her hand more than once in the course of six\nmonths, and _now_--why, we really seem to have another SEVIGNE budding\nright in our midst. She went to California, saw all the sights, and\nwondered, and admired, and _wrote_. The floods of eloquence that had so\nlong been slumbering now burst forth beyond all hindrance or control.\nShe stopped at Salt Lake, and called upon BRIGHAM YOUNG, and was so\ndisgusted with the mighty prophet that she would not look at him. Yet,\nconsidering that circumstance, she described his personal appearance\nwith wonderful vividness and accuracy. She indulged in the usual amount\nof stern remonstrance and indignation, that seem to be almost\nindispensable to the occasion. ALONZO asked why she called upon the\ndreadful man, and somewhat maliciously inquired if it was not for the\nexpress purpose of being shocked and horrified, thus affording a fine\nchance to moralize, and display the elevation of her own principles,\nand, in fact, help to fill out a good article; but MELISSA most\nvigorously denied the soft impeachment. Then she saw the sad wives,\nwhose days of sunshine are gone by, and the merry ones,--who don the cap\nand bells deliberately; and for their benefit she expended just the\nproper degree of astonishment and sympathy--so fully substantiating the\nsound and praiseworthy condition of her own mind and heart.\n\nThis excellent young woman also caught glimpses of the red man, and here\nwas another glorious opportunity to display her literary genius--and she\ndid not let the occasion slip--O no! it produced a plaintive little\nrhapsody of pity and regret, such as \"Mr. Lo!\" is apt to inspire in the\nhearts of the young and romantic, although if MELISSA were to find\nherself alone in a forest, with the faintest suspicion of \"Mr. Lo!\"\nmeandering anywhere near, she would most likely apply her hand\ninvoluntarily to her trembling chignon, and regret as keenly as all\n_hard-hearted_ persons, that civilization has not carried out the\nprocess of extermination even more thoroughly than it has done. Indeed,\nshe would probably wish the red gentleman at the bottom of the Red Sea,\nor in some other equally damp and discouraging situation. The\nnoble-hearted braves are so much prettier to read about than to\nencounter, and the thrill occasioned by the sight of a bloody hatchet\nsuspended over the intricate elaboration which we so fondly term a head,\nthough more exciting perhaps, would scarcely be as delightful as that\nawakened by some perfectly safe and stirring ballad of the red man's\nwrongs.\n\nMELISSA'S ideas of refinement met with a great shock. She concluded that\nthe Indians' acquaintance with soap and water must be extremely limited,\nand thought that the distribution amongst them of several boxes of\nCOLGATE'S best would be a most delicate courtesy, and true missionary\nenterprise. In looking at these noble representatives of savage life,\nshe was greatly puzzled to discover where the dirt ended and the Indian\nbegan: but philanthropy should overlook such trifles. Philanthropy\nshouldn't be squeamish.\n\nMELISSA, ecstasized over Lake Tahoe, and Yo Semite, and the Big Trees,\nand was delighted, enchanted, and enraptured in the most thorough and\nconscientious manner. She revelled amongst California grapes and pears,\nand quaffed the California wines with appropriate delight and hilarity.\nShe also studied JOHN CHINAMAN in all his phases, and came to the\nconclusion that he would do. She thought it would be a seraphic\nexperience to see the pride and importance of Misses BRIDGET and\nGRETCHEN taken down a little. JOHN would certainly not possess the\nvoluble eloquence--of the first, nor the stolid impudence of the second,\nnor would he have, like the pretty Swede, a train of admirers a mile in\nlength. Of course he would not have these advantages to recommend him.\nBut then one can get along without florid oratory in the kitchen, and\nalthough a lady may feel highly pleased and flattered to see an unending\nprocession of admirers file in and out of her drawing-rooms, still she\nhas a most decided objection to seeing the same imposing spectacle in\nher kitchen. Women, will be inconsistent.\n\nMELISSA particularly admired JOHN'S manner of ironing. She thought it\npeculiar but genteel, and gentility is always desirable. There must be\nsomething about the climate of California that is especially inspiring\nto authors--a kind of magnetism in the atmosphere that draws out all the\nliterary talent which may be lying dormant in their souls--so that any\none desirous of becoming a writer, has only to take a trip to that\nfascinating region, and at some unexpected moment he will awake with\nrapture and delight to the blessed consciousness of having blossomed\ninto a flower of genius, and, as such, will feel privileged at once to\ndeluge his family, his friends, and the world in general, with the\nbrilliant results of his most delightful discovery.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTHE PROFIT OF PURITAN PRISONS.\n\nSpain has commissioned a Mr. AZCARATE, a Cuban, to visit and report upon\nour penal institutions, and the gentleman is now in the country. We\ntrust he will not fail to visit the Connecticut State Prison. There he\nwould unquestionably obtain numerous hints for improving the Spanish\nsystem of prison torture, or even that in vogue in his native land, for\npolitical prisoners. There he might learn how Yankee thrift, applied in\nthis direction, makes the starving of convicts even a more profitable\nbusiness than manufacturing wooden nutmegs. Perhaps not the least\nvaluable information he would gain, would be the best method of goading\nobnoxious prisoners into revolt, and thus obtaining a chance for\ndisposing of them, legally, by a capital conviction.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAN OPEN CONGRESSIONAL COUNTENANCE.\n\nIt is oddly enough objected to the re-election of a certain Member of\nCongress from Massachusetts, that \"he can't open his mouth.\" It might be\nanswered that Gen. BUTLER is quite able to open his mouth wide enough\nfor the whole delegation.

The\nfriends of PUNCHINELLO will therefore be rejoiced to hear that this\naccurate reporter was engaged to detail for our readers the progress of\nthe late elections.\n\nSome time ago, the Eye-witness set about organizing the campaign by the\nmasterly and novel plan of inducing the leaders of the opposing\npolitical parties to nominate different men for the same office. The\neffect was electrical. Immediately on these nominations being made\npublic, the people rose like one man, and began canvassing like a great\nmany different and very quarrelsome men. Target companies sprang from\nthe recesses of the East Side, like ghosts from the rocks in _Der\nFreischuetz;_ drums and fifes resounded; cannons boomed; fireworks burst\ninto flame. The Eye-witness, having thus set the universe satisfactorily\nby the ears, got into his second-story front, and contemplated the\ncampaign with serene complacency from the window.\n\nHe had not to wait very long for a Mass Meeting to be formed under his\nvery nose, and, consequently, within range of his witnessing and\nrecording Eye. This Mass Meeting was conducted by the \"Intelligent\"\nParty, and was announced to be speedily followed by a Multitudinous\nAssemblage of the \"Enlightened\" Party. These two factions, as it will\nreadily be observed, and as their names indicate, are of the most widely\nvarying character and scope; a fact to be further illustrated by the\nproceedings which followed.\n\nThe intelligent began to assemble early in the evening, to the sound of\nguns and drums and sky-rockets. These accompaniments were intended to\nget their spirits up, but the Intelligent persistently applied\nthemselves to getting spirits down; and when the rival processes had\ncontinued for a reasonable length of time, speakers began to appear upon\nthe stands. The first man who addressed them was the Commercial\nCandidate.\n\n\"Fellow-citizens,\" said he, \"why are you here? To elect me, of course.\n(Immense cheering.) And why will you elect me? I am an honest man: I\nwant no office. (Laughter and cheers.) Ah, my friends, you elect me\nbecause you are now paying $5.36 on every pound of Peruvian Bark and\nEgyptian Mummy which you use in every-day life, and because you know\nthat when I am in, the other party will be out!\" (Continued applause.)\n\nNext rose an ex-Senator, who said he had come wholly unprepared to\nspeak, but, being unexpectedly called upon, had made some brief jottings\non a visiting-card, to which he would now refer. He then spoke for one\nhour and three-quarters. At the close there was an intermission for\ncarrying off the dead.\n\nJONES, the candidate for the office of Vituperator, then cleared his\nthroat savagely.\n\n\"My friends,\" he began, \"BROWN, the opposing candidate, is a scamp, and\nhe knows it. If any man says he isn't, _he_ is. (Loud cheers.) Do you\nask me to prove it? Prove an axiom! (Applause.) Who but a damned rascal\nwould run against me at election? I tell you it is assault and battery!\n(Sounds of approbation.) In conclusion, I will only add that Brown is an\ninfernal <DW15> and a sneak.\" (Cheers.)\n\nThe Intelligent then dispersed in a splendidly ferocious and\nbloody-minded condition, fully primed for the election. Shortly\nafterward the Enlightened appeared upon the scene in the following\n\nORDER OF PROCESSION.\n\nCordon of Police.\nDrum.\nCommittee of Arrangements.\nFife.\nTarget Company.\nDrum and Fife.\nSmall boys.\nApple-women.\nDrum.\n\nThe Enlightened candidate for the Vituperator was the first on the\nstand. He rushed forward and said:--\n\n\"The Vituperative candidate of the Intelligent let fall in a former\nspeech some subtle or carefully worded innuendoes as to my character. I\nhave only to say that his speech was a tissue of falsehood. I will\ntrespass upon your patience further, to add that JONES is an infernal\n<DW15> and a sneak. If he is not, my fellow-citizens, why then I am.\n(Indignant cries of 'That's so!') My friends, you cannot doubt this\nreasoning. The facts are then conclusive. Either he is a <DW15>, or I\nam. It is therefore your duty, on the 8th November, to elect me at once\nand in fact to the office of Vituperator, and prospectively to those of\nMayor, Governor, and President of the United States.\" (Prolonged\ncheering.)\n\nMr. DE MAGOG, a very giant of eloquence, a Gog as well as Magog of\noratory, next set the enlightened agog with a speech.\n\n\"Fellow-citizens! Men and Brothers! Victory or defeat! Liberty or death!\nGlorious republic! Stars and Stripes! Down with the traitor! To the\npolls! Red fire--blood and thunder\"--(voice drowned in shouts of wild\nenthusiasm.)\n\nThe Eye-witness, meantime, had become distracted with harassing doubts.\nSubscribing fully to the politics of PUNCHINELLO, which is the only\npaper he reads, he had hitherto announced himself as a member of the\nRight Party. Being, however, open to conviction, he had unfortunately\npermitted both parties to convict him. In this awful crisis Reason\nappeared about to totter from her throne. The Eye-witness thrust his\nhead wildly from the window, and shrieked to the crowd below: \"Where's\nthe Right Man? I belong to the Right Party. I want to hear the Right\nMan!!\"\n\nAt once the mob became a sea of upturned faces. The Enlightened,\ntogether with a large number of the Intelligent, who had lingered on the\nscene, with one common consent lifted up their voices and groaned. The\ngroan was but a premonitory thunder to a shower of sticks, stones,\nwhiskey-bottles, and superannuated eggs. The Eye-witness closed the\nwindow with an undignified bang, and retired into the depths of his\nchamber, where he remained until after the election. Owing to a dimness\nof vision, resulting from the eggs-cruciating condition of his ocular\norgans, the occupation of the Eye-witness was from that moment gone. And\nto this fact must be attributed his inability to state, with any\ncertainty, whether the Right Party has succeeded in putting the Right\nMan in the Right Place; but he rather thinks it has.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSpots on the Sun.\n\nThe _Sun_ is eclipsed by the _World,_ and is far behind the _Times._ It\ncannot be considered a _Standard_ sheet, and will never personify the\n_Star_ newspaper.

Major\nAnderson's supplies were nearly exhausted, and he wanted twenty thousand\nmen, with equipments and rations. If the Government couldn't afford the\nrations--very well: it ought at least to given him the men.\n\nI am speaking of the late rebellion, which GREELEY, HEADLEY, and others\nhave written up. Although a publishing company at Hartford, Conn., own\nmost of the facts of the war, which they peddle out only by\nsubscription, they can give the public but little of the secret history\nof the Fort Sumter affair. That remains to be written, while WELLER and\nI remain to write it. The Ex-Secretary has gracefully left it to me to\ndescribe the midnight session of the Cabinet at which I chanced to be\npresent.\n\nI was boarding at the White House at the time, and as President LINCOLN\nassured me it would be rather interesting, I was persuaded to attend.\n\"The fact is, the crisis reminds me,\" said he, of a little story of a\nhorse-trot in Arkansas--\"\n\n\"Sir,\" interrupted I, \"it reminds me of a dozen stories, one of AEsop's\nfables, and two hundred lives of CHAUCER.\"\n\nHe was afraid to continue.\n\nAs the clock struck twelve, he called the meeting to order and remarked:\n\"Gentlemen, ANDERSON is in Sumter. The question now is,--what will he do\nwith it?\"\n\nSouth Carolina was out. BUCHANAN had done nothing. Everywhere was\ndistrust. (That very day they had refused, on Pennsylvania avenue, to\ntrust me for a spring overcoat.) STANTON was getting his dark lantern\nready for nightly interviews with SUMNER and WENDELL PHILLIPS in a\nvacant lot upon the outskirts of the Capitol. Universal gloom prevailed.\n\nSEWARD opened the discussion. He said it was contemplated to throw four\nthousand men into Fort Sumter. We couldn't do it. If we did, it would\nonly be one of the first throes of a civil conflict, a war long and\nbloody, which he would venture to predict might be protracted even to\nthe extent of ninety days. Were we prepared for that? He would like to\nhear from that pure patriot, the Secretary of War, on this point.\n\nAmid murmurs of applause, Gen. CAMERON rose to say that he was wholly\nunprepared to make a speech; but he owned a lot of condemned muskets,\nwhich he stood ready to dispose of to the Government at four times their\noriginal cost. He should advise that the Fort be covered with several\nthicknesses of Pennsylvania railroad iron. It would protect our gallant\ntroops, and he was now, as he had always been, in favor of protection.\nBesides, he knew parties who could get up a ring in the way of army\nblankets.\n\nMr. CHASE spoke rather thick and fast, but I understood him to pronounce\nin favor of that platform which would get the most votes. \"If the people\nthink it ought to be done, why, do it. The country needs taxation, and\nis anxious to have me President. I think I can borrow money enough in\nWall street to pay the passage of a moderate number of men to\nCharleston, but they mustn't on any account be CHASE men. I don't want\nany of my friends killed off before the next Presidential election.\"\n\n\"What the Administration lacks,\" chimed in BLAIR, \"is backbone. Powder\nand ball, and blood are my sentiments. Fill all the army and navy\noffices with the BLAIR family, and secession is dead.\"\n\nSEWARD again: \"Strengthen Pickens, and let Sumter go. Our soldiers will\nfind it healthier and more commodious at Pickens. I'll have the\n_Powhatan_ sent there forthwith.\"\n\nHereupon Mr. GIDEON WELLES woke up and remarked, in a strain of apology,\nthat be hadn't read his commission yet, but it was his impression that\nhe was the head of what was called the Navy Department. Coming from an\ninland town, he didn't exactly know whether the Secretary of State or\nhimself had the ordering about of our national vessels; but he rather\nthought he would relieve his friend SEWARD of that burden. He had talked\nwith several old sea-dogs. They all agreed that the success of the plan\ndepended on its feasibility. Capt. Fox, a private citizen of\nMassachusetts, had been down there with a horse and buggy, and reports\nthat a squad of marines could do the job up in good style.\n\nMr. BATES was called upon, and stated that strengthening Sumter, without\ngiving the Southerners four weeks' notice of our intention, would not,\nin his opinion, be unconstitutional.\n\nAt this juncture Mr. FLOYD (who, having acquired the habit of attending\nBUCHANAN'S cabinet meetings, had not quite got over it) put his head in\nfor a moment to suggest, that if the Black Republican Government would\nevacuate all the forts on Southern territory, remunerate his friends for\ntheir expenses, and execute a quit-claim deed of Washington and the\nnational property to JEFF. DAVIS and other Southern leaders, the\nproposition might possibly be accepted, and trouble avoided.\n\nMr. SEWARD rose to add only a word, and that word was \"Pickens.\"\n\nThe Secretary of the Interior observed, that as Charleston harbor wasn't\nin his department, he would say nothing.\n\nMr. BATES urged that the people of his section were loyal to the flag;\nin fact, they not only wanted the flag but the Capitol itself, and the\nnational buildings (except the monument), removed to St. Louis; if they\ncouldn't get that, they might be satisfied if Fort Sumter were towed\naround there, up the Mississippi. It would certainly be a good deal\nsafer there.\n\nMr. GIDEON WELLES wanted it distinctly understood that Gen. SCOTT, Gen.\nHOLT, Capt. FOX and the _Powhatan_ could save the country if Mr. SEWARD\nwould let them; otherwise he would make a minute of these deliberations,\nand if his friend Mr. YOUNG (whom he was pleased to see present) didn't\nexpose it, he himself would put it in the shape of a lively sketch, and\nsend it to the magazines.\n\n\"Well--now,\" said Mr. LINCOLN, after patiently waiting, \"this reminds me\nof the man in Pomeroy, Ohio, who kept what he called an 'eating saloon.'\nOne morning, a tall hoosier came in and called for ham and eggs. 'Can't\ngiv 'em to ye, stranger,' said the proprietor, 'but what'll ye hav'\nt'drink?--don't keep nothin' but a bar.' 'Yer don't? Then what'n thunder\nyer got that sign out thar for?' for the fellow was a little mad. 'Why\nyer see I call her a eating saloon, 'cos I reckon she eats up all the\nprofits.\"\n\nThis beautiful and appropriate anecdote, which seemed to throw a flood\nof light upon the critical State question under consideration, pleased\nevery one except FLOYD, who swore it was ungenerous and unchivalric.\nHastily withdrawing, he threatened to telegraph it verbatim to the\ninsurgents; it would fire the Southern heart.\n\nSEWARD said he was going home, as he had already sent the _Powhatan_ to\nPICKENS.\n\nMr. LINCOLN yawned, and turning to me, inquired: \"Well, SARSFIELD, you\nsee what a man's got to do to run this machine,--now what's your\nadvice?\"\n\n\"Your Excellency,\" I replied, \"there's a man in the tanning business at\nGalena, in your State. Telegraph him at once. His name is GRANT, and if\nyou give him the tools to work with, he'll straighten everything out for\nyou as neat as a pin.\"\n\nThe meeting dissolved without taking heed of my suggestion, and the\nworld knows the result. However, there's one thing I am proud of. I\nclaim to have discovered GRANT four years before WASHBURN did. That's\nthe secret why I can have any office I want under the present\nadministration.\n\nSARSFIELD YOUNG.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTHE PLAYS AND SHOWS.\n\nThe popularity of opera among fashionable people in this city varies\ninversely as the intelligibility of the language in which it is sung.\n\nTo illustrate! The Italian opera is fashionable, though not one in ten\nof the people composing an average audience understand a word that is\nsaid or sung. The French opera is less fashionable, but perhaps\none-third of the audience can understand the less ingenious of the\nindelicate jokes. The English opera is not fashionable, but every one\ncan understand every word that Miss RICHINGS or Miss HERSEE pronounces.\nThese facts undoubtedly stand in the relation of cause and effect.\nWherefore the axiom with which this column begins.\n\nTo be sure, the words of an opera are a matter of very little\nconsequence, the music speaking as plainly as the clearest of Saxon\nsentences. But the fashionable public knows less of music than it knows\nof languages, and would be quite capable of mistaking \"_Gran Dio_\" for a\ncomic song, and \"_Libiamo_\" for a lover's lamentation, were not the\ntranslated libretto of _Traviata_ at hand to supply them and the critics\nof the minor papers, with the cue for the display of appropriate\nemotion. Singers, especially, understand the full force of the above\nstated axiom. Hence, those who are deficient in voice avoid the English\nstage. Miss KELLOGG, for example, never attempted English opera, because\nshe knew that people who had heard ROSE HERSEE or CAROLINE RICHINGS\nwould laugh at her claim to be \"the greatest living Prima Donna,\" should\nshe compete with those birds of English song. Wherefore, she wisely\nconfined herself to the Italian stage, sure of pleasing a public that\nknows nothing of music, but is confident that a lady who enjoys the\nfriendship of Madison avenue must be a great singer. PAREPA, on the\ncontrary, turned from the Italian to the English stage,--but then PAREPA\nhad a voice.\n\nHow many years is it since CAROLINE RICHINGS first sung in English\nopera? It is an ungallant question, but the answer would be still more\nungallant were it not that Miss RICHINGS is an artist; and with artists\nthe crown of youth never loses the brightness of its laurel leaves. At\nany rate, she has sung long enough to compel the recognition of her\nclaims to our gratitude and admiration. She is not faultless in her\nmethod, but she differs from other great American prime donne in the\nimportant particular of possessing voice enough to fill an auditorium\nlarger than the average minstrel hall.\n\nAt present she is filling NIBLO'S GARDEN with her voice and its\nadmirers. We go to hear her. PALMER and ZIMMERMANN, clad in velvet and\nfine linen, flit gorgeously about the lobby, and are mistaken, by rural\nvisitors, for JIM FISK and HORACE GREELEY--concerning whom the tradition\nprevails in rural districts that they are clothed in a style materially\ndifferent from that affected by King Solomon at the period of his\ngreatest glory. We find our seats, and mentally remarking that NIBLO'S\nis the one theatre in this city from which it would be possible to\nescape with whole bones and coat in case of fire, we await with\ncontented minds the lifting of the curtain.\n\nIn time the opera begins, and a select company of young men who are\nstanding in the rear of the audience improve every possible opportunity\nfor breaking into rapturous applause. Their zeal occasionally outruns\ntheir discretion, and they finally ruin the attempt of Miss RICHINGS to\nexecute a florid cadenza at the end of one of her arias. An intelligent\nusher is therefore detailed to curse them into a comprehension of their\nduties, after which they applaud with a discretion which produces almost\nexactly the effect of spontaneous enthusiasm.\n\nRemarks a young lady near us, who is dressed with much wealth of\ncontrasting colors:--\"This isn't half so nice as the Italian opera. Miss\nRICHINGS can't dress half so nicely as Miss KELLOGG, and then you don't\nsee any fashionable people here. The DAVIDS, the ABRAHAMS, the AARONS,\nthe NOAHS, that handsome Mr. JACOBS, and that delightful Mr. MOSES,--all\nthese elegant young men with beautiful eyes and curly hair that dress in\nvelvet coats and diamond studs--there isn't one of them here. Our best\nsociety never goes to any opera but the real Italian opera.\"\n\nLIGHT-HAIRED YOUNG MAN.--\"But, my dear, it seems to me that your best\nsociety must consist chiefly of Jews--judging from the names you\nmention.\"\n\nYOUNG LADY.--\"Well, what if it does? They are rich, are they not? What\nmore could you want?\"\n\nLIGHT-HAIRED YOUNG MAN.--\"What, indeed! But the music is just as good as\nit would be if the fashionable Israelites were here,--isn't it?\"\n\nSHE.--\"The music as good! Why, Charles, everybody knows that the Italian\nopera music is perfectly lovely. This is only English, you know.\"\n\nHE.--\"It is precisely the same. Here the _Somnmabula_ is sung with\nEnglish instead of Italian words. That doesn't alter a single note.\"\n\nSHE.--\"You are too ridiculous! The idea of attempting to make me believe\nthat this is just like the Italian Opera! Don't you suppose I knows\nanything about music?\"\n\nOLD GENTLEMAN.--\"I heard CAROLINE RICHINGS sing in 1808,--I think it was.\nI tell you she sings better now tan she did then, but the stupid public\nnever appreciated her. I recollect saying to KEAN--not CHARLES, you\nknow, but _the_ KEAN--that I knew a young lady that would be a splendid\nsinger some of these days--meaning CAROLINE, of course. 'Well, sir,'\nsays KEAN, 'what of it; you can't drink her, can you?' Gad! he was the\nbest man for repartee I ever knew. To give you an instance; one night\nKEAN and I, and old SMITH,--you don't remember old SMITH, I presume; he\nplayed old men at the Boston Theatre sixty years ago; I never met a\njollier fellow,--I remember his saying one night when JUNICS BOOTH was\nplaying--let me see, what was the play; it wasn't the _Apostate_, I\nhardly think, for--\"\n\nHere the orchestra mercifully strikes up, and the big drum drums the\ngarrulous monologue of the veteran theatrical observer. We have another\nact of the opera, sung far better than any opera has been sung at the\nAcademy for years. Pretty ROSE HERSEE--when have we had a voice as pure,\nor a manner as charming as hers?--sings in this act, and her tones so\nclosely resemble those of NILSSON in their exquisite purity, that we\nwonder how she has escaped the abuse of that \"independent critical\njournal,\" the _Season_, until we notice a middle-aged gentleman sleeping\nquietly with a copy of the _Season_ on his lap, and remember that at\nNIBLO'S GARDEN the proprietor of the independent critical journal is\npermitted to distribute his mental soothing syrup, while at STEINWAY\nHALL a rival sheet is the only admitted programme.\n\nAnd I say--still thinking of NILSSON--to an experienced\ntheatre-goer,--\"Why does WATSON abuse NILSSON?\"\n\nAnd he answers, with the contemptuous, but obviously honest\ninquiry--\"Who's WATSON?\"\n\nReally appalled by the suggestion that there exists a man with soul and\nthings so completely dead as not to have heard of the great WATSON, I\nchange my question and ask him: \"Why does the _Season_ abuse NILSSON?\"\n\nHE.--\"The _Season_, my young friend, is a programme paper that is\ncirculated gratuitously and depends for support upon its advertizing\npatronage. A few managers permit it to be circulated in their theatres;\nthe remaining managers will not admit it. Among the latter are Mr.\nWALLACK, and MAX STRAKOSCH. Consequently, the _Season_ abuses WALLACK'S\nTheatre and NILSSON'S concerts--asserting that Mr. WALLACK has a\nwretched company, and that Miss NILSSON has no voice. The _Season_ is\nalso a comic paper, and its best joke is its assertion that it is an\n'independent critical journal.'\"\n\nYOUNG LADY IN COLORS.--\"This opera is dreadfully stupid.\"\n\nLIGHT-HAIRED YOUNG MAN.--\"But, MARY ANNE, it is one of Mozart's--the\n_Marriage of Figaro_. It is one of his most famous works.\"\n\nSHE.--\"Then I don't like Mozart. There was an Italian who wrote an opera\nthat was all about Figaro,--the _Nossy di Figaro_ was the name of it.\nOh, it is perfectly splendid; ever so much prettier than this.\"\n\nHE.--\"Why, my dear girl, the _Nozze di Figaro_ is the identical opera\nyou are now hearing.\"\n\nSHE.--\"There is young Mr. NATHAN ISAACS. Isn't he perfectly splendid?\"\n\nHE (sighing sadly).--\"Whenever you wish to go home, I am ready.\"\n\nSHE.--\"You are real disagreeable to-night, and I'm sorry I came with\nyou.\"\n\nRURAL PERSON.--\"Well, if this is the opery, I don't mind sayin' I like\nit. Susan said I couldn't understand a word of the gibberish these opery\nfolks squawked, but it's just as plain as psalm-singing. Miss RICHIN and\nthat HERSY gal are just the tallest kind of singers. If we had 'em in\nour choir, the Baptist folks might shut up their meetin'-house to\nwunst.\"\n\nZIMMERMANN.--\"When are we going to revive the Crook--did you ask? What\ndo we want to revive it for? Isn't the house full enough to-night to\nsatisfy anybody?\"\n\nFRIEND OF THE THEATRE--\"To be sure it is. Stick to this sort of thing,\nand you'll find it will pay better in the end than any amount of legs.\nNIBLO'S is now a respectable theatre.\n\n### Summary:"}

Both are corrupt; the work of two illiterate\ncopyists who--strange to say--were both smatterers enough to betray\ntheir little knowledge by converting _Pervigilium_ into _Per Virgilium_\n(_scilicet_, \"by Virgil\"): thus helping us to follow the process of\nthought by which the Middle Ages turned Virgil into a wizard. Here and\nthere the texts become quite silly, separately or in consent; and just\nwhere they agree in the most surprising way--_i.e._ in the arrangement\nof the lines--the conjectural emendator is invited to do his worst by a\nnote at the head of the older Codex, \"Sunt vero versus xxii\"--\"There are\nrightly twenty-two lines.\"\n\nThis has started much ingenious guess-work. But no really convincing\nrearrangement has been achieved as yet; and I have been content to take\nthe text pretty well as it stands, with a few corrections upon which\nmost scholars agree. With a poem of \"paratactic structure\" the best of\nus may easily go astray by transposing lines, or blocks of lines, to\ncorrespond with _our_ sequence of thought; and I shall be content if,\nfollowing the only texts to which appeal can be made,[1] my translation\nbe generally intelligible.\n\nIt runs pretty closely, line for line, with the original; because one\nmay love and emulate classical terseness even while despairing to rival\nit. But it does not attempt to be literal; for even were it worth doing,\nI doubt if it be possible for anyone in our day to hit precisely the\nnote intended by an author or heard by a reader in the eighth century.\nMen change subtly as nations succeed to nations, religions to religions,\nphilosophies to philosophies; and it is a property of immortal poetry to\nshift its appeal. It does not live by continuing to mean the some thing.\nIt grows as we grow. We smile, for instance, when some interlocutor in a\ndialogue of Plato takes a line from the _Iliad_ and applies it seriously\n_au pied de la lettre_. We can hardly conceive what the great line\nconveyed to him; but it may mean something equally serious to us, though\nin a different way.\n\n[1] Facsimiles of the two Codices can be studied in a careful edition of\nthe _Pervigilum_ by Mr Cecil Clementi, published by Mr B.H. Blackwell of\nOxford, 1911.\n\n\n\n\nPERVIGILIUM VENERIS\n\n_Cras amet qui nunquam amavit; quique amavit cras amet_.\nVer novum, ver jam canorurn, vere natus orbis est;\nVere concordant amores, vere nubunt alites,\nEt nemus comam resolvit de maritis imbribus.\nCras amorum copulatrix inter umbras arborum     5\nInplicat casas virentes de flagello myrteo:\nCras Dione jura dicit fulta sublimi throno.\n_Cras amet qui nunquam amavit; quique amavit cras amet_.\n\n_To-morrow--What news of to-morrow?\nNow learn ye to love who loved never--now ye who have loved, love anew_!\nIt is Spring, it is chorussing Spring; 'tis the birthday of Earth, and\n    for you!\nIt is Spring; and the Loves and the birds wing together and woo to accord\nWhere the bough to the rain has unbraided her locks as a bride to\n    her lord.\nFor she walks--she our Lady, our Mistress of Wedlock--the woodlands\n    atween,     5\nAnd the bride-bed she weaves them, with myrtle enlacing, with curtains\n    of green.\nLook aloft! list the law of Dione, sublime and enthroned in the blue:\n_Now learn ye to love who loved never--now ye who have loved, love anew_!\n\nTunc liquore de superno spumeo et ponti globo,\nCaerulas inter catervas, inter et bipedes equos,     10\nFecit undantem Dionen de maritis imbribus.\n_Cras amet qui nunquam amavit; quiqiie amavit cras amet_.\n\nIpsa gemmis purpurantem pingit annum floribus,\nIpsa surgentes papillas de Favoni spiritu\nUrget in toros tepentes; ipsa roris lucidi     15\nNoctis aura quem relinquit, spargit umentes aquas.\nEt micant lacrimae trementes de caduco pondere:\n\nTime was that a rain-cloud begat her, impregning the heave of the deep,\n'Twixt hooves of sea-horses a-scatter, stampeding the dolphins as\n    sheep.     10\nLo! arose of that bridal Dione, rainbow'd and besprent of its dew!\n_Now learn ye to love who loved never--now ye who have loved, love anew_!\n\nShe, she, with her gem-dripping finger enamels the wreath of the year;\nShe, she, when the maid-bud is nubile and swelling winds--whispers anear,\nDisguising her voice in the Zephyr's--\"So secret the bed!

A semicircular\nbalcony, L., with balustrade and marble seats, and an\nopening whence a flight of steps leads down to the\ncity. The city lies out of sight below the terrace;\nfrom which, between its cypresses and statuary, is\nseen a straight stretch of a canal; beyond the canal are\nsand-hills and the line of the open sea. Mountains,\nL., dip down to the sea and form a curve of the\ncoast._\n\n_As the curtain rises, a crowd of town and country\nfolk is being herded to the back of the terrace by the\nDucal Guard, under Cesario. Within the Chapel, to_\n_the sound of an organ, boys' voices are chanting the\nservice of the Mass._\n\n_Cesario, Gamba the Fool, Guards, Populace._\n\n\n_Cesario._ Way there! Give room! The Regent comes from Mass.\nGuards, butt them on the toes--way there! give room!\nPrick me that laggard's leg-importunate fools!\n\n_Guards._ Room for the Regent! Room!\n\n[_The sacring bell rings within the Chapel._\n\n_Cesario._ Hark there, the bell!\n\n[_A pause. Men of the crowd take off their caps._\n\nCould ye not leave, this day of all the year,\nYour silly suits, petitions, quarrels, pleas?\nCould ye not leave, this once in seven years,\nOur Lady to come holy-quiet from Mass.\nLean on the wall, and loose her cage-bird heart,\nTo lift and breast and dance upon the breeze.\nDraws home her lord the Duke?\n\n_Crowd._ Long live the Duke!\n\n_Cesario._ The devil, then! Why darken his approach?\n\n\n_Gamba (from the bench where he has been mending his\nviol)._ Because, Captain, 'tis a property knaves\nand fools have in common--to stand in their own\nlight, as 'tis of soldiers to talk bad logic. That\nknave, now--he with the red nose and the black\neye--the Duke's colours, loyal man!--you clap\nan iron on his leg, and ask him why he is not\ndown in the city, hanging them out of window!\nGo to: you are a soldier!\n\n_Cesario._ And you a Fool, and on your own showing\nstand in your own light.\n\n_Gamba._ Nay, neither in my own light, nor as a\nFool. So should myself stand between the sun\nand my shadow; whereas I am not myself--these\nseven years have I been but the shadow of a\nFool. Yet one must tune up for the Duke.\n\n_(Strikes his viol and sings.)_\n\n\"Bird of the South, my Rondinello----\"\n\nFlat-Flat!\n\n\n_Cesario (calling up to watchman on the Chapel roof)._ Ho there!

The curst canal\nDrawn level through the drawn-out level sand\nAnd thistle-tufts that stink as soon as pluck'd!\nGive me the hot crag and the dancing heat,\nGive me the Abruzzi, and the cushioned thyme--\nBrooks at my feet, high glittering snows above.\nWhat were thy music, viol, without a ridge?\n\n\n[_Noise of commotion in the city below._\n\n\n_Cesario_.

Yes--Count Lucio!\nHe nears, draws rein, dismounts!\n\n_Cesario_.                  Sure, he brings news.\n\n\n_Gamba_. I think he brings word the Duke is sick;\nhis loyal folk have drunk so much of his\nhealth.\n\n[_A murmur has been growing in the town below. It\nbreaks into cheers as Count Lucio comes springing\nup to the terrace._\n\n_Enter Lucio._\n\n\n_Lucio._ News! Where's the Regent? Eh? is Mass not said?\nCesario, news! I rode across the dunes;\nA pilot--Nestore--you know the man--\nCame panting.

I've a mind--\n\n\n[_He strides towards the door of the Chapel; but\npauses at the sound of chanting within, and\ncomes back to Cesario._\n\n\nMan, are you mute? I say the town's aflame\nBelow! But here, up here, you stand and stare\nLike prisoners loosed to daylight. Rub your eyes,\nBelieve!\n\n_Cesario (musing)._ It has been long.\n\n_Lucio._                            As tapestry\nPricked out by women's needles; point-device\nAs saints in fitted haloes. Yet they stab,\nThose needles. Oh, the devil take their tongues!\n\n_Cesario._ Why, what's the matter?\n\n_Lucio._ P'st! another lie\nAgainst the Countess Fulvia; and the train\nLaid to my sister's ear. Cesario,\nMy sister is a saint--and yet she married:\nTherefore should understand... Would saints, like cobblers,\nStick but to business in this naughty world!\nAh, well! the Duke comes home.\n\n_Cesario._ And what of that?\n\n_Lucio._ Release!\n\n_Cesario._ Release?\n\n_Lucio (mocking a chant within the Chapel)._ From priests and petticoats\nDeliver us, Good Lord!\n\n_Gamba (strikes a chord on viol). AMEN!_\n\n_Cesario._ Count Lucio,\nThese seven years agone, when the Duke sailed,\nYou were a child--a pretty, forward boy;\nAnd I a young lieutenant of the Guard,\nBurning to serve abroad. But that day, rather,\nI clenched my nails over an inward wound:\nFor that a something manlier than my years--\nLook, bearing, what-not--by the Duke not miss'd,\nCondemned me to promotion: I must bide\nAt home, command the Guard! 'Tis an old hurt,\nBut scalded on my memory.... Well, they sailed!\nAnd from the terrace here, sick with self-pity,\nWrapped in my wrong, forgetful of devoir,\nI watch'd them through a mist--turned with a sob--\nUptore my rooted sight--\n                         There, there she stood;\nHer hand press'd to her girdle, where the babe\nStirred in her body while she gazed--she gazed--\nBut slowly back controlled her eyes, met mine;\nSo--with how wan, how small, how brave a smile!--\nReached me her hands to kiss...\n                                O royal hands!\nWhat burdens since they have borne let Adria tell.\nBut hear me swear by them, Count Lucio--\nWho slights our Regent throws his glove to me.\n\n_Lucio._ Why, soothly, she's my sister!\n\n_Cesario._ 'But the court\nIs dull? No masques, few banquetings--and prayers\nBe long, and youth for pastime leaps the gate?'\nYet if the money husbanded on feasts\nHave fed our soldiery against the Turk,\nYear after year, and still the State not starved;\nWas't not well done? And if, responsible\nTo God, and lonely, she has leaned on God\nToo heavily for our patience, was't not wise?--\nAnd well, though weary?\n\n_Lucio._ I tell you, she's my sister!\n\n_Cesario._ Well, an you will, bridle on that. Lord Lucio,\nYou named the Countess Fulvia. To my sorrow,\nTwo hours ago I called on her and laid her\nUnder arrest.\n\n_Lucio._ The devil! For what?\n\n_Cesario._ For that\nA lady, whose lord keeps summer in the hills\nTo nurse a gouty foot, should penalize\nHis dutiful return by shutting doors\nAnd hanging out a ladder made of rope,\nOr prove its safety by rehearsing it\nUpon a heavier man.\n\n_Lucio._ I'll go to her.\nOh, this is infamous!\n\n_Cesario._ Nay, be advised:\nNo hardship irks the lady, save to sit\nAt home and feed her sparrows; nor no worse\nAnnoy than from her balcony to spy\n(Should the eye rove) a Switzer of the Guard\nAt post between her raspberry-canes, to watch\nAnd fright the thrushes from forbidden fruit.\n\n_Lucio._ Infamous! infamous!\n\n_Cesario._ Enough, my lord:\nThe Regent!\n\n\n[_Doors of the Chapel open. The organ sounds,\nwith voices of choir chanting the recessional.\nThe Court enters from Mass, attending the\nRegent Ottilia and her son Tonino. She wears\na crown and heavy dalmatic. Her brother\nLucio, controlling himself with an effort, kisses\nher hand and conducts her to the marble bench,\nwhich serves for her Chair of State. She bows,\nreceiving the homage of the crowd; but, after\nseating herself, appears for a few moments unconscious\nof her surroundings. Then, as her\nrosary slips from her fingers and falls heavily\nat her feet, she speaks._\n\n_Regent._ So slips the chain linking this world with Heaven,\nAnd drops me back to earth: so slips the chain\nThat hangs my spirit to the Redeemer's cross\nAbove pollution in the pure swept air\nWhereunder frets this hive: so slips the chain--\n_(She starts up)_--God! the dear sound! Was that his anchor dropped?\nSpeak to the watchman, one! Call to the watch!\nWhat news?\n\n_Cesario._ Aloft! What news?\n\n_Voice above._ No sail as yet!\n\n_Regent._ Ah, pardon, sirs! My ears are strung to-day,\nAnd play false airs invented by the wind.\nMethought a hawse-pipe rattled...\n\n_Gamba (chants to his viol). Shepherds, see--\nLo! What a mariner love hath made me!_\n\n_Regent._ What chants the Fool?\n\n_Gamba._ Madonna, 'tis a trifle\nMade by a silly poet on wives that stand\nAll night at windows listening the surf--\n_Now he comes! Will he come? Alas! no, no!_\n\n_Lucio._ Peace, lively! Madam, there is news--brave news!\nI'm from the watch-house. There the pilots tell\nOf sixteen sail to the southward! Sixteen sail,\nAnd nearing fast!\n\n_Regent._ Praise God! dear Lucio!\n\n\n[_She has seated herself again. She takes Lucio's\nhand and speaks, petting it._\n\n\nWhat?  Glowing with my happiness?  That's like you.\nBut for yourself the hour, too, holds release.\n\n_Lucio (between sullenness and shame, with a glance at\nCesario)._ \"Release?\"\n\n_Regent._          You will forgive? I have great need\nTo be forgiven: sadly I have been slack\nIn guardianship, and by so much betrayed\nMy promise to our mother's passing soul.\nMyself in cares immersed, I left the child\nAmong his toys--and turn to find him man--\nBut yet so much a boy that boyhood can\n_(Wistfully)_ Laugh in his honest eyes? Forgive me, Lucio!\nTell me, whate'er have slackened, there has slipped\nNo knot of love. To-morrow we'll make sport,\nBe playmates and invent new games, and old--\nWreath flowers for crowns--\n\n\n[_He drags his hand away. She gazes at him\nwistfully, and turns to the Captain of the\nGuard._\n\n\n                              Cesario,\nWhat are the suits?\n\n_Cesario._        They are but three to-day,\nMadonna. First, a scoundrel here in irons\nFor having struck the Guard.\n\n_Regent (eying the culprit)._            His name, I think,\nIs Donatello Crocco. Hey? You improve,\nGood man. The last time 'twas your wife you basted.\nAt this rate, in another year or two\nYou'll bang the Turk. Do you confess the assault?\n\n_Prisoner._ I do.\n\n_Regent._ Upon a promise we dismiss you.\nYour tavern, as it comes into our mind,\nIs the 'Three Cups.' So many, and no more,\nYou'll drink to-day--have we your word? Three cups,\nAnd each a _Viva_ for the Duke's return.\n\n_Prisoner._ Your Highness, I'll not take it at the price\nOf my good manners. I'm a gallant man:\nAnd who in Adria calls. 'Three cheers for the Duke!'\nBut adds a fourth for the Duchess? Lady, nay;\nGrant me that fourth, or back I go to the cells!\n\n\n[_The Regent laughs and nods to the Guard to release\nhim._\n\n\n_Regent._ What next?\n\n_An Old Woman (very rapidly)._ Your Highness will not know me--Zia\nAgnese, Giovannucci's wife that was;\nAnd feed a two-three cows, as a widow may,\nOn the marshes where the grass is salt and sweet\nAs your Highness knows--and always true to pail\nUntil this Nicolo--\n\n_Nicolo._ Lies! lies, your Highness!\n\n_Old Woman._ Having a quarrel, puts the evil eye\nOn Serafina. She's my best of cows,\nIn stall with calf but ten days weaned.\n\n_Nicolo._ Lies! lies!\n\n_Old Woman._ I would your Highness saw her! When that thief\nHangs upon Lazarus' bosom, he'll be bidding\nA ducat for each drop of milk he's cost me,\nTo cool his tongue.\n\n_Regent._ Ay--ay, the cow is sick,\nI think; and mind me, being country-bred,\nOf a cure for such: which is, to buy a comb\nAnd comb the sufferer's tail at feeding-time.\nIf Zia Agnese do but this, she'll counter\nThe Evil Eye, and maybe with her own\nDetect who thieves her Serafina's hay.\n\n_Old Woman._ God bless your Highness!\n\n_Nicolo._ God bless your Highness!\n\n_Regent (taking up a fresh suit)._Why, what's here? \"_Costanza,\nWife of Giuseppe Boni, citeth him\nAnd sueth to live separate, for neglect\nAnd divers beatings, as to wit----_\" H'm, h'm--\n_Likewise to keep the child Geronimo,\nBegotten of his body._ You defend\nThe suit, Giuseppe?\n\n_A Young Peasant (shrugs his shoulders)._ As the woman will!\nI'll not deny I beat her.\n\n_Regent._ But neglect!\nHow came you to neglect her? Look on her--\nThe handsome, frowsy slut, that, by appearance,\nHath never washed her body since she wed.\nA beating we might pass. But how neglect\nTo take her by the neck unto the pump\nAnd hold her till her wet and furious face\nWere once again worth kissing? Well--well--well!\nNeglect is proven. She shall have deserts:\n_(To a Clerk)_ But--write, \"Defendant keeps his lawful child.\"\n\n_Young Peasant._ My lady--\n\n_Wife._ Nay, my lady--\n\n_Regent._ Eh? What's this?\n\n_Wife._ The poor _bambino_! Nay, 'twas not the suit!\nHow should Giuseppe, being a fool, a man--\n\n_Young Peasant._ Aye, aye: that's sense. I love him: still, you see--\n\n_Regent._ An if my judgment suit you not, go home,\nThe pair. _(As they are going she calls the woman back.)_\n         Costanza! hath your husband erred\nWith other woman?\n\n_Young Peasant_.    Never!\n\n_Wife_.                    I'll not charge him\nWith that.\n\n_Regent_.    But, yes, you may. This man hath held\nAnother woman to his breast.\n\n_Wife_.                        Her name?\nThat I may tear her eyes!\n\n_Regent_.                   Her name's Costanza.\nThe same Costanza that, with body washed,\nWith ribbon in her hair, light in her eyes,\nArrayed a cottage to allure his heart.\nGo home, poor fools, and find her!...\n          Heigh! No others?       [_Heaves a sigh._\nCaptain, dismiss the Guard. The watch, aloft--\nSet him elsewhere. We would not be o'erlooked.\nYou only, Lucio--you, Lucetta--stay;\nYou for a while, Cesario.\n\n                [_Exeunt Courtiers, Guard, Crowd, etc._\n\nHeigh! that's over--\nThe last Court of the Regent; and the books\nAccounts of stewardship, my seven years all,\nClosed here for audit.\n               Nay, there's one thing more--\nBrother, erewhile I spoke you sisterly,\nYou turned away, and still you bite your lip:\nSigns that may short my preface. It concerns\nThe Countess Fulvia.\n\n_Lucio_. Ha!\n\n_Regent_. Go, bring her, Captain.\n\n                                   [_Exit Cesario_.\n\nList to me, Lucio: listen, brother dear,\nFirst playmate-child, tending whose innocence\nMyself learned motherhood. Shall I deny\nYouth to be loved and follow after love?\nThere is a love breaks like a morning beam\nOn the husht novice kneeling by his arms;\nAnd worse there is, whose kisses strangle love,\nWhose feet take hold of hell. My Lucio,\n    Follow not that!\n\n_Lucio_. Why, who--who hath maligned\n    The Countess?\n\n_Regent_ Not maligned. Lucetta, here--\n\n_Lucio_. Lucetta! Curse Lucetta and her tongue!\n    Am I a child, to be nagged by waiting-maids?\n\n_Regent_. No, but a man, and shall weigh evidence.\n\n_Lucio_. But I'll not hear it! If her viper tongue\n    Can kill, why kill it must. But send me a man,\n    And I will smite his mouth--ay, slit his tongue--\n    That dares defame the Countess!\n\n_Regent_. Stay: she comes.\n\n           [_Enter the Countess Fulvia, Cesario attending._\n\n    Madam, the reason wherefore you are summoned\n    No doubt you guess, from a rude earlier call\n    Our Captain paid you. Certain practices,\n    Which you may force me name, are charged upon\n         you\nOn testimony you may force me call\n    And may with freedom question.\n\n_Fulvia_. I'll not question:\n    No, nor I will not answer.\n\n_Lucio_. Then I'll answer!'\n    For me, for all, she is innocent!\n\n_Regent_. For you?\n    We'll hope it: but 'for all''s more wide an oath\n    Than you can swear, sir. I'll not bandy you\n    Words nor debate. Myself the ladder saw;\n    Lucetta, here, the ladder and the man.\n    _What_ man she will not say. Cesario\n    Has tracked his footprint on her garden plots.\n    Must we say more?\n\n_Fulvia_. No need. Her fingering mind\n    Is a close cupboard turning all things rancid.\n\n_Lucio_. Yea, for such wry-necks all the world's a lawn\n    To peek and peer and pounce a sinful worm;\n    The fatter, the more luscious.\n\n_Regent. _ Lucio,\n    This woman nought gainsays.\n\n_Fulvia (fiercely)._ As why should I?\n    I'll question not, nor answer. 'Neath your brow\n    My sentence hunches, crawls, like cat to spring.\n    Pah! there's no prude will match your virtuous wife\n    You'd banish me?\n\n_Regent._ I do. Cesario,\n    See to it the City gate shuts not to-night.\n    And she this side.\n\n_Fulvia (laughs recklessly)._ To-night? To-night's your own.\n    Most modest woman! Duchess, there's a well\n    By the road, some seven miles beyond the town.\n    There, 'neath the stars, I'll dip a hand and drink\n    To the good Duke's disport. But have a care!\n    That cup's not yet to lip.\n\n_Regent.        _ Captain, remove her.\n    Lucio, remain.\n\n_[Exeunt the Countess Fulvia, Cesario following]_\n\n_Lucio._ I'll not remain--When ice\n    Sits judge of fire, what justice shall be done?\n    Sister, there be your books--peruse them. There\n    The sea-line--bide you so with back to it.\n    While the cold inward heat of cruelty\n    Warms what was once your heart, now crusted o'er\n    With duty and slimed with poisonous drip of tongues.\n    God help the Duke, if what he left he'd find!\n\n                                               _[Exit Lucio]_\n\n_Regent._ Is't so, I wonder? Go, Lucetta, fetch\n    My glass, if haply I may tell.\n\n                                             _[Exit Lucetta.]_\n\n                                              Is't so?\n    And have these years enforced, encrusted me\n    To something monstrous, neither woman nor man?\nMy lord, my lord! too heavy was the load\n    You laid! Yet I'll not blame you: for myself\n    Ruled the straight path the long account correct\n    As in these books, my ledgers....\n\n  [_While she turns the pages, Gamba the Fool creeps\n  in and hoists himself on the balustrade.

Mindest thou,\n    By Villalago, where from Sanno's lake\n    The stream, our Tasso, hurls it down the glen?\n    One noon, with Lucio--ever in those days\n    With Lucio--on a rock within the spray,\n    I wove a ferny garland, while the boy\n    Roamed, but returned in triumph, having trapped\n    A bee in a bell-flower--held it to my ear,\n    Laughing, dissembling that he feared to loose\n    The hairy thief. So laughed we--and were still,\n    As deep in Vallescura wound a horn,\n    And up the pathway 'neath the dappling bough\n    Came riding--flecked with sunshine, man and horse,--\n    My lord, my lover; and that song, that song\n    Upon his lips....\n\n_Voice of Watchman_.

O this lightness!\n    I'll draw him like a fairy, dance and double--\n    Yet not so fast but he shall overtake\n    At length, and catch me panting.

I'd have them wanton.\nMake jest this mantle hides the maid I was.\nI'll have no priest, no doctor--Fetch Tonino!\nI must present his son--\n[_Lucetta runs out._\nAll's acted quick:\nBride-bed, conception, birth--and death!

Look in my face, Ottilia--\nHearken me, all! One thing these seven years\nMy life hath lacked, which wanting, all your cannon,\nYour banners, _vivas_, bells that rock the roofs,\nThrong'd windows, craning faces--all--all--all\nWere phantasms, were noise.--\n\n_Lucio_ (_exclaims_). Why look, here's blood!\nHere, on the boy's hand!\n\n_Regent._   Ay! a scratch, no worse,\nHere, when I pinned my robe.\n\n_Duke_ (_continuing_). Nay, friends, this moment\nMy Duchy her dear hand restores to me\nTo me's a dream. More buoyant would I tread\nDumb street, deserted square, climb ruin'd wall,\nWhere in a heap beneath a broken flag\nLay Adria.--\nSo that amid the ruins stood my love\nAnd stretched her hands so faintly--stretched her hands\nSo faintly. See! She's mine! She lifts them--\n\n_Regent_ (_totters and falls into his arms with a tired, happy\nlaugh, which ends in a cry as his arms enfold her_).

Where is she?\n\n_Cesario._ Dead.\nI raised the cry: the people pointed after;\nRan with me, ravening. Just this side the bridge\nShe heard our howl and turned--drew back the dagger\nRed with our lady's blood, then drove it home\nClean to her own black heart.\n\n_Regent._   God pardon her!\nI would what blood of mine clung to the blade\nMight mix with hers and sweeten it for mercy.\n\n_Lucio._ Will you forgive her? Then forgive not me!\n\n### Summary:"}

Verplanck_.\n\nOn its conclusion HUGH MAXWELL submitted the following resolution, which\nwas adopted unanimously:\n\n_Resolved_, That the thanks of this Society be presented to Mr. BRYANT\nfor his eloquent and instructive discourse, delivered this evening, and\nthat he be requested to furnish a copy for publication.\n\nExtract from the Minutes,\n\nAndrew Warner,\n_Recording Secretary_.\n\n\n\n\nOfficers of the Society, Elected January, 1870.\n\n\nPresident, Thomas De Witt, D.D.\nFirst Vice-President, Gulian C. Verplanck, LL.D.\nSecond Vice-President, John A. Dix, LL.D.\nForeign Corresponding Secretary, John Romeyn Brodhead, LL.D.\nDomestic Corresponding Secretary, William J. Hoppin.\nRecording Secretary, Andrew Warner.\nTreasurer, Benjamin H. Field.\nLibrarian, George H. Moore, LL.D.\n\n\n\n\nThe life of him in honor of whose memory we are assembled, was prolonged\nto so late a period and to the last was so full of usefulness, that it\nalmost seemed a permanent part of the organization and the active movement\nof society here. His departure has left a sad vacuity in the framework\nwhich he helped to uphold and adorn. It is as if one of the columns which\nsupport a massive building had been suddenly taken away; the sight of the\nspace which it once occupied troubles us, and the mind wearies itself in\nthe unavailing wish to restore it to its place.\n\nIn what I am about to say, I shall put together some notices of the\ncharacter, the writings, and the services of this eminent man, but the\nportraiture which I shall draw will be but a miniature. To do it full\njustice a larger canvas would be required than the one I propose to take.\nHe acted in so many important capacities; he was connected in so many ways\nwith our literature, our legislation, our jurisprudence, our public\neducation, and public charities, that it would require a volume adequately\nto set forth the obligations we owe to the exertion of his fine faculties\nfor the general good.\n\nGulian Crommelin Verplanck was born in Wall street, in the city of New\nYork, on the 6th of August, 1786. The house in which he was born was a\nlarge yellow mansion, standing on the spot on which the Assay Office has\nsince been built. A little beyond this street, a few rods only, lay the\nisland of New York in all its original beauty, so that it was but a step\nfrom Wall street to the country. His father, Daniel Crommelin Verplanck,\nwas a respectable citizen of the old stock of colonists from Holland, who\nfor several terms was a member of Congress, and whom I remember as a\nshort, stout old gentleman, commonly called Judge Verplanck, from having\nbeen in the latter years of his life a Judge of the County Court of\nDutchess. Here he resided in the latter years of his life on the\npatrimonial estate, where the son, ever since I knew him, was always in\nthe habit of passing a part of the summer. It had been in the family of\nthe Verplancks ever since their ancestor Gulian Verplanck with Francis\nRombout, in 1683, purchased it, with other lands, of the Wappinger Indians\nfor a certain amount of money and merchandize, specified in a deed signed\nby the Sachem Sakoraghuck and other chiefs, the spelling of whose names\nseems to defy pronunciation. The two purchasers afterwards divided this\ndomain, and to the Verplancks was assigned a tract which they have ever\nsince held.\n\nThis fine old estate has a long western border on the Hudson, and extends\neasterly for four or five miles to the village of Fishkill. About half a\nmile from the great river stands the family mansion, among its ancient\ngroves, a large stone building of one story when I saw it; with a sharp\nroof and dormer windows, beside its old fashioned and well stocked garden.\nA winding path leads down to the river's edge, through an ancient forest\nwhich has stood there ever since Hendrick Hudson navigated the river\nbearing his name, and centuries before. This mansion was the country\nretreat of Mr. Verplanck ever since I knew him, and here it was that his\ngrandfather on the paternal side, Samuel Verplanck, passed much of his\ntime during our revolutionary war, in which, although he took no share in\npolitical measures, his inclinations were on the side of the mother\ncountry. This Samuel Verplanck, by a custom which seems not to have become\nobsolete in his time, was betrothed when but seven years old to his cousin\nJudith Crommelin, the daughter of a wealthy banker of the Huguenot stock\nin Amsterdam. When the young gentleman was of the proper age he was sent\nto make the tour of Europe, and bring home his bride. He was married in\nthe banker's great stone house, standing beside a fair Dutch garden, with\na wide marble entrance hall, the counting room on one side of it, and the\ndrawing room, bright with gilding, on the other. When the grandson, in\nafter years, visited Amsterdam, the mansion which had often been described\nto him by his grandmother, had to him quite a familiar aspect.\n\nThe lady from Amsterdam was particularly accomplished, and versed not only\nin several modern languages, but in Greek and Latin, speaking fluently the\nLatin, of which the Colloquies of her great countryman, Erasmus, furnish\nso rich a store of phrases for ordinary dialogue. Her conversation is said\nto have been uncommonly brilliant and her society much sought. During the\nrevolutionary war her house was open to the British officers, General\nHowe, and others, accomplished men, of whom she had many anecdotes to\nrelate to her grandson, when he came under her care. For the greater part\nof this time her husband remained at the country seat in Fishkill, quietly\noccupied with his books and the care of his estate. Meantime, she wrote\nanxious letters to her father, in Amsterdam, which were answered in neat\nFrench. The banker consoled his daughter by saying that \"Mr. Samuel\nVerplanck was a man so universally known and honored, both for his\nintegrity and scholarly attainments, that in the end all would be well.\"\nThis proved true; the extensive estate at Fishkill was never confiscated,\nand its owner was left unmolested.\n\nOn the mother's side, our friend had an ancestry of quite different\npolitical views. His grandfather, William Samuel Johnson, of Stratford, in\nConnecticut, was one of the revolutionary fathers. Before the revolution,\nhe was the agent of Connecticut in England; when it broke out he took a\nzealous part in the cause of the revolted colonies; he was a delegate to\nCongress from his State when Congress sat in New York, and he aided in\nframing the Constitution of the United States. Afterwards, he was\nPresident of Columbia College from the year 1787 to the year 1800, when,\nresigning the post, he returned to Stratford, where he died in 1819, at\nthe age of ninety-two. His father, the great-grandfather of the subject of\nthis memoir, was Dr. Samuel Johnson, of Stratford, one of the finest\nAmerican scholars of his day, and the first President of Columbia College,\nwhich however, he left after nine years, to return and pass a serene old\nage at Stratford. He had been a Congregational minister in Connecticut,\nbut by reading the works of Barrow and other eminent divines of the\nAnglican Church, became a convert to that church, went to England, and\ntaking orders returned to introduce its ritual into Connecticut. He was\nthe friend of Bishop Berkeley, whose arm-chair was preserved as an\nheir-loom in his family. When in England, he saw Pope, who gave him\ncuttings from his Twickenham willow. These he brought from the banks of\nthe Thames, and planted on the wilder borders of his own beautiful river\nthe Housatonic, which at Stratford enters the Sound. They were, probably,\nthe progenitors of all the weeping willows which are seen in this part of\nthe country, where they rapidly grow to a size which I have never seen\nthem attain in any other part of the world.\n\nThe younger of these Dr. Johnsons--for they both received the degree of\nDoctor of Divinity from the University of Oxford--had a daughter\nElizabeth, who married Daniel Crommelin Verplanck, the son of Samuel\nVerplanck, and the only fruit of their marriage was the subject of this\nmemoir. The fair-haired young mother was a frequent visitor with her child\nto Stratford, where, under the willow trees from Twickenham, as appears\nfrom some of her letters, he learned to walk. She died when he was but\nthree years old, leaving the boy to the care of his grandmother, by whom\nhe was indulgently yet carefully reared.\n\nThe grandmother is spoken of as a lively little lady, often seen walking\nup Wall Street, dressed in pink satin and in dainty high heeled shoes,\nwith a quaint jewelled watch swinging from her waist. Wall Street was\nthen the fashionable quarter; the city, still in its embryo stater\nextending but a little way above it; it was full of dwelling houses, with\nhere and there a church, which has long since disappeared. Over that\nregion of the metropolis where Mammon is worshipped in six days out of\nseven, there now broods on Sunday a sepulchral silence, but then the walks\nwere thronged with churchgoers. The boy was his grandmother's constant\ncompanion. He was trained by her to love books and study, to which,\nhowever, he seems to have had a natural and inherited inclination. It is\nsaid that at a very tender age she taught him to declaim passages from\nLatin authors, standing on a table, and rewarded him with hot pound-cake.\nAnother story is, that she used to put sugar-plums near his bedside, to be\nat hand in case he should take a fancy to them in the night. But, as he\nwas not spoiled by indulgence, it is but fair to conclude that her gentle\nmethod of educating him was tempered by firmness on proper occasions--a\nquality somewhat rare in grandmothers. A letter from one of her\ndescendants playfully says:\n\n\"It is a picture to think of her, seated at a marvellous Dutch bureau, now\nin possession of her great-grand-daughters, which is filled with a\ncomplexity of small and mysterious drawers, talking to the child, while\nher servant built the powdered tower on her head, or hung the diamond\nrings in her ears. Very likely, at such times, the child was thrusting his\nlittle fingers into the rouge pot, or making havoc with the powder, and\nperhaps she knew no better way to bring him to order than to tell him of\nmany of a fright of her own in the war, or she may have gone further back\nin history, and told the boy how her and his Huguenot ancestors fled from\nFrance when the bad King Louis forbade every form of worship but his own.\"\n\nDr. Johnson, the grandfather of young Verplanck, on the mother's side,\ncame from Stratford to be President of Columbia College, the year after\nhis grandson was born. To him, in an equal degree with his grandmother, we\nmust give the credit of bringing forward the precocious boy in his early\nstudies. I have diligently inquired what school he attended and who were\nhis teachers, but can hear of no other. His father had married again, and\nto the lively Huguenot lady was left the almost entire charge of the boy.\nHe was a born scholar; he took to books as other boys take to marbles; and\nthe lessons which he received in the household sufficed to prepare him for\nentering college when yet a mere child, at eleven years of age. He took\nhis first degree four years afterwards, in 1801, one year after his\nmaternal grandfather had returned to Stratford. To that place he very\nfrequently resorted in his youth, and there, in the well-stored and\nwell-arranged library he pursued the studies he loved. The tradition is\nthat he conned his Greek lessons lying flat on the floor with his thumb in\nhis mouth, and the fingers of the other hand employed in twisting a lock\nof the brown, hair on his forehead. He took no pleasure in fishing or in\nhunting; I doubt whether he ever let off a fowling-piece or drew a trout\nfrom the brook in his life. He was fond of younger children, and would\nrecreate himself in play with his little relatives, but was no visitor to\nother families. His contemporaries, Washington Irving, James K. Paulding,\nand Governeur Kemble, had their amusements and frolics, in which he took\nno part. According to Mr. Kemble, the elder men of the time held up to the\nyouths the example of young Verplanck, so studious and accomplished, and\nso ready with every kind of knowledge, and withal of such faultless\nhabits, as a model for their imitation.\n\nI have said that his relatives on the mother's side were of a different\npolitical school from his high tory grandmother. From them he would hear\nof the inalienable rights of the people, and the duty, under certain\ncircumstances, of revolution; from her he would hear of the obligation of\nloyalty and obedience. The Johnsons would speak of the patriotism, the\nwisdom, and the services of Franklin; the grandmother of the virtues and\naccomplishments of Cornwallis. The boy, of course, had to choose between\nthese different sides, and he chose the side of his country and of the\npeople.\n\nI think that I perceive in these circumstances how it was that the mind of\nVerplanck was educated to that independence of judgment, and that\nself-reliance, which in after life so eminently distinguished it. He never\nadopted an opinion for the reason that it had been adopted by another. On\nsome points--on more, I think, than is usual with most men--he was content\nnot to decide, but when he formed an opinion it was his own. He had no\nhesitation in differing from others if he saw reason; indeed, he sometimes\nshowed that he rather liked to differ, or chose at least, by questioning\ntheir opinions, to intimate that they were prematurely formed. Another\nresult of the peculiar political education which I have described, was the\nfairness with which he judged of the characters and motives of men who\nwere not of his party. I saw much, very much of him while he was a member\nof Congress, when political animosities were at their fiercest, and I must\nsay that I never knew a party man who had less party rancor, or who was\nmore ready to acknowledge in his political opponents the good qualities\nwhich they really possessed.\n\nAfter taking his degree he read law in the office of Josiah Ogden Hoffman,\nan eminent member of the New York bar, much esteemed in social life, whose\nhouse was the resort of the best company in New York. His first public\naddress, a Fourth of July oration, was delivered when he was eighteen\nyears of age. It was printed, but no copy of it is now to be found. In due\nseason he was admitted to the bar, and opened an office for the practice\nof law in New York. A letter from Dr. Moore, formerly President of\nColumbia College, relates that Verplanck and himself took an office\ntogether on the east side of Pearl street, opposite to Hanover square.\n\"Little business as I had then,\" proceeds the Doctor, \"he seemed to have\nstill less. Indeed I am not aware that he had, or cared to have, any legal\nbusiness whatever. He spent much of his time out of the office and was not\nvery studious when within, but it was evident that he read or had read\nelsewhere to good purpose, for though I read more Greek than law and\nthought myself studious, I had occasion to discover more than once that he\nwas a better Grecian than I, and could enlighten my ignorance.\" From other\nsources I learn that in his legal studies he delighted in the reports of\nlaw cases in Norman French, that he was fond of old French literature, and\nread Rabelais in the perplexing French of the original. It is mentioned in\nsome accounts of his life that he was elected in 1811 to the New York\nHouse of Assembly by a party called the malcontents, but I have not had\nthe means of verifying this account, nor am I able to discover what were\nthe objects for which the party called malcontents was formed. In this\nyear an incident occurred of more importance to him than his election to\nthe Assembly.\n\nOn the 8th of August, 1811, the Annual Commencement of Columbia College\nwas held in Trinity Church. Among those who were to receive the degree of\nBachelor of Arts was a young man named Stevenson, who had composed an\noration to be delivered on the platform. It contained some passages of a\npolitical nature, insisting on the duty of a representative to obey the\nwill of his constituents. Political parties were at that time much\nexasperated against each other, and Dr. Wilson of the College, to whom the\noration was submitted, acting it was thought at the suggestion of Dr. John\nMason, the eloquent divine, who was then Provost of the College, struck\nout the passages in question and directed that they should be omitted in\nthe delivery. Stevenson spoke them notwithstanding, and was then privately\ninformed by one of the professors that his degree would be denied him.\nYet, when the diplomas were delivered, he mounted the platform with the\nother graduates and demanded the degree of Dr. Mason. It was refused\nbecause of his disobedience. Mr. Hugh Maxwell, afterwards eminent as an\nadvocate, sprang upon the platform and appealed to the audience against\nthis denial of what he claimed to be the right of Stevenson. Great\nconfusion followed, shouts, applauses and hisses, in the midst of which\nVerplanck appeared on the platform saying: \"The reasons are not\nsatisfactory; Mr. Maxwell must be supported,\" and then he moved \"that the\nthanks of the audience be given to Mr. Maxwell for his spirited defence of\nan injured man.\" It was some time before the tumult could be allayed, the\naudience taking part with the disturbers; but the result was that Maxwell,\nVerplanck, and several others were prosecuted for riot in the Mayor's\nCourt. DeWitt Clinton was then Mayor of New York. In his charge to the\njury he inveighed with great severity against the accused, particularly\nVerplanck, of whose conduct he spoke as a piece of matchless impudence,\nand declared the disturbance to be one of the grossest and most shameless\noutrages he had ever known. They were found guilty; Maxwell, Verplanck,\nand Stevenson were fined two hundred dollars each, and several others\nless. An appeal was entered by the accused but afterwards withdrawn. I\nhave heard one of our judges express a doubt whether this disturbance\ncould properly be considered as a riot, but they did not choose to avail\nthemselves of the doubt, if there was any, and submitted.\n\nThere is this extenuation of the rashness of these young men, that Dr.\nMason, to whom was attributed the attempt to suppress certain passages in\nStevenson's oration, was himself in the habit of giving free expression to\nhis political sentiments in the pulpit. He belonged to the federal party,\nStevenson to the party then called republican.\n\nI have said the accused submitted; but the phrase is scarcely accurate.\nVerplanck took his own way of obtaining redress, and annoyed Clinton with\nsatirical attacks for several years afterward. Some of these appeared in a\nnewspaper called the _Corrector_, but those which attracted the most\nattention, were the pamphlets styled Letters of Abimelech Coody, Ladies'\nShoemaker, the first of which was published in 1811, addressed to Dr.\nSamuel Latham Mitchell.\n\nThe war went on until Clinton or some friend was provoked to answer in a\npamphlet entitled An Account of Abimelech Coody and other celebrated\nWorthies of New York, in a Letter from a Traveller. The writer saterizes\nnot only Verplanck, but James K. Paulding and Washington Irving, of whose\nHistory of New York he speaks disparagingly. In what he says of Verplanck\nhe allows himself to refer to his figure and features as subjects of\nridicule. This war I think was closed by the publication of \"The Bucktail\nBards,\" as the little volume is called, which contains The State\nTriumvirate, a Political Tale, and the Epistles of Brevet Major Pindar\nPuff. These I have heard spoken of as the joint productions of Verplanck\nand Rudolph Bunner, a scholar and a man of wit. The State Triumvirate is\nin octo-syllabic verse, and in the manner of Swift, but the allusions are\nobscure, and it is a task to read it. The notes, in which the hand of\nVerplanck is very apparent, are intelligible enough and are clever,\ncaustic and learned. The Epistles, which are in heroic verse, have\nstriking passages, and the notes are of a like incisive character. De Witt\nClinton, then Governor of the State, valued himself on his devotion to\nscience and literature, but he was sometimes obliged, in his messages and\npublic discourses, to refer to compends which are in every body's hands,\nand his antagonists made this the subject of unsparing ridicule.\n\nIn the family of Josiah Ogden Hoffman, lived Mary Eliza Fenno, the sister\nof his wife, and daughter of John Ward Fenno, originally of Boston, and\nafterwards proprietor of a newspaper published in Philadelphia, entitled\nthe _Gazette of the United States_. Between this young lady and Verplanck\nthere grew up an attachment, and in 1811 they were married. I have seen an\nexquisite miniature of her by Malbone, taken in her early girlhood when\nabout fifteen years old--beautiful as an angel, with light chestnut hair\nand a soft blue eye, in the look of which is a touch of sadness, as if\ncaused by some dim presentiment of her early death. I remember hearing\nMiss Sedgwick say that she should always think the better of Verplanck for\nhaving been the husband of Eliza Fenno. Several of her letters written to\nhim before their marriage are preserved, which, amidst the sprightliness\nnatural to her age, show a more than usual thoughtfulness. She rallies him\non being adopted by the mob, and making harangues at ward meetings. She\nplayfully chides him for wandering from the Apostolic Church to hear\npopular preachers and clerks that sing well; which she regards as crimes\nagainst the memory of his ancestors--an allusion to that part of the\nfamily pedigree which traced his descent in some way from the royal line\nof the Stuarts. She rallies him on his passion for old books, remarking\nthat some interesting works had just appeared which must be kept from him\ntill he reaches the age of three score, when they will be fit for his\nperusal. She writes to him from Boston, that he is accounted there an\namazingly plain spoken man--he had called the Boston people heretics. She\nwrites to him in Stratford, imagining him in Bishop Berkeley's arm-chair,\nsurrounded by family pictures and huge folios. These letters were\ncarefully preserved by her husband till his death, along with various\nmemorials of her whom he had lost; locks of her sunny brown hair, the\ndiamond ring which he had placed on her finger when they were engaged to\neach other, wrapt in tresses of the same bright hair, and miniatures of\nher, which the family never heard of till he died; all variously disposed\namong the papers in the drawers of his desk; so that whenever he opened\nit, he might be reminded of her, and her memory might become a part of his\ndaily life. With these were preserved some letters of his own, written to\nher about the same time, and of a sportive character. In one of these he\nlaments the passing away of the good old customs, and simple ways of\nliving in the country, supplanted by the usages of town life. Everybody\nwas then reading Coelebs in Search of a Wife, and Verplanck who had just\nbeen looking over some of the writings of Wilberforce, sees in it\nresemblances to his style, which led him to set down Wilberforce as the\nauthor.\n\nHe lived with his young wife five years, and she bore him two sons, one of\nwhom died at the age of thirty unmarried, and the other has become the\nfather of a numerous family. Her health failing he took her to Europe, in\nthe hope that it might be restored by a change of air and scene, but after\nlanguishing a while she died at Paris, in the year 1817. She sleeps in the\ncemetery of Pere La Chaise, among monuments inscribed with words strange\nto her childhood, while he, after surviving her for sixty-three years, yet\nnever forgetting her, is laid in the ancestral burying ground at Fishkill,\nand the Atlantic ocean rolls between their graves.\n\nHe remained in Europe a little while after this event, and having looked\nat what the continent had to show him, went over to England. In his\nletters to his friends at home he spoke pathetically of the loss of her\nwho was the blessing of his life, of the delight with which, had she\nlived, she would have looked at so many things in the old world now\nattracting his attention; and of the misfortune of his children to be\ndeprived of her care and guidance. In one of his letters he speaks\nenthusiastically of the painter, Allston, with whose genius he was deeply\nimpressed as he looked on the grand picture of Daniel interpreting the\nDream of Belshazzar, then begun but never to be finished. In the same\nletter he relates this anecdote:\n\n\"You may expect another explosion of mad poetry from Lord Byron. Lord\nHolland, who returned from Geneva, a few days ago, told Mr. Gallatin that\nhe was the bearer of a considerable cargo of verses from his lordship to\nMurray the publisher, the subject not known. That you may have a higher\nrelish for the new poem, I give you a little anecdote which is told in\nLondon. Some time ago Lord Byron's books were sold at auction, where a\ngentleman purchased a splendid edition of Shakespeare. When it was sent\nhome a volume was missing. After several fruitless inquiries of the\nauctioneer the purchaser went to Byron. 'What play was in the volume?'\nasked he. 'I think Othello,' 'Ah! I remember. I was reading that when Lady\nByron did something to vex me. I threw the book at her head and she\ncarried it out of the room. Inquire of some of her people and you will get\nyour book.'\"\n\nWhile abroad, Verplanck fell in with Dr. Mason, who had refused Stephenson\nhis degree. The two travellers took kindly to each other, and the\nunpleasant affair of the college disturbance was forgotten.\n\nIn 1818, after his return from Europe, he delivered before this Society\nthe noble Anniversary Discourse in which he commemorates the virtues and\nlabors of some of those illustrious men who, to use his words, \"have most\nlargely contributed to raise or support our national institutions, and to\nform or elevate our national character.\" Las Casas, Roger Williams,\nWilliam Penn, General Oglethorpe, Professor Luzac, and Berkeley are among\nthe worthies whom he celebrates. It has always seemed to me that this is\none of the happiest examples in our language of the class of compositions\nto which it belongs, both as regards the general scope and the execution,\nand it is read with as much interest now as when it was first written.\n\nMr. Verplanck was elected in 1820 a member of the New York House of\nAssembly, but I do not learn that he particularly distinguished himself\nwhile in that body. In the year following he was appointed, in the General\nTheological Seminary of the Episcopal Church, Professor of the Evidences\nof Revealed Religion and Moral Science in its relations to Theology. For\nfour years he performed the duties of this Professorship, with what\nability is shown by his Treatise on the Evidences of Christianity, the\nfruit of his studies during this interval. It is principally a clear and\nimpressive view of that class of proofs of the Christian religion which\nhave a direct relation to the intellectual and moral wants of mankind. For\nhe was a devout believer in the Christian gospel, and cherished religious\nconvictions for the sake of their influence on the character and the life.\nThis work was published in 1824, about the time that he resigned his\nProfessorship.\n\nIt was in 1824, that, on a visit to New York, I first became acquainted\nwith Verplanck. On the appearance of a small volume of poems of mine,\ncontaining one or two which have been the most favorably received, he\nwrote, in 1822, some account of them for the New York American, a daily\npaper which not long before had been established by his cousin, Johnson\nVerplanck, in conjunction with the late Dr. Charles King. He spoke of them\nat considerable length and in the kindest manner. As I was then an unknown\nliterary adventurer, I could not but be grateful to the hand that was so\ncordially held out to welcome me, and when I came to live in New York, in\n1825, an intimacy began in which I suspect the advantage was all on my\nside.\n\nIt was in 1825 that he published his Essay on the Doctrine of Contracts,\nin which he maintained that the transaction between the buyer and seller\nof a commodity should be one of perfect frankness and an entire absence of\nconcealment; that the seller should be held to disclose everything within\nhis knowledge which would affect the price of what he offered for sale,\nand that the maxim which is compressed into the two Latin words, _caveat\nemptor_--the maxim that the buyer takes the risk of a bad bargain--is not\nonly a selfish but a knavish and immoral rule of conduct, and should not\nbe recognized by the tribunals. The question is ably argued on the grounds\nof an elevated morality--but I have heard jurists object to the doctrine\nof this essay, that if it were to prevail it would greatly multiply the\nnumber of lawsuits.\n\nIn 1825, Mr Verplanck was elected one of the three Representatives in\nCongress, to which this city was then entitled. He immediately\ndistinguished himself as a working member. This appellation is given in\nCongress to members who labor faithfully in Committees, consider petitions\nand report upon them, investigate claims, inquire into matters referred to\ntheir judgment, frame bills and present them through their Chairman.\nBesides these, there are the talking members who take part in every\ndebate, often without knowing anything of the question, save what they\nlearn while the debate is proceeding, and the idle members, who do nothing\nbut vote--generally I believe, without knowing anything of the question\nwhatever; but to neither of these classes did Verplanck belong. He was a\ndiligent, useful, and valued member of the Committee of Ways and Means,\nand at an important period of our political history was its Chairman.\n\nThen arose the great controversy concerning the right of a State to\nrefuse obedience at pleasure to any law of Congress, a right contended for\nunder the name of nullification by some of the most eminent men of the\nSouth, whose ability, political influence, and power of putting a\nplausible face on their heresy, gave their cause at first an appearance of\ngreat strength, and seemed to threaten the very existence of the Union.\n\nWith their denial of the binding force of any law of Congress which a\nState might think proper to set aside, these men combined another\nargument. They denied the power of Congress, under the Constitution, to\nlevy duties on imported merchandize, for the purpose of favoring the home\nmanufacturer, and maintained that it could only lay duties for the sake of\nraising a revenue. Mr. Verplanck favored neither this view nor their\ntheory of nullification. He held that the power to lay duties being given\nto Congress, without reservation by the Constitution, the end or motive of\nlaying them was left to the discretion of the Legislature. He showed also\nthat the power to regulate commerce given to that body in the\nConstitution, was, from an early period in our history, held to imply a\nright, by laying duties, to favor particular traffics, products or\nfabrics.\n\nThis view of the subject was presented with great skill and force in a\npamphlet entitled \"A Letter to Colonel William Drayton, of South\nCarolina,\" published in 1831. Mr. Verplanck was through life a friend to\nthe freedom of exchange, but he would not use in its favor any argument\nwhich did not seem to him just. His pamphlet was so ably reasoned that\nWilliam Leggett said to him, in my presence, \"Mr. Verplanck, you have\nconvinced me; I was, till now, of a different opinion from yours, but you\nhave settled the question against me. I now see that whatever may be the\ninjustice of protective duties, Congress has the constitutional right to\nimpose them.\"\n\nIt was while this controversy was going on that President Jackson issued\nhis proclamation warning those who resisted the revenue laws that their\nresistance was regarded as rebellion, and would be quelled at the\nbayonet's point. Mr. Calhoun and his friends were not prepared for this:\nindeed, I do not think that in any of his plans for the separate action of\nthe slave States, he contemplated a resort to arms on either side. They\nlooked about them to find some plausible pretext for submission, and this\nthe country was not unwilling to give. It was generally admitted that the\nduties on imported goods ought to be reduced, and Mr. McLane, Secretary of\nthe Treasury, and Mr. Verplanck, Chairman of the Committee of Ways and\nMeans, each drew up a plan for lessening the burdens of the tariff.\n\nMr. McLane had just returned from a successful mission to Great Britain,\nand had the advantage of considerable personal popularity. He was a\nmoderate protectionist, and with great pains drew up a scheme of duties\nwhich kept the protection of home manufactures in view. Some branches of\nindustry, he thought, were so far advanced that they would bear a small\nreduction of the duty; others a still larger; others were yet so weak that\nthey could not prosper unless the whole existing duty was retained. The\nscheme was laid before Congress, but met with little attention from any\nquarter; the southern politicians regarded it with scorn, as made up of\nmere cheese-parings. Mr. Verplanck's plan of a tariff was more liberal. He\nwas not a protectionist, and his scheme contemplated a large reduction of\nduties--as large as it was thought could possibly be adopted by\nCongress--yet so framed as to cause as little inconvenience as might be to\nthe manufacturers. It was thought that Mr. Calhoun and his friends would\nreadily accept it as affording them a not ignoble retreat from their\ndangerous position.\n\nWhile these projects were before Congress, Mr. Littell, a gentleman of the\nfree-trade school, and now editor of the \"Living Age,\" drew up a scheme of\nrevenue reform more thorough than either of the others. It proposed to\nreduce the duties annually until, at the end of ten years the principle of\nprotection, which was what the southern politicians complained of, should\ndisappear from the tariff, and a system of duties take, its place which\nshould in no case exceed the rate of twenty per cent, on the value of the\ncommodity imported. The draft of this scheme was shown to Mr. Clay: he saw\nat once that it would satisfy the southern politicians; he adopted it,\nbrought it before Congress, urged its enactment in several earnest\nspeeches, and by the help of his great influence over his party it was\nrapidly carried through both houses, under the name of the Compromise\nTariff, to the astonishment of the friends of free-trade, the mill owners,\nthe Secretary of the Treasury, the Committee of Ways and Means, and, I\nthink, the country at large. I thought it hard measure for Mr. Verplanck\nthat the credit of this reform should be taken out of his hands by one who\nhad always been the great advocate of protective duties; but this was one\nof the fortunate strokes of policy which Mr. Clay, when in the vigor of\nhis faculties, had the skill to make. He afterwards defended the measure\nas inflicting no injury upon the manufacturers, and it never appeared to\nlessen the good will which his party bore him.\n\nAbout this time I was witness to a circumstance which showed the sagacity\nof Mr. Verplanck in estimating the consequences of political measures. Mr.\nVan Buren had been sent by President Jackson as our Minister to the\nBritish Court while Congress was not in session, and the nomination yet\nawaited confirmation by the Senate. It led to a long and spirited debate,\nin which Mr. Marcy uttered the memorable maxim: \"To the victor belong the\nspoils of the enemy,\" which was so often quoted against him. I was in\nWashington, dining with Mr. Verplanck, when the vote on this nomination\nwas taken. As we were at the table, two of the Senators, Dickinson, of New\nJersey, and Tazewell, of Virginia, entered. Verplanck, turning to them,\nasked eagerly: \"How has it gone?\" Dickinson, extending his left arm, with\nthe fingers closed, swept the other hand over it, striking the fingers\nopen, to signify that the nomination was rejected. \"There,\" said\nVerplanck, \"that makes Van Buren President of the United States.\"\nVerplanck was by no means a partizan of Van Buren, but he saw what the\neffect of that vote would be, and his prediction was, in due time,\nverified.\n\nWhile in Congress, Mr. Verplanck procured the enactment of a law for the\nfurther security of literary property. To use his own words, it \"gave\nadditional security to the property of authors and artists in their works,\nand more than doubled the term of legal protection to them, besides\nsimplifying the law in various respects.\" It was passed in 1831, though\nMr. Verplanck had begun to urge the measure three years before, when he\nbrought in a bill for the purpose, but party strife was then at its\nheight, and little else than the approaching elections were thought of by\nthe members of Congress. When party heat had cooled a little, he gained\ntheir attention, and his bill became a law. If we had now in Congress a\nmember so much interested for the rights of authors and artists, and at\nthe same time so learned, so honored, and so persevering, we might hope\nthat the inhospitable usage which makes the property of the American\nauthor in Great Britain and of the British author in the United States the\nlawful prize of whosoever chooses to appropriate it to himself, would be\nabolished.\n\nA dinner was given to Verplanck on his return from Washington, in the name\nof several literary gentlemen of New York, but the expense was, in fact,\ndefrayed by a generous and liberal-minded bookseller, Elam Bliss, who held\nauthors in high veneration and only needed a more discriminating\nperception of literary merit to make him, in their eyes at least, a\nperfect bookseller. On this occasion Mr. Verplanck spoke well and modestly\nof the part he had taken in procuring the passage of the new law;\nmentioned with especial honor the \"first and ablest champion\" who had then\n\"appeared in this cause,\" the Hon. Willard Phillips, who had discussed the\nquestion in the \"North American Review;\" referred to the opinions of\nvarious eminent publicists, and pointed out that our own Constitution had\nrecognized the right of literary property while it left to Congress the\nduty of securing it. He closed with an animated view of what American\nliterature ought to be and might be under circumstances favorable to its\nwholesome and vigorous growth. We listened with delight and were proud of\nour Representative.\n\nDuring Mr. Verplanck's fourth and last term in Congress he became\nseparated from his associates of the Democratic party by a difference in\nregard to the Bank of the United States. General Jackson had laid rough\nhands on this institution and removed to the State banks the public money\nwhich had till then been entrusted to its keeping. Many of our best men\nhad then a high opinion of the utility of the bank, and thought much\nbetter of its management than, as afterwards appeared, it deserved. The\nWhig party declared itself in favor of the bank. Mr. Calhoun and the\nSouthern politicians of his immediate school joined them on this question,\nand Mr. Verplanck, who regarded the bank with a friendly eye, found\nhimself on the same side, which proved to be the minority. The time\narrived for another election of members of Congress from this City. The\nDemocratic party desired to re-elect Mr. Verplanck, if some assurance\ncould be obtained from him that he would not oppose the policy of the\nAdministration in regard to the bank. That party understood very well his\nmerits and his usefulness, and made a strong effort to retain him, but he\nwould give no assurance, even to pursue a neutral course, on the bank\nquestion, and accordingly his name was reluctantly dropped from their\nlist of nominations. A long separation ensued between him and those who up\nto that time had been his political associates.\n\nIn 1834, the Whig party, looking for a strong candidate for the Mayoralty\nof the City, offered the nomination to Verplanck, who accepted it. On the\nother side, the Democrats brought forward Cornelius W. Lawrence, a man of\npopular manners and unquestioned integrity. Those were happy days when, in\nvoting for a Mayor, the citizen could be certain that he would not vote\namiss, and that whoever succeeded in the election, the City was sure of an\nhonest man for its chief officer. One would have thought that this\nconsideration might make the election a quiet one, but it was not so; the\nstruggle was for party supremacy, and it was violent on both sides. At\nthat time the polls were kept open for three days, and each day the\nexcitement increased; disorders took place; some heads were broken, and at\nlast it appeared that Lawrence was elected Mayor by a majority of about\ntwo hundred votes.\n\nWhile in Congress, Verplanck had leisure, during the interval between one\nsession and another, for literary occupations. He wrote about one-third of\nan annual collection of miscellanies entitled, the \"Talisman,\" which was\npublished by Dr. Bliss in the year 1827 and the two following years. To\nthese volumes he contributed the \"Peregrinations of Petrus Mudd,\" a\nhumorous and lively sketch, founded on the travels of a New Yorker of the\ngenuine old stock, who when he returned from wandering over all Europe and\npart of Asia, set himself down to study geography in order to know where\nhe had been. Of the graver articles he wrote \"De Gourges,\" a chapter from\nthe history of the Huguenot colonists of this country, \"Gelyna, a Tale of\nAlbany and Ticonderoga,\" and several others. In conjunction with Robert C.\nSands, a writer of a peculiar vein of quaint humor, he contributed two\npapers to the collection, entitled \"Scenes in Washington,\" of a humorous\nand satirical character. He disliked the manual labor of writing and was\nfond of dictating while another held the pen. I was the third contributor\nto the \"Talisman,\" and sometimes acted as his amanuensis. In estimating\nVerplanck's literary character, these compositions, some of which are\nmarked by great beauty of style and others by a rich humor, should not be\nover-looked. The first volume of the \"Talisman\" was put in type by a young\nEnglishman named Cox, who, while working at his desk as a printer,\ncomposed a clever review of the work, which appeared in the \"New York\nMirror,\" and of which Verplanck often spoke with praise.\n\nIn 1833, Verplanck collected his public speeches into a volume. Among\nthese is one delivered in August of that year, at Columbia College, in\nwhich he holds up to imitation the illustrious examples of great men\neducated at that institution. In one of those passages of stately\neloquence which he knew so well to frame, he speaks of the worth of his\nold adversary, De Witt Clinton, the first graduate of the College after\nthe peace of 1783, and pays due \"honor to that lofty ambition which taught\nhim to look to designs of grand utility, and to their successful execution\nas his arts of gaining or redeeming the confidence of a generous and\npublic spirited people.\" In the same discourse he pronounced the eulogy of\nDr. Mason, who had died a few days before. In the same year, Verplanck, at\nGeneva College, delivered an address on the \"Right Moral Influence and Use\nof Liberal Studies,\" and the next year, at Amherst College, another on the\nconverse of that subject, namely, the \"Influence of Moral Causes upon\nOpinion, Science and Literature.\" In 1836, he gave a discourse on \"the\nAdvantages and Dangers of the American Scholar.\" Of these addresses let me\nsay, that I know of no compositions of their class which I read with more\npleasure or more instruction. Enlarged views, elevated sentiments, a\nhopeful and courageous spirit, a wide knowledge of men and men's recorded\nexperience, and a manly dignity of style, mark them all as the productions\nof no common mind.\n\nAfter separating from the Democratic party, Mr. Verplanck was elected by\nthe Whigs, in 1837, to the Senate of the State of New York, while that\nbody was yet a Court for the Correction of Errors,--a tribunal of the\nlast resort,--and in that capacity decided questions of law of the highest\nmagnitude and importance. Nothing in his life was more remarkable than the\nnew character in which he now appeared. The practiced statesman, the\nelegant scholar and the writer of graceful sketches, the satirist, the\ncritic, the theologian, started up a profound jurist. During the four\nyears in which he sat in this Court, he heard the arguments in nearly\nevery case which came before it, and delivered seventy-one opinions--not\nsimply his written conclusions, but elaborate judgments founded on the\nclosest investigation of the questions submitted, the most careful and\nexhaustive examination of authorities, and a practical, comprehensive and\nfamiliar acquaintance with legal rules and principles, even those of the\nmost technical nature, which astonished those who knew that he had never\nappeared for a client in Court, or sat before in a judicial tribunal. I\nuse in this the language of an able lawyer, Judge Daly, who has made this\npart of Verplanck's labors a subject of special study.\n\nAs examples of his judicial ability, I may instance his examination of the\nwhole structure of our State and Federal Government in the case of\nDelafield against the State of Illinois, where the question came up\nwhether an individual could sue a State; his survey of the whole law of\nmarine insurance and the principles on which it is founded, in the case of\nthe American Insurance Company against Bryan; his admirable statement of\nthe reasons on which rests the law of prescription, or right established\nby usage, in the case of Post against Pearsall; his exposition of the\nextent of the right which in this country the owners of land on the\nborders of rivers and navigable streams have in the bed of the river, in\nKempshall's case--a masterly opinion, in which the whole Court concurred.\nI might also mention the great case of Alice Lispenard, in which he\nconsidered the degree of mental capacity requisite to make a will, a case\ninvolving a vast amount of property in this city, decided by his opinion.\nThere is also the case of Smith against Acker, relating to the taint of\nfraud in mortgages of personal property, in which he carried the Court\nwith him against the Chancellor and overturned all the previous decisions.\nNot less important is his elaborate, learned and exhaustive opinion in the\ncase of Thompson against the People, decided by a single vote and by his\nopinion,--in which he examined the true nature of franchises conferred on\nindividuals in this country by the sovereign power, the right to construct\nbridges over navigable streams, and the proper operation of the writ of\n_quo warranto_. These opinions of Verplanck form an important part of the\nlegal literature of our State. If he had made the law his special pursuit,\nand been placed on the bench of one of our higher tribunals, there is no\ndegree of judicial eminence to which he might not have aspired. The\nStanding Committee of the Diocese of New York, of which he was a member,\nin their resolutions expressive of sorrow for his death, spoke of him as\none whose judicial wisdom and familiarity with the principles and practice\nof the law, made his counsels of the highest value.\n\nIn 1844, after, I doubt not, some years of previous study, appeared the\nfirst number of Verplanck's edition of Shakespeare, issued by Harper &\nBrothers. The numbers appeared from time to time till 1847, when the work\nwas completed. He made some corrections of the text but never rashly; he\nselected the notes of other commentators with care; he added some\nexcellent ones of his own, and wrote admirable critical and historical\nprefaces to the different plays. This edition has always seemed to me the\nvery one for which the general reader has occasion.\n\nAlmost ever since the American Revolution a Board of Regents of the\nUniversity of the State of New York has existed, on which is laid the duty\nof visiting and superintending in a general way our institutions of\neducation above the degree of Common Schools. It consists of twenty-three\nmembers, including the Governor and Lieutenant-Governor, the Secretary of\nState and the Superintendent of Public Instruction; the other nineteen\nmembers are appointed by the Legislature. The Board assists at the\nincorporation of all colleges and academies, looks into their condition,\ninterposes in certain specified cases, receives reports from them and\nmakes annual reports to the Legislature, and confers by diploma such\ndegrees as are granted by any college or university in Europe. Mr.\nVerplanck was appointed a member of this Board in 1826, in place of\nMatthew Clarkson, who had been a Regent ever since 1787. In 1855 he was\nappointed Vice-Chancellor of the University, and to the time of his death\npunctually attended the meetings of the Board, shared in its discussions\nand bore his part in its various duties. In 1844 the State Library was\nplaced under the superintendence of the Regents. Mr. Verplanck was\nimmediately put on the Library Committee, where his knowledge of books and\neditions of books made his services invaluable. There were then about ten\nthousand volumes in the collection, and many of these consisted of broken\nsets. Under the care of the Regents--Mr. Verplanck principally, who gave\nit his particular attention--it has grown into a well selected, well\narranged library of more than eighty-two thousand volumes. About the same\ntime the State Cabinets of Natural History were put under the care of the\nBoard, and these have equally prospered, every year adding to their\nextent, until now the Regents publish annually, catalogues of the\nadditions made to them from various sources, and, occasionally, papers\ncommunicated by experts in natural history.\n\nEvery year in the month of August a University Convocation is held at\nAlbany, to which are invited all the leading teachers and professors of\nour colleges and academies, and carefully prepared papers relating to\neducation are read. At the first of these conventions, in 1863, Mr. D.J.\nPratt, now the Assistant Secretary of the Board, had read a paper on\n\"Language as the Chief Educator and the noblest Liberal Art,\" in which he\ndwelt upon the importance of studying the ancient classic authors in their\noriginal tongues. Mr. Verplanck remarked that in what he had to say he\nwould content himself with relating an anecdote respecting the first\nNapoleon, which he had from a private source, and which had never been in\nprint. The Emperor wishing to keep himself advised of what was passing in\nthe University of France, yet without attracting public attention, was\nwont on certain occasions to send to the University a trustworthy and\nintelligent person from his household, who was to bring back a report.\nThis man at one time reported that the question of paying more attention\nto the mathematical sciences had been agitated. On this Napoleon exclaimed\nwith emphasis: \"Go to the Polytechnic for mathematics, but classics,\nclassics, classics for the University.\" At another time Verplanck, still\noccupied with his favorite studies, gave the convention an address on the\npronunciation of the Latin language, in which he came to the conclusion\nthat of all the branches of the Latin race, the Portuguese in their\npronunciation of Latin make the nearest approach to that of the ancient\nRomans. He was desired by the members of the Board to write out the\naddress for publication, but this was never done. Verplanck, as I have\nalready remarked, was an unwilling scribe, and did not like to handle the\npen.\n\nThe Annual Reports of the Regents, which are voluminous documents, give\nmuch the same view of the arrangements for public education in the State\nas is obtained of a country by looking down upon it from an observatory.\nEvery college, every academy, every school, not merely a private\nenterprise, and above the degree of common schools, makes its yearly\nreport to the Regents, and these are embodied in the general report which\nthey make to the Legislature, so that the whole great system, with all its\nappendages, its libraries, its revenues, its expenditures, the number of\nits teachers and its pupils, and the opportunities of instruction which it\ngives, lies before the eye of the reader. It now comprehends twenty\nColleges of Literature and Science, three Law Departments, two Medical\nColleges, two hundred or more Academies, or Schools of that class, besides\nthe Normal School at Albany.\n\nIn his discourse delivered before this Society in 1818, Mr. Verplanck had\napostrophized his native country as the Land of Refuge. He could not then\nhave foreseen how well in after times it would deserve this name, nor\nwhat labors and responsibilities the care of that mighty throng who resort\nto our shores for work and bread would cast upon him. Shortly before the\nyear 1847 the number of emigrants from Europe arriving in our country had\nrapidly and surprisingly increased. The famine in Ireland had caused the\npeople of that island to migrate to ours in swarms like those which the\npopulous North poured from her frozen loins to overwhelm the Roman Empire.\nIn the ten years from 1845 to 1854 inclusive, more than a million and a\nhalf of Irish emigrants left the United Kingdom. The emigration from\nGermany had also prodigiously increased and promised to become still\nlarger. All these were exposed, and the Germans in a particular manner, on\naccount of their ignorance of our language, to the extortions of a knavish\nclass, called runners, and of the keepers of boarding-houses, who often\ndefrauded them of all that they possessed, and left them to charity. Most\nof those who, after these extortions, had the means, made their way into\nthe interior and settled upon farms, but a large number remained to become\ninmates of the almshouse, or to starve and sicken in crowded and\nunwholesome rooms. Mr. Kapp, for some time a Commissioner of Emigration,\nrelates, in his interesting work on Emigration, an example of the manner\nin which these poor creatures were cheated. An emigrant came to a\nboarding-house keeper to pay his bill: \"It is eighteen dollars,\" said the\nlandlord. \"Why,\" said the emigrant, \"did you not agree to board me for\nsixpence a meal and threepence for a bed?\" \"Yes,\" was the answer, \"and\nthat is just seventy-five cents a day; you have been here eight days, and\nthat makes just eighteen dollars.\"\n\nThese things had become a grievous scandal, and it was clear that\nsomething must be done to protect the emigrant from pillage, and the\ncountry from the burden of his support. The Act of May, 1847, was\ntherefore passed by the New York Legislature. It named six gentlemen of\nthe very highest character, Gulian C. Verplanck, James Boorman, Jacob\nHarvey, Robert B. Minturn, William F. Havemeyer, and David C. Colden, who\nwere to form a Board of Commissioners of Emigration, charged with the\noversight and care of this vast influx of strangers from the Old World. To\nthese were added the Mayors of New York and Brooklyn, and the Presidents\nof the German Society and the Irish Emigrant Society. Every master of a\nvessel was, within twenty-four hours of his arrival, to give this Board a\nlist of his passengers, with a report of their origin, age, occupation,\ncondition, health and other particulars, and either give bonds to save the\ncommunity from the cost of maintaining them in case they became paupers,\nor pay for each of them the sum of two dollars and a half. The payment of\nmoney has been preferred, and this has put into the hands of the\nCommissioners a liberal revenue, faithfully applied to the advantage of\nthe emigrants.\n\nMr. Havemeyer was chosen President of the Board, but resigned the office\nafter a few months, and was succeeded in it by Mr. Verplanck, who held it\ntill the day of his death. Under the management of the Commissioners, the\nBureau of Emigration, becoming with almost every year more perfectly\nadapted to its purpose, has grown to vast dimensions, till it is now like\none of the departments of government in a great empire. Whoever passes by\nWard's Island, where the tides of the East River and the Sound meet and\nrush swiftly to and fro through their narrow channels, will have some idea\nof what the Board has done as he sees the domes and spires of that great\ncluster of buildings, forming a vast caravanserai in which the poorer\nclass of emigrants are temporarily lodged, before they can be sent into\nthe interior or find employment here. Here are barracks for the men, a\nspacious building for the women and children, a nursery for children of a\ntender age, Catholic and Protestant chapels, a dispensary, workshops, a\nlunatic asylum, fever wards, surgical wards, storehouses, residences of\nthe physicians and other persons employed in the care of the place, and\nout-houses and offices of various kinds. Here, too, rise the stately\nturrets of the spacious new hospital styled the Verplanck Emigrant\nHospital, in honor of the great philanthropist, for such his constant and\nnoiseless labors in this department of charity entitle him to be called.\n\nThe Commissioners found that they could not protect the emigrants from\nimposition without a special landing place from which they could wholly\nexclude the rascal crew who cheated them. It took eight years to obtain\nthis from the New York Legislature, but at last, in 1855, it was granted,\nand the old fort at the foot of Manhattan Island, called Castle Garden,\nwas leased for this purpose. This is now the Emigrants' Landing, the gate\nof the New World for those who, pressing westward, throng into it from the\nOld.\n\n### Summary:"}

If ever a man deserved success\nit was he, and it was good to see the look of pleasure on his face as I\ntold him so.\n\n\"And now,\" said I presently, \"I also have a surprise for you, Joseph.\"\n\nHe laughed. \"Eh bien, M'sieur, it is your turn to take my breath away.\"\n\n\"My last billet in France, before being wounded,\" I told him, \"was in a\nPicardy village called Flechinelle.\"\n\nHe raised his hands. \"Mon Dieu,\" he cried, \"it is my own village!\"\n\n\"More than that,\" I continued, \"for nearly six weeks I lodged just\nbehind the church, in a whitewashed cottage with a stock of oranges,\npipes and boot-laces for sale in the window.\"\n\n\"It is my mother's shop!\" he exclaimed breathlessly.\n\nI nodded my head, and then proceeded to give him the hundred-and-one\nmessages that I had received from the little old lady as soon as she\ndiscovered that I knew her son.\n\n\"It is so long since I 'ave seen 'er,\" said Monsieur Joseph, blowing his\nnose violently. \"So 'ard I work in London these ten, fifteen years that\nonly once have I gone 'ome since my father died.\"\n\nThen I told him how bent and old his mother was, and how lonesome she\nhad seemed all by herself in the cottage, and as I spoke of the shop\nwhich she still kept going in her front-room the tears fairly rained\ndown his face.\n\n\"But, M'sieur,\" said he, \"that which you tell me is indeed strange; for\nthose letters which she writes to me week by week are always gay, and it\n'as seemed to me that my mother was well content.\"\n\nThen he struck his fist on the table. \"I 'ave it,\" he said. \"She shall\ncome to live 'ere with me in Londres. All that she desires shall be\n'ers, for am I not a rich man?\"\n\nI shook my head. \"She would never leave her village now,\" I told him.\n\"And I know well that she desires nothing in the world except to see you\nagain.\"\n\nThen as I rose to go, \"Good night, M'sieur,\" said Joseph a little sadly.\n\"Be very sure that there is always a welcome for you 'ere.\"\n\nThe next time that I dined at the Mazarin was some four weeks later, on\nthe eve of my return to the Front. A strange waiter showed me to my\nplace, and Joseph was nowhere to be seen. Indeed a wholly different air\nseemed to pervade the place since my last visit. Presently I beckoned to\na waiter whom I recognised as having served under the old _regime_.\n\"Where is Monsieur Joseph?\" I asked him.\n\n\"Where indeed, Sir!\" the man replied. \"It is all so strange. One day it\nis arranged that he shall take over the restaurant and its staff, and on\nthe next he come to say 'Good-bye' to us all, and then leave for France.\nOh, it is _drole_. So good a business man to lose the chance that comes\nonce only in a life! He is too old to fight. Yet who knows? Maybe he\nheard of something better out there....\"\n\nAs the man spoke the gold-and-white walls of the restaurant faded, the\nclatter of plates and dishes died away, and I was back again in a tiny\nvillage shop in Picardy. Across the counter, packed with its curious\nstock, I saw Monsieur Joseph, with shirt-sleeves rolled up, gravely\nhanding a stick of chocolate to a child, and taking its sou in return.\nIn the diminutive kitchen behind sat a little white-haired old lady with\nsuch a look of content on her face as I have rarely seen.\n\nThen suddenly I found myself back again in the London restaurant.\n\n\"Yes,\" I said to the waiter, \"it is possible, as you say, that Monsieur\nJoseph heard of something better in France.\"\n\nAnd raising my glass I drank a silent toast.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n[Illustration: THE TUBER'S REPARTEE.\n\nGERMAN PIRATE. \"GOTT STRAFE ENGLAND!\"\n\nBRITISH POTATO. \"TUBER UeBER ALLES!\"]\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n[Illustration: _Crowd_. \"WOULD YER LIKE TO GO TO HORSPITAL?\"--\"SHALL I\nGET YER A DROP OF BRANDY?\"--\"DID YER SLIP ON THE BANANA-PEEL?\" \"DID YER\nFALL?\"--\"ARE YER HURT, SIR?\"--\"SHALL I FETCH A DOCTOR?\"--\"IS THAT YOUR\nHAT, SIR?\"\n\n_Ex-Cabinet Minister_. \"THE ANSWERS TO ONE, TWO, FIVE AND SIX ARE IN THE\nNEGATIVE; TO THREE, FOUR AND SEVEN IN THE AFFIRMATIVE.\"]\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTHE MUD LARKS.\n\nYou have all seen it in the latest V.C. list--\"The Reverend Paul Grayne,\nChaplain to the Forces, for conspicuous bravery and gallant example in\nthe face of desperate circumstances.\"\n\nYou have all pictured him, the beau-ideal of muscular Christian, the\nFighting Parson, eighteen hands high, terrific in wind and limb, with a\ngolden mane and a Greek profile; a Pekinese in the drawing-room, a\nbull-dog in the arena; a soupcon of Saint FRANCIS with a dash of JOHN L.\nSULLIVAN--and all that.\n\nBut we who have met heroes know that they are very seldom of the type\nwhich achieves the immortality of the picture post-card.\n\nThe stalwart with pearly teeth, lilac eyes and curly lashes is C3 at\nLloyd's (Sir FRANCIS), and may be heard twice daily at the Frivolity\nsinging, \"My Goo-goo Girl from Honolulu\" to entranced flappers; while\nthe lad who has Fritzie D. Hun backed on the ropes, clinching for time,\nis usually gifted with bow legs, freckles, a dented proboscis and a\ncoiffure after the manner of a wire-haired terrier.\n\nThe Reverend Paul Grayne, V.C., sometime curate of Thorpington Parva, in\nthe county of Hampshire, was no exception to this rule. AEsthetically he\nwas a blot on the landscape; among all the heroes I have met I never saw\nanything less heroically moulded.\n\nHe stood about five feet nought and tipped the beam at seven stone\nnothing. He had a mild chinless face and his long beaky nose, round\nlarge spectacles, and trick of cocking his head sideways when\nconversing, gave him the appearance of an intelligent little dicky-bird.\n\nI remember very well the occasion of our first meeting. I was in my\ntroop lines one afternoon, blackguarding a farrier, when a loud nicker\nsounded on the road and a black cob, bearing a feebly protesting padre\nupon his fat back, trotted through the gate, up to the lines and began\nto swop How d'y'do's with my hairies. The little Padre cocked his head\non one side and oozed apologies from every pore.\n\nHe hadn't meant to intrude, he twittered; Peter had brought him; it was\nPeter's fault; Peter was very eccentric.\n\nPeter, I gathered, was the fat cob, who by this time had butted into the\nlines and was tearing at a hay net as if he hadn't had a meal for years.\n\nHis alleged master looked at me hopeless, helpless. What was he to do?\n\"Well, since Peter is evidently stopping to tea with my horses,\" said I,\n\"the only thing you can do is to come to tea with us.\" So I lifted him\ndown and bore him off to the cow-shed inhabited by our mess at the time\nand regaled him on chlorinated Mazawattee, marmalade and dog biscuit. An\nhour later, Peter willing, he left us.\n\nWe saw a lot of the Padre after that. Peter, it appeared, had taken\nquite a fancy to us and frequently brought him round to meals. The Padre\nhad no word of say in the matter. He confessed that, when he embarked\nupon Peter in the morning, he had not the vaguest idea where mid-day\nwould find him. Nothing but the black cob's fortunate rule of going home\nto supper saved the Padre from being posted as a deserter.\n\nHe had an uneasy feeling that Peter would one day suddenly sicken of the\nwar and that he would find himself in Paris or on the Riviera. We had an\nuneasy feeling that Peter would one day develop a curiosity as to the\nBosch horse rations, and stroll across the line, and we should lose the\nPadre, a thing we could ill afford to do, for by this time he had taken\nus under his wing spiritually and bodily. On Sundays he would appear in\nour midst dragging a folding harmonium and hold Church Parade, leading\nthe hymns in his twittering bird-like voice.\n\nThen the spinster ladies of his old parish of Thorpington Parva gave him\na Ford car, and with this he scoured back areas for provisions and\nthreaded his tin buggy in and out of columns of dusty infantry and\nclattering ammunition limbers, spectacles gleaming, cap slightly awry,\nwhile his batman (a wag) perched precariously a-top of a rocking pile of\nbiscuit tins, cigarette cases and boxes of tinned fruit, and shouted\nafter the fashion of railway porters, \"By your leave! Fags for the\nfirin' line. Way for the Woodbine Express.\"\n\nBut if we saw a lot of the Padre it was the Antrims who looked upon him\nas their special property. They were line infantry, of the type which\ngets most of the work and none of the Press notices, a hard-bitten,\nunregenerate crowd, who cared not a whit whether Belgium bled or not,\nbut loved fighting for its own sake and put their faith in bayonet and\nbutt. And wherever these Antrims went thither went the Padre also, his\nharmonium and his Woodbines. I have a story that, when they were in a\ncertain part of the line where the trenches were only thirty yards apart\n(so close indeed that the opposing forces greeted each other by their\nfirst names and borrowed one another's wiring tools), the Padre dragged\nthe harmonium into the front line and held service there, and the\nGermans over the way joined lustily in the hymns. He kept the men of the\nAntrims going on canteen delicacies and their officers in a constant\nbubble of joy. He swallowed their tall stories without a gulp; they\npulled one leg and he offered the other; he fell headlong into every\nsilly trap they set for him. Also they achieved merit in other messes by\npeddling yarns of his wonderful innocence and his incredible\nabsent-mindedness.\n\n\"Came to me yesterday, the Dicky Bird did,\" one of them would relate;\n\"wanted advice about that fat fraud of his, Peter. 'He's got an abrasion\non the knob of his right-hand front paw,' says he. 'Dicky Bird,' says I,\n'that is no way to describe the anatomy of a horse after all the\nteaching I've given you.' 'I am so forgetful and horsey terms are so\nconfusing,' he moans. 'Oh, I recollect now--his starboard ankle!' The\ndear babe!\"\n\nIn the course of time the Antrims went into the Push, but on this\noccasion they refused to take the Padre with them, explaining that\nPushes were noisy affairs with messy accidents happening in even the\nbest regulated battalions.\n\nThe Padre was up at midnight to see them go, his spectacles misty. They\nwent over the bags at dawn, reached their objective in twenty minutes\nand scratched themselves in. The Padre rejoined them ten minutes later,\nvery badly winded, but bringing a case of Woodbines along with him.\n\nMy friend Patrick grabbed him by the leg and dragged him into a\nshell-hole. Nothing but an inherent respect for his cloth restrained\nPatrick from giving the Dicky Bird the spanking of his life. At 8 A.M.\nthe Hun countered heavily and hove the Antrims out. Patrick retreated in\ngood order, leading the Padre by an ear. The Antrims sat down, licked\ntheir cuts, puffed some of the Woodbines, then went back and pitchforked\nthe Bosch in his tender spots. The Bosch collected fresh help and bobbed\nup again. Business continued brisk all day, and when night fell the\nAntrims were left masters of the position.\n\nAt 1 A.M. they were relieved by the Rutland Rifles, and a dog weary\nbattered remnant of the battalion crawled back to camp in a sunken road\na mile in the rear. One or two found bivouacs left by the Rutlands, but\nthe majority dropped where they halted. My friend Patrick found a\nbivouac, wormed into it and went to sleep. The next thing he remembers\nwas the roof of his abode caving in with the weight of two men\nstruggling violently. Patrick extricated himself somehow and rolled out\ninto the grey dawn to find the sunken road filled with grey figures, in\namong the bivouacs and shell holes, stabbing at the sleeping Antrims.\nHere and there men were locked together, struggling tooth and claw; the\nair was vibrant with a ghastly pandemonium of grunts and shrieks; the\nsunken road ran like a slaughter-house gutter. There was only one thing\nto do, and that was to get out, so Patrick did so, driving before him\nwhat men he could collect.\n\nA man staggered past him, blowing like a walrus. It was the Padre's\nbatman, and he had his master tucked under one arm, in his underclothes,\nkicking feebly.\n\nPatrick halted his men beyond the hill crest, and there the Colonel\njoined him, trotting on his stockinged feet. Other officers arrived,\nherding men. \"They must have rushed the Ruts., Sir,\" Patrick panted;\n\"must be after those guns just behind us.\" \"They'll get 'em too,\" said\nthe Colonel grimly. \"We can't stop 'em,\" said the Senior Captain. \"If we\ncounter at once we might give the Loamshires time to come up--they're in\nsupport, Sir--but--but, if they attack us, they'll get those guns--run\nright over us.\"\n\nThe Colonel nodded. \"Man, I know, I know; but look at 'em\"--he pointed\nto the pathetic remnant of his battalion lying out behind the\ncrest--\"they're dropping asleep where they lie--they're beat to a\nfinish--not another kick left in 'em.\"\n\nHe sat down and buried his face in his hands. The redoubtable Antrims\nhad come to the end.\n\nSuddenly came a shout from the Senior Captain, \"Good Lord, what's that\nfellow after? Who the devil is it?\"\n\nThey all turned and saw a tiny figure, clad only in underclothes,\nmarching deliberately over the ridge towards the Germans.\n\n\"Who is it?\" the Colonel repeated. \"Beggin' your pardon, the Reverend,\nSir,\" said the Padre's batman as he strode past the group of officers.\n\"'E give me the slip, Sir. Gawd knows wot 'e's up to now.\" He lifted up\nhis voice and wailed after his master, \"'Ere, you come back this minute,\nSir. You'll get yourself in trouble again. Do you 'ear me, Sir?\" But the\nPadre apparently did not hear him, for he plodded steadily on his way.\nThe batman gave a sob of despair and broke into a double.\n\nThe Colonel sprang to his feet, \"Hey, stop him, somebody! Those swine'll\nshoot him in a second--child murder!\"\n\nTwo subalterns ran forward, followed by a trio of N.C.O.'s. All along\nthe line men lifted their weary heads from the ground and saw the tiny\nfigure on the ridge silhouetted against the red east.\n\n\"Oo's that blinkin' fool?\"\n\n\"The Padre.\"\n\n\"Wot's 'e doin' of?\"\n\n\"Gawd knows.\"\n\nA man rose to his knees, from his knees to his feet, and stumbled\nforward, mumbling, \"'E give me a packet of fags when I was broke.\" \"Me\ntoo,\" growled another, and followed his chum. \"They'll shoot 'im in a\nminute,\" a voice shouted, suddenly frightened. \"'Ere, this ain't war,\nthis is blasted baby-killin'.\"\n\nIn another five seconds the whole line was up and jogging forward at a\nlurching double. \"And a little child shall lead them,\" murmured the\nColonel happily, as he put his best foot forwards; a miracle had\nhappened, and his dear ruffians would go down in glory.\n\nBut as they topped the hill crest came the shrill of a whistle from the\nopposite ridge, and there was half a battalion of the Rutlands\nback-casting for the enemy that had broken through their posts. With\nwild yells both parties charged downwards into the sunken road.\n\nWhen the tumult and shouting had died Patrick went in quest of the\nlittle Padre.\n\nHe discovered him sitting on the wreck of his bivouac of the night; he\nwas clasping some small article to his bosom, and the look in his face\nwas that of a man who had found his heart's desire.\n\nPatrick sat himself down on a box of bombs, and looked humbly at the\nReverend Paul. It is an awful thing for a man suddenly to find he has\nbeen entertaining a hero unawares.\n\n\"Oh, Dicky Bird, Dicky Bird, why did you do it?\" he inquired softly.\n\nThe Padre cocked his head on one side and commenced to ooze apologies\nfrom every pore.\n\n\"Oh dear--you know how absurdly absent-minded I am; well, I suddenly\nremembered I had left my teeth behind.\"\n\nPATLANDER.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n[Illustration: _Old Lady._ \"And what regiment are you in?\"\n\n_The Sub._ \"7th Blankshires.

Without the assistance of\nthis glossary it is almost impossible to read some of the numerous\nnovels of poilu life.\n\nSo far as I am aware the latest creation is the infinitesimal word \"as,\"\nor rather, it is a case of adaptation. Yesterday \"as des carreaux\" (to\ngive the full form) stood simply for ace of diamonds. To-day all France,\nwith that swift assimilation which has ever been one of its many\nmysteries, knows its new meaning and applies it.\n\nAnd what is this new \"as\"? I gather, without having had the advantage of\ncross-examining a French soldier, that an \"as\" is an obscure hero, one\nof the men, and they are by no means rare, who do wonderful things but\ndo not get into the papers or receive medals or any mention in\ndespatches. We all know that many of the finest deeds performed in war\nescape recognition. One does not want to suggest that V.C.'s and\nD.S.O.'s and Military Crosses and all the other desirable tokens of\nvalour are conferred wrongly. Nothing of the kind. They are nobly\ndeserved. But probably there never was a recipient of the V.C. or the\nD.S.O. or the Military Cross who could not--and did not wish to--tell\nhis Sovereign, when the coveted honour was being pinned to His breast,\nof some other soldier not less worthy than himself of being decorated,\nwhose deed of gallantry was performed under less noticeable conditions.\nThe performer of such a deed is an \"as\" and it is his luck to be a not\npublic hero. But why ace of diamonds? That I cannot explain.\n\nThe \"as\" can be found in every branch of the Army, and he is recognised\nas one by his comrades, even although the world at large is ignorant.\nPerhaps we shall find a word for his British correlative, who must be\nnumerically very strong too. The letter A alone might do it, signifying\nanonymous. \"Voila, un as!\" says the French soldier, indicating one of\nthese brave modest fellows who chances to be passing. \"You see that\nchap,\" one of our soldiers would say; \"he's an A.\"\n\nAll that I know of the \"as\" I have gathered from the French satirical\npaper, a child of the War, _La Baionette_. This paper comes out every\nweek and devotes itself, as its forerunner, _L'Assiette au Beurre_,\nused to do, to one theme at a time, one phase or facet of the struggle,\nusually in the army, but also in civil life, where changes due to the\nWar steadily occur. In the number dedicated to the glory of the \"as\" I\nfind recorded an incident of the French Army so moving that I want to\ntell it here, very freely, in English. It was, says the writer, before\nthe attack at Carency, and he vouches for the accuracy of his report,\nfor he was himself present. In the little village of Camblain-l'Abbe a\nregiment was assembled, and to them spoke their Captain. The scene was\nthe yard of a farm. I know so well what it was like. The great manure\nheap in the middle; the carts under cover, with perhaps one or two\nAmerican reapers and binders among them; fowls pecking here and there; a\nthin predatory dog nosing about; a cart-horse peering from his stable\nand now and then scraping his hoofs; a very wide woman at the\ndwelling-house door; the old farmer in blue linen looking on; and there,\ndrawn up, listening to their Captain, row on row of blue-coated men, all\nhard-bitten, weary, all rather cynical, all weather-stained and frayed,\nand all ready to go on for ever.\n\nThis is what the Captain said--a tall thin man of about thirty, speaking\ncalmly and naturally as though he was reading a book. \"I have just seen\nthe Colonel,\" he said; \"he has been in conference with the Commandant,\nand this is what has been settled. In a day or two it is up to us to\nattack. You know the place and what it all means. At such and such an\nhour we shall begin. Very well. Now this is what will happen. I shall be\nthe first to leave the trench and go over the top, and I shall be killed\nat once. So far so good. I have arranged with the two lieutenants for\nthe elder of them to take my place. He also will almost certainly be\nkilled. Then the younger will lead, and after him the sergeants in turn,\naccording to their age, beginning with the oldest who was with me at\nSaida before the War. What will be left by the time you have reached the\npoint I cannot say, but you must be prepared for trouble, as there is a\nlot of ground to cover, under fire. But you will take the point and hold\nit.

Intimately connected with this question is the case of the\n\"deadhead,\" argued with the zeal that is according to knowledge by that\neminent playwright, Mr. HEMMERDE, who knows all about the free-list and\nits services in \"enabling the management to keep the house properly\ndressed\"--this refers, of course, to the front of the house--during the\ndoubtful first weeks of a new play.\n\nMr. HOGGE was in his place again. It had been reported that, consequent\nupon a hasty pledge to remain in Liverpool until his candidate was\nreturned, he was now doomed for ever to wander an unquiet sprite upon\nthe banks of Mersey. But he has wisely determined that Parliament must\nnot suffer to please his private whim.\n\n_Tuesday, July 3rd._--The House of Lords was crowded to hear Lord\nHARDINGE'S comments upon the Mesopotamia Report. Even those critics in\nthe Commons who had declared that a civil servant should not take\nadvantage of his position as a peer to make a personal explanation\nwould, I think, have had no reason to complain of its character. His\nobject was not to defend himself, but to call attention to the splendid\nservices that India had rendered to the Empire during the War in other\nfields than Mesopotamia. In his own phrase, \"India was bled absolutely\nwhite during the first few weeks of the War.\"\n\nWhen the report comes up for formal discussion Lord CURZON will\ndoubtless have something to say, and will say it in vigorous fashion.\nTo-day, with the air and mien of a highly respectable undertaker, he\ncontented himself with acknowledging Lord HARDINGE'S contribution and\ndeprecated further debate.\n\nLord ROBERT CECIL, safely back from his travels, does not appear to have\nkept himself up to date in the interval, for he was ignorant of the\nrefusal of the Allies to allow Greece to set up a republic, although Mr.\nKING, with his superior sources of information, knows all about it.\n\n[Illustration: PARENTAL PRIDE. LORD DERBY.]\n\nAt the close of Questions a stalwart young man in khaki advanced to the\nTable, and, amid the cheers of the Members and to the obvious delight of\nLord DERBY, who sat beaming with parental pride in the Peers' Gallery,\nadded the signature \"STANLEY\" to a roll which has rarely been without\nthat name since \"the Rupert of debate\" signed it there close on a\nhundred years ago.\n\nExcess profits provided the theme for some lively speeches to-day. Major\nHAMILTON did not see why farmers should escape the tax, and instanced\nthe case of a potato-grower who had made ten thousand pounds out of a\ncouple of hundred acres. Several Members connected with the shipping\ninterest protested against the tax. Mr. LEIF-JONES implied that it was\nmore disastrous than the U-boats, and Mr. HOUSTON loudly protested at\nbeing represented as a harpy.\n\nBy these complaints Mr. BONAR LAW was absolutely unmoved, and for very\ngood reason. He had himself a few thousands invested in shipping, and,\nas he was getting about fifty per cent., instead of the modest five per\ncent. which he had anticipated, he had come to the conclusion that even\nunder present conditions the trade was doing pretty well. After this\nconfession of an involuntary profiteer the tax was agreed to. But the\nfarmers, with next year's Budget in view, are praying that the\nconscientious CHANCELLOR will not invest his surplus profits in land.\n\n_Wednesday, July 4th_.--We all know the ex-poacher-turned-game-keeper.\nThe converse process has taken place in the case of Lord PORTSMOUTH,\nwho, when he ceased to be a Minister of the Crown, became a bitter\ncritic of successive Administrations. His complaints of our blockade\npolicy were frigidly acknowledged by Lord MILNER and hotly resented by\nLord LANSDOWNE, upon whom Lord PORTSMOUTH'S ruddy beard always has a\nprovocative effect. It is all very well to talk of being ruthless to\nneutrals, but if we had adopted the noble lord's policy early in the War\nwould the Union Jack and the Stars and Stripes be to-day floating side\nby side all over London?\n\nMr. LYNCH'S latest suggestion for the furtherance of his Republican\npropaganda is that the COMMISSIONER OF WORKS should remove from the\nstreets all statues of deceased monarchs, and replace them by those of\ngreat leaders of thought. Sir ALFRED MOND absolutely refused. The worst\nkings sometimes make the best statues, and he is not prepared to\nsacrifice JAMES II. from the Admiralty even to put Mr. LYNCH himself on\nthe vacant pedestal.\n\n\"P. R.\" came up smiling for another round, and, having secured the\nservices on this occasion of Mr. ASQUITH as judicious bottle-holder, was\nexpected to make a good fight of it. The EX-PREMIER scouted the notion\nthat the new plan of voting would fill the House with freaks and\nfaddists, a class from which, he hinted, it is not, even under present\nconditions, entirely immune. But the majority evidently felt that there\ncould not be much amiss with a system which had returned such wise and\npatriotic persons as themselves to Parliament, and they outed P. R. by\n201 to 169.\n\n_Thursday, July 5th_.--It is hardly surprising that the Government has\ndecided not to proceed at present with its great scheme of nationalizing\nthe liquor-traffic. The announcement that, in order to meet the\nrequirements of the harvest-season, the brewers should be allowed to\nincrease the output of beer by one-third, brought a swarm of hornets\nabout the CHANCELLOR'S head. Mr. LEIF-JONES (irreverently known as\n\"Tea-leaf JONES\") was horrified at the thought that more grain and sugar\nshould be diverted to this pernicious liquid; Mr. DEVLIN and other\nchampions of the trade were almost equally annoyed because the\nharvest-beer was to be of a lower specific gravity. The storm of\n\"supplementaries\" showed no sign of abating, until the SPEAKER, who\nrarely fails to find the appropriate phrase, remarked upon \"This thirst\nfor information,\" and so dissolved the House in laughter.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n[Illustration: _Gunner (home on leave)_. \"WAITER, MY NEIGHBOUR'S EFFORTS\nWITH HIS SOUP (BY THE WAY, I'M SURE HE OUGHT TO BE INTERNED) ARE MORE\nTHAN I CAN BEAR.

My brother says it\nmeans Very Active Damsles but you cant beleive him, and anyway no one\ntalks of damsles nowydays besept in potry.

POMEROY'S REPUTATION.\"\n\nCandour (subacid virtue) compels me to set down that there was nothing\nvery notable or novel about the manipulation, by Messrs. HORACE ANNESLEY\nVACHELL and THOMAS COBB, of the comedy of needless complications\nentitled _Mrs. Pomeroy's Reputation_. The occasion was chiefly notable\nfor the return of Miss VIOLET VANBRUGH to active service and the welcome\nshe was given by her splendidly loyal following.\n\n_Sir Granville Pomeroy_, childless head of an odious family, has designs\non, and for, the son of his brother's pretty widow, he suspecting her to\nbe no fit and proper person to bring up a young _Pomeroy_. And indeed\nthree short months after her husband's death she played bridge, bought a\nkimono and an expensive carpet, and, it is said, even flirted. Why such\nrecklessness? Well, she discovered a stray daughter of her sainted\nhusband. The irregular mother died, and of course solid _Mrs. Pomeroy_\nwith the bubble reputation did the handsome thing, and shut her mouth\nuntil the fatal moment in the Third Act, when it all came out. Whereby\nand wherein she discovered that the philandering _Vincent Dampier_ could\ntrust where the solemn _Maurice Randall_ could not. As a side issue the\nblameless baronet had a little goose to wife, who went to _Dampier's_\nMaidenhead bungalow and fell into the river. Elaborate lies to explain\nquite simple situation to fool anxious to believe the worst. Moral:\nNever lie to save a little goose.\n\n[Illustration: LETTICE AND IMPROMPTU DRESSING.\n\n_Lettice_ MISS LETTICE FAIRFAX.\n_Georgina_ MISS VIOLET VANBRUGH.\n_Vincent Dampier_ MR.

Loyalty would have carried her\nthrough a duller play, to say nothing of her charming looks and her\nqueenly way of wearing a beautiful gown. Mr. LOWNE, as the baronet, made\neffective play with a quite impossible part in a quite futile situation,\nand held the reflector up to the best Mayfair Cockney with \"_Georginar_\nexplains.\" He needn't apologise; we know it's true to life! The piece of\nacting that most cheered me was Mr. GRAHAME HERINGTON as the\nphilanderer's manservant--a very tactful and observant performance. Mr.\nFRANK ESMOND, the philanderer, seemed ill at ease (partly art but partly\nnature, I judged, perhaps unjustly). Miss LETTICE FAIRFAX as the little\ngoose was what I believe is known as adequate.\n\nT.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Food Shortage.\n\nLetter received by a schoolteacher:--\n\n    \"Dear Miss,--Will you please let Sam out about 20 minutes to 12\n    o'clock.

His keen bronzed face and his obviously\nathletic body, clothed in white flannel, brought back to me the far days\nwhen the sharp clean crack in the adjoining field told of a loose one\nwhich had been got away square.\n\nI looked at him again and thought how glad he must be to get into mufti\nfor a few days. I tell you this to show how unprejudiced I was. The only\nother signs of life were the two super-aborigines who inhabit the\ncroquet patch and detest all other mankind. I approached one of them\nwarily and asked a question. He regarded me with a bilious and\nsuspicious eye.\n\n\"Nothing whatever to do with the Army,\" he snapped, and a Prussian-blue\nopponent was smacked off into an arid and hoopless waste.\n\n\"Ah!\" I exclaimed, \"then he's only a rabbit after all.\"\n\nThe old thing gave me an unfriendly glance and then missed his hoop\nbadly. I strolled across and sat down beside the newcomer. He smiled at\nme in a frank and disarming manner.\n\n### Summary:"}

I have used it   |\n  | constantly, in shirt manufacturing as well as family sewing, |\n  | sixteen years. My wife ran it four years, and earned between |\n  |   $700 and $800, besides doing her housework. I have never   |\n  |  expended fifty cents on it for repairs. It is, to-day, in   |\n  |   the best of order, stitching fine linen bosoms nicely. I   |\n  | started manufacturing shirts with this machine, and now have |\n  | over one hundred of them in use. I have paid at least $3,000 |\n  |  for the stitching done by this old machine, and it will do  |\n  |              as much now as any machine I have.              |\n  |                                                              |\n  |                         W.F.

A widow. Her\nhusband, the late TIMOTHY, was a New York detective. Amassing a\ncompetency, he emigrated to Indiana, became a Bank Director and\nSunday-School Superintendent, and died beloved by all.\n\nProduce your very best bow for Mrs. LADLE, and trot out your company\ntalk, for she's in the mother-in-law business, and thoroughly up to\nsnuff.\n\nThis old male party, with the remains of a luxuriant growth of very red\nhair, clinging fondly, like underbrush round a rock, to the sides of his\nhead, with a seedy-looking patch far under the chin to match, whose limp\ndickey droops pensively as if seeking to crawl bodily into the embrace\nof the plaid gingham which encircles his neck, and in whose nose is\nembodied that rare vermilion tint which artists so love to dwell\nupon;--this is the Hon. MICHAEL LADLE, brother of the late TIMOTHY, a\nWestern Member of Congress, and a grass widower.\n\nThis girl of the period, whose saucy black eyes bear down on you like a\ntwenty-four gun frigate; looking as it were through you, and counting\nthe hairs on the back of your neck, is Miss BELINDA LADLE, daughter of\nthe deceased TIMOTHY, and step-daughter to the hostess who was TIM'S\nsecond matrimonial venture, you understand.\n\nThis young woman mounts a lager-beer cask, and stops the buzz of\nconversation by bringing her mallet down with a smart rap upon the head\nof the nearest bald-headed gentleman.\n\n\"Attention, company,\" said she--\"Stand up straight, and look as well as\nyou can.--_Take_--mallets.\"\n\nWhile the guests are boisterously laughing, with that rare appreciation\nof refined humor peculiar to the West, Mrs. LADLE, the proper, attempts\nan indignant remonstrance, but is interrupted by the Hon. MICHAEL.\n\n\"Oh, let the little gal have her tantrums, sister-in-law,\" said he.\n\"Mebbe _you_ was young once, though nobody now living could swear to\nit.\"\n\n\"Come,\" interrupted BELINDA, \"we've had gassin' enough. Choose your\npartners. Mildewed age, before infantile beauty. Mother-in-law, go in.\"\n\nThe extremely respectable and highly dignified female last alluded to\nshook her fist at BELINDA on the sly, and said:\n\n\"I'll take ANN BRUMMET.\"\n\nThe lady who stepped forward at this summons was greeted with a wide\nstare, and every eye-glass was focussed.\n\nShe was a remarkable-looking female. She wasn't exactly handsome, but\nthere was a sort of a something about her, you understand,\nthat--ah--riveted the gaze of folks generally, you see, and a\nfellow--ah--caught himself looking the second time, as you may say--and\nah--it wasn't style either, for one shoulder was higher than the other,\nand her hair was done up in a bob, and she took awful long steps, and\nswung her arms as far as they would go each way; and her collar looked\nas though she'd slept in it, and she wore rubbers like a school-ma'am.\n\nAnd you couldn't say 'twas regularity of features exactly, either, for\nher eyes were too limited in circumference, and her nose too numerous in\ndiameter; and her mouth monopolized too much latitude, and she had a\nhair-mole on one cheek, and faint dawnings of a moustache on her upper\nlip. But in spite of these trivial eccentricities, you felt when you\nlooked at her, as I said before--ah--a sort of--as it were--a--\n\nBy Jove, I can't describe it.\n\nThe general impression was that she was an heiress, and the comments\nwere numerous.\n\n\"How graceful!\" \"Look at that swan-like neck!\" \"What a perfect form!\"\n\"What a dove-like expression!\" \"Do introduce me!\" \"Who is she?\"\n\n\"She's a poor relation of Mrs. LADLE'S.\"\n\n\"There, I thought so!\" \"What an object!\" \"Forcing herself into genteel\nsociety, too!\" \"The audacity of these creatures is perfectly horrid.\"\n\nIt was BELINDA'S turn to choose next, and she pointed straight at the\nman she wanted, and said:\n\n\"JEFFRY MAULBOY.\"\n\nIt was natural she should choose him, for he was greatly respected by\nall present, and the ladies especially regarded him as simply a hero;\nfor he was one of the Great Masters in the noble Art of Muscle.\n\nLet me explain.\n\nAt the time of which I write, there had been a contest in the\nUniversities of America between Brains and Muscle, and the latter had\nconquered. Brains were accounted a very good thing in their way, but\nwhat we want, sir, is Muscle. If a man can master his Greek, and his\nLatin, and his Theology, and his Law, and such frothy trifles between\ntimes, well and good, but he musn't neglect his Muscle.\n\nAnd so base-ball clubs were organized, and the Long Heels challenged the\nShort Heels, and the leading journals published cards of defiance from\nthe Knockers to the Hitters, together with labored editorials on the\nsame. And boat-races and sculling matches were set on foot, and once a\nyear the students repaired with their friends to a city afflicted with a\nlake, where, pending the contest, they organized a Reign of Terror,\nduring which the harmless inhabitants locked themselves in their houses\nand clasped their offspring to their bosoms, or gazed terror-stricken\nfrom an attic-window upon the classical marauders below, as they\nindulged in a _post-mortem_ examination of a private dwelling, or the\nrare pleasantry of roasting a policeman. But dared complain, for public\nexcitement waxed high on the subject of Muscle.\n\nAnd when the day arrived which was to decide the momentous question, the\nbanks of the lake were decked with the beauty and culture of the land,\nand fair hands \"staked their odds,\" and fair lips became familiar with\n\"home-stretches,\" \"spurts,\" and \"fouls.\"\n\nA body of students crossed the ocean to win a boat-race, and the public\nPress told us in very large capitals what they ate and drank, and the\nexact condition of a boil belonging to one of the party. But the heart\nof the nation beat high with hope, until the appalling intelligence was\nflashed across the wires that they were defeated. It was a cruel blow.\nStrong men looked at one another in mute agony, or spoke as if there was\na corpse in the next room. The Press sent up a wail that resounded\nthrough the land. An eminent divine pronounced it a \"National\nmisfortune,\" and the pictorials containing wood-cuts of the lamented\nheroes were put away, as we put away the playthings of a child that has\ndied.\n\nNo wonder that Mr. JEFFRY MAULBOY was looked up to and courted, for he\nhad a medal bestowed upon him as a Champion Paddler, and had lost a bet\nof fifty dollars on the \"Great International Contest.\"\n\nBut his towering ambition remained unsated. He realized that he lived in\na progressive age, and his superior talents enabled him to take a stand\nfar ahead of his fellows. By diligent application to his noble\nprofession, he was now a member of that exalted Institution, \"The Prize\nRing of America,\" and the letters P.R.U.S.A. were elegantly imprinted\nwith blue ink upon his right arm.\n\nThere were two persons present, however, who didn't regard JEFFRY\nMAULBOY as a little god. One was the Hon. MICHAEL LADLE; the other was\nANN BRUMMET.\n\nShe was putting her tongue out, and making faces at him from behind an\napple-tree. A lady who saw her said it improved her appearance.\n\nWhen BELINDA chose JEFFRY, he very deliberately took a chew of tobacco,\nand said he wouldn't play.\n\n\"This is the sickest croquet party I ever saw,\" said BELINDA. \"All\nbacking out. Spos'en I take you then, you dear old buffer,\" she added,\naddressing the Hon. MICHAEL.\n\n\"I may be an old buffer,\" said the Hon. Member from the West, but I am\nyoung enough for anything here. As STOWE BYRON says:\n\n    \"Oh, days of my childhood's hours,\n    I'm a gazin' on ye yit.\"\n\nHe was interrupted by JEFFRY MAULBOY.\n\n\"You say you are young enough for anything here,\" said he; \"suppose you\nand I try a little mill out back of the house.\"\n\n\"Young man,\" replied the Hon. MICHAEL, \"if there's one mistake in life\nthat your parents grieve over, it is probably the mistake of your birth.\nIf you don't have any serious drawbacks, and are careful of your health,\nyou will make a first-class DEAD BEAT. When a man insults me, sir, I lay\nhim out, without depending in the smallest degree upon an undertaker,\nbut as for standing up in front of a man who mashes noses by contract,\nand chaws off ears as a matter of genteel business, why it ain't my\ncut.\"\n\nJEFFRY MAULBOY took another chew of tobacco.\n\n\"You can go on,\" he said. \"I won't hurt you. You're too small potatoes\nfor me.\"\n\nWhile this gentle raillery was in progress, BELINDA felt somebody\ntugging at her dress. She looked down, and saw Mr. ARCHIBALD BLINKSOP, a\nsailor-looking chap who smelt of tar, and well he might, for he had\nploughed the tempestuous deep for upwards of six months, as a common\nsailor on the Erie Canal.\n\n\"Shiver my starboard binnacle amidships,\" said he, \"why don't you choose\n_me?\"_\n\nShe squeezed his hand and winked at him.\n\n\"I _will_ choose you, dear,\" said she. \"Don't blush so.\"\n\nThe game has commenced.\n\nJEFFRY MAULBOY, standing aloof, is just taking a fresh chew, when a hand\nis laid on his shoulder.\n\nThe hand is that of ANN BRUMMET, the poor relation, and the voice that\nbreaks on his ear is also the property of that extraordinary woman.\n\n\"JEFF,\" said she cautiously, \"meet me in just half an hour, out back of\nthe house. You know the place. Where the woodbine has twined so much.\nI've got something _very_ particular to tell you.\" And she pinched his\narm slyly.\n\nThe game progresses.\n\nThe Hon. MICHAEL LADLE and ARCHIBALD BLINKSOP are conversing together.\n\n\"That MAULBOY is a jackass,\" said the former. \"Is he a friend of\nyour'n?\"\n\n\"Well, not exactly,\" returned ARCHIBALD. \"You see, it's just like this,\"\nhe continued, hitching up his pants behind, and rolling, the same as\nsailors do on the stage. \"About two months ago JEFF made a voyage with\nme. One night we were bowling along the canal under a very stiff breeze.\nThe compass stood north-east and a half, the thermometer was chafing\nfearfully, and the jib-boom, only two-thirds reefed was lashing\nfuriously against the poop-deck. Suddenly, that terrible cry, 'A man\noverboard!' I lost no time. I bore down on the taffrail threw the cook\noverboard, and soon had the satisfaction of seeing our noble craft lay\nover abaft the wind. Then, quick as thought, I belayed the windlass and\nlowered a gaff. It struck something soft. I heard JEFF cry: 'Don't hit\nmy head again.' I was careful. The gaff slid along his back, and finally\nsettled firmly into the seat of his trousers. He was hoisted aboard. The\nfirst thing he did was to see if his tobacco was safe. Then he offered\nme a chew and said: 'Bless you, bless you; you have saved my life, and\nowe me a debt of gratitude forever.' And I'spose I do,\" added ARCHIBALD.\n\"It's the way of the world.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the Hon. MICHAEL, \"I don't envy you. I shouldn't want to\nowe him a debt of any kind.\"\n\n\"Why?\" queried BLINKSOP.\n\n\"Because, sooner or later, you'll have to pay it, double over,\" was the\nreply.\n\n(To be continued.)\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFrom Gay to Grave.\n\nHere is a suggestive item from abroad:--\n\n\"On the Crown Prince's birthday he and his staff dined with the King of\nPrussia at the Prefecture at Versailles, where covers were laid for\neighty.\"\n\nWill PRUSSIA have the goodness to inform PUNCHINELLO (post-paid) how\nmany victims of the battle-field _covers_ have been laid for since the\nbeginning of the war?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nConfidential.\n\nBusiness at the Interior Department will now be done up in a rapid\nmanner, for there can be no delay by DELA-NO.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPUNCHINELLO CORRESPONDENCE.\n\nANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.\n\n_Veritas._ A paragraph has been going the rounds of the papers, giving\nsome description of an animal called the \"Tygomelia\"--a sort of\ncamelopard--said to have lately been captured in the Hudson Bay\nTerritory.

This frothy and frenzied Republic is at that\nebb where national \"extreme unction\" must be administered speedily, else\nthe sufferer will pass away from the theatre of sublunary things without\nthe benefit of clergy. I feel as if I would like to get the whole nation\non a toasting-fork before a slow fire, and roast it into a realizing\nsense of what the devil is doing for it. To see BISMARCK feeding on\nshrimps with anchovy sauce, and drinking champagne, while TROCHU and\nJULES FAVRE fight domestic treason within the walls, and the Prussians\nwithout, upon stomachs that feebly digest Parisian \"hard tack\" and\ngritty _vin ordinaire,_ is enough to make the spirit of liberty lay over\nthe mourner's bench and perpetrate a perfect Niagara of tears. When\nFLOURENS bagged the whole government at the Hotel de Ville the other\nday, my feelings got the better of me, and I went for him.\n\n\"Idiotic Frenchmen!\" I exclaimed, in a voice that must have sounded like\nan echo working its way through a thick upper crust of doughy\napple-dumplings; \"Idiotic Frenchmen, do you know what you are doing?\nHave you the feelings of a man, or of a mad dog? Which is it that it is,\nthat you should be worrying the life out of this croupy infant of\nliberty, as is hardly able to waggle its head, barring all hope that it\nwill ever get upon its pins and take its 'constitutional' like other\nmortals in distress? Where is the ghost of MIRABEAU, that it does not\ncome upon you all of a sudden, to confiscate the very marrow in your\nbones and set up a candle factory in spite of the tax on tallow? Where\nis LAFAYETTE? Where is REGINALD DE LYLE? Where is ROBESPIERRE and GEORGE\nFRANCIS TRAIN? Where is the DUKE DE MONTEBELLO, or the Count of MONTE\nCHRISTO, that they don't hang round you like aggravated wasps, and sting\nyou into that appreciation of the fitness of things whereby some razor\nmay be slipped across your wizzen, and Paris follow your corse to the\n_Pere la Chaise_ with joy and gladness? Why, in the name of all the\ntorments--\"\n\nI stopped for want of breath, in time to see that the crowd paid no\nattention, and that, to say the least of it, I had been making an ass of\nmyself. Not that there was no wisdom in my words, but these Frenchmen\nare the most \"dog gorned\" insensible people to right up and down, plain,\neveryday gospel truth that Providence ever permitted to play checkers\nwith Destiny. I had no hankering for a closer interview with FLOURENS.\nHe and I could never had got at a basis peace. There is no harmony in\nthe method of our mental \"jointings.\" I would have given \"stamps\" to\nhave got his head under a quiet village pump, but I wouldn't have\nundertaken to reason with him for all the gold of the Credit Mobilier.\nThere is another creamy idiot, trying his \"level best\" to smash things\nhere. Look at him! JULES VALLES! a patriot by name and a Pat-rioter by\nnature, with enough hair on his head to stuff a gabion, and not sense\nenough beneath it to accommodate a well-informed parrot. These fellows\ncall FAVRE a \"milk-sop,\" and the trouble of it is that FAYRE\noccasionally gives them reason for doing so. Strolling through the\n_Passage des Princes_ this morning, I saw TROCHU and accosted him.\n\"General,\" I said, probably with some trifling vindictiveness in my\nheart, \"isn't there a grease vat in Paris sufficiently large to boil\ndown Monsieur FLOURENS and his friends?\" He might have thought that I\nwas a little overheated, or that some of the _Grand Cafe_ \"tangle-foot\"\nhad got into my head; but his looks undeniably indicated that he did not\nregard this as an unusually _cool_ proposal. He simply said, \"Oh my!\" in\ntolerably good English, and then I continued:\n\n\"You mistake me, General. I was not born in New Zealand. There is\nnothing of the cannibal about me, and I trust the supply of provisions\nin Paris won't compel us to eat each other just yet; but if there is no\nsatisfaction for the stomach in putting a tun or two of boiling fat\naround GUSTAVE FLOURENS, can you think of anything better calculated to\nproduce serenity in the public mind?\"\n\nHe didn't answer me then. It couldn't be expected, perhaps; but I am\nstill of the impression that this conundrum is gradually working towards\na solution in the brain of the Commander-in-Chief. I hope it don't lay\nheavily there; I wouldn't do anything to distress him. If GOLDWIN SMITH\nwere expounding political economy to him in one ear, and HORACE GREELEY\ntalking agriculture in the other, the poor man couldn't be more bothered\nthan he is. No, no; far be it from me to add one harrowing burden to his\nalready heavy load; but when a man sees the porter-house steak of\nLiberty a burning up on the grid-iron of war, why shouldn't he put forth\nhis \"flipper\" and save it if he can? And there's another conundrum: but\nit's for PUNCHINELLO and his hemisphere of adorers.\n\nDICK TINTO.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA GOOD BAR-GAIN SUGGESTED.\n\nThe suggestion for purifying the New York Bar by classifying its tenders\nis a good one and should be acted upon. As it is now, the justice there\ndispensed is so mixed and doctored that it satisfies only the vitiated\ntaste of the roughs. The proceedings in the McFARLAND and JACKSON case\nshow that swagger, not study--bullying, not brains, are in a fair way to\nbecome the important qualifications of a counsel. The lawyers should\norganize in their own defence and classify themselves. Mr. PUNCHINELLO\nsuggests the following method as the simplest and probably the most\neffective in its application to matters of legal digestion. Let there be\ntwo classes made, the one to embrace the well-bred, and the other the\nGRAHAM bred practitioners.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTHE SPORT AT WASHINGTON.--Fighting COX.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTHE PLAYS AND SHOWS\n\n\"O What a wretched smell of orange-peel and sawdust!\" says MARGARET to me,\nas we enter the gateway of the CIRCUS. Wretched! Why of all perfumes,\nnext to that of the clover and the new-mown hay, it is the most\ndelicious. For it brings back to us the days of our innocent childhood,\nwhen we stole unlawful pennies to pay for admission to the charmed\ncircle of equestrian delights, and in youthful purity of soul, and\ngeneral dirtiness of face and hands, listened to the ingenious\nwitticisms of the clown, while we cracked the peaceful peanut, and\nshared the social gingerbread.\n\nChildlike innocence is a phrase that must originally have been applied\nexclusively to girls. Obviously it is sheer nonsense as applied to boys.\nWho ever saw an innocent boy, especially in a place of amusement? Are\nthey not, one and all, given to untimely hunger, and addicted to\nundesirable methods of assuaging its pangs? Are they not prone to\nperpetual colds in the head, accompanied by loud and labored breathing,\nand rarely mitigated by the judicious use of pocket-handkerchiefs? Do\nthey not indulge in a vicious and wholly unpardonable wealth of muddy\nboots, wherewith to trample upon their unoffending neighbors? Are they\nnot as prone to bad language as the _Tribune,_ and as noisy and noisome\nas the _Sun_ itself? In short, are they not always and altogether the\nmost oppressive nuisance that can annoy the peaceful pleasure-seeker?\nEcho answers that there isn't the smallest possible doubt of it. Why,\nthen, do we foolishly speak of innocent boyhood?\n\nGirls, on the other hand, may be innocent,--that is to say, when they\nare extremely young. Of course they outgrow it when they arrive at years\nof flirtation; but up to--say--their tenth or eleventh year, they rarely\ngo in for muddy boots and inappropriate peanuts,--at least not to the\nsame extent as boys. The average little girl is, moreover, seldom found\nat the CIRCUS. She prefers WALLACK'S, or BOOTH'S theatre,--whereas your\nusual boy despises the legitimate drama, and prefers to have his\ndissipations served up with a great deal of horse and plentifully spiced\nwith the presence of the cheerful clown. For my part, I frankly confess\nthat I do not like boys, and heartily approve of the noble sentiment\nexpressed the other day by my landlady, who, on reading that the\nParisians had destroyed the Bois de Boulogne, remarked that, \"Even if\nthe French couldn't spell 'boys' properly, she was glad to see that they\nknew how to treat them.\" Pardon the errors of her pronunciation. She\nlearned French at a young ladies' seminary.\n\nBut I digress. It is a reprehensible habit. It is much better, as a\nrule, to die game than it is to digress, though on the present occasion\nthere is no reason why I should do either. By the way, if a man has to\nchoose between having either his leg or his arm amputated, which ought\nhe to choose? Obviously he should choose ether,--that being much safer\nthan chloroform.\n\nAs I was saying, the CIRCUS always has a strong flavor of orange peel.\nWill some one explain why orange-peel has such a close affinity for\nhorses and sawdust? I have attempted to account for it by an elaborate\nstretching of the theory of chemical affinities. People crack peanuts at\nthe CIRCUS, because the cracking of peanuts in its prosaic dreariness is\nin harmony with the cracking of jokes by the dreary clown. The clown\nhimself is always hoarse, obviously because of his intimate association\nwith the feats of horsemanship. Here are two cases in which the theory\nof affinities clearly applies. Now, can we not go further, and find some\nconnection between the ring of the Circus and the peel of the orange? Or\nagain, may not the presence of unwholesome animals in the arena have\nsomething to do with the presence of orange-rind in the seats? The\nlatter is clearly a rind-pest of the very worst variety.\n\nAt this rate we shall never get inside the _Circus_ building. So say\nMARGARET; and I therefore cease my philosophical remarks, which have so\nstrongly impressed the doorkeeper that he has finally beckoned to a\npoliceman to come and listen to them. Up the steep stairs we hasten, and\nare put into a reserved pen, where we watch the glory of motley and the\nglitter of spangles in the ring below.\n\nA terrific feat of horsemanship is in progress. A daring rider, mounted\non a broad platform, which is borne on the back of a placid horse, is\ncarried on a slow canter around the ring. He evidently impersonates a\nmember of the horse marines, for he executes elaborate imitations of\npulling ropes, reefing and furling sails. Probably the horse marines\nreef topsails on horseback. In the absence of opposing testimony we\naccept his theory, and are greatly pleased to find that the equestrian\nsailor finally escapes being wrecked on the lower row of benches, and so\nmeeting a watery grave among the sawdust, while his horse slowly\nfounders beneath him.\n\nI remark to MARGARET, while this daring act of marine horsemanship in\nprogress, that \"I hope the horse won't founder\"--meaning to pun on the\nlatter word.\n\nBut I am overheard by a horsey person in the neighborhood, who replies,\n\"That horse hain't got a symptom of foundering. LENT keeps his horses in\ntoo good condition for that.\"\n\nAnd I to him, in a light and jocose manner--\"LENT keeps them so well fed\nthat they never keep Lent themselves, I suppose.\"\n\nBut the horsey person does not see my joke,--thus proving that he shares\na dulness of perception that I have too often noticed, even among my\nfriends. So I mercifully give him one more chance and say: \"I suppose\nMr. LENT keeps all the fast horses, so that they never have to keep fast\nthemselves.\" But he gruffly answers, \"You think yourself smart, don't\nyou? You ain't, though, and you'd better keep yourself mighty quiet.\" I\nagree with him in the latter opinion, and relapse into a dignified\nsilence.\n\nPresently the \"Antipodal Brothers\" begin their fraternal gymnastics. I\nagain feel the spirit of speculation strong within me, and say to\nMARGARET, \"Why are gymnasts always born in couples? Why couldn't the\nAntipodal Cousins, or the Antipodal Relations by Marriage, break their\nnecks together with as much effect as though they were brothers? Does\nthe fraternal supply of brotherly gymnastics exist in consequence of a\npresumed demand for the article by the public? If so, why does the\npublic make such demand?\"\n\nAnd she answers, \"It is a mystery. Seek not to penetrate it. That way\nmadness lies.\"\n\nHere a conundrum obtrudes itself upon me, and I ask, \"Suppose Gen. TERRY\nhad a daughter, why would she necessarily be a delightful puzzle?\nObviously because she would be a Miss TERRY.\"\n\nBut the horsey person turns round and says, \"If you want a head put on\nyou, just keep on talking; so that folks can't hear the brothers turn a\nsomersault. You'll be accommodated; do you understand?\"\n\nI accept his general hint, and watch the somersaulting pair. What an\neditor the elder brother would make! He could turn as sudden and perfect\na somersault as did Mr. DANA, when he transformed the _Sun_ in a single\nnight from a decent daily to what it now is. Or what a politician the\nyounger brother might become, were he to exhibit in the arena of public\nlife the agility in turning flip-flaps, and reversing himself by\nunexpectedly standing on his head, which he displays in the CIRCUS ring.\nThen the famous equestrienne--or rideress, as WEBSTER would probably\ncall her--careers around the circle on her thoroughbred Alaskian steed:\nshe is evidently a great favorite, and the small boy behind me exclaims,\nwith an ecstatic kick at the back of my neck: \"Isn't this bully?\"\n\nI venture to correct him by remarking: \"My son, you should say 'horsey.'\nYou would thereby avoid confounding the noble animals before you with\nthe no less useful, but undeniably less attractive--in an aesthetic\npoint of view--animals which belong to the bovine race.\"\n\nHe is evidently overcome by my flow of language, and he asks, with a\nfeeble show of independence: \"You ain't hungry, are you?\"\n\nI say to myself: \"Kind-hearted little fellow. He is grateful for my\nreproof, and proposes to reward me with peanuts.\" So I kindly reply:\n\"No, my child, I am not hungry; why do you ask?\"\n\n\"Because,\" answers the young villain, \"I thought you couldn't be, after\nhaving histed in a whole big dictionary.\"\n\nI turn abruptly to MARGARET and say: \"Come, my dear\"--(she is my maiden\naunt, and I use the language of affection and respect to her)--\"let us\ngo. This thing is only fit for children. We'll go over to WALLACK'S and\nsee an old comedy.\"\n\nShe rises reluctantly; but as we emerge into Fourteenth street, she\nsays: \"The CIRCUS is one of the nicest places in town, and I like it a\nmillion times better than I do your stupid old comedies.\"\n\nThe curious circumstance in connection with this remark is, that\nMARGARET is nearly always right.\n\nMATADOR.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSARSFIELD YOUNG'S PANORAMA.\n\nDEAR PUNCHINELLO:--Some months ago, a friend of mine requested me to\nwrite him up descriptions for a set of panoramic views, which he had\npurchased at a low figure at auction, and which he proposed to exhibit\nthrough the country. The \"Professor\" who was engaged to travel with him,\nit seems, was highly gifted so far as good clothes, a fine head of hair,\nand a sweet expression, were concerned. He could also play rudimentary\nmusic upon the flute. But he couldn't handle his mother tongue glibly\nenough to accompany the scenes in first class showman style.\n\nHaving the subjects given me, but without seeing a foot of the canvas, I\nknocked off a few remarks, which I aimed to render as appropriate as\ncircumstances, and no regard whatever for the truth, would permit. The\n\"Professor\" was to commit them to memory, with the usual gestures, as he\nflourished his pointing-stick; he was to twirl his moustache, manoeuvre\nhis pocket handkerchief, and occasionally resort to a glass of\nwater,--and I am told he recites with great abandon.\n\nSome of PUNCHINELLO'S readers may not enjoy the privilege of seeing the\n\"Panoramic Cosmos.\" For their special benefit I am allowed to append a\nportion of the narration. They will observe that the back towns are\nindeed fortunate to obtain at a moderate price so rare an intellectual\ntreat.\n\nYours,\n\nSARSFIELD YOUNG.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPART I.\n\nLADIES AND GENTLEMEN:--We are proud to have the honor of appearing\nbefore you with our series of unrivalled paintings. Inferior exhibitions\nboast of the extent of their canvas: ours is literally endless. Like Mr.\nBROOKS' TENNYSON (I beg pardon,--Mr. TENNYSON'S BROOK), it \"runs on\nforever.\" It embraces every variety of landscape, waterscape, and, in\nthe crowded halls of our large cities, a new patent fire-escape.\n\nEverywhere we have met with unparalleled success. We have appeared\nbefore the crowned heads of Europe, and the woolly heads of Charleston\nand Savannah,--the verdict of praise is unanimous. Purchasing our oil\nand varnish at wholesale prices, we defy competition. While we have\ngiven orders to our artists to furnish the most brilliant colors and\ngorgeous imagination that the market affords, there is nothing here\n(except, perhaps, myself) to offend the most fastidious.\n\nOur aim is high, but combined with a price that is unquestionably low;\nwe strive to elevate and instruct the people, at twenty-five cents a\nhead (or packages of five tickets for one dollar), and inspire a love\nfor the pure and beautiful in art, with a liberal discount to Sunday and\nday schools.\n\nAs the audience sit spell-bound (no extra charge for reserved seats)\nbefore one grand conception of the artist's pencil,--lost in\nadmiration--another glides noiselessly into view; the eye is gratified,\nthe brain is refreshed, the digestion stimulated, and we all breathe\neasier.\n\nThis alone is worth double the price of admission.\n\nBut not to detain you longer on the threshold, I will ring up the\ncurtain, and travel with you in this varied journey.\n\nTHE GIANTS' CAUSEWAY.\n\nThis stupendous structure is agreeably located on the coast of Ireland,\nwhere the waves are ever beating, and the stormy winds do blow. These\npillars, grottoes, and colonnades strike the beholder with awe. They\nhave resulted from some grand convulsion of Nature; rocked in the cradle\nof the deep, as things seem to be here.\n\nIt is not yet decided whether they belong to the pre-Raphaelite or the\npre-Adamite period.\n\nAs the spectator gazes spell-bound on this scene of grandeur, he almost\nfancies that he hears the surges beating heavily at the base of these\ngrim rocks. (This is effected by costly machinery, concealed behind the\ncanvas.)\n\nThese columns have probably been standing here for centuries. At least\nthat is my opinion.\n\nI propose it to this scientific audience with great humility.\n\nBy this I mean that the great HUGH MILLER thinks as I do.\n\nHe must be a bold man to contradict such authority.\n\nThis, however, is a boulder!\n\nJUAN FERNANDEZ,\n\nAn island in the Pacific. It is called an island, as it is entirely\nsurrounded by water. It is famous as the residence of ROBINSON CRUSOE,\nwho, to avoid taxation in his native land, lived here in great\nretirement. He had a faithful servant, FRIDAY, whom he enjoyed as much\nas one of these boys here does Saturday afternoon.\n\nThere is quite a local look to this view, which renders it valuable to\nthe enthusiastic student of geography.\n\nShips sometimes stop here. Our artist's ship stopped fifteen minutes,\nthus giving him ample time for this spirited and life-like\nrepresentation.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"DE TEA FABULA NARRATUR.\"\n\nThe women have embarked in the tea business. Tea at net prices is to be\none of the chief tenets of the woman's rights party. The middle men now\nengaged in the business are all to be abolished. All the women lecturers\nare to become tea-totallers, and go before their audiences laden with\npackages for sale, in lots to suit, for cash. Intimations of all this we\ngather from the recent news from Japan, where the agent of the Woman's\nTea Company, who has undertaken this reformation, has arrived, and been\ninterviewed, on her way to secure the stock. But really, if the women do\nmanage to give us our tea at a reasonable rate, we will buy it gladly,\neven though, perhaps, we should be forced to attend the lectures in\norder to obtain it.

Taken from Curley, Note 3, at end)\n\n\n*This Treatise on the Emendation of the Intellect etc., which we\ngive you here, kind reader, in its unfinished [that is, defective]\nstate, was written by the author many years ago now. He always\nintended to finish it. But hindered by other occupations, and\nfinally snatched away by death, he was unable to bring it to the\ndesired conclusion. But since it contains many excellent and useful\nthings, which--we have no doubt--will be of great benefit to\nanyone sincerely seeking the truth, we did not wish to deprive you\nof them. And so that you would be aware of, and find less difficult\nto excuse, the many things that are still obscure, rough, and\nunpolished, we wished to warn you of them. Farewell.*\n\n\n\n\n\n[1]  (1) After experience had taught me that all the usual\nsurroundings of social life are vain and futile; seeing that none\nof the objects of my fears contained in themselves anything either\ngood or bad, except in so far as the mind is affected by them,\nI finally resolved to inquire whether there might be some real\ngood having power to communicate itself, which would affect the\nmind singly, to the exclusion of all else: whether, in fact, there\nmight be anything of which the discovery and attainment would\nenable me to enjoy continuous, supreme, and unending happiness.\n\n[2]  (1) I say \"I finally resolved,\" for at first sight it seemed\nunwise willingly to lose hold on what was sure for the sake of\nsomething then uncertain.  (2) I could see the benefits which are\nacquired through fame and riches, and that I should be obliged to\nabandon the quest of such objects, if I seriously devoted myself\nto the search for something different and new.  (3) I perceived\nthat if true happiness chanced to be placed in the former I should\nnecessarily miss it; while if, on the other hand, it were not so\nplaced, and I gave them my whole attention, I should equally fail.\n\n[3]  (1) I therefore debated whether it would not be possible to\narrive at the new principle, or at any rate at a certainty\nconcerning its existence, without changing the conduct and usual\nplan of my life; with this end in view I made many efforts,\nin vain.  (2) For the ordinary surroundings of life which are\nesteemed by men (as their actions testify) to be the highest\ngood, may be classed under the three heads--Riches, Fame, and\nthe Pleasures of Sense: with these three the mind is so absorbed\nthat it has little power to reflect on any different good.\n\n[4]  (1) By sensual pleasure the mind is enthralled to the extent\nof quiescence, as if the supreme good were actually attained, so\nthat it is quite incapable of thinking of any other object; when\nsuch pleasure has been gratified it is followed by extreme\nmelancholy, whereby the mind, though not enthralled, is disturbed\nand dulled.  (2) The pursuit of honors and riches is likewise very\nabsorbing, especially if such objects be sought simply for their\nown sake, [a] inasmuch as they are then supposed to constitute the\nhighest good.\n\n[5]  (1) In the case of fame the mind is still more absorbed, for fame\nis conceived as always good for its own sake, and as the ultimate end\nto which all actions are directed.  (2) Further, the attainment of\nriches and fame is not followed as in the case of sensual pleasures by\nrepentance, but, the more we acquire, the greater is our delight, and,\nconsequently, the more are we incited to increase both the one and the\nother; on the other hand, if our hopes happen to be frustrated we are\nplunged into the deepest sadness.  (3) Fame has the further drawback\nthat it compels its votaries to order their lives according to the\nopinions of their fellow-men, shunning what they usually shun, and\nseeking what they usually seek.\n\n[6]  (1) When I saw that all these ordinary objects of desire would\nbe obstacles in the way of a search for something different and new--nay,\nthat they were so opposed thereto, that either they or it would\nhave to be abandoned, I was forced to inquire which would prove the\nmost useful to me: for, as I say, I seemed to be willingly losing\nhold on a sure good for the sake of something uncertain.  (6:2) However,\nafter I had reflected on the matter, I came in the first place to the\nconclusion that by abandoning the ordinary objects of pursuit, and\nbetaking myself to a new quest, I should be leaving a good, uncertain\nby reason of its own nature, as may be gathered from what has been\nsaid, for the sake of a good not uncertain in its nature (for I sought\nfor a fixed good), but only in the possibility of its attainment.\n\n[7] (1) Further reflection convinced me that if I could really get\nto the root of the matter I should be leaving certain evils for a\ncertain good.  (2) I thus perceived that I was in a state of great\nperil, and I compelled myself to seek with all my strength for a\nremedy, however uncertain it might be; as a sick man struggling with\na deadly disease, when he sees that death will surely be upon him\nunless a remedy be found, is compelled to seek a remedy with all his\nstrength, inasmuch as his whole hope lies therein.  (7:3) All the\nobjects pursued by the multitude not only bring no remedy that tends\nto preserve our being, but even act as hindrances, causing the death\nnot seldom of those who possess them, [b] and always of those who\nare possessed by them.\n\n[8]  (1) There are many examples of men who have suffered persecution\neven to death for the sake of their riches, and of men who in pursuit\nof wealth have exposed themselves to so many dangers, that they have\npaid away their life as a penalty for their folly.  (2) Examples are\nno less numerous of men, who have endured the utmost wretchedness for\nthe sake of gaining or preserving their reputation.  (3) Lastly,\nare innumerable cases of men, who have hastened their death through\nover-indulgence in sensual pleasure.\n\n[9]  (1) All these evils seem to have arisen from the fact, that\nhappiness or unhappiness is made wholly dependent on the quality of the\nobject which we love.  (2) When a thing is not loved, no quarrels will\narise concerning it--no sadness will be felt if it perishes--no envy if\nit is possessed by another--no fear, no hatred, in short no disturbances\nof the mind. (3) All these arise from the love of what is perishable,\nsuch as the objects already mentioned.\n\n[10]  (1) But love towards a thing eternal and infinite feeds the\nmind wholly with joy, and is itself unmingled with any sadness,\nwherefore it is greatly to be desired and sought for with all our\nstrength.  (2) Yet it was not at random that I used the words,\n\"If I could go to the root of the matter,\" for, though what I have\nurged was perfectly clear to my mind, I could not forthwith lay\naside all love of riches, sensual enjoyment, and fame.\n\n[11]  (1) One thing was evident, namely, that while my mind was\nemployed with these thoughts it turned away from its former objects\nof desire, and seriously considered the search for a new principle;\nthis state of things was a great comfort to me, for I perceived\nthat the evils were not such as to resist all remedies.  (11:2) Although\nthese intervals were at first rare, and of very short duration, yet\nafterwards, as the true good became more and more discernible to me,\nthey became more frequent and more lasting; especially after I had\nrecognized that the acquisition of wealth, sensual pleasure, or fame,\nis only a hindrance, so long as they are sought as ends not as means;\nif they be sought as means, they will be under restraint, and, far\nfrom being hindrances, will further not a little the end for which\nthey are sought, as I will show in due time.\n\n[12]  (1) I will here only briefly state what I mean by true good,\nand also what is the nature of the highest good. (2) In order that\nthis may be rightly understood, we must bear in mind that the terms\ngood and evil are only applied relatively, so that the same thing\nmay be called both good and bad according to the relations in view,\nin the same way as it may be called perfect or imperfect.\n(3) Nothing regarded in its own nature can be called perfect or\nimperfect; especially when we are aware that all things which come\nto pass, come to pass according to the eternal order and fixed\nlaws of nature.\n\n[13]  (1) However, human weakness cannot attain to this order in its\nown thoughts, but meanwhile man conceives a human character much more\nstable than his own, and sees that there is no reason why he should\nnot himself acquire such a character.  (2) Thus he is led to seek\nfor means which will bring him to this pitch of perfection, and\ncalls everything which will serve as such means a true good.\n(13:3) The chief good is that he should arrive, together with other\nindividuals if possible, at the possession of the aforesaid\ncharacter.  (4) What that character is we shall show in due time,\nnamely, that it is the knowledge of the union existing being\nthe mind and the whole of nature. [c]\n\n[14]  (1) This, then, is the end for which I strive, to attain to\nsuch a character myself, and to endeavor that many should attain to\nit with me.  (2) In other words, it is part of my happiness to lend\na helping hand, that many others may understand even as I do, so\nthat their understanding and desire may entirely agree with my own.\n(3) In order to bring this about, it is necessary to understand as\nmuch of nature as will enable us to attain to the aforesaid character,\nand  also to form a social order such as is most conducive to the\nattainment of this character by the greatest number with the least\ndifficulty and danger.\n\n[15]  (1) We must seek the assistance of Moral Philosophy [d] and\nthe Theory of Education; further, as health is no insignificant means\nfor attaining our end, we must also include the whole science of\nMedicine, and, as many difficult things are by contrivance rendered\neasy, and we can in this way gain much time and convenience, the\nscience of Mechanics must in no way be despised.\n\n[16]  (1) But before all things, a means must be devised for\nimproving the understanding and purifying it, as far as may be at\nthe outset, so that it may apprehend things without error, and in\nthe best possible way.  (2) Thus it is apparent to everyone that I\nwish to direct all science to one end [e] and aim, so that we may\nattain to the supreme human perfection which we have named; and,\ntherefore, whatsoever in the sciences does not serve to promote\nour object will have to be rejected as useless.  (3) To sum up the\nmatter in a word, all our actions and thoughts must be directed to\nthis one end.\n\n[17]  (1) Yet, as it is necessary that while we are endeavoring to\nattain our purpose, and bring the understanding into the right path\nwe should carry on our life, we are compelled first of all to lay\ndown certain rules of life as provisionally good, to wit the\nfollowing:--\n\nI.  (2) To speak in a manner intelligible to the multitude, and to\n    comply with every general custom that does not hinder the\n    attainment of our purpose.  (3) For we can gain from the multitude\n    no small advantages, provided that we strive to accommodate\n    ourselves to its understanding as far as possible: moreover,\n    we shall in this way gain a friendly audience for the reception\n    of the truth.\n\nII. (17:4) To indulge ourselves with pleasures only in so far as they\n    are necessary for preserving health.\n\nIII. (5) Lastly, to endeavor to obtain only sufficient money or other\n    commodities to enable us to preserve our life and health, and to\n    follow such general customs as are consistent with our purpose.\n\n[18]  (1) Having laid down these preliminary rules, I will betake\nmyself to the first and most important task, namely, the amendment\nof the understanding, and the rendering it capable of understanding\nthings in the manner necessary for attaining our end.  (2) In order\nto bring this about, the natural order demands that I should here\nrecapitulate all the modes of perception, which I have hitherto\nemployed for affirming or denying anything with certainty, so that\nI may choose the best, and at the same time begin to know my own\npowers and the nature which I wish to perfect.\n\n[19] (1) Reflection shows that all modes of perception or knowledge\nmay be reduced to four:--\n\nI. (2) Perception arising from hearsay or from some sign which\n   everyone may name as he please.\n\nII. (3) Perception arising from mere experience--that is, form\n   experience not yet classified by the intellect, and only so called\n   because the given event has happened to take place, and we have no\n   contradictory fact to set against it, so that it therefore remains\n   unassailed in our minds.\n\nIII. (19:4) Perception arising when the essence of one thing is inferred\n   from another thing, but not adequately; this comes when [f] from some\n   effect we gather its cause, or when it is inferred from some general\n   proposition that some property is  always present.\n\nIV. (5) Lastly, there is the perception arising when a thing is\n   perceived solely through its essence, or through the knowledge\n   of its proximate cause.\n\n[20] (1) All these kinds of perception I will illustrate by examples.\n(2) By hearsay I know the day of my birth, my parentage, and other\nmatters about which I have never felt any doubt.  (3) By mere\nexperience I know that I shall die, for this I can affirm from\nhaving seen that others like myself have died, though all did not\nlive for the same period, or die by the same disease.  (4) I know\nby mere experience that oil has the property of feeding fire, and\nwater of extinguishing it.  (5) In the same way I know that a dog\nis a barking animal, man a rational animal, and in fact nearly all\nthe practical knowledge of life.\n\n[21]  (1) We deduce one thing from another as follows: when we\nclearly perceive that we feel a certain body and no other, we\nthence clearly infer that the mind is united [g] to the body,\nand that their union is the cause of the given sensation; but\nwe cannot thence absolutely understand [h] the nature of the\nsensation and the union.  (2) Or, after I have become acquainted\nwith the nature of vision, and know that it has the property of\nmaking one and the same thing appear smaller when far off than\nwhen near, I can infer that the sun is larger than it appears,\nand can draw other conclusions of the same kind.\n\n[22]  (1) Lastly, a thing may be perceived solely through its essence;\nwhen, from the fact of knowing something, I know what it is to know\nthat thing, or when, from knowing the essence of the mind, I know\nthat it is united to the body.  (2) By the same kind of knowledge\nwe know that two and three make five, or that two lines each parallel\nto a third, are parallel to one another, &c. (3) The things which I\nhave been able to know by this kind of knowledge are as yet very few.\n\n[23]  (1) In order that the whole matter may be put in a clearer\nlight, I will make use of a single illustration as follows.\n(2) Three numbers are given--it is required to find a fourth,\nwhich shall be to the third as the second is to the first.\n(23:3) Tradesmen will at once tell us that they know what is required\nto find the fourth number, for they have not yet forgotten the rule\nwhich was given to them arbitrarily without proof by their masters;\nothers construct a universal axiom from their experience with simple\nnumbers, where the fourth number is self-evident, as in the case of\n2, 4, 3, 6; here it is evident that if the second number be\nmultiplied by the third, and the product divided by the first,\nthe quotient is 6; when they see that by this process the number\nis produced which they knew beforehand to be the proportional,\nthey infer that the process always holds good for finding a fourth\nnumber proportional.\n\n[24]  (1) Mathematicians, however, know by the proof of the nineteenth\nproposition of the seventh book of Euclid, what numbers are\nproportionals, namely, from the nature and property of proportion\nit follows that the product of the first and fourth will be equal\nto the product of the second and third: still they do not see the\nadequate proportionality of the given numbers, or, if they do see it,\nthey see it not by virtue of Euclid's proposition, but intuitively,\nwithout going through any process.\n\n[25] (1) In order that from these modes of perception the best may\nbe selected, it is well that we should briefly enumerate the means\nnecessary for attaining our end.\n\nI.  (2) To have an exact knowledge of our nature which we desire to\n    perfect, and to know as much as is needful of nature in general.\n\nII. To collect in this way the differences, the agreements, and the\n    oppositions of things.\n\nIII. To learn thus exactly how far they can or cannot be modified.\n\nIV. To compare this result with the nature and power of man.\n    (4) We shall thus discern the highest degree of perfection\n    to which man is capable of attaining.\n\n[26] (1) We shall then be in a position to see which mode of\nperception we ought to choose.  (2) As to the first mode, it is\nevident that from hearsay our knowledge must always be uncertain,\nand, moreover, can give us no insight into the essence of a thing,\nas is manifest in our illustration; now one can only arrive at\nknowledge of a thing through knowledge of its essence, as will\nhereafter appear.  (3) We may, therefore clearly conclude that\nthe certainty arising from hearsay cannot be scientific in its\ncharacter.  (4) For simple hearsay cannot affect anyone whose\nunderstanding does not, so to speak, meet it half way.\n\n[27]  (1) The second mode of perception [i] cannot be said to\ngive us the idea of the proportion of which we are in search.\n(2) Moreover its results are very uncertain and indefinite,\nfor we shall never discover anything in natural phenomena by its\nmeans, except accidental properties, which are never clearly\nunderstood, unless the essence of the things in question be\nknown first.  (3) Wherefore this mode also must be rejected.\n\n[28] (1) Of the third mode of perception we may say in a manner\nthat it gives us the idea of the thing sought, and that it\nus to draw conclusions without risk of error; yet it is not by\nitself sufficient to put us in possession of the perfection we\naim at.\n\n[29] (1) The fourth mode alone apprehends the adequate essence of\na thing without danger of error.  (2) This mode, therefore, must be\nthe one which we chiefly employ.  (3) How, then, should we avail\nourselves of it so as to gain the fourth kind of knowledge with\nthe least delay concerning things previously unknown?  (4) I will\nproceed to explain.\n\n[30] (1) Now that we know what kind of knowledge is necessary for\nus, we must indicate the way and the method whereby we may gain\nthe said knowledge concerning the things needful to be known.\n(2) In order to accomplish this, we must first take care not to\ncommit ourselves to a search, going back to infinity--that is,\nin order to discover the best method of finding truth, there is\nno need of another method to discover such method; nor of a third\nmethod for discovering the second, and so on to infinity.  (3) By\nsuch proceedings, we should never arrive at the knowledge of the\ntruth, or, indeed, at any knowledge at all.  (30:4) The matter stands\non the same footing as the making of material tools, which might\nbe argued about in a similar way.  (5) For, in order to work iron,\na hammer is needed, and the hammer cannot be forthcoming unless\nit has been made; but, in order to make it, there was need\nof another hammer and other tools, and so on to infinity.\n(6) We might thus vainly endeavor to prove that men have no\npower of working iron.\n\n[31]  (1) But as men at first made use of the instruments supplied\nby nature to accomplish very easy pieces of workmanship, laboriously\nand imperfectly, and then, when these were finished, wrought other\nthings more difficult with less labour and greater perfection;\nand so gradually mounted from the simplest operations to the making\nof tools, and from the making of tools to the making of more complex\ntools, and fresh feats of workmanship, till they arrived at making,\ncomplicated mechanisms which they now possess.  (31:2) So, in like\nmanner, the intellect, by its native strength, [k], makes for itself\nintellectual instruments, whereby it acquires strength for performing\nother intellectual operations, [l], and from these operations\nagain fresh instruments, or the power of pushing its investigations\nfurther, and thus gradually proceeds till it reaches the summit\nof wisdom.\n\n[32]  (1) That this is the path pursued by the understanding may be\nreadily seen, when we understand the nature of the method for\nfinding out the truth, and of the natural instruments so necessary\ncomplex instruments, and for the progress of investigation. I thus\nproceed with my demonstration.\n\n[33]  (1) A true idea, [m], (for we possess a true idea) is something\ndifferent from its correlate (ideatum); thus a circle is different\nfrom the idea of a circle. (2) The idea of a circle is not something\nhaving a circumference and a center, as a circle has; nor is the idea\nof a body that body itself. (3) Now, as it is something different\nfrom its correlate, it is capable of being understood through itself;\nin other words, the idea, in so far as its actual essence (essentia\nformalis) is concerned, may be the subject of another subjective\nessence (essentia objectiva).  [33note1] (4) And, again, this second\nsubjective essence will, regarded in itself, be something real,\ncapable of being understood; and so on, indefinitely.\n\n[34] (1) For instance, the man Peter is something real; the true\nidea of Peter is the reality of Peter represented subjectively,\nand is in itself something real, and quite distinct from the\nactual Peter.  (2) Now, as this true idea of Peter is in itself\nsomething real, and has its own individual existence, it will\nalso be capable of being understood--that is, of being the\nsubject of another idea, which will contain by representation\n(objective) all that the idea of Peter contains actually\n(formaliter).  (3) And, again, this idea of the idea of Peter\nhas its own individuality, which may become the subject of yet\nanother idea; and so on, indefinitely.  (4) This everyone may\nmake trial of for himself, by reflecting that he knows what\nPeter is, and also knows that he knows, and further knows that\nhe knows that he knows, &c.  (34:5) Hence it is plain that, in\norder to understand the actual Peter, it is not necessary first\nto understand the idea of Peter, and still less the idea of\nthe idea of Peter.  (6) This is the same as saying that, in order\nto know, there is no need to know that we know, much less to\nknow that we know that we know.  (7) This is no more necessary\nthan to know the nature of a circle before knowing the nature of\na triangle. [n].  (8) But, with these ideas, the contrary is the\ncase: for, in order to know that I know, I must first know.\n\n[35] (1) Hence it is clear that certainty is nothing else than\nthe subjective essence of a thing: in other words, the mode in\nwhich we perceive an actual reality is certainty.  (2) Further,\nit is also evident that, for the certitude of truth, no further\nsign is necessary beyond the possession of a true idea: for,\nas I have shown, it is not necessary to know that we know that\nwe know.  (3) Hence, again, it is clear that no one can know\nthe nature of the highest certainty, unless he possesses an\nadequate idea, or the subjective essence of a thing:\ncertainty is identical with such subjective essence.\n\n[36]  (1) Thus, as the truth needs no sign--it being to possess\nthe subjective essence of things, or, in other words, the ideas\nof them, in order that all doubts may be removed--it follows\nthat the true method does not consist in seeking for the signs\nof truth after the acquisition of the idea, but that the true\nmethod teaches us the order in which we should seek for truth\nitself, [o] or the subjective essences of things, or ideas,\nfor all these expressions are synonymous.\n\n[37] (1) Again, method must necessarily be concerned with\nreasoning or understanding--I mean, method is not identical\nwith reasoning in the search for causes, still less is it\nthe comprehension of the causes of things: it is the\ndiscernment of a true idea, by distinguishing it from other\nperceptions, and by investigating its nature, in order that\nwe may so train our mind that it may, by a given standard,\ncomprehend whatsoever is intelligible, by laying down\ncertain rules as aids, and by avoiding useless mental\nexertion.\n\n[38]  (1) Whence we may gather that method is nothing else\nthan reflective knowledge, or the idea of an idea; and that\nas there can be no idea of an idea--unless an idea exists\npreviously,--there can be no method without a pre-existent\nidea.  (2) Therefore, that will be a good method which\nshows us how the mind should be directed, according to the\nstandard of the given true idea.\n\n(38:3) Again, seeing that the ratio existing between two\nideas the same as the ratio between the actual realities\ncorresponding to those ideas, it follows that the reflective\nknowledge which has for its object the most perfect being is\nmore excellent than reflective knowledge concerning other\nobjects--in other words, that method will be most perfect\nwhich affords the standard of the given idea of the most\nperfect being whereby we may direct our mind.\n\n[39] (1) We thus easily understand how, in proportion as it\nacquires new ideas, the mind simultaneously acquires fresh\ninstruments for pursuing its inquiries further. (2) For we\nmay gather from what has been said, that a true idea must\nnecessarily first of all exist in us as a natural instrument;\nand that when this idea is apprehended by the mind, it enables\nus to understand the difference existing between itself and\nall other perceptions.  (3) In this, one part of the method\nconsists.\n\n(39:4) Now it is clear that the mind apprehends itself better\nin proportion as it understands a greater number of natural\nobjects; it follows, therefore, that this portion of the method\nwill be more perfect in proportion as the mind attains to the\ncomprehension of a greater number of objects, and that it will\nbe absolutely perfect when the mind gains a knowledge of the\nabsolutely perfect being, or becomes conscious thereof.\n\n[40]  (1) Again, the more things the mind knows, the better does\nit understand its own strength and the order of nature; by\nincreased self-knowledge, it can direct itself more easily, and\nlay down rules for its own guidance; and, by increased knowledge\nof nature, it can more easily avoid what is useless.  (2) And\nthis is the sum total of method, as we have already stated.\n\n[41]  (1) We may add that the idea in the world of thought is in\nthe same case as its correlate in the world of reality.  (2) If,\ntherefore, there be anything in nature which is without connection\nwith any other thing, and if we assign to it a subjective essence,\nwhich would in every way correspond to the objective reality,\nthe subjective essence would have no connection, [p] with any\nother ideas--in other words, we could not draw any conclusions\nwith regard to it.  (41:3) On the other hand, those things which are\nconnected with others--as all things that exist in nature--will\nbe understood by the mind, and their subjective essences will\nmaintain the same mutual relations as their objective realities--that\nis to say, we shall infer from these ideas other ideas, which\nwill in turn be connected with others, and thus our instruments\nfor proceeding with our investigation will increase.  (4) This is\nwhat we were endeavoring to prove.\n\n[42]  (1) Further, from what has just been said--namely, that an\nidea must, in all respects, correspond to its correlate in the\nworld of reality,--it is evident that, in order to reproduce in\nevery respect the faithful image of nature, our mind must deduce\nall its ideas from the idea which represents the origin and source\nof the whole of nature, so that it may itself become the source\nof other ideas.\n\n[43]  (1) It may, perhaps, provoke astonishment that, after having\nsaid that the good method is that which teaches us to direct our\nmind according to the standard of the given true idea, we should\nprove our point by reasoning, which would seem to indicate that it\nis not self-evident.  (2) We may, therefore, be questioned as to\nthe validity of our reasoning.  (3) If our reasoning be sound, we\nmust take as a starting-point a true idea.  (4) Now, to be certain\nthat our starting-point is really a true idea, we need proof.\n(5) This first course of reasoning must be supported by a second,\nthe second by a third, and so on to infinity.\n\n[44]  (1) To this I make answer that, if by some happy chance anyone\nhad adopted this method in his investigations of nature--that is,\nif he had acquired new ideas in the proper order, according to the\nstandard of the original true idea, he would never have doubted [q]\nof the truth of his knowledge, inasmuch as truth, as we have shown,\nmakes itself manifest, and all things would flow, as it were,\nspontaneously towards him.  (44:2) But as this never, or rarely,\nhappens, I have been forced so to arrange my proceedings, that we\nmay acquire by reflection and forethought what we cannot acquire\nby chance, and that it may at the same time appear that, for\nproving the truth, and for valid reasoning, we need no other means\nthan the truth and valid reasoning themselves: for by valid\nreasoning I have established valid reasoning, and, in like measure,\nI seek still to establish it.\n\n[45]  (1) Moreover, this is the order of thinking adopted by men\nin their inward meditations.  (2) The reasons for its rare employment\nin investigations of nature are to be found in current misconceptions,\nwhereof we shall examine the causes hereafter in our philosophy.\n(3) Moreover, it demands, as we shall show, a keen and accurate\ndiscernment.  (4) Lastly, it is hindered by the conditions of human\nlife, which are, as we have already pointed out, extremely changeable.\n(5) There are also other obstacles, which we will not here inquire into.\n\n\n[46]  (1) If anyone asks why I have not at the starting-point set forth\nall the truths of nature in their due order, inasmuch as truth is\nself-evident, I reply by warning him not to reject as false any\nparadoxes he may find here, but to take the trouble to reflect on\nthe chain of reasoning by which they are supported; he will then\nbe no longer in doubt that we have attained to the truth.\n(2) This is why I have as above.\n\n[47] (1) If there yet remains some sceptic, who doubts of our\nprimary truth, and of all deductions we make, taking such truth\nas our standard, he must either be arguing in bad faith, or we\nmust confess that there are men in complete mental blindness\neither innate or due to misconceptions--that is, to some external\ninfluence.  (2) Such persons are not conscious of themselves.\n(3) If they affirm or doubt anything, they know not that they\naffirm or doubt: they say that they know nothing, and they say\nthat they are ignorant of the very fact of their knowing nothing.\n(4) Even this they do not affirm absolutely, they are afraid of\nconfessing that they exist, so long as they know nothing;\nin fact, they ought to remain dumb, for fear of haply supposing\nwhich should smack of truth.\n\n[48]  (1) Lastly, with such persons, one should not speak of\nsciences: for, in what relates to life and conduct, they are\ncompelled by necessity to suppose that they exist, and seek\ntheir own advantage, and often affirm and deny, even with an\noath.  (2) If they deny, grant, or gainsay, they know not that\nthey deny, grant, or gainsay, so that they ought to be\nregarded as automata, utterly devoid of intelligence.\n\n[49] (1) Let us now return to our proposition.  (2) Up to the present,\nwe have, first, defined the end to which we desire to direct all our\nthoughts; secondly, we have determined the mode of perception best\nadapted to aid us in attaining our perfection; thirdly, we have\ndiscovered the way which our mind should take, in order to make a good\nbeginning--namely, that it should use every true idea as a standard in\npursuing its inquiries according to fixed rules.  (49:3) Now, in order\nthat it may thus proceed, our method must furnish us, first, with a\nmeans of distinguishing a true idea from all other perceptions, and\nenabling the mind to avoid the latter; secondly, with rules for\nperceiving unknown things according to the standard of the true idea;\nthirdly, with an order which enables us to avoid useless labor.\n(49:4) When we became acquainted with this method, we saw that,\nfourthly, it would be perfect when we had attained to the idea of the\nabsolutely perfect Being.  (5) This is an observation which should be\nmade at the outset, in order that we may arrive at the knowledge of\nsuch a being more quickly.\n\n[50] (1) Let us then make a beginning with the first part of the method,\nwhich is, as we have said, to distinguish and separate the true idea\nfrom other perceptions, and to keep the mind from confusing with true\nideas those which are false, fictitious, and doubtful.  (2) I intend to\ndwell on this point at length, partly to keep a distinction so necessary\nbefore the reader's mind, and also because there are some who doubt of\ntrue ideas, through not having attended to the distinction between a true\nperception and all others.  (3) Such persons are like men who, while they\nare awake, doubt not that they are awake, but afterwards in a dream, as\noften happens, thinking that they are surely awake, and then finding that\nthey were in error, become doubtful even of being awake.  (4) This state\nof mind arises through neglect of the distinction between sleeping and\nwaking.\n\n[51]  (1) Meanwhile, I give warning that I shall not here give\nessence of every perception, and explain it through its proximate\ncause.  (2) Such work lies in the province of philosophy.  (3) I shall\nconfine myself to what concerns method--that is, to the character of\nfictitious, false and doubtful perceptions, and the means of freeing\nourselves therefrom.  (4) Let us then first inquire into the nature of\na fictitious idea.\n\n[52]  (1) Every perception has for its object either a thing considered\nas existing, or solely the essence of a thing.  (2) Now \"fiction\" is\nchiefly occupied with things considered as existing.  (3) I will,\ntherefore, consider these first--I mean cases where only the existence\nof an object is feigned, and the thing thus feigned is understood, or\nassumed to be understood.  (4) For instance, I feign that Peter, whom\nI know to have gone home, is gone to see me, [r] or something of that\nkind.  (5) With what is such an idea concerned?  (6) It is concerned\nwith things possible, and not with things necessary or impossible.\n\n[53] (1) I call a thing impossible when its existence would imply a\ncontradiction; necessary, when its non-existence would imply a\ncontradiction; possible, when neither its existence nor its\nnon-existence imply a contradiction, but when the necessity or\nimpossibility of its nature depends on causes unknown to us, while\nwe feign that it exists.  (2) If the necessity or impossibility of\nits existence depending on external causes were known to us, we\ncould not form any fictitious hypotheses about it;\n\n[54] (1) Whence it follows that if there be a God, or omniscient\nBeing, such an one cannot form fictitious hypotheses.  (2) For,\nas regards ourselves, when I know that I exist, [s] I cannot\nhypothesize that I exist or do not exist, any more than I can\nhypothesize an elephant that can go through the eye of a needle;\nnor when I know the nature of God, can I hypothesize that He\nor does not exist. [t]  (54:3) The same thing must be said of the\nChimaera, whereof the nature implies a contradiction.  (4) From\nthese considerations, it is plain, as I have already stated, that\nfiction cannot be concerned with eternal truths. [u]\n\n[55]  (1) But before proceeding further, I must remark, in passing,\nthat the difference between the essence of one thing and the essence\nof another thing is the same as that which exists between the reality\nor existence of one thing and the reality or existence of another;\ntherefore, if we wished to conceive the existence, for example,\nof Adam, simply by means of existence in general, it would be the\nsame as if, in order to conceive his existence, we went back to the\nnature of being, so as to define Adam as a being.  (2) Thus, the more\nexistence is conceived generally, the more is it conceived confusedly\nand the more easily can it be ascribed to a given object.\n(55:3) Contrariwise, the more it is conceived particularly, the more\nis it understood clearly, and the less liable is it to be ascribed,\nthrough negligence of Nature's order, to anything save its proper\nobject.  (4) This is worthy of remark.\n\n[56]  (1) We now proceed to consider those cases which are commonly\ncalled fictions, though we clearly understood that the thing is not\nas we imagine it.  (2) For instance, I know that the earth is round,\nbut nothing prevents my telling people that it is a hemisphere,\nand that it is like a half apple carved in relief on a dish; or,\nthat the sun moves round the earth, and so on.  (56:3) However,\nexamination will show us that there is nothing here inconsistent\nwith what has been said, provided we first admit that we may have\nmade mistakes, and be now conscious of them; and, further, that we\ncan hypothesize, or at least suppose, that others are under the\nsame mistake as ourselves, or can, like us, fall under it.  (4) We can,\nI repeat, thus hypothesize so long as we see no impossibility.\n(56:5) Thus, when I tell anyone that the earth is not round, &c.,\nI merely recall the error which I perhaps made myself, or which I\nmight have fallen into, and afterwards I hypothesize that the person\nto whom I tell it, is still, or may still fall under the same mistake.\n(6) This I say, I can feign so long as I do not perceive any\nimpossibility or necessity; if I truly understood either one or the\nother I should not be able to feign, and I should be reduced to saying\nthat I had made the attempt.\n\n[57]  (1) It remains for us to consider hypotheses made in problems,\nwhich sometimes involve impossibilities.  (2) For instance, when we\nsay--let us assume that this burning candle is not burning, or,\nlet us assume that it burns in some imaginary space, or where there\nare no physical objects.  (3) Such assumptions are freely made,\nthough the last is clearly seen to be impossible.  (4) But, though\nthis be so, there is no fiction in the case.  (57:5) For, in the first\ncase, I have merely recalled to memory, [x] another candle not\nburning, or conceived the candle before me as without a flame, and\nthen I understand as applying to the latter, leaving its flame out\nof the question, all that I think of the former.  (6) In the second\ncase, I have merely to abstract my thoughts from the objects\nsurrounding the candle, for the mind to devote itself to the\ncontemplation of the candle singly looked at in itself only; I can\nthen draw the conclusion that the candle contains in itself no\ncauses for its own destruction, so that if there were no physical\nobjects the candle, and even the flame, would remain unchangeable,\nand so on.  (7) Thus there is here no fiction, but, [y] true and\nbare assertions.\n\n[58] (1) Let us now pass on to the fictions concerned with essences\nonly, or with some reality or existence simultaneously.  (2) Of\nthese we must specially observe that in proportion as the mind's\nunderstanding is smaller, and its experience multiplex, so will its\npower of coining fictions be larger, whereas as its understanding\nincreases, its capacity for entertaining fictitious ideas becomes\nless.  (58:3) For instance, in the same way as we are unable, while\nwe are thinking, to feign that we are thinking or not thinking, so,\nalso, when we know the nature of body we cannot imagine an infinite\nfly; or, when we know the nature of the soul, [z] we cannot imagine\nit as square, though anything may be expressed verbally.  (4) But,\nas we said above, the less men know of nature the more easily can\nthey coin fictitious ideas, such as trees speaking, men instantly\nchanged into stones, or into fountains, ghosts appearing in mirrors,\nsomething issuing from nothing, even gods changed into beasts and men\nand infinite other absurdities of the same kind.\n\n[59] (1) Some persons think, perhaps, that fiction is limited by\nfiction, and not by understanding; in other words, after I have\nformed some fictitious idea, and have affirmed of my own free will\nthat it exists under a certain form in nature, I am thereby\nprecluded from thinking of it under any other form.  (2) For\ninstance, when I have feigned (to repeat their argument) that the\nnature of body is of a certain kind, and have of my own free will\ndesired to convince myself that it actually exists under this\nform, I am no longer able to hypothesize that a fly, for example,\nis infinite; so, when I have hypothesized the essence of the soul,\nI am not able to think of it as square, &c.\n\n[60] (1) But these arguments demand further inquiry. (2) First,\ntheir upholders must either grant or deny that we can understand\nanything. If they grant it, then necessarily the same must be\nsaid of understanding, as is said of fiction. (3) If they deny\nit, let us, who know that we do know something, see what they\nmean.  (4) They assert that the soul can be conscious of, and\nperceive in a variety of ways, not itself nor things which\nexist, but only things which are neither in itself nor anywhere\nelse, in other words, that the soul can, by its unaided power,\ncreate sensations or ideas unconnected with things.  (5) In fact,\nthey regard the soul as a sort of god.  (60:6) Further, they assert\nthat we or our soul have such freedom that we can constrain\nourselves, or our soul, or even our soul's freedom.  (7) For,\nafter it has formed a fictitious idea, and has given its assent\nthereto, it cannot think or feign it in any other manner, but is\nconstrained by the first fictitious idea to keep all its other\nthoughts in harmony therewith.  (8) Our opponents are thus driven\nto admit, in support of their fiction, the absurdities which I\nhave just enumerated; and which are not worthy of rational\nrefutation.\n\n[61]  (1) While leaving such persons in their error, we will take\ncare to derive from our argument with them a truth serviceable for\nour purpose, namely, [61a] that the mind, in paying attention to\na thing hypothetical or false, so as to meditate upon it and\nunderstand it, and derive the proper conclusions in due order\ntherefrom, will readily discover its falsity; and if the thing\nhypothetical be in its nature true, and the mind pays attention\nto it, so as to understand it, and deduce the truths which are\nderivable from it, the mind will proceed with an uninterrupted\nseries of apt conclusions; in the same way as it would at once\ndiscover (as we showed just now) the absurdity of a false\nhypothesis, and of the conclusions drawn from it.\n\n[62]  (1) We need, therefore, be in no fear of forming hypotheses,\nso long as we have a clear and distinct perception of what is\ninvolved.  (2) For, if we were to assert, haply, that men are\nsuddenly turned into beasts, the statement would be extremely\ngeneral, so general that there would be no conception, that is,\nno idea or connection of subject and predicate, in our mind.\n(3) If there were such a conception we should at the same time\nbe aware of the means and the causes whereby the event took place.\n(4) Moreover, we pay no attention to the nature of the subject\nand the predicate.\n\n[63]  (1) Now, if the first idea be not fictitious, and if all the\nother ideas be deduced therefrom, our hurry to form fictitious ideas\nwill gradually subside.  (2) Further, as a fictitious idea cannot be\nclear and distinct, but is necessarily confused, and as all confusion\narises from the fact that the mind has only partial knowledge of a\nthing either simple or complex, and does not distinguish between the\nknown and the unknown, and, again, that it directs its attention\npromiscuously to all parts of an object at once without making\ndistinctions, it follows, first, that if the idea be of something\nvery simple, it must necessarily be clear and distinct.  (3) For\na very simple object cannot be known in part, it must either be\nknown altogether or not at all.\n\n[64]  (1) Secondly, it follows that if a complex object be divided by\nthought into a number of simple component parts, and if each be\nregarded separately, all confusion will disappear.  (2) Thirdly, it\nfollows that fiction cannot be simple, but is made up of the blending\nof several confused ideas of diverse objects or actions existent in\nnature, or rather is composed of attention directed to all such ideas\nat once, [64b] and unaccompanied by any mental assent.\n\n(64:3) Now a fiction that was simple would be clear and distinct,\nand therefore true, also a fiction composed only of distinct ideas\nwould be clear and distinct, and therefore true.  (4) For instance,\nwhen we know the nature of the circle and the square, it is\nimpossible for us to blend together these two figures, and to\nhypothesize a square circle, any more than a square soul, or things\nof that kind.\n\n[65] (1) Let us shortly come to our conclusion, and again repeat\nthat we need have no fear of confusing with true ideas that which\nis only a fiction.  (2) As for the first sort of fiction of which\nwe have already spoken, when a thing is clearly conceived, we saw\nthat if the existence of a that thing is in itself an eternal truth\nfiction can have no part in it; but if the existence of the\nconceived be not an eternal truth, we have only to be careful\nsuch existence be compared to the thing's essence, and to\nconsider the order of nature. (64:3) As for the second sort of\nfiction, which we stated to be the result of simultaneously\ndirecting the attention, without the assent of the intellect,\nto different confused ideas representing different things and\nactions existing in nature, we have seen that an absolutely\nsimple thing cannot be feigned, but must be understood, and that\na complex thing is in the same case if we regard separately the\nsimple parts whereof it is composed; we shall not even be able\nto hypothesize any untrue action concerning such objects, for we\nshall be obliged to consider at the same time the causes and manner\nof such action.\n\n[66]  (1) These matters being thus understood, let us pass on to\nconsider the false idea, observing the objects with which it is\nconcerned, and the means of guarding ourselves from falling into\nfalse perceptions.  (2) Neither of these tasks will present much\ndifficulty, after our inquiry concerning fictitious ideas.\n(3) The false idea only differs from the fictitious idea in the\nfact of implying a mental assent--that is, as we have already\nremarked, while the representations are occurring, there are no\ncauses present to us, wherefrom, as in fiction, we can conclude\nthat such representations do not arise from external objects:\nin fact, it is much the same as dreaming with our eyes open,\nor while awake.  (67:4) Thus, a false idea is concerned with, or\n(to speak more correctly) is attributable to, the existence of\na thing whereof the essence is known, or the essence itself, in\nthe same way as a fictitious idea.\n\n[67]  (1) If attributable to the existence of the thing, it is\ncorrected in the same way as a fictitious idea under similar\ncircumstances.  (2) If attributable to the essence, it is\nlikewise corrected in the same way as a fictitious idea.\n(67:3) For if the nature of the thing known implies necessary\nexistence, we cannot possible be in error with regard to its\nexistence; but if the nature of the thing be not an eternal\ntruth, like its essence, but contrariwise the necessity or\nimpossibility of its existence depends on external causes,\nthen we must follow the same course as we adopted in the\nof fiction, for it is corrected in the same manner.\n\n[68]  (1) As for false ideas concerned with essences, or even\nwith actions, such perceptions are necessarily always confused,\nbeing compounded of different confused perceptions of things\nexisting in nature, as, for instance, when men are persuaded\nthat deities are present in woods, in statues, in brute beasts,\nand the like; that there are bodies which, by their composition\nalone, give rise to intellect; that corpses reason, walk about,\nand speak; that God is deceived, and so on.  (68:2) But ideas which\nare clear and distinct can never be false: for ideas of things\nclearly and distinctly conceived are either very simple\nthemselves, or are compounded from very simple ideas, that is,\nare deduced therefrom.  (3) The impossibility of a very simple\nidea being false is evident to everyone who understands the nature\nof truth or understanding and of falsehood.\n\n[69]  (1) As regards that which constitutes the reality of truth,\nit is certain that a true idea is distinguished from a false one,\nnot so much by its extrinsic object as by its intrinsic nature.\n(2) If an architect conceives a building properly constructed,\nthough such a building may never have existed, and amy never exist,\nnevertheless the idea is true; and the idea remains the same,\nwhether it be put into execution or not.  (69:3) On the other hand,\nif anyone asserts, for instance, that Peter exists, without\nknowing whether Peter really exists or not, the assertion, as far\nas its asserter is concerned, is false, or not true, even though\nPeter actually does exist.  (4) The assertion that Peter exists is\ntrue only with regard to him who knows for certain that Peter does\nexist.\n\n[70]  (1) Whence it follows that there is in ideas something real,\nwhereby the true are distinguished from the false.  (2) This reality\nmust be inquired into, if we are to find the best standard of truth\n(we have said that we ought to determine our thoughts by the given\nstandard of a true idea, and that method is reflective knowledge),\nand to know the properties of our understanding.  (70:3) Neither must\nwe say that the difference between true and false arises from the\nfact, that true knowledge consists in knowing things through their\nprimary causes, wherein it is totally different from false knowledge,\nas I have just explained it: for thought is said to be true, if\nit involves subjectively the essence of any principle which has no\ncause, and is known through itself and in itself.\n\n[71]  (1) Wherefore the reality (forma) of true thought must exist\nin the thought itself, without reference to other thoughts; it does\nnot acknowledge the object as its cause, but must depend on the\nactual power and nature of the understanding.  (2) For, if we\nsuppose that the understanding has perceived some new entity which\nhas never existed, as some conceive the understanding of God before\nHe created thing (a perception which certainly could not arise\nany object), and has legitimately deduced other thoughts from said\nperception, all such thoughts would be true, without being\ndetermined by any external object; they would depend solely on the\npower and nature of the understanding.  (71:3) Thus, that which\nconstitutes the reality of a true thought must be sought in the\nthought itself, and deduced from the nature of the understanding.\n\n[72]  (1) In order to pursue our investigation, let us confront\nourselves with some true idea, whose object we know for\ncertain to be dependent on our power of thinking, and to have\nnothing corresponding to it in nature.  (2) With an idea of this\nkind before us, we shall, as appears from what has just been said,\nbe more easily able to carry on the research we have in view.\n(72:3) For instance, in order to form the conception of a sphere,\nI invent a cause at my pleasure--namely, a semicircle revolving\nround its center, and thus producing a sphere.  (4) This is\nindisputably a true idea; and, although we know that no sphere in\nnature has ever actually been so formed, the perception remains\ntrue, and is the easiest manner of conceiving a sphere.\n(72:5) We must observe that this perception asserts the rotation\nof a semicircle--which assertion would be false, if it were not\nassociated with the conception of a sphere, or of a cause\ndetermining a motion of the kind, or absolutely, if the assertion\nwere isolated.  (6) The mind would then only tend to the\naffirmation of the sole motion of a semicircle, which is not\ncontained in the conception of a semicircle, and does not arise\nfrom the conception of any cause capable of producing such motion.\n\n(72:7) Thus falsity consists only in this, that something is\naffirmed of a thing, which is not contained in the conception\nwe have formed of that thing, as motion or rest of a semicircle.\n(8) Whence it follows that simple ideas cannot be other than\ntrue--e.g., the simple idea of a semicircle, of motion, of rest,\nof quantity, &c.\n\n(72:9) Whatsoever affirmation such ideas contain is equal to the\nconcept formed, and does not extend further.  (10) Wherefore we\nform as many simple ideas as we please, without any fear of error.\n\n[73]  (1) It only remains for us to inquire by what power our mind\ncan form true ideas, and how far such power extends.  (2) It is\ncertain that such power cannot extend itself infinitely.  (3) For\nwhen we affirm somewhat of a thing, which is not contained in the\nconcept we have formed of that thing, such an affirmation shows a\ndefect of our perception, or that we have formed fragmentary or\nmutilated ideas.  (4) Thus we have seen that the notion of a\nsemicircle is false when it is isolated in the mind, but true when\nit is associated with the concept of a sphere, or of some cause\ndetermining such a motion.  (73:5) But if it be the nature of a\nthinking being, as seems, prima facie, to be the case, to form true\nor adequate thoughts, it is plain that inadequate ideas arise in us\nonly because we are parts of a thinking being, whose thoughts--some\nin their entirety, others in fragments only--constitute our mind.\n\n[74]  (1) But there is another point to be considered, which was not\nworth raising in the case of fiction, but which give rise to complete\ndeception--namely, that certain things presented to the imagination\nalso exist in the understanding--in other words, are conceived\nclearly and distinctly.  (2) Hence, so long as we do not separate that\nwhich is distinct from that which is confused, certainty, or the true\nidea, becomes mixed with indistinct ideas.  (3) For instance, certain\nStoics heard, perhaps, the term \"soul,\" and also that the soul is\nimmortal, yet imagined it only confusedly; they imaged, also, and\nunderstood that very subtle bodies penetrate all others, and are\npenetrated by none.  (74:4) By combining these ideas, and being at the\nsame time certain of the truth of the axiom, they forthwith became\nconvinced that the mind consists of very subtle bodies; that these\nvery subtle bodies cannot be divided &c.\n\n[75]  (1) But we are freed from mistakes of this kind, so long as we\nendeavor to examine all our perceptions by the standard of the given\ntrue idea.  (2) We must take care, as has been said, to separate such\nperceptions from all those which arise from hearsay or unclassified\nexperience.  (3) Moreover, such mistakes arise from things being\nconceived too much in the abstract; for it is sufficiently self-evident\nthat what I conceive as in its true object I cannot apply to anything\nelse.\n\n### Summary:"}

GARIS\n\n1914\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nA COLD NIGHT\n\n\n\"Oh, how red your nose is!\" cried little Mabel Blake, one day, as her\nbrother Hal came running out of the school yard, where he had been\nplaying with some other boys. Mabel was waiting for him to walk home\nwith her as he had promised.\n\n\"So's your's red, too, Mab!\" Harry said. \"It's as red--as red as some\nof the crabs we boiled at our seashore cottage this summer.\"\n\n\"Is my nose red?\" asked Mab of some of her girl friends.\n\n\"It surely is!\" replied Jennie Bruce. \"All our noses are red!\" she\nwent on. \"It's the cold that makes 'em so. It's very cold to-day, and\nsoon it will be winter, with lots of snow and ice! Oh! I just love\nwinter!\"\n\n\"Come on, Hal!\" called Mab. \"Let's hurry home before it gets any\ncolder!\"\n\n\"Let's run!\" suggested Hal. \"When you run you get warm, and you don't\nmind the cold.\"\n\n\"What makes us get warm when we run?\" his sister inquired, as she took\nhold of his hand and raced along beside him.\n\n\"I don't know,\" Hal answered, \"but we'll ask Daddy when we get home.\nHe can tell us everything.\"\n\n\"Huh! Not everything!\" cried Sammie Jones, one of the nice boys with\nwhom Hal played, \"Your father doesn't know everything.\"\n\n\"Yes he does, too!\" exclaimed Hal. Doesn't he, Mab?\"\n\n\"Yep!\" answered the little girl, shaking her head from side to side so\nfast that you could hardly tell which were her curls and which was her\nhair ribbon.\n\n\"Huh! Does your father know what makes a steam engine go?\" asked\nSammie.\n\n\"Sure he does!\" said Hal. \"And he told us about it once, too; didn't\nhe, Mab?\"\n\n\"Yes, he did,\" the little girl answered. \"I know, too. It's hot water\nin the boiler that makes it go. The hot water swells up, and turns\ninto steam, and the steam pushes on the wheels, and that makes the\nengine go.\"\n\n\"And our Daddy knows what makes an automobile go, too,\" went on Hal.\n\"He knows everything.\"\n\n\"Huh! Well, I guess mine does then, too!\" spoke Sammie. I'm going to\nask him what--what--makes it lightning!\"\n\n\"And then will you tell us?\" asked Mab, for she and Hal wanted to know\nabout everything they saw.\n\n\"Yes, I'll tell you,\" promised Sammie. \"And we'll ask Daddy Blake what\nmakes us warm inside when we run,\" went on Hal, \"and then we'll tell\nyou that, Sammie.\"\n\nThe children ran home from school, and, thought it was cold, for it\nwas almost winter now, they did not mind it. Their noses got more and\nmore red, it is true, but they knew when they were in the house, near\nthe warm fire, the red would all fade out.\n\nHal and Mab said good-bye to Sammie, as he turned down his street,\nand then the little Blake boy and girl, hand in hand, ran on to their\nhouse.\n\nAs they reached it they saw their mamma and their Aunt Lolly out in\nthe front yard, bringing in pots of flowers and vines.\n\n\"Quick, children!\" called Mamma Blake, \"You are just in time! Here,\nHal, you and Mab put down your books\" and help us to carry in the\nflowers. Take only the small pots, and don't drop them, or get any\ndirt on your clothes.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm sure something will happen if you let the children carry any\nof the flowers!\" cried Aunt Lolly, who was a dear, fussy little old\nlady. \"They'll drop them on their toes, or spill the dirt on the\nfloor--or something.\"\n\n\"Oh, I guess not,\" laughed Mamma Blake. \"Anyhow we need help to get\nall the plants in before dark. There is going to be a very heavy\nfrost, and everything will freeze hard to-night. It will be very\ncold!\"\n\n\"Is that why you are bringing in the plants, mamma?\" asked Mab.\n\n\"Yes, so they will not freeze and die,\" Mrs. Blake answered. \"Flowers\nfreeze very easily.\"\n\nThe children were glad to help their mother and Aunt Lolly. Roly-Poly,\nthe fat little white poodle dog, tried to help, too, but he upset more\nplants than he carried in, though he did manage to drag one pot to the\nsteps.\n\nBesides, Roly-Poly was always running off to look for a clothespin,\nor something like that, to bury under the earth, making believe, I\nsuppose, that it was a bone.\n\n\"The ground will soon be frozen too hard for you to dig in it with\nyour paws, Roly-Poly,\" said Mamma Blake, when it was nearly dark, and\nall the plants had been brought into the warm kitchen. \"Come, now\nchildren,\" she called. \"Wash your hands, and supper will soon be\nready. Then Daddy will be here, and he will shake down the furnace\nfire, and make it hot, for it is going to be a very cold night.\"\n\nA little later, when supper was almost ready, a step was heard in the\nfront hall.\n\n\"Oh, here comes Daddy now!\" cried Mab, making a rush for the door.\n\n\"Let's ask him what makes the cold,\" exclaimed Hal, \"and why we get\nwarm inside when we run.\" Hal was very curious.\n\n\"Ah, here we are!\" cried Mr. Blake, with a jolly laugh, as he came in\nrubbing his ears. He caught Hal up in one arm, and Mab in the other.\n\n\"Oh, how cold your cheeks are, Daddy!\" cried Mab as she kissed him.\n\n\"Yes, it is going to be a frosty night, and freeze,\" he said. \"And if\nit freezes enough I will tell you a secret I have been keeping for\nsome time.\"\n\n\"Oh Daddy! Another secret!\" cried Mab. \"Tell us what it is, please!\"\n\n\"Wait until we see if it freezes hard enough to-night,\" replied her\npapa.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nTHE ICE IN THE BOTTLE\n\n\nHal and Mab were so excited at hearing their father speak about a new\nsecret, that they could hardly eat their supper. There were so many\nquestions they wanted to ask. But they managed to clear their plates,\nand then, when Mr. Blake had on his slippers, and had put plenty of\ncoal on the furnace, Hal climbed up on one knee, and Mab on the other.\n\n\"Now, Daddy, please tell us the secret,\" begged the little girl.\n\n\"And tell us what makes water freeze, and how it gets cold, and what\nmakes us warm when we run,\" added Hal. \"Sammie Jones is going to ask\nhis father what makes it lightning in a thunder storm.\"\n\n\"My goodness me sakes alive, and some peanut candy!\" cried Daddy Blake\nwith a laugh. \"What a lot of questions!\"\n\n\"But the secret first, please,\" begged Mab.\n\n\"Well, let me see if it is going to be cold enough for me to tell\nyou,\" said Mr. Blake. \"It must be freezing cold, or the secret will be\nof no use.\"\n\nDaddy Blake went to the door, outside of which hung an instrument\ncalled a thermometer. I guess you have seen them often enough. A\nthermometer is a glass tube, fastened to a piece of wood or perhaps\ntin, and inside is a thin, shiny column. This column is mercury, or\nquicksilver. Some thermometers have, instead of mercury, alcohol,\n red, so it can easily be seen.\n\nYou see mercury, or alcohol, will not freeze, except in much colder\nweather than you ever have where you live, unless you live at the\nNorth Pole. Up there it gets so cold that sometimes alcohol will\nbecame as thick as molasses, and then it is not of any use in a\nthermometer. But mercury will not freeze, even at the North Pole.\n\nThe word thermometer means something by which heat can be measured.\n\"Thermos\" is a Greek word, meaning heat, and \"Meter\" means to measure.\nThough of course a thermometer will measure cold as well as heat.\n\n\"Is it cold enough?\" asked Hal, as Daddy Blake came back from looking\nat the thermometer.\n\n\"Not quite,\" his father answered. \"But the mercury is going down the\ntube.\"\n\n\"What makes it go down?\" asked Mab.\n\n\"Well, let me think a minute, and I'll see if I can make it simple\nenough so you can understand,\" said Daddy Blake.\n\nThose of you who have read the other \"Daddy\" books know how many\nthings Mr. Blake told his children, and what good times Hal and Mab\nhad with him. He was always taking them somewhere, and often one or\nthe other of the children would call out:\n\n\"Oh, Daddy is going to take us walking!\"\n\nSometimes perhaps it might not be for a walk. It might be for a trip\nin the steam cars. But, wherever it was, Hal and Mab were always ready\nto go with their father.\n\nIn the first book I told you how Daddy Blake took Hal and Mab camping.\nThey went to live in the woods in a white tent and had lots of fun.\nOnce they were frightened in the night, but it was only because\nRoly-Poly, their poodle dog--\n\nBut there, I'm not going to spoil it by telling you, when you might\nwant to read the book for yourself.\n\nIn the second volume, called \"Daddy Takes Us Fishing,\" I made up a\nstory about how Hal and Mab went to the seashore cottage, and learned\nto catch different kinds of fish; even the queer, pinching crabs, that\nturned red when you boiled them.\n\nOnce Mab fell overboard, and the children nearly drifted out to sea,\nbut they got safely back. After that they went to the big animal show.\nAnd in the book \"Daddy Takes Us to the Circus,\" I told you how Hal and\nMab were accidentally taken away in one of the circus wagons, and how\nthey traveled all night. And the next day they rode on the elephant's\nback, and also on a camel's and they went in the big parade. Oh! it\nwas just wonderful the adventures they had!\n\nHal and Mab lived with their papa and mamma, and Aunt Lolly, in a fine\nhouse in the city. But they often went to the country and to other\nplaces where they had good times. In the family was also Uncle\nPennywait. That wasn't his real name, but the children called him that\nbecause he so often said:\n\n\"Wait a minute and I'll give you a penny.\"\n\nHal and Mab used to buy lollypops with the pennies their uncle gave\nthem. And then--Oh, yes, I mustn't forget Roly-Poly, the funny, fat,\npoodle dog who was always hiding things in holes in the ground,\nthinking they were bones, I guess. Sometimes he would even hide Aunt\nLolly's spectacles and she would have the hardest work finding them.\nOh, such hard work!\n\n\"Well, Daddy,\" asked Mab, after Mr. Blake had sat silent for some\ntime, \"have you thought of a way to tell us what makes the shiny stuff\nin the--in the--in the--Oh! I can't say that big word!\" she finished\nwith a sigh.\n\n\"The mercury in the thermometer!\" laughed Daddy Blake. \"You want to\nknow what makes it go down? Well, it's the cold. You see cold makes\nanything get smaller and shrink, and heat makes things swell up, and\nget larger. That's why the steam from hot water swells up and makes\nthe engine go, and pull the cars.\n\n\"And in hot weather the mercury swells, puffs itself out and creeps\nup inside the little glass tube. In winter the mercury gets cold, and\nshrinks down, just as it is doing to-night.\"\n\n\"But will it get cold enough so you can tell us the secret?\" Hal\nwanted to know, most anxiously.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" said his father. \"We will try it and see. I will fill a\nbottle with water, and we will set it out on the back porch to freeze.\nIf it freezes by morning I will know that I can tell you the secret.\"\n\n\"Oh, do we have to wait until morning?\" cried Mab, in disappointed\ntones.\n\n\"That won't be long,\" laughed her father. \"You can hardly keep your\neyes open now. I guess the sand man has been here. Go to bed, and it\nwill soon be morning. Then, if there is ice in the bottle, I'll tell\nyou the secret.\"\n\nDaddy Blake took a bottle, and filled it with water. He put the cork\nin tightly, and then twisted some wires over the top.\n\n\"What are the wires for?\" asked Hal.\n\n\"So the ice, that I think will freeze inside the bottle, will not push\nout the cork,\" explained Daddy Blake. \"Now off to bed with you!\"\n\nYou may be sure Hal and Mab did not want to go to bed, even if they\nwere sleepy. They wanted to stay up and watch the water in the bottle\nfreeze. But Mamma Blake soon had them tucked snugly under the covers.\n\nThen Daddy Blake fixed the furnace fire for the night, as it was\ngetting colder and colder. Next he opened a package he had brought\nhome with him. Something inside jingled and clanked, and shone in the\nlamplight as brightly as silver.\n\n\"What have you there?\" asked Aunt Lolly.\n\n\"That's the children's secret,\" answered Daddy Blake, as he wrapped\nthe package up again.\n\nHal was up first in the morning, but Mab soon followed him.\n\n\"Daddy, where is the bottle?\" called Hal.\n\n\"May we get it?\" asked Mab.\n\n\"Oh, it is much too cold for you to go out until you are warmly\ndressed!\" cried Daddy. \"I'll bring the bottle in so you can see it.\"\n\nHe went out on the porch in his bath robe and slippers, and quickly\nbrought in the bottle of water he had set out the night before.\n\n\"Oh, look!\" cried Hal.\n\nFor the bottle was broken into several pieces, and standing up on the\nboard on which it had been set, was a solid, clear piece of ice, just\nthe shape of the glass bottle itself.\n\n\"Oh, somebody broke our bottle!\" cried Mab. \"Now we can't hear the\nsecret!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nTHE NEW SKATES\n\n\nDaddy Blake laughed when Mab said that.\n\n\"Yes, the bottle is broken,\" he said, \"but it was the ice that broke\nit.\"\n\n\"How could it?\" Hal wanted to know.\n\n\"I told you last night,\" said Daddy Blake, when the children were at\nbreakfast table a little later, \"that heat made things get larger, and\nthat cold made them get smaller. That was true, but sometimes, as you\nsee now, freezing cold makes water get larger. That is when it is cold\nenough to make ice.\n\n\"As long as there was only water in the bottle it was all right, the\nglass was not broken. But in the night it got colder and colder. All\nthe warmth was drawn off into the cold air. Then the water froze, and\nswelled up. The ice tried to push the cork out of the bottle, just as\nyou would try to push up the lid of a box if you were shut up inside\none.\"\n\n\"I guess the wires over the cork wouldn't let the ice push it out,\"\nspoke Hal.\n\n\"That's it,\" Daddy Blake answered. \"And so, as the ice could not lift\nout the cork, it swelled to the sides, instead of to the top, and\npushing out as hard as it could, it broke the bottle. The glass fell\naway, and left a little statue of ice, just the shape of the bottle,\nstanding in its place.\n\n\"How wonderful!\" cried Mab, her blue eyes open wide.\n\n\"Yes, the freezing of ice is very wonderful,\" Daddy Blake said, as he\npassed Hal his third slice of bread and jam. \"If the cracks in a great\nrock became filled with water, and the water froze, the swelling of\nthe ice would split the great, strong stone.\n\n\"There is scarcely anything that can stand against the swelling of\nfreezing ice. If you filled a big, hollow cannon ball with water, and\nlet it freeze, the ice would burst the iron.\"\n\n\"It burst our milk bottle once, I know,\" said Aunt Lolly.\n\n\"Yes,\" spoke Daddy Blake. \"That is why, on cold mornings, the milkman\nraises the tin top on the bottle. That gives the frozen milk a chance\nto swell up out of the top, and saves the bottle from cracking.\"\n\n\"One morning last winter,\" said Mamma Blake, \"when we had milk bottles\nwith the pasteboard tops, the milk froze and there was a round bit of\nfrozen milk sticking up out of the bottle, with the round pasteboard\ncover on top, like a hat.\"\n\n\"And that's what saved the bottle from breaking,\" said Daddy Blake,\n\"If I had not wired down the cork of our bottle the water would have\npushed itself up, after it was frozen, and would have stuck out of the\nbottle neck, like a round icicle.\"\n\n\"But what about our secret?\" asked Hal. \"Is it cold enough for you to\ntell us about it?\"\n\n\"I think so,\" answered Daddy Blake, with a queer little twinkle in his\neyes. \"As long as the water in the bottle was frozen, the pond will\nsoon be covered with ice,\" he said. \"And we need ice to make use of\nthe secret.\"\n\n\"Oh, I just wonder what it is?\" cried Mab, clapping her hands.\n\n\"I think I can guess,\" spoke Hal.\n\nDaddy Blake went out in the hall, and came back with two paper\nbundles. He placed one at Mab's place, and gave the other to Hal.\n\n\"I want something, so I can cut the string!\" Hal cried, and he laid\nhis package down on the floor, while he searched through his pockets\nfor his knife.\n\nJust then Roly-Poly came into the breakfast room, barking. He saw\nHal's package on the floor, and, thinking, I suppose, that it must be\nmeant for him to play with, the little poodle dog at once began to\ndrag it away. Though, as the ground was frozen, I don't know how he\nwas going to bury it, if that was what he intended to do.\n\n\"Hi there, Roly!\" cried Hal. \"Come back with that, if you please,\nsir!\"\n\n\"Bow-wow!\" barked the little poodle dog, and I suppose he was saying:\n\n\"Oh, can't I have it a little while?\"\n\nBy this time Mab had her package open.\n\n\"Oh!\" she cried. \"It's skates! Ice skates! Oh, I've always wanted a\npair!\"\n\n\"Ha! That's what I thought they were, when Daddy talked so much about\nice and freezing,\" said Hal.\n\nHe had managed, in the meanwhile, to get his bundle away from\nRoly-Poly.\n\nOpening it, Hal found in the package a pair of shining ice skates,\njust like those Mab was trying on her shoes.\n\n\"Oh, thank you, Daddy!\" Hal cried.\n\n\"And I thank you, too!\" added Mab. I'd get up and kiss you, only my\nmouth is all jam. I'll kiss you twice as soon as I've washed.\"\n\n\"That will do,\" laughed her father. \"Do you like your skates,\nchildren?\"\n\n\"Oh, do we?\" they cried, and by the way they said it you could easily\ntell that they did.\n\n\"And Daddy's going to take us skating; aren't you?\" asked Hal as he\nmeasured his skates on his shoes to see if they would fit. They did.\nOh! Daddy Blake knew just how to buy things to have them right, I tell\nyou.\n\n\"Yes, I'll take you skating, and show you how to stand up on the\nice--that is as soon as it is thick enough on the pond to make it\nsafe, and hold us up,\" promised the children's father.\n\nJust then Mamma Blake came running up from down the cellar. She was\nmuch excited.\n\n\"Oh, come quickly!\" she called to her husband. \"Something has happened\nto the stationary wash-tubs. The water is spurting all over the\ncellar. Oh, do hurry!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nTHE FROZEN POND\n\n\nDaddy Blake hurried down cellar. Hal and Mab carefully putting away\ntheir new skates, followed their father. Roly-Poly, the little fat\npoodle dog looked around to see if he could find anything to drag\noff and hide, but, seeing nothing, he went down cellar also, barking\nloudly at each step.\n\n\"Hal! Mab!\" called Aunt Lolly. \"Come back here, dears!\"\n\n\"We want to see what has happened!\" answered Hal.\n\n\"Oh, you'll get hurt! I'm sure you will!\" exclaimed the dear, little,\nfussy old lady aunt.\n\n\"No, it isn't anything serious!\" called Daddy Blake when he saw what\nhad happened. \"Only one of the water pipes has burst. We must send for\nthe plumber. Wait, children, until I shut off the water, and then you\ncan come down. It is like a shower-bath now.\"\n\nDaddy Blake found the faucet, by which he could shut off the water at\nthe stationary wash-tubs, and then, when it had stopped spurting from\nthe burst pipe, he called to Hal and Mab:\n\n\"Now you may come and see how strong ice is. Not only does it burst\nglass bottles, but it will even crack an iron pipe.\"\n\n\"Just like it cracked a cannon ball!\" cried Hal, and he was in such a\nhurry to get down the cellar steps that he jumped two at a time.\n\nThat might have been all right, only Roly-Poly, the little fat poodle\ndog, did the same thing. He became tangled up in Hal's legs, and,\na moment later, the little boy and the dog were rolling toward the\nbottom of the steps, over and over just like a pumpkin.\n\n\"Oh!\" cried Mab, holding fast to the handrail, a little frightened.\n\n\"Oh my!\" exclaimed Mamma Blake at the top of the cellar steps. \"What\nhas happened?\"\n\n\"Oh my goodness me sakes alive and some orange pudding!\" exclaimed\nAunt Lolly. \"I just knew _something_ would happen!\"\n\nBut nothing much did, after all, for Daddy Blake, as soon as he heard\nHal falling, ran to the foot of the stairs, and there he caught his\nlittle boy before Hal had bounced down many steps.\n\n\"There you are!\" cried Daddy Blake, as he set Hal upright on his feet.\n\"Not hurt a bit; are you?\"\n\n\"N-n-n-n-no!\" stammered Hal, as he caught his breath, which had almost\ngotten away from him. \"I'm not hurt. Is Roly-Poly?\"\n\nRoly was whirling about, barking and trying to catch his tail, so I\nguess he was not much hurt. The truth was that both Hal and Roly were\nso fat and plump, that falling down a few cellar steps did not hurt\nthem in the least.\n\n\"Well, now we'll look at the burst water pipe,\" said Daddy Blake,\nwhen the excitement was over. The water had stopped spurting out now,\nthough there was quite a puddle of it on the cellar floor by the tubs.\n\nMr. Blake lifted Hal across this, and showed him where there was a big\ncrack in the water pipe. Then he showed Mab, also lifting her across\nthe little pond in the cellar.\n\n\"You see the pipe was full of water,\" Mr. Blake explained, \"and in the\nnight it got so cold down cellar that the water froze, just as it did\nin the glass bottle out on the back porch.\n\n\"Then the ice swelled up, and it was so strong that it burst the\nstrong iron pipe, splitting it right down the side.\"\n\n\"But why didn't the water spurt out when I came down cellar earlier\nthis morning?\" asked Mamma Blake. \"It did not leak then.\"\n\n\"I suppose it was still frozen,\" answered her husband. \"But when the\nfurnace fire became hotter it melted the ice in the pipe and that let\nthe water spurt out. But the plumber will soon fix it.\"\n\nHal and Mab watched the plumber, to whom their papa telephoned. He had\nto take out the broken pipe, and put in a new piece. Afterward Hal\nlooked at the pipe that had been split by the ice.\n\n\"Why it's just as if gun-powder blew it up,\" he said, for once he had\nseen a toy cannon that had burst on Fourth of July, from having too\nmuch powder in it.\n\n\"Yes, freezing ice is just as strong as gunpowder, only it works more\nslowly,\" said Daddy Blake with a smile. \"Powder goes off with a puff,\na flash and a roar, but ice freezes slowly.\"\n\n\"Oh, but when are we going skating?\" asked Mab, as she and her brother\nstarted for school, a little later that morning.\n\n\"As soon as I can find a frozen pond,\" said Daddy Blake with a smile.\n\nWell wrapped up, and wearing warm gloves, Hal and Mab went to their\nlessons. It was so cold that wintry day, though there was no snow,\nthat they ran instead of walking. Running made them warm.\n\n\"Is my nose red?\" asked Mab, when they were near the school.\n\n\"Oh, it's awful red!\" cried Hal. \"Is mine?\"\n\n\"As red as a boiled lobster!\" laughed Mab. \"Let's run faster!\"\n\nSo they ran, and soon they were in a glow of warmth.\n\n\"Oh!\" cried Mab, as she and her brother entered the school-yard, \"we\nforgot to ask Daddy why we get warm when we run.\"\n\nWhen the two children reached their house, after lessons were over for\nthe day, they found their father waiting for them. He had his skates\nover his shoulder, dangling from a strap, and he had Hal's and Mab's\nin his hand.\n\n\"Come, we are going to look for the frozen pond!\" he said.\n\nThen Hal and Mab forgot all about asking why they became warm when\nthey ran. They cried out joyfully:\n\n\"Oh, Daddy is going to take us skating! Daddy is going to take us\nskating!\"\n\nAcross the fields they went, and in a little while they came to a\nplace where was a pond, in which they used to fish during the summer.\nBut now as they looked down on the water, from the top of a small\nhill, they saw that the pond was all frozen over. A sheet of ice\ncovered it from edge to edge.\n\n\"Oh, now we can skate!\" cried Hal in delight, \"Now we can try our new\nskates.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nPOOR ROLY-POLY\n\n\n\"Come on!\" cried Mab, as she started to run down the <DW72> of the hill\ntoward the frozen pond. \"Come on, Hal!\"\n\n\"Hold on!\" called Daddy Blake. \"Wait a minute, Mab! Don't go on the\nice yet!\"\n\nMab stopped at once. So did Hal, who had just begun to run. You see\nthe children had gotten into the habit of stopping when their uncle\ncalled: \"Wait a minute and I'll give you a penny,\" so it was not hard\nfor them to do so when their father called.\n\n\"Why can't I go on the ice?\" asked Mab,\n\n\"I must first see how thick it is,\" answered Daddy Blake.\n\n\"What difference does that make?\" Hal wanted to know.\n\n\"Oh, a whole lot,\" said Mr. Blake. \"If the ice is too thin you will\nbreak through, and go into the cold water. We must be very careful, I\nwill see if it is thick enough.\"\n\nMab waited for her father and Hal to come to where she was standing.\nRoly-Poly did not wait, however. Down he rushed to the frozen pond.\n\n\"Oh, come back! Come back!\" cried Mab. \"You'll go through the ice,\nRoly!\"\n\nBut Roly-Poly paid no attention. Out on the slippery ice he ran,\nand then he turned around and, looking at Daddy Blake and the two\nchildren, he barked as loudly as he could.\n\nRoly-Poly was a queer dog that way. Sometimes he would mind Mab, and\nthen, again, he would not.\n\n\"I guess the ice is thick enough to hold up Roly,\" said Mr. Blake. \"It\ndoesn't need to be very strong for that, as Roly is so little.\"\n\n\"How thick must it be to hold us up?\" Hal wanted to know.\n\n\"Well, on a small pond, ice an inch thick might hold up a little boy\nor girl,\" explained Mr. Blake. \"But not very many children at a time.\nOn a large pond the ice should be from six to eight inches thick to\nhold up a crowd of skaters.\"\n\n\"Oh, does ice ever get as thick as that?\" asked Hal.\n\n\"Oh, yes, and much thicker. On big lakes it gets over two feet thick\nin cold weather,\" Mr. Blake said. \"Then it will hold up a whole\nregiment of soldiers, and cannon too. Ice is very strong when once it\nis well frozen. But always be sure it is thick enough before going\non.\"\n\n\"How are you going to tell?\" asked Mab.\n\n\"By cutting a little hole through the ice,\" her father told her. \"You\ncan look at the edges of the hole and tell how thick the ice is. We\nwill try it and see.\"\n\nWith the big blade of his knife, Mr. Blake cut and chipped a hole in\nthe ice, a little way from shore. Hal and Mab stayed on the ground\nwatching their father, but Roly-Poly ran all about, barking as hard as\nhe could.\n\n\"I guess he is looking for something to bury in a hole,\" spoke Hal.\nBut Roly could not dig in the hard ice, and the ground was also frozen\ntoo solidly for him to scratch. So all the little poodle dog could do\nwas to bark.\n\n\"There we are!\" cried Mr. Blake, after a bit. \"See, children, the ice\nis more than six inches thick. It will be safe for us to skate on!\"\n\nHal and Mab ran to look into the little hole their father had cut in\nthe ice. It went down for more than half a foot, or six inches, like a\nwell you dig in the sand at the seashore. But no water showed in the\nbottom of this hole in the ice.\n\n\"The ice is good and thick,\" said Mr. Blake. \"It will hold up all the\nskaters that will come on this pond.\"\n\nBut the children and their Daddy were the only ones there now. Mr.\nBlake showed Hal and Mab how to put on their skates. He made the\nstraps tight for them, and then put on his own.\n\n\"Now we will see how well you can skate,\" said Mr. Blake.\n\n\"I can!\" cried Hal. \"I've watched the big boys do it. I can skate!\"\n\n\"It's just like roller skating,\" said Mab, \"and I can do that, I\nknow.\"\n\n\"Well, you may find it a little different from roller skating, Mab,\"\nher papa answered with a laugh.\n\n\"Here I go!\" cried Hal. He struck out on the ice, first with one foot,\nand then with the other, as he had been used to doing on his roller\nskates. And then something happened.\n\nEither Hal's feet slid out from under him, or else the whole frozen\nsurface of the pond tilted up, and struck him on the head. He was not\nquite sure which it was, but it felt, he said afterward, as though the\nice flew up and struck him.\n\n\"Oh, be careful!\" cried Daddy Blake, as he saw Hal fall. But it was\ntoo late to warn the little boy then.\n\n\"Oh, he's hurt!\" exclaimed Mab with a little sob, as she saw that her\nbrother did not get up.\n\nDaddy Blake skated over to Hal, but there was no need of his help. For\nHal got up himself, only he was very careful about it. He did not try\nto skate any more. He did not want to slip and fall.\n\n\"Are you hurt?\" asked Mr. Blake.\n\n\"N-n-no; I guess not,\" Hal answered slowly. \"The ice is sort of soft,\nI guess.\"\n\n\"No quite as soft as snow, however,\" laughed Daddy Blake. \"Now you had\nbetter not try to skate until I take hold of your hand. I will hold\nyou up. Come, Mab, well take hold of hands and so help each other to\nstand up.\"\n\nRoly-Poly was rushing here and there, filled with excitement, and he\nwas barking all the while. He was having fun too.\n\n\"Now strike out slowly and carefully,\" directed Daddy Blake to the\nchildren. \"First lean forward, with your weight on the left foot and\nskate, and then do the same with your right. Glide your feet out in a\ncurve,\" and he showed them how to do it, keeping hold of their hands,\nMab on one side and Hal on the other. In this way they did not fall\ndown.\n\nSlowly over the ice they went.\n\n\"Oh, we are skating!\" cried Mab, in delight.\n\n\"Isn't it fun!\" shouted Hal.\n\n\"At least you are beginning to skate,\" said Mr. Blake.\n\nRoly-Poly kept prancing around in front, running here and there, and\nbarking louder than ever.\n\n\"Don't get in our way, Roly!\" called Mr. Blake with a laugh, \"or we\nmight skate right over you!\"\n\n\"Bow-wow!\" barked the little poodle dog. And I suppose that was his\nway of saying:\n\n\"No, I won't! I'll be good.\"\n\nHal and Mab were beginning to understand the first simple rules of\nskating. It was not as easy as they had thought--nor was it the same\nas roller skating. The ice was so slippery.\n\n\"Oh, look at Roly!\" cried Hal, when they had stopped for a rest. \"He's\nskating, too.\"\n\nA boy who had no skates had come down to the frozen pond, and, seeing\nthe poodle dog, and knowing him to be Hal's pet, this boy wanted to\nhave some fun. He would throw a stick on the ice, sliding it along,\nand Roly would race after it. He would go so fast, Roly would, that he\ncould not stop when he reached the stick, and along he would slide,\nalmost as if he were skating.\n\nJust as Hal called to Mab to look, Roly cook a long run and a slide.\nThen, all of a sudden, there was a cracking sound in the ice. A hole\nseemed to open, close to where the poodle dog was, and, a moment\nlater, Roly-Poly went down, out of sight, into the cold, black water.\n\n\"Poor Roly-Poly!\" cried Mab. \"He's drowned!\"\n\nRoly-Poly had gone under the ice. Hal and Mab were ready to cry. But\nlisten. This is a secret. Roly-Poly was not drowned! A wonderful thing\nhappened to him, but I can not tell you about it until the end of the\nbook. And mind, you're not to turn over the pages to find out, either.\nThat would not be fair. Just wait, and I'll tell you when the times\ncomes.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nFISHING THROUGH THE ICE\n\n\n\"Come on, Mab,\" cried Hal, to his sister. \"We've got to get him out!\nWe've got to save Roly-Poly!\"\n\nLetting go his father's hand, Hal started to skate toward the place\nwhere the little poodle dog had last been seen.\n\n\"Wait--don't go,\" said Mr. Blake quickly, but there was no need. For,\nas soon as Hal let go of his Daddy's hands, his feet, on which were\nstill the slippery skates, slid out from under him, and down he went\nagain.\n\n\"Oh dear!\" cried Mab. \"Everything is happening! Can't we save Roly,\nDaddy?\"\n\n\"Yes, perhaps,\" he said slowly. \"But we must not go too near. Roly\nwent down through an air hole in the ice. The ice is thin near there.\nIt might break with us. I will go up carefully and look.\"\n\nTelling Hal and Mab to stay together, in a spot where he knew the\nice was thick, Mr. Blake skated slowly toward the place where poor\nRoly-Poly had gone under. As he came near the ice began to crack\nagain. Mr. Blake skated back.\n\n\"It would be dangerous to go on,\" he said. \"I am sorry for Roly-Poly,\nbut it would not be wise for us to risk our lives for him. It would\nnot be right, however much you love him.\"\n\n\"Oh, we do love him so much!\" sobbed Mab.\n\n\"I'll get you another dog,\" said Mr. Blake, and then he had to blow\nhis nose very hard. Maybe he was crying too, for all I know. Mind, I'm\nnot saying for sure.\n\n\"No other dog will be like Roly-Poly,\" said Hal, who was trying not to\ncry.\n\n\"I'm awful sorry I threw the sticks for him to chase after,\" said\nCharlie Anderson, the boy who had been playing with the poodle dog\nwhile Hal and Mab were learning to skate.\n\n\"Oh, it wasn't your fault,\" said Daddy Blake. \"Poor Roly! I will see\nif I can break the ice around the hole. Maybe he is caught fast, and\nI can loosen the ice so he can get out.\" Daddy Blake took off his\nskates, and then, with a long piece of fence rail, while he stood on\nthe bank, the children's papa broke the ice around the edges of the\nair hole. But no Roly-Poly could be seen.\n\n\"Oh dear\" cried Mab. \"He is gone forever!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" spoke Hal, quietly, and then he put his arms around his little\nsister.\n\nBut don't you feel badly, children. We know something Hal and Mab do\nnot know, and we'll keep it a secret from them until it is time for\nthe surprise.\n\nThe two Blake children were so sorry their doggie had been lost\nthrough the ice, that their father thought it best to take them home.\n\n\"We will have another skating lesson to-morrow,\" he said. \"But this\nshows you how dangerous air holes are.\"\n\n\"What is an air hole in the ice, Daddy?\" asked Hal.\n\n\"I'll tell you,\" said Mr. Blake. This interested Mab, and she stopped\ncrying. Besides, if you cry when it's cold, the tears may freeze on\nyour cheeks, like little pearls, and fall off.\"\n\n\"An air hole,\" said Mr. Blake, as he walked on home with the children,\n\"is a place where the ice has not frozen solidly. Sometimes it may be\nbecause there is a warm spring in that part of the pond, or a spring\nthat bubbles up, and keeps the water moving. And you know moving or\nrunning water will not freeze, except in very, very cold weather.\n\n\"But always be careful of air holes, for the ice around them is easily\nbroken, and you might go through.\"\n\n\"Poor Roly-Poly!\" sighed Mab. \"I wish he had been careful.\"\n\n\"So do I,\" spoke Hal.\n\n\"How would you like to go fishing through the ice?\" asked Daddy Blake,\nso the children would have something new to think about, and not feel\nsorry about Roly.\n\n\"Fishing through the ice?\" cried Hal. \"How can we do that? Aren't the\nfish frozen in the winter?\"\n\n\"I saw some frozen ones down at the fish store,\" Mab said.\n\n\"Well, I don't mean that kind,\" laughed Daddy Blake. \"There are live\nfish in the waters of the lakes, rivers and ponds, down under the ice.\nYou can not catch all kinds of fish through the ice in winter, but you\nmay some sorts--pickeral for instance.\"\n\n\"Oh, Daddy, and will you take us fishing?\" asked Mab.\n\n\"I think I will, some day soon, if the cold keeps up,\" he said.\n\nAnd, surely enough he did.\n\nThe weather was still very cold, and the ice froze harder and thicker.\nSeveral times Daddy Blake took the children down to the pond, and\ntaught them about skating. They were doing very well.\n\nThen, one Saturday, when there was no school, Daddy Blake called out:\n\n\"Now we'll go fishing through the ice. We'll go over to the big lake,\nso wrap up well, as it is quite cold. We'll take along some lunch, and\nwe'll build a fire on the shore and make hot chocolate.\"\n\n\"Hurray!\" cried Hal.\n\n\"Oh, how lovely!\" exclaimed Mab.\n\nWell wrapped up, and carrying with them their fishing things, as well\nas lunch, while Mr. Blake had a small axe, the little party set off\nfor a large lake, about two miles away.\n\nWhen they reached it, Hal wondered how they could ever get any fish,\nas the water was covered with a thick sheet of ice. But Daddy Blake\nchopped several holes in the frozen surface, so Hal and Mab could see\nthe dark water underneath. The holes however, were not large enough\nfor the children to fall through.\n\n\"Now we'll fish through the ice!\" said Daddy Blake.\n\n\"Oh, I see how it's done!\" exclaimed Hal with a laugh.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nLEARNING TO SKATE\n\n\n\"Now we'll bait our hooks,\" said Mr. Blake, when he had put the lunch,\nwhich they had brought along, safely away in a sheltered place. \"And\nafter that we will have a little skate practice to get warmed up, for\nit is colder than I thought.\"\n\n\"But if we bait our hooks, and leave them in the water, won't the fish\nrun away with our lines if we are not here to watch them?\" asked Mab.\n\n\"We'll fix the lines so the fish that bite will ring a little bell, to\ntell us to come and take them off the hook!\" replied Daddy Blake with\na laugh.\n\n\"Oh, now I know you're fooling us!\" said Hal.\n\n\"No, really I am not,\" replied his father, but Mr. Blake could not\nkeep the funny twinkle out of his eyes, and Hal was sure there was\nsome joke.\n\nFrom a small satchel, in which he had put the things for fishing, Mr.\nBlake took several pieces of wire. On the ends were some bits of\nred cloth, and also, on each wire, a little brass bell, that went\n\"tinkle-tinkle.\"\n\n\"Oh, they are really bells!\" cried Mab, as she heard them jingle.\n\n\"Of course they are\" said her father. \"Now I'll tell you what we'll\ndo. We'll bait our hook, and lower it into the water through a hole in\nthe ice. Then, close to the hole, we'll fasten one of these pieces of\nwire each one of which has, on the upper end, a bell and a bit of red\ncloth.\n\n\"When the wires are stuck in the ice we'll fasten our lines to them,\nand then, when the fish, down in the cold water, pulls on the baited\nhook he will make the piece of red cloth flutter, and he will also\nring the bell.\"\n\n\"Oh, now I see!\" cried Hal. \"And if we are off skating we can look\nover here, and if we see the red rag fluttering we'll know we have a\nbite, and can come and pull up the fish.\"\n\n\"That's it,\" said Daddy Blake, smiling.\n\n\"And if we don't happen to see the red rag fluttering, we will hear\nthe bell ring,\" added Mab, clapping her hands. \"How nice it is to fish\nthis way!\"\n\nThe hooks were soon baited, and lowered into the water through the\nholes in the ice Then the other end of each fish line was made fast\nto a wire sticking up, with its bit of red rag, and the little brass\nbell.\n\n\"Now we'll go skating,\" said Daddy Blake. \"The fish themselves will\ntell us when they are caught. Come along.\"\n\nHal and Mab had, by this time, learned to put on their own skates,\nthough of course Hal helped his sister with the straps.\n\n\"You must begin to learn to skate by yourselves,\" said Daddy Blake,\nafter he had held the hands of the children for a time. \"Don't be\nafraid, strike out for yourselves.\"\n\n\"But s'pose we fall?\" asked Mab.\n\n\"That won't hurt you very much,\" her father said. \"Be careful, of\ncourse, not to double your legs up under you, and when you tumble\ndon't hit your head on your own skates, or any one's else. But when\nyou feel that you are going to fall, just let yourself go naturally.\nIf you strain, and try not to fall, you may sprain and hurt yourself\nmore than if you fall easily. Now strike out!\"\n\nHal and Mab tried it. At first they were timid, and only took little\nstrokes, but, after a while, they grew bolder, and did very well. They\nwere really learning to skate.\n\n\"Oh, look!\" suddenly cried Hal. \"My red rag is bobbing; I must have a\nbite!\"\n\nHe started in such a hurry toward the ice-hole where his line was set\nthat he fell down. But he did not mind that, and was soon up again.\nHowever, Mab, who did not stumble, teached her line first.\n\n\"Oh dear! I haven't a bite!\" she sighed, for her bell was not\njingling.\n\n\"But I have!\" cried Hal, pulling his line in. \"A big one, too!\"\n\n\"I'll help you,\" said Daddy Blake, as he skated up to his little son,\nand when Daddy had felt of the tugging line he remarked:\n\n\"Yes, that is a large fish! Up he comes!\" And he pulled up Hal's fish.\n\nJust as the big, flopping pickerel was hauled out on the ice, Mab\ncried:\n\n\"My bell is tinkling! My bell is tinkling! I've got a fish, too!\" And\nindeed her piece of wire was moving to and fro where it was stuck up\nin the ice, and the bell was jingling merrily.\n\n\"Wait, Mab, I'll help you!\" called Daddy Blake, and, leaving Hal to\ntake care of his own fish, the children's papa went to pull in Mab's\ncatch.\n\nHer fish was not quite as large as was Hal's, but it was a very nice\none. Then Mr. Blake called out:\n\n\"Oh ho! Now there's a bite on my line!\"\n\nHis bell jingled quite loudly, and when the string was pulled up\nthrough the hole there was a fine, large pickerel on the hook. The\nfish were placed in a basket to be taken home, after having been\nmercifully put out of pain by a blow on the head. Then the hooks were\nbaited again.\n\nIn a little while each one had caught another fish and then Daddy\nBlake said:\n\n\"Now we have all the fish we can use, so there is no need of catching\nany more. We will practice our skating a little longer, and then go\nhome. For I am sure you children must be cold.\"\n\n\"Oh, but aren't we going to eat the lunch we brought, before we go\nhome?\" cried Hal.\n\n\"I was just wondering if you would think of that!\" laughed Daddy\nBlake. \"Yes, we will eat lunch as soon as we get a little warm by\nskating around, or by running.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nTHE SKATING RACE\n\n\nDaddy Blake and the two children glided to and fro over the ice of the\nfrozen lake on their sharp steel skates. Soon all their cheeks were\nred and rosy, and they felt as warm inside as though they had taken\nsome hot chocolate at the corner drug store.\n\n\"Daddy,\" asked Hal, \"what makes you warm when you run fast, or skate?\"\n\n\"It is because your heart pumps so much more blood up inside your\nbody,\" explained Daddy Blake. \"Our blood is just the same to our\nbodies as coal is to a steam engine. The more coal the fireman puts\nunder the boiler (that is if it all burn well, and there is a good\ndraft) the hotter the fire is, and the more steam there is made.\"\n\n\"Is our blood like steam?\" asked Mab, as she tried to peep down at\nher red nose and cheeks. But she could not see them very well so she\nlooked at Hal's.\n\n\"Well, our blood is something like steam,\" said Daddy Blake, with a\nlaugh. \"That is if we didn't have any blood we could not move around,\nand live and breathe, any more than an engine could move if it had no\nsteam.\n\n\"You see we eat food, which is fuel, or, just what coal and wood are\nto an engine. The food is changed into blood inside our bodies, and\nour heart pumps this blood through our arteries, which are like steam\npipes. Our heart is really a pump, you know; a very wonderful pump.\"\n\n\"My heart is pumping hard,\" said Hal, putting his hand over his\nthumping chest.\n\n\"Well,\" went on his father, \"the reason for that is, that when we run,\nor skate fast, our body uses more blood, just as an engine which is\ngoing fast uses more steam than one going slowly. The heart has to\npump faster to send more blood to our arms and legs, and all over, and\nwhenever anything goes fast, it is warmer than when it goes slowly.\n\n\"If you rub your finger slowly over the window-pane, your finger will\n_not_ be very warm, but if you rub it back and forth as _fast_ as you\ncan, your finger-tip will soon be almost warm enough to burn you.\n\n\"That is something like what happens when you run quickly. The blood\ngoes through your body so much faster, and your heart beats so much\nharder, trying to keep up, that you are soon warm. And it is a good\nthing to exercise that way, for it makes the blood move faster, and\nthus by using up the old blood, you make room for new, and fresh.\n\n\"But I guess we've had enough talk about our hearts now,\" spoke Daddy\nBlake with a laugh. \"We'll eat some lunch and then take home our\nfish.\"\n\nDaddy Blake built a little fire on the shore, near the frozen lake,\nand over this blaze, when the flames were leaping up, and cracking, he\nheated the chocolate he had brought. Then it was poured out into cups,\nand nice chicken sandwiches were passed on little wooden plates.\n\n\"Isn't this fun!\" cried Mab as she sipped the last of her chocolate.\n\n\"Indeed it is,\" agreed Hal. \"I'm coming skating over to this lake\nevery day!\"\n\n\"Well, I guess not every day,\" spoke Daddy Blake with a smile. \"But\nwe'll come as often as we can, for I want you to learn to be good\nskaters. And besides, there may be snow soon, and that will spoil the\nice for us.\"\n\n\"Oh, I hope it doesn't snow for a long time,\" sighed Mab.\n\n\"So do I!\" echoed her brother. \"But, if it does, we can have some\nother fun. Daddy will take us coasting; won't you?\"\n\n\"I guess so,\" answered Mr. Blake.\n\nThe lunch things were packed in the basket, and then Hal and Mab went\nback to where the pickerel fish they had caught were left lying on the\nice.\n\n\"Why, they're frozen stiff!\" Hal cried, as he picked up one fish,\nwhich was like a stick of wood.\n\n\"That shows you how cold it is,\" said Mr. Blake. \"But mamma can thaw\nout the fish by putting them in water, and we can have them for dinner\nto-morrow.\"\n\n\"When are we coming skating again?\" asked Hal as they were on their\nway home.\n\n\"Oh, in a few days,\" his father promised. \"Meanwhile you and Mab can\npractice on the pond near home, and then you can have a race.\"\n\n\"Oh, good!\" cried Mab. \"And I'll win!\"\n\n\"Huh! I guess not!\" exclaimed Hal. \"Boys always win races; don't they,\nDaddy.\"\n\n\"Well, not always,\" said Mr. Blake. \"And Mab is becoming a good little\nskater.\"\n\n\"Well, I'll win!\" declared Hal. \"You see if I don't!\"\n\nThe next day was too cold for the children to go skating with\ntheir Daddy, but a little later in the week it was warmer, and one\nafternoon, coming home early from the office Mr. Blake said:\n\n\"Come on now. I hear you two youngsters have been practicing skating\non the pond, so we'll go over there and have a race.\"\n\n\"Hurray!\" cried Hal.\n\n\"Oh, I do hope I win!\" exclaimed Mab.\n\nThere were not many other skaters on the ice when the children and\ntheir father reached it Mr. Blake marked off a place, by drawing two\nlines on the ice with his skate. The space between them was about as\nlong as from the Blake's front gate to their back fence.\n\n\"Now, Hal and Mab,\" said Daddy Blake, \"take your places on this first\nline. And when I call 'Go!' start off. The one who reaches the other\nline first will win.\"\n\nHal and Mab took their places. They were so eager to start that they\nstepped over the line, before it was time.\n\n\"Go back,\" said Daddy Blake, smiling. Finally they were both evenly on\nthe line. The other skaters came up to watch.\n\n\"Go!\" suddenly cried Daddy Blake.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nA WINTER PIC-NIC\n\n\nHal and Mab started off on their race so evenly that neither one was\nahead of the other. The two children had learned to skate farily well\nby this time, though of course they could not go very far, nor very\nfast. And they could not cut any \"fancy figures\" on the ice such as\ndoing the \"grape-vine twist,\" or others like that.\n\n\"I--I--I think I'm going to win,\" said Mab as she skated along beside\nher brother.\n\n\"You'd better--better not talk,\" Hal panted. \"That takes your breath,\nand it's hard enough to breathe anyhow, when you're skating fast,\nwithout talking.\"\n\n\"You're talking,\" said Mab.\n\n\"But I'm not going to talk any more,\" Hal answered, and he closed his\nlips tightly.\n\nOn and on they skated, side by side.\n\n\"Oh, Hal's going to win!\" cried some of the children who had gathered\naround to watch.\n\n\"No, Mab is!\" shouted a number of little girls who were her friends.\n\"Mab will win!\"\n\nSometimes Mab would be in the lead, and then Hal would come up with a\nrush and pass her.\n\nIt was not very far to the \"finish line,\" as the end of the race is\ncalled.\n\n\"Oh, I do hope I get there first!\" thought Mab, her little heart\nbeating very fast.\n\n\"I hope I win!\" thought Hal.\n\nAnd that is always the way it is in races--each one wants to be first.\nThat is very right and proper, for it is a good thing to try and be\nfirst, or best, in everything we do. Only we must do it fairly, and\nnot be mean, or try to get in the way of anyone else. And, if we don't\nwin, after we have done our best, why we must try and be cheerful\nabout it. And never forget to say to the one who has come out ahead:\n\n\"Well, I am sorry I lost, but I am glad you won.\"\n\nThat is being polite, or, as the big folks say; when they have races,\nthat is being \"sportsman-like,\" and that that is the finest thing in\nthe world--to be really \"sportsman-like\" at all times.\n\n\"Go on! Go on!\" cried Daddy Blake. \"Don't stop, children! Finish out\nthe race!\"\n\nBut Hal and Mab were getting a little tired now, though the race was\nsuch a short one. Gradually Hal was skating ahead.\n\n\"Oh dear! He's going to win!\" thought Mab, but, just then, all of a\nsudden, Hal's skate glided over a twig on the ice, and down he went.\n\"Ker-bunk-o!\"\n\nBefore Mab could stop herself she had slid over the finish line.\n\n\"Oh, Mab wins! Mab has won the race!\" cried her girl friends.\n\nPoor Hal, who was not much hurt, I am glad to say, got up. He looked\nsorrowfully at his sister who had gone ahead of him, when he stumbled.\nHe did want so much to win!\n\nBut Mab was a real \"sportswoman,\" for there are such you know--even\nlittle girls.\n\n\"Hal, I didn't win!\" she exclaimed, skating back to her brother, \"It\nisn't a fair race when some one falls; is it Daddy?\"\n\n\"Well, perhaps in a real big race they would count it, even if some of\nthe skaters fell,\" he said. \"But this time you need not count--\"\n\n\"Well, I'm not going to count this!\" interrupted Mab. \"I don't want to\nwin the race that way. Come on, Hal. We won't count this, and we'll\nrace over again!\"\n\nNow I call that real good of Mab. Don't you?\n\nHal looked happy again. He didn't even mind the bruise on his knee,\nwhere it had hit on the ice.\n\n\"Well, I'd be glad to race over again,\" Hal said. \"Next time I won't\nfall.\"\n\n\"Very well, race over once more,\" said Daddy Blake.\n\nSo Hal and Mab did, and this time, after some hard skating, Hal\ncrossed the finish line a little ahead of his sister. Poor Mab tried\nnot to look sad but she could not help it.\n\n\"You--you won the race, Hal,\" she said.\n\n\"Well, maybe I got started a little ahead of you,\" he replied kindly.\n\"Anyhow, I'm older and of course I'm stronger. Oughtn't I give her a\nhead-start, Daddy?\"\n\n\"I think it would be more fair, perhaps,\" said Daddy Blake with a\nsmile.\n\n### Summary:"}

In\nmany minds time has dimmed the horrors of August and September 1914.\nWhen war weariness is apt to sap resolution and the possibility of a\npatched up peace is furtively canvassed, the great world of the\nEnglish-speaking race should call to remembrance the inhuman and barely\ncredible acts of brutality and bestiality committed in cold blood by the\nGerman race.\n\nNo apology is made for this book. It is a translation of a document\nwhich has created a profound impression in France. It is an\nauthoritative record of German crimes committed on the people of Belgium\nand Northern France, attested by the Mayors of twenty-six French towns.\nSome time ago permission was obtained from the French Committee of\nPublication (the Prefect of Meurthe-and-Moselle, and the Mayors of Nancy\nand Luneville) to produce an English version on condition that the\ntranslation be an \"exact and literal translation.\" This has been\ncompleted and the Editor, the Rev. J. Esslemont Adams, an Assistant\nPrincipal Chaplain with the British Expeditionary Force in France, is\nindebted to the friends who have assisted in producing the work.\n\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n\nThis is a book of horrors, but a book of plain truths! Where have we\ndiscovered our facts? They are taken from three sources: _First_, Four\nreports issued by the French Commission of Enquiry[1]; and \"Germany's\nViolation of the Laws of Warfare,\" published by the French Ministry of\nForeign Affairs; _Second_, Two volumes containing twenty-two reports of\nthe Belgian Commission[2], and the Reply to the German White Book of the\n15th May, 1915; _Third_, Notebooks found upon a large number of German\nsoldiers, non-commissioned officers, and officers, who have been wounded\nor taken prisoners, and translated under the direction of the French\nGovernment. These valuable records, in which the bandits and their\nleaders have imprudently given themselves away, are real \"_pieces a\nconviction_.\"\n\nThese reports in their entirety form an overwhelming indictment. We\nwish that everyone could study them in full. But the books are large,\nrunning to thousands of pages, and will not find their way to the\ngeneral public.\n\nYet everyone ought to know how the Germans carry on war. We have\ntherefore made selections from these documents in order to compile this\nsmall pamphlet. A dismal task, this wading through mud and blood! And a\nhard task, to run through all these reports, pencil in hand, with the\nidea of underlining _the essential facts_! You find yourself noting down\neach page, marking each paragraph; and, lo and behold, at the end of the\nbook, you have selected _everything_--- that is to say, nothing. One\nmight as well start to gather the hundred finest among the leaves of a\nforest, or to pick up the hundred most glittering grains among the sand\non a beach. All we can do is to take the first examples which come to\nhand. This, then, is not a collection of the most stirring and striking\nGerman crimes, but simply a book of samples. Until complete statistics\nare forthcoming, two classes of outrage stand out, and must remain ever\npresent to the mind: murdered civilians can be counted in thousands;\nhouses wilfully burned, in tens of thousands.\n\nFor want of time and space we have concerned ourselves here only with\ncrimes committed in Belgium and France, and we have had no thought of\nseparating the two neighbouring sister nations.\n\nOur part in this work is a modest one. Taking at random a certain number\nof _facts_, we have grouped them under different headings to make\nperusal easier for the reader. To indicate the references would have\nbeen impossible. Each line would have required a foot-note; the notes\nwould have been as long as the text, and both the length of, and the\ncost of producing this pamphlet would have been doubled.\n\nIt is enough to state that there is not a single fact published here\nthat cannot be verified by our readers in one or other of the documents\nalready referred to. Nothing but facts are set down, absolute bare\nfacts, and it is for the reader to form his own conclusions. When he has\nstudied these \"samples,\" and begins by means of them to learn the truth,\nthen, and only then, will he have the right to choose, according to his\nconscience, between remembrance and oblivion, between pardon and\npunishment.\n\nL. MIRMAN, Prefect of Meurthe-et-Moselle.\n\nG. SIMON, Mayor of Nancy.\n\nG. KELLER, Mayor of Luneville.\n\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[1] The members of this Commission were MM. G. Payelle (Premier\nPresident de la Cour des Comptes), A. Mollard (Ministre\nPlenipotentiaire), G. Maringer (Conseiller d'Etat), E. Paillot\n(Conseiller a la Cour de Cassation)--Rapports et Proces-verbaux, vols\ni., ii., iii., iv., Imprimerie Nationale.\n\n[2] The Commission, consisting of men of the highest position in\nBelgium, is presided over by M. Van Iseghem (President de la Cour de\nCassation). Its reports and the \"Reply to the German White Book\" have\nbeen published by Berger-Levrault, from which firm we have also \"Carnets\nde Route\" (J. de Dampierre) and \"Paroles Allemandes.\" \"Crimes allemands\nd'apres des te-moi gnages allemands,\" by J. Bedier, is published by\nColin.\n\n\n\n\nROBBERY\n\n\nWe shall not waste time over the looting of cellars, of larders, of\npoultry yards, of linen-chests, or of whatever can be consumed promptly,\nor immediately made use of by the troops--all these are the merest\ntrifles. Let us also dismiss pillage, organised on a large scale by the\nauthorities, of all sorts of raw material and industrial machinery: the\nbill on this score will come to several thousand million francs. Let us\nlikewise put aside official robberies, committed by governors of towns,\nor provinces, from municipal treasuries (even the treasury of the Red\nCross at Brussels was robbed), usually under the form of fines, or of\ntaxes imposed under transparent pretences. There again there will be\nmillions to recover.\n\nWe shall deal here with _personal robberies_ only, as distinct from the\npilfering carried on by hungry soldiers, distinct too from the regular\ncontributions levied on a conquered country by an unscrupulous\nadministration. These robberies are innumerable, committed sometimes by\nprivate soldiers, but often by officers, doctors, and high officials.\nHere are some examples.\n\n(1) _Soldier thieves_: They are rougher in their dealings, and kill\nthose who offer resistance. It is a case of \"Your money or your life.\"\nMadame Maupoix, aged 75, living at Triaucourt, was kicked to death while\nsoldiers ransacked her cupboards. Monsieur Dalissier, aged 73,\nbelonging to Congis, was summoned to give up his purse: he declared\nthat he had no money; they tied him up with a rope and fired fifteen\nshots into his body. Let us pass quickly over the \"soldier\nthief\"--merely small fry!\n\n(2) _Officer thieves_: At Baron, an officer compelled the notary to open\nhis safe, and stole money and jewellery from it. Another, after going\nthrough several houses, was seen wearing on his wrists and fingers six\nbracelets and nine rings belonging to women. Soldiers who brought their\nofficer a stolen jewel received a reward of four shillings. The\nrobberies at Baccarat and Creil were \"directed\" by officers. At Creil, a\ncaptain tried to induce Guillot and Demonts to point out the houses of\nthe richest inhabitants, and their refusal cost them harsh treatment. At\nFosse, a French military doctor in charge of an ambulance, conveying two\nhundred patients, and himself wounded, was arrested and taken before a\ncaptain. The captain told the doctor that he would have him shot, and\nmeanwhile opened the doctor's tunic with his own hand, took out his\npocket-book and appropriated the 400 francs he found in it.\n\nOfficers and privates sometimes share the stolen money. From a diary\nbelonging to a titled Lieutenant of the Guards, let us quote this\nnote:--\n\n    \"Fosse. Village entirely burnt. The 7th Company made\n    2000 francs in booty.\"\n\nFrom another officer's note-book:--\n\n    \"More than 3000 francs booty for the battalion.\"\n\nAnother diary, after the sacking of a place, gives a detailed account\nof the distribution thus:--\n\n    \"460 francs for the first lieutenant, 390 francs for the\n    second lieutenant, etc....\"\n\n(3) _Doctor thieves:_ At Choisy-au-Bac, two army doctors, wearing their\nbrassards, personally sacked the house of a family named Binder. At\nChateau-Thierry some doctors were made prisoners: their mess-tins were\nopened and found to be full of stolen articles. After Morhange, a French\ndoctor of the 20th Corps remained in the German lines to be near his\nwounded. He was accosted by one of his German 'confreres.'[3] who with\nhis own hands stole his watch and pocket-book.\n\nAt Raon-sur-Plaine, after the retreat of our troops, Dr. Schneider\nremained behind with thirty wounded. Next day up came a German ambulance\nwith Professor Vulpius, a well-known German scientist of Heidelberg\nUniversity, who must have presided over many international medical\ncongresses. As soon as he was installed, \"Herr Professor\" intimated to\nhis French fellow-doctors that he was \"going to begin with a small\ncustomary formality.\" The formality was a simple one: his colleagues\nwere to hand over to him \"all the money they had on them.\" \"I strongly\nprotested\" (declared the French doctor, on oath), \"but we were compelled\nto hand over our purses and all their contents. Having relieved us in\nthis way, he turned to our poor wounded, who were all searched and\nstripped of their money. There was nothing to be done: we were in the\nhands, not of a doctor, but of a regular brute....\"\n\n(4) _Royal thieves_: After living about a week in a chateau near Liege,\nH.R.H. Prince Eitel Fritz, the Duke of Brunswick, and another nobleman\nof less importance, had all the dresses that could be found in the\nwardrobes belonging to the lady of the house and her daughters packed up\nbefore their own eyes, and sent to Germany.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThese thieves are often _facetious_: they give as compensation a\nso-called receipt or bond (in German, of course), which in French means,\n\"Good for a hundred lashes,\" or \"Good for two rabbits,\" or \"To be shot,\"\nor \"Payable in Paris\".... They are also _disgusting_. In houses robbed\nby them they leave, by way of visiting cards, excrement in beds, on\ntables, and in cupboards. They are sometimes _unnaturally vicious_. In a\nvillage of Limbourg they burnt in a stable a stallion valued at 50,000\nfrancs, and \"forced the farmer, his wife and children to witness the\ncrime on their knees with their arms raised.\" Amongst the crowd of\nunfortunate people brought from Louvain to Brussels were thirteen\npriests. The soldiers at a German guard-house stopped the column, and\nordered the priests to come out. To shoot them? No. They forced them\ninto a pigsty, from which they had driven out the only pig. Forthwith\nthey compelled most of them to strip off all their clothes, and robbed\nthem of everything of value they possessed.\n\nThese thieves are _practical_ too. At Dinant, safes were opened with\noxy-hydrogen blow-pipes, brought expressly for that purpose. They have a\npartiality for safes, and in this connection the story of Luneville\ndeserves recording. A house near the station, belonging to M. Leclerc,\nwas set on fire; the walls alone remained standing, and in one of them\n(on the second floor) a safe was left intact. A non-commissioned\nofficer, named Weill, with a party blew up the wall with dynamite, and\nthe safe was extricated from the rubbish, carried to the station, put on\na truck, and sent to Boche-land. This man Weill, before the war, often\ncame to Luneville on business with hops, was always well received there,\nmade himself agreeable and knew everybody. When the Germans settled in\nthe unfortunate town he played a very important part, in spite of his\nlow rank, in acting as agent, confidential clerk and guide to the\nCommanding Officer.\n\nThe robbers are also business-like in their transport arrangements as to\ncarriages, military waggons, lorries, and motor cars. At Compiegne,\nwhere the home of the Orsetti family was sacked, silver plate, jewellery\nand articles of value were collected in the courtyard of the chateau,\nthen classified, registered, packed and \"put into two carts, upon which\nthey took care to place the Red Cross flag.\" We read in the note-book of\na wounded German soldier, under medical treatment at Brussels, \"A car\nhas arrived at the hospital, bringing war booty, a piano, two sewing\nmachines and all sorts of other things.\"\n\nIn 1870, our clocks were in most demand; now, pianos form the\nattraction, and an immense number have been sent to Germany. They are\nthe article particularly favoured by the Boche ladies. In a chateau\nretaken by our troops, an officer left behind a letter from his wife, in\nwhich is written, \"A thousand thanks for the beautiful things you sent\nme. The furs are magnificent, the rosewood furniture is exquisite; but\ndon't forget that Elsa is always waiting for her piano.\"\n\nThese women, however, are not all as patient in waiting as Elsa. They\nfrequently come and choose for themselves, and preside over the packing.\nThey have been seen arriving in motor cars from Strasbourg or Metz, at\nmany towns in Lorraine, at Luneville, Baccarat, and elsewhere.\n\nAll note-books, more or less, contain such items as these: \"Wholesale\npillage and abundant loot,\" \"Everything destroyed or sacked,\" \"Looting\ngoing strong,\" \"Played the piano; looting going strong.\" This very\nGerman formula frequently occurs, \"_Methodically_ plundered.\" And again,\n\"We have been allowed to plunder; we didn't require to be told twice:\nwhole bales of loot.\"\n\n\"_Rethel._ The Vandals could not have done better.\" (The officer who\nmakes this indiscreet admission and seems to protest against the thefts\ncommitted, writes on the following page: \"I have found a silk rainproof\ncoat and a camera for Felix.\")\n\n\"_Courcy._ The village, and the workmen's cottages looted and sacked.\nAtrocious. There is something, after all, in what they say of German\nbarbarians.\"\n\n\"_Ottignies._ The village was pillaged. The blond beast has made plain\nwhat he is. The Huns and the free-lances of the Middle Ages could not\nhave done better.\"\n\n\"_Cirey._ During the night incredible things were done: shops sacked,\nmoney stolen, rapes: enough to make one's hair stand on end.\"\n\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[3] We have not found this fact recorded in the Commission's Reports. It\nwas told to us, on his return from captivity, by Dr. Marlier, of the\n20th Corps, taken prisoner at Morhange, and Dr. Marlier is the soul of\nhonour.\n\n\n\n\nINCENDIARISM\n\n\nIn order to punish imaginary crimes, attributed to individuals or\ntownships, or without even taking the trouble to discover any kind of\npretext, the Germans often, especially after looting, set everything on\nfire _so as to make all traces disappear_. Sometimes, as at Courtacon,\nthey compelled the inhabitants to provide the material for burning their\nown houses; or, as at Recquignies, forced prisoners \"to set the houses\nof the doctor and mayor on fire with lighted straw.\" But generally they\ndo the work themselves. They have a _special service_ for this, and all\nthe requisite incendiary material is carefully prepared; torches,\ngrenades, fuses, oil pumps, firebrands, satchels of pastilles containing\nvery inflammable compressed powder, etc. German science has applied\nitself to the perfecting of the technique of incendiarism. The village\nis set alight by a _drilled_ method. Those concerned act quite coolly,\nas a matter of duty, as though in accordance with a drill scheme laid\ndown and perfected beforehand.\n\nOf course, fire once let loose, these people have to see that it does\nits work completely: accordingly, at Louvain, they destroyed the\nfire-engines and fire-escapes; at Namur, they stopped the firemen at the\nvery moment they were preparing to do their duty.\n\nIn this way they sometimes wilfully burned down whole blocks of\ndwellings (Luneville): sometimes an entire district (105 houses at\nSenlis, 112 at Baccarat): sometimes almost a whole town itself (more\nthan 300 houses at Gerbeviller, 800 at Sermaize, 1,200 at Dinant, 1,800\nat Louvain[4]). On other occasions they did not leave a house standing\n(Nomeny, Clermont-en-Argonne, Sommeilles).\n\nThe complete list of buildings, cottages, farms, villas, factories, or\nchateaux, burned wilfully in this way by hand, will be a formidable one,\namounting to tens of thousands.[5]\n\nRefinement of cruelty frequently occurs. At Aerschot \"women had to\nwitness the sight of the conflagration holding their hands up. Their\ntorture lasted six hours.\" At Crevic, the Germans began their sinister\nwork by burning a chateau which they knew belonged to General Lyautey.\nThe troops, commanded by an officer, shouted out for Madame and\nMademoiselle Lyautey \"that they might cut their heads off.\"\n\nThe houses destroyed by fire were not always uninhabited. At Maixe, M.\nDemange, wounded in both knees, dragged himself along and fell prostrate\nin his kitchen; his house was set on fire and Madame Demange was\nforcibly prevented from going to the rescue of her husband, who perished\nin the flames. At Nomeny, Madame Cousin, after being shot, was thrown\ninto the burning building and roasted. At the same place, M. Adam was\nthrown alive into the flames. Let us note in connection with him, to\ntheir credit, an act of comparative humanity. Finding that the unhappy\nman was not being burnt fast enough, they ended his misery in the flames\nby shooting him. At Monceau-sur-Sambre, where they set fire to 300\nhouses, they confined the two brothers S. in a shed, and the unfortunate\nmen were burnt alive.[6]\n\nThe soldiers' diaries are filled with descriptions of incendiarism, some\nof which we now quote. \"Returned by Mazerulles, which was burnt as we\npassed through, because the engineers found a telephone there connected\nup with the French.\"[7] \"The whole village was in ablaze. Everything\ndestroyed in the street, except one small house; in front of the door\nwas a poor woman with her six children, her arms raised and begging for\nmercy. And every day it is the same thing.\"\n\n_Parnx_. \"The first village burnt (in Lorraine, on the 10th August);\nafter that the fun began. Villages in flames, one after the other.\"\nAnother note-book simply states, \"Sommepy--horrible carnage. The village\nentirely burnt; the French thrown into the burning houses; civilians\nwith the rest.\" Another recalls theatrical memories. \"The village is\nablaze; it reminds one of the conflagration of Walhalla in the 'Twilight\nof the Gods.'\"\n\nHere is a poet speaking: \"The soldiers set up the red cock (_i.e._,\nfire) upon the houses, just as they like.\" This poet is moved, and\nspeaks of \"pure vandalism\" on the part of his companions in arms. And\nagain, a musician writes, \"Throwing of incendiary grenades into the\nhouses; a military concert in the evening--'Nun danket alle Gott'! (Now\nthank we all our God).\" Finally, a Bavarian: \"The village\n(Saint-Maurice, Meurthe-et-Moselle) was surrounded, and the soldiers\nposted one yard apart so that no one could escape. Then the Uhlans set\nfire to the place, one house after the other. No man, woman, or child\ncould possibly escape. Only the cattle were removed in safety, because\ncattle have some value. Anyone trying to escape was shot. Everything in\nthe village was destroyed.\" We shall see presently that they even went\nso far as to burn ambulances.\n\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[4] They destroyed by fire the Library at Louvain, with its 200,000\nvolumes and its incomparable treasures. By means of shells and fire they\nhave injured in one place, totally destroyed in another, wonders of art\nthat were an integral part of our human heritage; our Cathedrals at\nRheims, Arras, Ypres, &c.\n\n[5] Belgium alone accounts for about 20,000.\n\n[6] This fact is quoted in the admirable book by Captain A. de Gerlache,\nentitled \"Belgium and the Belgians during the War,\" published by the\nfirm of Berger-Levrault.\n\n[7] See note at foot of page 31. (this is foot-note 11)\n\n\n\n\nMURDER\n\n\nNot having sufficient space for a complete catalogue, we shall here\nsimply mention the judicial murders of Miss Cavell, Eugene Jacquet,\nBattisti, and others, in order to honour the memory of those noble\nvictims. For the same reason, as they are now well known to everyone, we\ncontent ourselves with merely recalling the criminal torpedoing of the\n_Lusitania,_[8] _Ancona, Portugal, Amiral-Ganteaume_.... all merchant\nsteamers, without any military character whatever, employed in carrying\npassengers of every nationality, and the last-named crowded with\nrefugees.\n\nWe may pass over the crimes committed _from a distance_, so to speak, on\nunfortified towns, with fieldpieces, long-range guns, aeroplanes, and\nZeppelins, merely noting that the Germans _were the first_ to fire\nshells into the centre of towns indiscriminately. If they made an\nexception, it was to aim at the cathedral square, when people were\nleaving after Mass, as at Nancy, or into the market-place at the time\nwhen women are busiest, as they did at Luneville.\n\nWe only mention here such outrages as were committed at close quarters\nwith hand-weapons, bayonets or rifles. The list is a long one. Will the\nexact number of victims ever be known? In Belgium alone it has been\nproved that up to now more than 5,000 civilians have been assassinated:\ngrown men, old people, women and children. They slaughtered their\nvictims sometimes one by one, sometimes in groups, often in masses. They\nwere not content only with killing. At one place they organised round\nthe massacre such tragic scenes, and at another displayed such\nrefinements of cruelty, that reason falters in face of their acts, and\nasks what terrible madness has brought this race to such low depths? Is\nit possible? Yes, it is. Judge by the following examples:--\n\nAt Foret, the village schoolmaster was shot for refusing to trample\nunder foot the national flag, torn down from the front of the school.[9]\nAt Schaffen, A. Willem was tied to a tree and burnt alive, and two other\nunfortunate men were buried alive. Madame Luykx and her little girl, 12\nyears old, were shot together in a cellar. J. Reynders and his young\nnephew, 10 years of age, were both shot in the street. At Sompuis, an\nold man named Jacquemin, aged 70, was bound to his bed by an officer and\nleft there without food for three days, dying soon after his release.\n\nA Westphalian prisoner states, \"The commanding officer ordered us to\nshoot two women, and we did so. One of them was holding a child by the\nhand, and in falling she dragged the child over with her. The officer\ngave orders to shoot the child, because it could not be left alone in\nthe world.\" At Rouves, a Government clerk refused to tell a Bavarian\nofficer the numbers of the French regiments in the neighbourhood. The\nofficer killed him with two shots from his revolver. At Crezancy,\nanother officer shot with his own hand young Lesaint, 18 years old, \"to\nprevent his being a soldier later on.\" At Embermenil, Madame Masson was\nshot for having, in absolute good faith, given some wrong information.\nAs she was obviously in a state of pregnancy they made her sit down on a\nbench to meet her fate. At Ethe, two priests were shot \"for having\nburied some weapons.\" At Marqueglise, a superior officer ordered the\narrest of four young fugitives. Learning that two of them came from\nBelgium, he exclaimed, \"The Belgians are filthy people,\" and without\nmore ado took his revolver and shot them one after the other. Three were\nkilled outright, the fourth expired the following day.\n\nFrom the crowd of fugitives which left Louvain in flames, the priests\nwere singled out, and searched. On one of them, a Jesuit father, by name\nDupierreux, they found a note-book containing the following note in\nFrench, \"When I used to read about the Huns under Attila devastating\ntowns, I smiled. I smile no longer now that I have seen with my own eyes\nthe hordes of to-day setting fire to the churches and library of\nLouvain.\" In front of the assembled troops the priests were placed in a\nsemi-circle round the Jesuit Father. The incriminating phrase was read\nout, and then translated into German. The lieutenant said that it\nconstituted an incitement to murder, and that the Jesuit must be shot on\nthe spot. The sentence was carried out forthwith, and the other\npriests, his companions, were made to bury him where he fell.\n\nAt Pin, some Uhlans found two young boys on the road. They tied them by\nthe arms to their horses and galloped off. The bodies of the poor lads\nwere found a few miles away--their knees were \"literally crushed\"; one\nhad his throat cut and both had several bullets in their heads. At\nSermaize, a labourer, named Brocard, and his son, were arrested. His\nwife and daughter-in-law, mad with terror, threw themselves into a\nneighbouring stream. The old man broke away, and ran to try and save\nthem. The Germans dragged him away.... Four days later Brocard and the\nson, on being liberated, returned home, and after a search, found the\nbodies. The two women, while still in the water, had been shot several\ntimes through the head. A parish priest named Dergent was taken to\nAerschot, stripped, and tied to a cross in front of the church; his\nfingers and toes were crushed and broken with the butt-end of a rifle.\nThe inhabitants were made to pass in front of him and were each\ncompelled to urinate on him in turn; then he was shot and his body\nthrown into the canal.[10]\n\nAt Herimenil, during the pillage, the inhabitants were shut up in a\nchurch, and kept there for four days without food. When Madame Winger,\n23 years of age, and her three young servants, one girl and two boys,\nwere too slow in leaving her farm to go to the church, the captain\nordered his men to fire on them. Four more dead bodies!\n\nThe Germans arrived at Monchy-Humieres. A group of inhabitants watched\nthem marching past. No provocation whatever was offered, but an officer\nthought that he heard someone utter the word \"Prussians.\" He at once\ncalled out three dragoons, and ordered them to fire upon the group--one\nkilled and two wounded--one of the latter being a little girl of four.\n\nAt Sommeilles, when the fire--which destroyed the whole place--broke\nout, Madame X. took refuge in a cellar belonging to M. and Madame Adnot,\nwho were there, with their four children, the eldest a girl of 11 years.\nA few days after, on returning to the village, our soldiers found the\nseven bodies in the cellar lying in a pool of blood, several of them\nbeing horribly mutilated. Madame X. had her right arm severed from her\nbody; the little girl's foot had been cut off, and the little boy of\nfive had his throat cut.\n\nAt Louveigne a certain number of men were shut up in a blacksmith's\nshop; in the afternoon the murderers opened the door as if it were a\npigeon-shooting competition, drove the prisoners out, and shot them\ndown--a ghastly group of 17 corpses.\n\nAt Senlis the heroic Mayor, M. Odent, and six members of his staff were\nshot.\n\nAt Gerbeviller they forced their way into the house of M. and Madame\nLingenheld; seized the son, aged 36, exempt from service, and wearing\nthe badge of the Red Cross, tied his hands, dragged him into the street\nand shot him. They then returned to look for the father, an old man of\n70. Meanwhile the mother, mad with terror, made her escape. On coming\nout she saw her son lying on the ground. As he still showed signs of\nlife, they threw paraffin over him and roasted him. The father was shot\nlater on with fourteen other old men. More than 150 victims were\nidentified in this parish.\n\nAt Nomeny, M. Vasse provided shelter for a number of neighbours in his\ncellar. Fifty soldiers got in and set fire to the house. To escape the\nflames the refugees rushed out and were shot one by one as they emerged.\nMentre was killed first; his son Leon, with his little eight-year-old\nsister in his arms, fell next: as he was not quite dead they put the\nbarrel of a rifle to his ear and blew his brains out. Then came the turn\nof a family named Kieffer. The mother was wounded; the father, his boy\nand girl, aged respectively 10 and 3, were shot down. They fell on them\nwith fury. Striffler, Guillaume, and Vasse were afterwards massacred.\nYoung Mlle. Simonin, 17 years old, and her small sister, afraid to leave\ntheir refuge in the cellar, were eventually driven out by the flames,\nand immediately shot at. The younger child had an elbow almost blown off\nby a bullet; as the elder girl lay wounded on the ground, she was\ndeliberately kicked by a soldier. At Nomeny 40 victims were identified.\n\nAnd now we come to some of the _wholesale slaughters._ At Louvain, more\nthan 100 victims; at Aerschot, over 150; at Soumagne, 165; at Ethe, 197;\nat Andenne, over 300; at Tamines, 400; at Dinant, upwards of 600, of\nwhom 71 were women, 34 old men of over seventy, 6 children from five to\nnine years old, and 11 under five. At Aerschot, a first batch of 78 men\nwere taken out of the town, and ordered to advance in groups of three,\nholding each other by the hand, when they were made to pass in front of\nsome German Military Police, who shot them all at short range with\nrevolvers. Others had their hands bound so tightly that many screamed\nwith pain: they spent the night lying on the ground, and were shot the\nnext day. Many, before execution, were compelled to dig their own\ngraves. At Dinant, the victims were placed in two rows, the first\nkneeling, the second standing. Then came the order--\"Fire!\" At Tamines,\nseveral hundred men were massed in the Place Saint-Martin, on the bank\nof the Sambre. The assassins stood ten yards away and fired a volley.\nAll fell, but some were not wounded. The officer in command ordered them\nto \"stand up.\" A second volley was fired. As soon as the firing\nfinished, there was a frightful scene which lasted until the\nevening--the killing of the wounded. Many soldiers, some wearing the\nbadge of the Red Cross, approached their victims by the light of small\nlanterns, and passed through their ranks, clubbing them with the butt\nend of their rifles, and stabbing with bayonets. A perfect shambles!\n\nIn these horrors we do not discern the musical note, or the\nacknowledgment of the \"Old German God.\" Yet, here is a specimen:--\n\nAt Andenne, Colonel Schumann, in command of the Potsdam Rifles,\norganised a grand concert in the evening at the Place des Tilleuls. The\nentertainment ended with a prayer!\n\nIt now remains for us to publish a few extracts from note-books found\nupon officers and privates. Some are short items like the\nfollowing:--\"Pepinster, 12th August. Burgomaster, Priest and\nSchoolmaster shot, and houses burnt to the ground. We resume our march.\"\nAnother, \"Villers-en-Fagne, village in flames. The population had\nnotified the French of the approach of the grenadiers; thereupon the\nhussars set fire to the village, the Parish Priest and others being\nshot.\"\n\nOthers enter into details of the executions. \"_Leffe._ We shoot everyone\nwho fires on our men. We put three, one behind the other, and a Marburg\nrifleman kills them outright with a single shot. It is war to the\nknife.\"\n\nAnother expresses something other than enthusiasm for such work.\n\"Considering that the King (of the Belgians) has given orders to defend\nthe country by all possible means, we have been ordered to shoot every\nmale inhabitant. At Dinant more than 100 were collected in a crowd and\nshot. A dreadful Sunday.\" Another, an aesthete, writes as follows:\n\"During the night many more civilians were shot, so many that we were\nable to count over 200. Women and children, with lamps in their hands,\nwere compelled to witness the horrible sight. We afterwards ate our\nrice among the dead bodies. Sadly beautiful.\" He adds (in shorthand)\n\"Captain Hermann was drunk.\"\n\nAgain another: \"_Dinant._ We have been firing on everyone who showed\nhimself, or on those thrown out of the houses, men or women. The bodies\nlie in the streets, in heaps a yard deep.\"\n\nA Saxon officer writes: \"My company is at Bouvignes. Our men behave like\nvandals: everything is upset; the sight of the slaughtered inhabitants\ndefies all description; not a house is left standing. We have dragged\nout of every corner all survivors, one after another, men, women, and\nchildren, found in a burning cloister, and have shot them 'en masse.'\"\n\nThe following depositions on the massacres at Nomeny are made by\nprisoners, one a Bavarian officer in the Reserve, the other a private in\nthe same regiment. The lieutenant says: \"I gathered the impression that\nit was impossible for the officers at Nomeny to prevent such acts. As\nfar as I can judge, the crimes committed there, which horrified all the\nsoldiers who were at Nomeny later on, must be put down to the acts of\nunnatural brutes.\" The soldier says, \"At five o'clock regimental orders\nwere received to kill every male inhabitant of Nomeny, and to raze\neverything to the ground; we forced our way into the houses.\" Here is a\nmore detailed account of a massacre near Blamont. \"All the villagers\nfled: it was terrible; their beards thick with blood, and what faces!\nThey were dreadful to look at. The dead were all buried, numbering\nsixty. Among them were many old men and women, and one unfortunate woman\nhalf confined--the whole being frightful to look at. Three children\nwere clasped in each other's arms, and had died thus. The Altar and the\nvaulting of the church were destroyed because there was a telephone[11]\ncommunicating with the enemy. This morning, 2nd September, all the\nsurvivors were expelled. I saw four small boys carrying away on two\nsticks a cradle containing a baby of five or six months. All this is\ndreadful to see. Blow for blow: thunder against thunder! Every thing is\ngiven up to pillage. I also saw a mother with her two children; one had\na big wound on the head, and one eye knocked out.\"\n\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[8] They have decorated the pirates who sank the _Lusitania_. They glory\nin the crime, and have even struck a commemorative medal in its honour.\n\n[9] In this case, and many of the following ones, the reader is\nrequested to note, and remember, the _motive_ for the murders.\n\n[10] This cruel treatment of the Abbe Dergent, priest of Gelrode, near\nLouvain, is reported by a neutral witness, Father G., a student at\nLouvain. The German soldiers accused the Belgian priests of every\nconceivable crime; the Assistant-Priest of Sainte-Gertrude (Louvain),\nwho was remonstrating with a soldier, received this reply: \"We are\nCatholics too, but you are pigs and black devils.\" In Belgium about one\nhundred of the clergy were massacred. Note further that in this\nunfortunate country _doctors_ were particularly ill-treated;\nthirty-seven being shot in the small parishes, while more than one\nhundred and fifty disappeared altogether from large towns.\n\n[11] To whom did it belong, and where was it? Telephones exist in every\ndistrict of Meurthe-et-Moselle. Besides, our army installed field\ntelephones which were not all destroyed at the time of their retreat. It\nis a most foolish pretext, yet where can one find a more stupid one than\nthis? A German official communique, in order to prove that the general\nrising of the people had been organized for a long time, declares, \"that\ndepots of arms were installed, where each rifle bore the name of the man\nfor whom it was intended.\" It is absolutely clear that this applies to\narms taken from civilians by order of the local authorities in Belgium\nand France, and deposited at the Town Hall, every weapon bearing the\nname of its owner. Would they have taken that for an arsenal? No, stupid\nas they may be, they are not so foolish as that. They feign stupidity\nsimply because they know very well that the conscience of the civilized\nworld is beginning to be moved.\n\n\n\n\nOUTRAGES ON WOMEN AND CHILDREN\n\n\nWe might write a long and heartbreaking chapter on this pitiful subject,\nbut let the following suffice. The Report of the French Commission of\nEnquiry concludes with these words, \"Outrages upon women and young girls\nhave been common _to an unheard-of extent_.\" No doubt the bulk of these\ncrimes will never come to light, for it needs a concatenation of special\ncircumstances for such acts to be committed in public. Unfortunately and\nonly too often these circumstances have existed, _e.g._, at\nBeton-Bazoches and Sancy-les-Provins, a young girl, and at St.\nDenis-les-Rebaix, a mother-in-law and a little boy of eight years old,\nand at Coulommiers a husband and two children, were witnesses to\noutrages committed on the mother of the family. Sometimes the attacks\nwere individual and sometimes committed by bodies of men, _e.g._, at\nMelen-Labouxhe, Margaret W. was violated by twenty German soldiers, and\nthen shot by the side of her father and mother. They did not even\nrespect nuns.[12]\n\nThey did not even spare grandmothers (Louppy-le-Chateau,\nVitry-en-Perthois...).\n\nNor did they respect children.... At Cirey, a witness (a University\nprofessor), whose statements one of us took down a few days after the\ntragedy, cried to a Bavarian officer, \"Have you no children in Germany?\"\nAll the officer said in reply was, \"My mother never bore swine like\nyou.\"\n\nNow and then they let themselves loose on a whole family; at Louppy, the\nmother and her two young girls aged thirteen and eight, respectively,\nwere simultaneous victims of their savagery.\n\nThe outrages sometimes lasted till death. At Nimy, the martyrdom of\nlittle Irma G. lasted six hours till death delivered her from her\nsufferings. When her father tried to rescue her he was shot, and her\nmother was seriously wounded. Indeed, it was certain destruction to any\nfrenzied parent who tried to defend his child. A clergyman of Dixmude\nsays, \"The burgomaster of Handzaeme was shot for trying to protect his\ndaughter.\" And how many other cases have occurred! We have not the heart\nto continue the list.\n\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[12] See the report of the French Commission (vol. i., page 35). See\nalso, in the \"Reply to the White Book,\" p. 500, the moving letter of\nCardinal Mercier to von Bissing: \"My conscience forbids my divulging to\nany tribunal the information, alas, only too well substantiated, which I\npossess. Outrages on nuns have been committed...\"\n\n\n\n\nKILLING THE WOUNDED\n\n\nThere are _great numbers_ of wounded who, on their solemn oath, have\nrelated how, when lying on the field of battle, they saw their wounded\ncomrades \"finished off\" by rifle or revolver shots, or by blows from\nbutt-ends, or by bayonet stabs, or kicked to death by German soldiers,\nnon-commissioned officers, and even by officers.[13]\n\nWe cannot pause to analyse these innumerable depositions. There is other\nevidence. How often, when a counter-attack has put us in possession of\nground lost the day before, have we found poor fellows \"finished\noff\"--with their throats cuts, as in the case of the two sergeants of\nthe 31st Chasseurs at the Pass of Sainte-Marie, or \"with their own\nbayonets driven into their mouths,\" like the poor little fellow of the\n17th. The enemy often runs amok like this:--\"On August 23rd, the Cure of\nRemereville tended Lieutenant Toussaint (who passed out first at the\nForestry School in July). When he fell in battle, this young officer was\nbayoneted by all the Germans who passed near him, and his body was a\nmass of wounds from head to feet.\" At Oudrigny \"a German officer met a\nFrench vehicle showing the Red Cross flag, and loaded with ten wounded.\nHe deployed his company, and fired two volleys at it.\" At Bonviller, an\nofficer murdered nine French wounded, stretched helpless in a barn, by\nshooting them through the ear. On 23rd August at Montigny-le-Tilleul, M.\nVital was caught in the act of tending a French soldier, L. Sohier by\nname, wounded in the head and side. Such a crime deserved punishment,\nand the wretches first shot the orderly and then the patient.\n\nAt Ethe they set a shed on fire and roasted more than twenty wounded who\nwere lying there.\n\nWe all know the celebrated order of General Stenger in the region of\nThiaville (Meurthe-et-Moselle):--\"No prisoners are to be taken. All\nprisoners, whether wounded or not, must be slaughtered.\"\n\nIt was not only in Lorraine that such orders were given. Listen to the\ndepositions of a German soldier: \"The same day we saw eighteen other\nFrenchmen. Lieutenant N. told us to shoot them as he did not know what\nelse to do with them.\"\n\nRead this letter found at L'Ecouvillon in a German trench which we\nrecaptured: \"Every day we take many prisoners, but they are shot at once\nas we no longer know where to put them.\"\n\nThink of the diary in which a German soldier near Peronne recorded his\nimpressions of the day: \"They lay in heaps of ten or twelve, some dead\nand some still living. Those who could still walk were marched off.\nThose who were wounded in the head or lungs, and could not lift\nthemselves up, were finished off with a bullet. That is the order which\nwe got.\"\n\nA German soldier, while being nursed in a hospital at Nancy, confided to\nDr. Roemer that the wound in his stomach \"had been inflicted on him by a\nGerman N.C.O. because he refused to finish off a wounded Frenchman.\"\n\nWounded were not only massacred on the field of battle, but field\nhospitals were also the scene of atrocities. At Gomery, in a casualty\nclearing station, under Dr. Sedillot, there were numerous wounded\nremaining in the German lines. A German officer with twenty-five men\nvisited the place and inspected it and retired, saying that all was in\norder. But a N.C.O. and a party of soldiers remained in the street\noutside. They were excited and kept shouting, \"It is war to the death,\"\nand making signs of cutting throats. They rushed in and with their\nrevolvers shot down Dr. Sedillot (who happily survived, with others, to\ngive evidence), and set fire to the place. Maddened by the flames, the\nwounded (many of whom had had amputations performed on them that very\nmorning) leapt from the windows on the first floor and fell into the\ngarden, where the executioners picked them up, gathering them in a\nbunch, and shot them. In this way Lieutenant Jeannin and Dr. Charette\nwere murdered, and from one hundred to one hundred and twenty officers\nand soldiers--whose wounds should have made them sacred--perished from\nshot or fire after terrible sufferings.\n\nWhen all is said, however, it is better to kill wounded soldiers by fire\nor sword than by starvation, as the following incident shows: One\nhundred wounded Frenchmen, together with Dr. <DW12>, were brought to the\nStenay barracks, and one hundred and eighty more came in shortly\nafterwards; the latter, having been left out unattended on the\nbattle-field for five days, were in a terrible condition. Dr. <DW12> in\nvain begged the Germans for help in getting the wounded men out of the\nambulances into the hospital. The Boches refused, and simply went on\nsucking their pipes. Though wounded himself, the doctor, with the aid of\ntwo male nurses (Frenchmen both), had to do the whole thing himself.\nFor several days the Boches gave them no food at all. \"Our poor fellows\nscreamed with hunger,\"[14] says the doctor, on oath, and adds, \"I had\nsixty badly wounded with me, and begged the German army doctor to\noperate, but he said he had no time. I then asked his leave to operate\nmyself, but his reply was, \"You are in the German lines, and must\nconform to our rules.\" The doctor ends his pathetic evidence with the\nwords, \"Nearly all these unhappy men died of neglect.\"\n\nWe have seen doctors, like Professor Vulpius, actually steal money; but\nof all the types of Boche doctors, the most hideous is the hero of the\nfollowing tale, taken from the deposition of Dr. <DW12>. \"A French\nsoldier, at Stenay, was under my treatment. He had a wound in his\nfoot--not very severe, which did not need an operation at all. What was\nmy astonishment to find that a German army surgeon had amputated his\nthigh? I could not help expressing my indignation, and the surgeon's\nonly reply was, \"He will be a man the less against us in the next\nwar.\"[15] They will deny these crimes to-morrow, but in 1914 they\ngloried in them.\n\nOn the 18th of October a Silesian newspaper published an article sent\nfrom the front by a N.C.O., in which he says, \"Men who are particularly\ntender-hearted give the French wounded the 'coup de grace' with a\nbullet, but the others cut and thrust as much as possible. Our enemies\nfought bravely... whether they are slightly or badly wounded our brave\nFusiliers spare the Fatherland as far as possible the expensive trouble\nof looking after numerous enemies. In the evening, with prayers of\nthanksgiving on our lips, we go to sleep.\" Are these mere boastings of\ncrimes? No. The article was submitted to the Captain of the Company who\ncertified it as correct and counter-signed it. The N.C.O., the Captain,\nthe Silesian public, the whole German nation were delighted to see this\nabominable story of murder and shame appear in the paper under the\nheading, \"A Day of Honour for our Regiment.\"[16]\n\n\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[13] Report of the French Commission, vol. iii.\n\n[14] He adds that certain orderlies--Lorrainers, belonging to the German\nArmy--supplied them with food on the sly.\n\n[15] French chivalry could hardly believe that a doctor would amputate a\nwounded enemy's limb without absolute necessity and in mere revenge, but\nsuch cases are, alas, not rare. See the awful tales of torture in the\n\"Journal d'un Grand Blesse en Allemagne,\" by Charles Hennebois (pp. 137,\n146), and the statement of a German doctor (p. 87), \"Your doctors in\nFrance perform amputations as they please on our wounded. The order has\ntherefore been given to amputate without hesitation, as reprisals, every\ndamaged limb.\"\n\n[16] Let us quote, to show the mental \"make-up\" of certain Germans, the\nconditions in which Captain Coustre of the 108th and Captain Lesourd of\nthe 50th met their deaths. They were wandering over the battle-field\nwhere the enemy had been repulsed. They heard a cry for help. There was\na soldier in one place and an officer in another who asked for a drink.\nThey stopped and leant over them to give them a drink from their flasks\nwhen the wounded men blew their brains out.\n\n\n\n\nSHELTERING BEHIND WOMEN\n\n\nLet us call to mind the innumerable instances when the Boches put up\ntheir hands, or waved a white flag, and cried, \"Kamerad,\" pretending to\nsurrender: thus drawing our unsuspecting men towards them and then\nsuddenly moving aside, to leave the field open to a party of riflemen or\na machine-gun hidden away behind them. These are the tricks of cowards,\nwhich were constantly employed at the beginning of the war, and our men\n(at the cost of many victims) learned at last to guard against them. But\nthey have done even more cowardly things than this. There was the German\nofficer who, to protect himself from danger while taking observations,\nput three children round him. At Nery, twenty-five persons, women and\nchildren, were compelled to walk at the side of a Boche column to\nprotect it from being enfiladed. Near Malines, six German soldiers who\nwere taking with them five young girls, on meeting a Belgian patrol,\nplaced the girls all round them to prevent the enemy from firing. At\nJodoigne they put a Cure in front of them and made him walk with his\narms folded, and they did the same at Hougaerde to another Cure who was\nkilled. A similar fate befell several civilians at Mons. At Senlis, our\nmen were firing to cover our retreat, and the Germans took some\ninhabitants out of the houses and made them walk in the middle of the\nstreets while they themselves kept along by the walls. Many of these\nunfortunate people were killed. \"In numerous places,\" says the Belgian\nCommission of Enquiry, \"the Germans made civilians--men and women--walk\nin front of them.\" In this way a German column passed through\nMarchienne, pushing ahead of them a body of several hundred civilians.\nThey took the road for Montigny-le-Tilleul, where the first important\nbattle with the French forces took place. At Sempst, during the fighting\non the 25th August, men and women were placed in the front rank of the\nfiring line. At Erpe, on the 12th September, a German column, attacked\nby a Belgian motor-machine-gun, took out of the houses twenty to\ntwenty-five men and young people (including a child of thirteen), and\nmade them walk in front in the middle of the road. The machine-gunners,\nseeing civilians in front of them, ceased firing. At Alost, a German\ncompany attacked the bridge. In front marched some thirty civilians with\na machine-gun hidden behind them. At Nimy, with the butt-ends of their\nrifles, they drove in front of them 500 men, women and children towards\nthe English, who in consequence dared not fire; and in this way the 84th\nand 85th Schleswig Regiments were able to continue their heroic march as\nfar as Maubeuge.\n\nWhen their adversary cannot actually see the human shield that they are\nusing, they send a warning. On the 7th September, 1914, the Death's Head\nHussars shut up all the inhabitants of the village with them in the\nChateau of Saint Ouen-sur-Morin, and then, to avoid being shelled,\ninformed the English of their \"dispositions.\" They fired on anyone who\ntried to escape. At Mouzon, we saw a number of civilians being pushed in\nfront of the enemy with the butt-ends of rifles, and we stopped firing.\nThe wretched people moved suddenly to one side of the road, uncovering\nthe Germans, and then we fired. The Boches, furious, fired their first\nvolley not at us, but point blank at these non-combatants, who were\ndecimated.\n\nThe cowards chiefly used civilians as shields, but sometimes they also\nmade use of prisoners. At Keyem, they pushed one hundred Belgian\nsoldiers in front of them, some with their hands tied, and others with\ntheir arms in the air. At Dixmude, they advanced under the shelter of\nforty disarmed marines who had been taken prisoners. When they got in\nfront of our lines our marines shouted, \"For God's sake fire, these are\nGermans,\" and these heroes fell gloriously under the French bullets.\nSuch deeds are countless.\n\nThe Boches will deny them later on, but in 1914 they did not deny them,\nbut rather gloried in them as a \"good idea.\" We can see this from the\nletter of the Bavarian Lieutenant Eberlein, published on the 7th\nOctober, 1914, by a leading Munich paper, \"We had arrested three other\ncivilians when a 'good idea' struck me. We made them sit on chairs in\nthe middle of the street;--supplications from them, and blows with\nbutt-ends of rifles from us. At last they were seated outside in the\nstreet with their hands convulsively clasped together. I felt sorry for\nthem, but the plan worked at once. As I learnt later, the regiment which\nentered Saint-Die, further to the north of us, had precisely similar\nexperiences to our own. The civilians, whom they had put in the same\nway in the middle of the street, were killed by French bullets. I saw\ntheir dead bodies.\"[17]\n\n\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[17] We have not, so far, come across any attempted justification, by\nGerman authors, of these cowardly acts; but such we shall have without\nfail. It is probable that the 93 \"intellectuals\" whose manifesto we\nrecall to memory a few pages further on are preparing a fresh \"appeal to\nthe civilized world\" with a view to explaining that the German\ntroops--the representatives and trustees of _Kultur_--are authorised by\nGod Himself to use _every means_ for the protection of their precious\nlives.\n\n\n\n\nMARTYRDON OF CIVILIAN PRISONERS\n\n\nAfter having burnt our villages,[18] and shot the inhabitants by dozens\nin some places, and by hundreds in others, they frequently deported all\nor a part of the survivors to Germany. It is impossible at this moment\nto establish the number of those deported, but they were sent off by\ntens of thousands. These unfortunate people, men, women and children,\nwho had witnessed and survived fires and massacres, who had seen their\nhouses blazing and so many of those dear to them fall under the bullets\nof the assassin, and who were forced in some places to dig graves for\ntheir victims, and in others to hold a light for the executioners while\nthey were finishing off the wounded,--these poor wretches are despatched\nto Germany.[19] What a journey, and what a place of residence!\n\nLet us quote one story among a thousand. \"Our escort was commanded by\ntwo German officers. They were unapproachable. Anyone who tried to speak\nto them was threatened with a revolver. In order that we might get a\ndrink, we were made to collect empty meat tins which served as our\ndrinking cups until we reached Cassel. We were abused and threatened\nwherever we went. Sometimes they made signs to us that they were going\nto shoot us, or hang us, or cut our heads off. They threw filth at our\nheads and spat in our faces. We were not going to stoop before them; the\ndisgrace was not ours. It is they, not we, who are degraded. An officer\nwho was present when our march-past took place aimed blows with a\nriding-whip at everyone within his reach. Until we arrived at the\nrailway, it was the same at every place where we met soldiers.\n\n### Summary:"}

I have used it   |\n  | constantly, in shirt manufacturing as well as family sewing, |\n  | sixteen years. My wife ran it four years, and earned between |\n  |   $700 and $800, besides doing her housework. I have never   |\n  |  expended fifty cents on it for repairs. It is, to-day, in   |\n  |   the best of order, stitching fine linen bosoms nicely. I   |\n  | started manufacturing shirts with this machine, and now have |\n  | over one hundred of them in use. I have paid at least $3,000 |\n  |  for the stitching done by this old machine, and it will do  |\n  |              as much now as any machine I have.              |\n  |                                                              |\n  |                         W.F.

MICHAEL LADLE and ARCHIBALD BLINKSOP were interrupted in their\nconversation by BELINDA, who sent off the former under pretence that the\ncroquet players were waiting for him, or, as she expressed it, it was\n\"his turn to mallet.\"\n\nAs soon as he was fairly out of sight, she turned to ARCHIBALD, and\nsaid; \"Come with me.\"\n\n\"What for?\" said ARCHIBALD, as she seized him by the arm and hurried him\ninto the shrubbery. \"Recollect,\" he added, \"that I am an orphan, with a\nconstitution never robust.\"\n\nShe made no reply till they were screened from observation.\n\n\"You needn't be afraid, you little fool,\" she said. \"Sit down on that\nstump.\"\n\nARCHIBALD tremblingly obeyed her.\n\nShe imprisoned his fluttering hand in hers, and smoothed his hair\nreassuringly.\n\n\"ARCHIE,\" she murmured; \"_dear_ ARCHIE.\"\n\n\"Oh, don't, _don't_ talk that way,\" said ARCHIBALD. \"You make me afraid\nof you.\"\n\n\"Afraid!\" she returned. \"And of _me_? Oh cruel, cruel ARCHIBALD. Is it\nfor this that I have passed many a sleepless night, awaking unrefreshed\nwith haggard orbs? Is it for this that I've pined away and refused meat\nvictuals?\"\n\nShe paused. Her heart was beating violently. She took from her pocket a\ncopy of the _Ledger_, adjusted her eye-glasses, and continued:\n\n\"ARCHIBALD BLINKSOP, for weeks I have basked in the sunlight of your\nexistence. Your celestial smile, shedding a tranquil calm o'er my\nperturbed spirit, has been my daily sustenance. Your ethereal form,\nbeautiful as an houri, has, with its subtle fascination, enthralled and\nsteeped in bliss my innermost soul, lifting me as it were into a purer,\na holier existence. Your--\"\n\n\"Oh-h,\" moaned the wretched ARCHIBALD, \"_please_ stop. That's COBB, Jr.\nI _know_ it is. When I was sea-sick on the canal, they read a chapter to\nme just like that, instead of giving me an emetic, and I was out of my\nhead all next day.\"\n\n\"But you _do_ love me, don't you, ARCHIBALD?--just a very small\nfragment, you know.\"\n\nShe seized him by the ear and kissed him twice.\n\n\"Come, own up now,\" said she, \"that from the first moment you saw me,\nyou have felt a sort of a spooney hankering, and a general looseness,\nincluding a desire to write poetry and use hair-oil, and wear pretty\nneckties; a sort of a feeling that your clothes don't fit you, and you\ncan't bear the sight of gravy, and dote on lavender kids, and want to\npart your hair in the middle. _That's_ being in love, ARCHIE. That's--\"\n\nAt this juncture voices were heard calling for ARCHIBALD.\n\n\"Oh, do, _do_ let me go,\" he pleaded.\n\nBELINDA grasped him firmly by the collar. \"Heaven knows,\" said she\nimpressively, \"that I have wooed you thus far in a spirit of the most\ndelicate consideration. Now, I mean business, I want a husband, and by\nthe Sixteenth Amendment, you don't stir from this spot, until you\npromise to marry me!\"\n\n\"But--but--I don't want to get married,\" said ARCHIBALD; \"I--I--ain't\nold enough.\"\n\nShe glared at him menacingly.\n\n\"Am I to understand then,\" she shrieked, \"that you dare refuse me?\" And\nshe laughed hysterically.\n\n\"Oh, no, no. I wouldn't. Of course I wouldn't,\" groaned the ghastly\nyouth. \"I'll promise _anything_, if you'll only let me go.\"\n\n\nThus it was, mid the hushed repose of that lovely June twilight, while\nall Nature seemed to pronounce a sweet benediction, that these loving\nhearts commingled. The soft hum of the June-bug seemed to have a sweeter\nsound, and the little fly walked unmolested across their foreheads, for\nthey were betrothed.\n\n\nCHAPTER THIRD.\n\nWHERE THE WOODBINE TWINETH.\n\nNotwithstanding the thrilling events enacted near by, that modest\nproduction of Nature, the woodbine, still continued to twine in all its\npristine virginity. And meanwhile, JEFFRY MAULBOY is at the appointed\nrendezvous, waiting for ANN BRUMMET.\n\nShe comes.\n\nBut why that glazed expression, and that convulsive twitching of the\nlips?\n\nShe is chewing gum.\n\n\"Hilloa, JEFF,\" said she. \"Mean thing. Been here a whole day, and not a\nsingle word about my new overskirt. How does it hang behind?\"\n\nWhat reply does this cruel, this heartless man make?\n\nHe took a chew of tobacco, and said:\n\n\"Oh, bother your overskirt. Is that the'something very particular' you\nwanted to see me for?\"\n\n\"Oh no,\" she replied; \"I forgot.\" She looked cautiously round, and\nadded:\n\n\"Say, JEFF, folks are talking about us awfully.\"\n\n\"Let 'em talk,\" was the rejoinder.\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" she replied. \"Of course _you_ don't care. The more a man is\ntalked about the better he likes it, and the more he's thought of. But\nit's death to a woman.\"\n\n\"Well, I don't care any way,\" said JEFFRY.\n\n\"Yes you do care too,\" she replied. S'posen it should get to the ears of\nthat rich widow you're engaged to. 'Twould be all up with you _there_,\nsure, JEFF. She ain't burdened with principle, the Lord knows, but she's\ngot jealousy enough to break the match short off, and kill you besides,\nif she hears of it.\n\n\"And she'll hear of it anyhow, if they keep up their infernal clack,\"\nsaid he fiercely. \"I'd like to choke the whole confounded pack.\"\n\n\"The talk would all die out,\" said ANN slowly, \"if I should go away.\"\n\n\"Any fool can see that,\" replied he. \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I've been thinking of going,\" she continued, \"for six months. I'm a\npoor relation, and Mrs. LADLE hates me. And as for BELINDA, she has so\nmany good clothes, I can't take any comfort seeing her round.\"\n\n\"Where to?\" inquired JEFFRY incredulously.\n\n\"Oh, anywhere,\" she replied. \"I can dance a jig, you know. I'll go to\nNew York, and let myself as the 'Eminent and Graceful Queen of\nTerpsichore, imported from Paris at a cost of Forty Thousand Dollars in\nGold.' And then I'll make a tour of the New England States. Or I'll\nlearn to play the banjo and get off slang phrases, and then I'll appear\nas 'The Beautiful and Gifted Artist, ANNETTA BRUMMETTA, who has, by her\nguileless vivacity, charmed our most Fashionable Circles.' Or I'll go as\nAssistant Teacher in a Select Boarding School for Young Ladies. I ain't\nproud, you know.\"\n\nJEFFRY grinned. \"Let me advise you,\" said he, \"to go right off\nto-morrow. I'll help you pack your trunk inside of an hour, if you say\nso.\"\n\n\"That ain't the point,\" she retorted sharply. \"I ain't got rid of so\neasily as _that_, I tell you.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by that?\" he inquired, with a scowl.\n\n\"I mean just this,\" she returned. \"I won't go at all if you don't do\nwhat's right by me. If you'll agree to my terms I'll go, and not\nwithout.\"\n\n\"Your _terms_!\" said he, with a sneer. \"Well, that _is_ a go. What may\nyour 'terms' be?\" he continued, derisively.\n\n\"Marriage,\" replied she; \"private if you say so, and a remittance of\nfifty dollars a month for six months.\"\n\nHe laughed in her face. \"Marry _you_? Well, I guess not,\" said he. \"Do\nyou take me for an idiot?\"\n\n\"You ain't obliged to stick by it,\" she continued. \"We're in Indiana,\nain't we? We'll take a minister and a lawyer along with us. While the\nminister is marrying us, the lawyer can be at work on the divorce\npapers. When you are JEFFRY MAULBOY again, a single man, and I'm once\nmore ANN BRUMMET. spinster, I'll go away and never trouble you again.\nThere's no risk. I go in ANN BRUMMET, and come out ANN BRUMMET, all\ninside of two hours, and there's nobody to tell of it. The lawyer and\nminister are used to it, you see, and the secret's safe with _them_.\"\n\nJEFFRY MAULBOY took an unusually large chew of tobacco, and thought it\nall over.\n\n\"I won't do it,\" he finally said.\n\n\"All right, then,\" she replied; \"I'll write to Mrs. CUPID and tell her\nthe whole story, and I'll stay here besides. It'll be hard enough on me\nfor a while if I go, and harder still if I stay; but I'll do it to\n_spite you_. I'll break off your match with Mrs. CUPID if I _do_ stay,\nnow mark my words.\"\n\nJEFFRY MAULBOY walked back and forth, and emitted the choicest string\nof curses that his extensive and valuable collection enabled him to\ncull. At last he stopped in front of her, and said savagely:\n\n\"I'll do it. But if you ever lisp a word to any living soul till I'm\nsafely married to CUPID, I'll kill you, dead sure. Do you hear that?\"\n\n\"When and how is the thing to be done?\" he growled again.\n\n\"The sooner the better,\" was ANN'S reply. \"If you don't hear from me by\nto-morrow noon, go to the Half-way House at Forney's Crag. That's all\n_you've_ got to do. I'll have the lawyer and minister both there.\n_You'd_ better be there too. That's all I say.\"\n\nAlone in his room, JEFFRY admitted that ANN had been too smart for him.\n\n\"And I'm mighty afraid that, somehow or other, the old she-dragon will\nget the best of me yet in this infernal business,\" he soliloquized.\n\"Anyhow, I'll sleep on it,\" and he went to bed.\n\nHe got up in the morning, firmly resolved to break his engagement with\nANN.\n\n\"She was only bluffing me last night,\" he said. \"She daren't tell\nCUPID.\" But he didn't feel easy for all that.\n\nAfter breakfast he took his hat and started out.\n\n\"Where are you bound, JEFF?\" inquired ARCHIBALD.\n\n\"Anywhere,\" was the reply. \"Come along.\"\n\nJEFFRY was awful dull company, so Archibald thought. He took very large\nchews of tobacco, and expectorated freely into the eyes of the small\nboys whom they chanced to meet, and if he didn't make a good shot, he\nswore awfully. Once he went away across a field on purpose to kick a\nvery small dog, and ARCHIBALD waited for him.\n\n\"Why, JEFFRY,\" said ARCHIBALD, \"what ails you? You're awfully down in\nthe mouth this morning.\"\n\n\"And so you'd be if you was in my boots,\" was the reply.\n\nAnd then he up and told ARCHIBALD the whole story.\n\nThe latter was so thoroughly dumbfounded that a decently-smart boy could\nhave blown him over without any apparent effort.\n\n\"Why, JEFF,\" said he, \"only to think of it. Ain't it awful? And ANN\nBRUMMET, too; ain't I glad it ain't me, though.\"\n\n\"That's no way to console a fellow, you fool,\" said JEFFRY. \"You'd\nbetter offer to help me out of the scrape.\"\n\n\"Why, so I will, of course,\" said ARCHIBALD. \"If I hadn't saved your\nlife, of course you wouldn't have got into it; and so I feel bound, you\nknow, to see you out of it. What shall I do?\"\n\n\"Why, just go over to the Half-way House, and tell ANN I can't come.\nTell her I've got the small-pox, or broke my leg, or my old man's\ndying--or anything, so that she understands I can't come.\"\n\n\"You'd better give me a letter,\" said ARCHIBALD, \"and I'll slip it under\nher door and run off. I never could remember all that, I should be so\nflustered, you know.\"\n\n\"No,\" replied JEFFRY, \"I shan't give you any letter. I ain't fool enough\nto commit myself to any woman in black and white.\"\n\n\"Well,\" replied ARCHIBALD drearily, \"just as you say. Oh, what a knowing\nman the Hon. MICHAEL is! He said you'd make me pay that debt of saving\nyour life, sooner or later, and it's turned out sooner. But I'll go,\nJEFFRY, if I can get away from BELINDA. She tags me round everywhere,\nand wants to court me all the time. Ain't it dreadful? What time shall I\ngo?\"\n\n\"Three o'clock,\" answered JEFFRY. \"Tell her I'd come if I could but I\ncan't _anyhow_. Be sure and tell her _that_, and anything else you've a\nmind to.\"\n\n(To be continued.)\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPIGEON ENGLISH.\n\nCertainly newspaper writers are given to making very remarkable\nstatements. In describing General CHANGARNIER, a newspaper lately\ninformed us that \"he stoops his head, which is sprinkled over with a few\ngray hairs when walking.\" Now, if the general's head be sprinkled when\nwalking, we may fairly infer that the gray hairs, unless brushed off,\nremain upon it when it stands still. We are additionally mystified by\nthe further statement--still with reference to the same officer--that\n\"he enjoys the personal demeanor of the French people to a remarkable\ndegree.\" This we are very much delighted to hear, although we have not\nthe slightest idea what it means.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCorroborative.\n\nA late item of war news states that \"the Prussians have advanced to\nDole,\" while from several other sources we learn that the Prussians have\ncome to Grief.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPUNCHINELLO CORRESPONDENCE\n\nANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.\n\n_Ambergris_.--Can you give me the motto of the City of Strasbourg?\n\n_Answer_.--We cannot at this moment recall the Flemish version of it,\nbut it means, in English, \"We make our own Pies.\"\n\n_Katrina Shwachenzittern_. We have had some difficulty in deciphering\nyour manuscript. Your grievance, however, seems to be that one of your\nboarders, an Alsatian, keeps a ten-pound brass cannon in his bedroom,\nand fires a grand salvo with it whenever a French victory is announced.\nThis, of course, is very foolish. The best way of putting a stop to it\nwould be for your German boarders to keep guns of even larger calibre in\ntheir rooms, and fire the Frenchman down. You will then have a perfect\nright to charge all your boarders for extra fires.\n\n_Ney_.--Please explain two things about the war. First: How did the\nMobile Guard come to leave Mobile? Second: Is _Francs-Tireurs_ the\nFrench for FRANK BUTLER'S black-and-tan terriers?\n\n_Answer_.--We cannot perceive much difference between NEY and BRAY.\n\n_Artichoke_.--You are mistaken in supposing total deafness to be an\nindispensable qualification in a candidate for the position of prompter\nto a theatre.\n\n_Flippertygibbet_.--How is the belligerent attitude of the Russian Bear\nlikely to affect the New York money market?\n\n_Answer_.--Turn a rushin' bear into any market, and see what the result\nwill be.\n\n_Paterfamilias_.--I am the unhappy father of three brace of twins, and\nwish to dispose of one out of each brace.

In\nEurope it is the usage for Crowned Heads and their families, only, to\neat sausages with their turkey; and, if ever the true story of the Man\nwith the Iron Mask comes to be unveiled, it is more than likely that the\nmystery will be found to hinge upon that fact.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA PRESIDENTIAL FLOUT.\n\nAccording to the Washington special despatches to the _Philadelphia\nInquirer_, the President has tendered a Cabinet appointment to several\ndistinguished members of the Union League of that city. Either from\nexcessive modesty, however, or, as is probable, from prudent doubts as\nto their ability to fill the position, all of these gentlemen have\ndeclined to accept the offer.\n\nIt is surmised that the object of the President's recent visit to\nPhiladelphia (ostensibly to see his old friend, Mr. BORIE), was to\nexamine the roll of the League, comprising two thousand members, for the\npurpose of selecting one who might serve on a pinch to fill the office\nin question.\n\nThis was a bitter stroke of satire on the part of Mr. GRANT, since it is\ngenerally understood in Philadelphia, that, outside the ranks of the\nMutual Admiration Society to which we have referred, there are no brains\nto be found among the Republicans of Philadelphia.\n\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA Bubble of Air.\n\nWhat is the most favorable sort of weather for ballooning?\n\n_Highly_ favorable weather.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n[Illustration: THE THREE CENTS.\n\nAn Incident both Dramatic and True.\n\nSLINEY, OF SWAMPVILLE, COMES TO THE CITY.

We merely speak of it for the purpose of mentioning that city's\nlast contribution to mankind, of this kind. They have a hotel there\nwhich advertises through the seductive fly-pages of our magazines in the\nfollowing terms: \"Courtesy to strangers is a marked feature in the\nmanagement of--\"\n\nBut we remember in time that we have no right to interfere with the\nadvertising columns. However, it is a fact that there is a hotel in\nAmerica where courtesy to guests is a feature, and of course a marked\none. It is a cheering fact, and especially so just now, in this early\nfall, when we are all smarting with the fresh memories of our summer's\nsufferings at the hands of the hotel proprietors, their head clerks, and\nthe rest of the rapacious crew. What an attractive picture it presents!\nA hotel where guests are treated with courtesy! Really, if anything\ncould seduce us into making a visit to Boston, the desire to actually\nwitness this surprising innovation upon our national customs would prove\ntoo strong for the reverential fear which keeps us distant worshippers\nof that American Mecca.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOdious Comparison.\n\n\"She is a gem,\" remarked Mr. JENKINSOP, speaking of his red-haired wife.\n\n\"Yes--a diamond of many carats,\" was the low rejoinder of JENKINSOP'S\nfriend, WINKLESOP.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nROYAL DEMOCRACY.\n\nIt appears to have been decided that one of the royal princesses of\nEngland can be allowed to marry, without being obliged to find some\nroyal prince for that purpose. Perhaps this course has been discovered\nto be possible from the fact that the stock of royal princes is getting\nshort in Europe. Prussia has gobbled up any number of German ones, and\nbids fair to do so with the rest. But we prefer to think that this\ninnovation is really due to the women's rights movement. Their platform\nis broad enough for the entire sex to stand on, and why should a\nprincess, from the unfortunate accident of her birth, be debarred her\nnatural right to fall in love with the man of her choice, and to marry\nthe man she loves. At any rate we commend this change of policy to the\nleaders of the women's rights party, as a proof of the success their\nmovement has gained, and advise them to send a series of congratulatory\nresolutions to the princess in question, upon her gaining her\nunquestioned right to consult her heart rather than a Lord Chancellor in\nthe bestowal of her hand.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAn Anecdote from Salt Lake.\n\nA GYPSY came to BRIGHAM YOUNG with a pony for sale.\n\n\"Why, the beast is half-starved,\" said BRIGHAM, running his hand over\nthe pony's side. \"You can count his ribs.\"\n\n\"That's more'n a chap could do with yours,\" retorted the gypsy.\n\nBRIGHAM YOUNG did not buy that pony.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNATURAL HISTORY IN OUR PARKS.\n\nNo greater tribute has yet been paid to the already improved condition\nof our city parks under the new _regime_, than the arrival in them of\nstrange birds by which they had not hitherto been patronized. Within a\nfew days past several owls have been captured in the solemn pines with\nwhich these delightful retreats have lately been made green, if not\nshady. The owl, as is well known, was regarded by the ancients as the\nBird of Wisdom. He fully sustained his right to the title by letting\nseverely alone the city parks while they were still dreary and\ndisgusting wastes. The only night-birds by which these were, then\noccupied were of the featherless (and apparently motherless) kind, and\nwere well known to the police. They were quite as watchful, it is true,\nas the genuine feathered owl that has just commenced to give its very\nextraordinary countenance to the parks, but then it was with other\npeople's watches, not their own. It is with much concern that we hear\nreports of the slaughter of some of these solemn but beautiful owls that\nhave come to ventilate their wisdom among us. The reports in question\nwere very definite and unmistakable, most of them proceeding from\nrevolvers handled by members of the Municipal Police Force, while others\nemanated from the barrels of shot-guns wielded by beery Teutons, who\nrushed frantically out from their sawdust lairs when they were told that\nthe game was up--that is, that an owl was up a tree. This was scurvy\ntreatment for the visitors. To \"put a head on\" an owl, which is already\nprovided with one so large and so comical, appears to be a work both\nsuperfluous and inhuman. The only apology for it in this instance is,\nthat these night-birds of prey were supposed by the police to have been\nattracted to the parks by the prospect of succulent suppers on the very\nwell-fed sparrows by which these resorts are now thickly tenanted. The\nowls hooted at this notion; but their hooting was only answered by\nshooting, and the poor foolish Birds of Wisdom have been stuffed with\ntow instead of sparrows, and set up to form the nucleus of an\nornithological Rogues' Gallery in the City Hall.\n\nOn visiting the Battery a few days ago, one of the park-keepers (himself\nlooking in his bright new uniform somewhat like a blue-jay) expressed\nhis conviction that, next spring, that time-honored pleasure-garden of\nthe old Knickerbockers will be a paradise for song-birds such as it has\nnot been since the original Swedish Nightingale warbled her \"woodnotes\nwild\" there a score of years ago, more or less. The sea-gulls, he\nthought (will Judge HILTON have the goodness to provide these park\nofficers with manuals of ornithology?), would build their nests in the\npine-trees with which the wide esplanade that stretches away to the\nwater's edge will soon be bristling. Honest, but mistaken young man! As\nwell might he have said that the sea-wall [a very substantial one, by\nthe way] would build its nest in the melancholy pines. But it is\nreasonable to hope that pine grossbeaks will find their way thither, and\nthat the German flutes of various finches will provide for the coming\nBavarians and Hessians (should any be left after the siege of Paris and\nthe _sorties_ of the truculent TROCHU) a welcome such as has not\nheretofore been accorded to the strangers who at Castle Garden first set\nfoot upon our shore.\n\nThe Bowling Green--late a nuisance and a pandemonium, now an oasis of\nverdure--has not as yet reported its owl, but the public eye is upon it,\nand the nocturnal marauder may yet be detected in the forks of the great\nwillow-trees, which still retain their verdure. The sparrows are almost\ndisproportionately numerous in this small park, but this may be\naccounted for. It has lately been laid down with new grass, the green,\ntender blades of which, just now beginning to crop out, are probably\nmistaken by the birds for \"sparrow-grass\" munificently provided for them\nby the Commissioners.\n\nIn all of these city parks the contrast between past and present is very\nstriking and agreeable. But a few short months ago they were the\ndomiciles and dormitories of outcast roughs and vagrants of the worst\ndescription, whose \"'owls,\" as a Cockney explorer observed, \"made night\n'ideous.\" The only muss now common to them is the _mus_ tribe,\ncomprising the _mus ratus_, or ordinary rat (so called from its haunting\nordinaries, we suppose), and the timid mouse, with which the Bird of\nWisdom is contented to put up when the sparrows decline to come to his\nclaw.\n\nCentral Park offers numerous attractions now to all who love to keep up\ntheir animal spirits by studying animal life. There is a fat little\nAsiatic pig there, who is the very picture of content. A red pig he is,\nand exceedingly well behaved. The best red pig, in fact, that we\nremember ever to have seen, beating the learned pig by several trumps\nand an ace. When we last saw him he was very busy with his pen, and our\nsurmise was that his mind was fully occupied with arrangements for\nediting the works of BACON, or, possibly, those of HOGG.\n\nThe young elephant has increased immensely, since last year, in stature\nand girth. He is remarkably neat in his person, wisping himself all over\nwith hay for hours at a time. Whether he does this for cleanliness or to\nobtain a flavor of elephant for the hay is doubtful, however, for he\nalways eats it after having made use of it as a flesh-brush for a good\nwhile. Notices requesting visitors \"not to feed or annoy the animals\"\nare posted on the compartments. In the case of the elephant, though, it\nmight be as well also to caution persons against making jokes about his\ntrunk--a low kind of ribaldry in which every carpet-bagger, who never\nhad one, seems to think himself bound to indulge.\n\nThere is a cinnamon bear in one of the outside cages, whose claws remind\none sharply that cinnamon and cloves go together, and that clove is a\ntense of the verb \"to cleave.\" But we do not want such a fellow as that\nto cleave to us, since it is evident that a grocer kind of brute than a\ncinnamon bear cannot be found in all the ursine family. \"Sugar and\nspice, and all things nice,\" are stated in song to be the materials that\n\"little girls are made of,\" but if we thought that cinnamon bear figured\nupon the list of groceries thus used for modelling young maidens, we\nwould either fly to the desert with Dr. MARY WALKER or immure ourselves\nin a nunnery with SUSAN B. ANTHONY, and all the other females of the\nanti-sugar-and-spice persuasion.\n\nFattest of all the beasts in the Central Park collection is the larger\nof the two grizzly bears. From the easy way in which he takes life, he\nreminds one of a successful politician, who had worked his way up from\nbeing a slim and impecunious \"repeater\" to the position of Alderman, or\nCustom House official, and President of the Fat Men's Club. There is a\ndrunken leer in this beast's eye, an inebriate roll in all his\nmovements, that lead one mechanically to peer into the darkness of his\nden with the view of seeing what the Bar fixings are like. It would be a\nrare freak to treat the huge fellow to a cask of rum and sugar, and then\nstand by with a comic artist, and take down for PUNCHINELLO the traits\nof BRUIN the Grizzly on a \"<DW12>,\" and with all his repressed nature\nbrought out by the strong drink.\n\n\"Carnivorium\" is the word now properly applied by the Park authorities\nto the establishment in which the wild beasts are kept. That is, the\nterm will be correct when applied only to the particular department\nallotted to the fierce flesh-devouring animals. At present camels are\naccommodated in the Carnivorium, and so are cows, which is a sort of\nslur upon the habits of these poor innocent vegetarians. The new word,\nhowever, is likely to find considerable extension, and if any provider\nfor the public maw should choose hereafter to call his dining-saloon a\nCarnivorium, none would have a right to cavil at him on philological\ngrounds, at least.\n\nBy and by the Park will have a new and sensational attraction. The\nantediluvian monsters of that great FRANKENSTEIN of the period, Mr.\nWATERHOUSE HAWKINS, will soon be advanced enough to \"give fits\" to the\nnursery-maids and their tender charges. Accipitrine in features as in\nname, Mr. HAWKINS is a living illustration of the Darwinian theory.\nCertainly his remote ancestors must have been of the falcon family. He\nrevels in birds; though, when he cannot obtain those, he can put up with\nlizards, which he usually prefers manufactured, and of a length not less\nthan from sixty to one hundred feet. This reminds us that a saurian of a\nhundred feet should not be confounded with a centipede.\n\nIt will be seen, then, that the landscape-gardens of our great city are\nin a fair way of being able to afford some illustrations for students of\nNatural History more interesting than the oyster-shells and old boots\nwith which most of them have hitherto been stocked.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFRUIT FOR BALLOONISTS.

{"original_length": 23935, "trunc_length": 16000, "text": "\n\nSummarize the following text into a summary of less than 800 words.\n### Text:\n\nProduced by Juliet Sutherland, Leonard D Johnson and PG Distributed\nProofreaders\n\n\n\n\n\nVERSE AND PROSE\n\nFOR\n\nBEGINNERS IN READING\n\n\n\n\n\n_SELECTED FROM ENGLISH AND AMERICAN LITERATURE_\n\n1893\n\n\n\n\n\nPREFACE.\n\n\nThe attentive reader of this little book will be apt to notice very soon\nthat though its title is _Verse and Prose for Beginners in Reading_,\nthe verse occupies nine tenths, the prose being confined to about two\nhundred proverbs and familiar sayings--some of them, indeed, in\nrhyme--scattered in groups throughout the book. The reason for this will\nbe apparent as soon as one considers the end in view in the preparation\nof this compilation.\n\nThe _Riverside Primer and Reader_, as stated in its Introduction, \"is\ndesigned to serve as the sole text-book in reading required by a pupil.\nWhen he has mastered it he is ready to make the acquaintance of the\nworld's literature in the English tongue.\" In that book, therefore, the\npupil was led by easy exercises to an intelligent reading of pieces of\nliterature, both verse and prose, so that he might become in a slight\ndegree familiar with literature before he parted with his sole\ntext-book. But the largest space had, of necessity, to be given to\npractice work, which led straight to literature, indeed, though to a\nsmall quantity only. The verse offered in that book was drawn from\nnursery rhymes and from a few of the great masters of poetical form; the\nprose was furnished by a selection of proverbs, some of the simplest\nfolk stories, and two passages, closing the book, from the Old and New\nTestaments.\n\nThe pupil, upon laying down his _Primer and Reader_ and proposing to\nenter the promised land of literature, could find a volume of prose\nconsisting of _Fables and Folk Stories_, into the pleasures of which he\nhad already been initiated; but until now he could find no volume of\npoetry especially prepared for him which should fulfill the promise of\nthe verse offered to him in his _Primer and Reader_. Be it remembered\nthat he was not so much to read verse written expressly for him, as to\noverhear the great poets when they sang so simply, so directly, and yet\nwith so penetrating a note that the burden of their song, full, it may\nbe, to the child's elders, would have an awakening power for the child\nhimself. As so often said, a child can receive and delight in a poem\nthrough the ear long before he is able to attain the same pleasure\nthrough the eye; and there are many poems in such a book, for example,\nas Miss Agnes Repplier's _A Book of Famous Verse_, wholly delightful for\na child to listen to which yet it would be impossible for him to read to\nhimself.\n\nThe agreeable task of the editor, therefore, was to search English and\nAmerican literature for those poems which had fallen from the lips of\npoets with so sweet a cadence and in such simple notes that they would\noffer but slight difficulties to a child who had mastered the rudiments\nof reading. It was by no means necessary that such poems should have had\nan audience of children in mind nor have taken childhood for a subject,\nthough it was natural that a few of the verses should prove to be\nsuggested by some aspect of child-life. The selection must be its own\nadvocate, but it may be worth while to point out that the plan of the\nbook supposes an easy approach to the more serious poems by means of the\nlight ditties of the nursery; that there is no more reason for depriving\na child of honest fun in his verse than there is for condemning the\nchild's elders to grave poetry exclusively; and that it is not necessary\nor even desirable for a poem to come at once within the reader's\ncomprehension. To take an extreme case, Tennyson's lines \"Break, Break,\nBreak!\" would no doubt be ruled out of such a book as this by many in\nsympathy with children; yet the unexplainable power of the poem is not\nbeyond the apprehension of sensitive natures at an early age.\n\nThe contents have been gleaned from a number of sources, and the editor\nis glad to mingle with the names of the secure dwellers on Parnassus\nthose of some living Americans and Englishmen. He does not pretend that\nhe has made an exhaustive collection, but he hopes the book may be\nregarded as the nucleus for an anthology which cannot, in the nature of\nthings, be very large.\n\nThe prose, as already intimated, is confined to groups of proverbs and\nfamiliar sayings. In one aspect these single lines of prose present\ndifficulties to the young reader: they are condensed forms of\nexpression, even though the words may be simple; but they offer the\nconvenient small change of intellectual currency which it is well for\none to be supplied with at an early stage of one's journey, and they\nafford to the teacher a capital opportunity for conversational and other\nexercises.\n\nThe order of this book is in a general way from the easy to the more\ndifficult, with an attempt, also, at an agreeable variety. The editor\nhas purposely avoided breaking up the book into lesson portions or\ngiving it the air of a text-book. There is no reason why children should\nnot read books as older people read them, for pleasure, and dissociate\nthem from a too persistent notion of tasks. It is entirely possible that\nsome teachers may find it out of the question to lead their classes\nstraight through this book, but there is nothing to forbid them from\njudicious skipping, or, what is perhaps more to the point, from helping\npupils over a difficult word or phrase when it is encountered; the\ninterest which the child takes will carry him over most hard places. It\nwould be a capital use of the book also if teachers were to draw upon it\nfor poems which their pupils should, in the suggestive phrase, learn by\nheart. To this purpose the contents are singularly well adapted; for,\nfrom the single line proverb to a poem by Wordsworth, there is\nsuch a wide range of choice that the teacher need not resort to the\nquestionable device of giving children fragments and bits of verse and\nprose to commit to memory. One of the greatest services we can do the\nyoung mind is to accustom it to the perception of _wholes_, and whether\nthis whole be a lyric or a narrative poem like Evangeline, it is almost\nequally important that the young reader should learn to hold it as such\nin his mind. To treat a poem as a mere quarry out of which a\nparticularly smooth stone can be chipped is to misinterpret poetry. A\npoem is a statue, not a quarry.\n\nH.E.S.\n\nBOSTON, _October_, 1893.\n\n\n\n\nCONTENTS.\n\n\nALPHABET                                     _Mother Goose_\n\nA DEWDROP                          _Frank Dempster Sherman_\n\nBEES                               _Frank Dempster Sherman_\n\nRHYMES.\n  Baa, baa, black sheep\n  Bless you, bless you, burnie bee\n  Bow, wow, wow\n  Bye, baby bunting                          _Mother Goose_\n\nSTAR LIGHT                                        _Unknown_\n\nTHE LITTLE MOON                                _A.B.

day?\n\n\n\nAT THE SEASIDE\n\nWhen I was down beside the sea\nA wooden spade they gave to me\n  To dig the sandy shore.\n\nMy holes were empty like a cup,\nIn every hole the sea came up,\n  Till it

DAVID'S WEAKNESS\n\n\n\nPsalm lxxviii. 71, 72, 73.  He chose David his servant, and took him\naway from the sheep-folds.  As he was following the ewes great with\nyoung ones, he took him; that he might feed Jacob his people, and\nIsrael his inheritance.  So he fed them with a faithful and true\nheart, and ruled them prudently with all his power.\n\nI am about to preach to you four sermons on the character of David.\nHis history, I take for granted, you all know.\n\nI look on David as an all but ideal king, educated for his office by\nan all but ideal training.  A shepherd first; a life--be it\nremembered--full of danger in those times and lands; then captain of\na band of outlaws; and lastly a king, gradually and with difficulty\nfighting his way to a secure throne.\n\nThis was his course.  But the most important stage of it was\nprobably the first.  Among the dumb animals he learnt experience\nwhich he afterwards put into practice among human beings.  The\nshepherd of the sheep became the shepherd of men.  He who had slain\nthe lion and the bear became the champion of his native land.  He\nwho followed the ewes great with young, fed God's oppressed and\nweary people with a faithful and true heart, till he raised them\ninto a great and strong nation.  So both sides of the true kingly\ncharacter, the masculine and the feminine, are brought out in David.\nFor the greedy and tyrannous, he has indignant defiance:  for the\nweak and helpless, patient tenderness.\n\nMy motives for choosing this subject I will explain in a very few\nwords.\n\nWe have heard much of late about 'Muscular Christianity.'  A clever\nexpression, spoken in jest by I know not whom, has been bandied\nabout the world, and supposed by many to represent some new ideal of\nthe Christian character.\n\nFor myself, I do not understand what it means.  It may mean one of\ntwo things.  If it mean the first, it is a term somewhat\nunnecessary, if not somewhat irreverent.  If it mean the second, it\nmeans something untrue and immoral.\n\nIts first and better meaning may be simply a healthy and manful\nChristianity, one which does not exalt the feminine virtues to the\nexclusion of the masculine.\n\nThat certain forms of Christianity have committed this last fault\ncannot be doubted.  The tendency of Christianity, during the\npatristic and the Middle Ages, was certainly in that direction.\nChristians were persecuted and defenceless, and they betook\nthemselves to the only virtues which they had the opportunity of\npractising--gentleness, patience, resignation, self-sacrifice, and\nself-devotion--all that is loveliest in the ideal female character.\nAnd God forbid that that side of the Christian life should ever be\nundervalued.  It has its own beauty, its own strength too made\nperfect in weakness; in prison, in torture, at the fiery stake, on\nthe lonely sick-bed, in long years of self-devotion and resignation,\nand in a thousand womanly sacrifices unknown to man, but written for\never in God's book of life.\n\nBut as time went on, and the monastic life, which, whether practised\nby man or by woman, is essentially a feminine life, became more and\nmore exclusively the religious ideal, grave defects began to appear\nin what was really too narrow a conception of the human character.\n\nThe monks of the Middle Ages, in aiming exclusively at the virtues\nof women, generally copied little but their vices.  Their unnatural\nattempt to be wiser than God, and to unsex themselves, had done\nlittle but disease their mind and heart.  They resorted more and\nmore to those arts which are the weapons of crafty, ambitious, and\nunprincipled women.  They were too apt to be cunning, false,\nintriguing.  They were personally cowardly, as their own chronicles\ndeclare; querulous, passionate, prone to unmanly tears; prone, as\ntheir writings abundantly testify, to scold, to use the most\nvirulent language against all who differed from them; they were, at\ntimes, fearfully cruel, as evil women will be; cruel with that worst\ncruelty which springs from cowardice.  If I seem to have drawn a\nharsh picture of them, I can only answer that their own documents\njustify abundantly all that I have said.\n\nGradually, to supply their defects, another ideal arose.  The\nwarriors of the Middle Ages hoped that they might be able to serve\nGod in the world, even in the battle-field.  At least, the world and\nthe battle-field they would not relinquish, but make the best of\nthem.  And among them arose a new and a very fair ideal of manhood:\nthat of the 'gentle, very perfect knight,' loyal to his king and to\nhis God, bound to defend the weak, succour the oppressed, and put\ndown the wrong-doer; with his lady, or bread-giver, dealing forth\nbounteously the goods of this life to all who needed; occupied in\nthe seven works of mercy, yet living in the world, and in the\nperfect enjoyment of wedded and family life.  This was the ideal.\nOf course sinful human nature fell short of it, and defaced it by\nabsurdities; but I do not hesitate to say that it was a higher ideal\nof Christian excellence than had appeared since the time of the\nApostles, putting aside the quite exceptional ideal of the blessed\nmartyrs.\n\nA higher ideal, I say, was chivalry, with all its shortcomings.  And\nfor this reason:  that it asserted the possibility of consecrating\nthe whole manhood, and not merely a few faculties thereof, to God;\nand it thus contained the first germ of that Protestantism which\nconquered at the Reformation.\n\nThen was asserted, once for all, on the grounds of nature and\nreason, as well as of Holy Scripture, the absolute sanctity of\nfamily and national life, and the correlative idea, namely, the\nconsecration of the whole of human nature to the service of God, in\nthat station to which God had called each man.  Then the Old\nTestament, with the honour which it puts upon family and national\nlife, became precious to man, as it had never been before; and such\na history as David's became, not as it was with the mediaeval monks,\na mere repertory of fanciful metaphors and allegories, but the\nsolemn example, for good and for evil, of a man of like passions and\nlike duties with the men of the modern world.\n\nThese great truths, once asserted, could not but conquer; and they\nwill conquer to the end.  All attempts to restore the monastic and\nfeminine ideal, like that of good Nicholas Ferrar at Little Gidding,\nfailed.  They withered like hot-house exotics in the free, keen,\nbracing English air; and in our civil wars, Cavalier and Puritan, in\nwhatever they differed, never differed in their sound and healthy\nconviction that true religion did not crush, but strengthened and\nconsecrated a valiant and noble manhood.\n\nNow if all that 'Muscular Christianity' means is that, then the\nexpression is altogether unnecessary; for we have had the thing for\nthree centuries--and defective likewise, for it is not a merely\nmuscular, but a human Christianity which the Bible taught our\nforefathers, and which our forefathers have handed down to us.\n\nBut there is another meaning sometimes attached to this flippant\nexpression, 'Muscular Christianity,' which is utterly immoral and\nintolerable.  There are those who say, and there have been of late\nthose who have written books to shew, that provided a young man is\nsufficiently brave, frank, and gallant, he is more or less absolved\nfrom the common duties of morality and self-restraint.\n\nThat physical prowess is a substitute for virtue is certainly no new\ndoctrine.  It is the doctrine of every red man on the American\nprairies, of every African chief who ornaments his hut with human\nskulls.  It was the doctrine of our heathen forefathers, when they\ncame hither slaying, plundering, burning, tossing babes on their\nspear-points.  But I am sorry that it should be the doctrine of any\none calling himself a gentleman, much more a Christian.\n\nIt is certainly not the doctrine of the Catechism, which bids us\nrenounce the flesh, and live by the help of God's Spirit a new life\nof duty to God and to our neighbour.\n\nIt is certainly not the doctrine of the New Testament.  Whatsoever\nSt. Paul meant by bidding his disciples crucify the flesh, with its\naffections and lusts, he did not mean thereby that they were to\ndeify the flesh, as the heathen round them did in their profligate\nmysteries and in their gladiatorial exhibitions.\n\nNeither, though the Old Testament may seem to put more value on\nphysical prowess than does the New Testament, is it the doctrine of\nthe Old Testament, as I purpose to show you from the life and\nhistory of David.\n\nNothing, nothing, can be a substitute for purity and virtue.  Man\nwill always try to find substitutes for it.  He will try to find a\nsubstitute in superstition, in forms and ceremonies, in voluntary\nhumility and worship of angels, in using vain repetitions, and\nfancying that he will be heard for his much speaking; he will try to\nfind a substitute in intellect, and the worship of intellect, and\nart, and poetry; or he will try to find it, as in the present case,\nin the worship of his own animal powers, which God meant to be his\nservants and not his masters.  But let no man lay that flattering\nunction to his soul.  The first and the last business of every human\nbeing, whatever his station, party, creed, capacities, tastes,\nduties, is morality:  Virtue, Virtue, always Virtue.  Nothing that\nman will ever invent will absolve him from the universal necessity\nof being good as God is good, righteous as God is righteous, and\nholy as God is holy.\n\nBelieve it, young men, believe it.  Better would it be for any one\nof you to be the stupidest and the ugliest of mortals, to be the\nmost diseased and abject of <DW36>s, the most silly, nervous\nincapable personage who ever was a laughingstock for the boys upon\nthe streets, if only you lived, according to your powers, the life\nof the Spirit of God; than to be as perfectly gifted, as exquisitely\norganised in body and mind as David himself, and not to live the\nlife of the Spirit of God, the life of goodness, which is the only\nlife fit for a human being wearing the human flesh and soul which\nChrist took upon him on earth, and wears for ever in heaven, a Man\nindeed in the midst of the throne of God.\n\nAnd therefore it is, as you will yourselves have perceived already,\nthat I have chosen to speak to you of David, his character, his\nhistory.\n\nIt is the character of a man perfectly gifted, exquisitely\norganised.  He has personal beauty, daring, prowess, and skill in\nwar; he has generosity, nobleness, faithfulness, chivalry as of a\nmediaeval and Christian knight; he is a musician, poet, seemingly an\narchitect likewise; he is, moreover, a born king; he has a\nmarvellous and most successful power of attracting, disciplining,\nruling his fellow-men.  So thoroughly human a personage is he, that\nGod speaks of him as the man after his own heart; that our blessed\nLord condescends to call himself especially the Son of David.\n\nFor there is in this man (as there is said to be in all great\ngeniuses) a feminine, as well as a masculine vein; a passionate\ntenderness; a keen sensibility; a vast capacity of sympathy,\nsadness, and suffering, which makes him truly the type of Christ,\nthe Man of sorrows; which makes his Psalms to this day the text-book\nof the afflicted, of tens of thousands who have not a particle of\nhis beauty, courage, genius; but yet can feel, in mean hovels and\nworkhouse sick-beds, that the warrior-poet speaks to their human\nhearts, and for their human hearts, as none other can speak, save\nChrist himself, the Son of David and the Son of man.\n\nA man, I say, of intense sensibilities; and therefore capable, as is\nbut too notorious, of great crimes, as well as of great virtues.\n\nAnd when I mention this last fact, I must ask you to pause, and\nconsider with me very solemnly what it means.\n\nWe may pervert, or rather misstate the fact in more than one way, to\nour own hurt.  We may say cynically, David had his good points and\nhis bad ones, as all your great saints have.  Look at them closely,\nand in spite of all their pretensions you will find them no better\nthan their neighbours.  And so we may comfort ourselves, in our own\nmediocrity and laziness, by denying the existence of all greatness\nand goodness.\n\nNathan the prophet said that David's conduct would be open to this\nvery interpretation, and would give great occasion to the enemies of\nthe Lord to blaspheme.  But I trust that none of you wish to be\nnumbered among the enemies of the Lord.\n\nAgain, we may say, sentimentally, that these great weaknesses are on\nthe whole the necessary concomitants of great strength; that such\nhighly organised and complex characters must not be judged by the\nrule of common respectability; and that it is a more or less fine\nthing to be capable at once of great virtues and great vices.\n\nBooks which hint, and more than hint this, will suggest themselves\nto you at once.  I only advise you not to listen to their teaching,\nas you will find it lead to very serious consequences, both in this\nlife and in the life to come.\n\nBut if we do say this, or anything like this, we say it on our own\nresponsibility.  David's biographers say nothing of the kind.  David\nhimself says nothing of the kind.  He never represents himself as a\ncompound of strength and weakness.  He represents himself as\nweakness itself--as incapacity utter and complete.  To overlook that\nstartling fact is to overlook the very element which has made\nDavid's Psalms the text-book for all human weaknesses, penitences,\nsorrows, struggles, aspirations, for nigh three thousand years.\n\nBut this subject is too large for me to speak of to-day; and too\ndeep for me to attempt an explanation till I have turned your\nthoughts toward another object, which will explain to you David, and\nyourselves, and, it seems to me at times, every problem of humanity.\nLook not at David, but at David's greater Son; and consider Christ\nupon his Cross.  Consider him of whom it is written, 'Thou art\nfairer than the children of men:  full of grace are thy lips,\nbecause God hath blessed thee for ever.  Gird thee with thy sword\nupon thy thigh, O thou most Mighty, according to thy worship and\nrenown.  Good luck have thou with thine honour; ride on, because of\nthe word of truth, of meekness, and righteousness; and thy right\nhand shall teach thee terrible things.  Thy arrows are very sharp,\nand the people shall be subdued unto thee, even in the midst among\nthe King's enemies.'  Consider him who alone fulfilled these words,\nwho fulfils them even now eternally in heaven, King over all, God\nblessed for ever.  And then sit down at the foot of his Cross:\nhowever young, strong, proud, gallant, gifted, ambitious you may be-\n-sit down at the foot of Christ's Cross, and look thereon, till you\nsee what it means, and must mean for ever.  See how he nailed to\nthat Cross, not in empty metaphor but in literal fact, in agonising\nsoul and body, all of human nature which the world admires--youth,\ngrace, valour, power, eloquence, intellect:  not because they were\nevil, for he possessed them doubtless himself as did none other of\nthe sons of men--not, I say, because they were evil, but because\nthey were worthless and as nothing beside that divine charity which\nwould endure and conquer for ever, when all the noblest accidents of\nthe body and the mind had perished, or seemed to perish.  In the\nutmost weakness and shame of human flesh he would shew forth the\nstrength and glory of the Divine Spirit; the strength and the glory\nof duty and obedience; of patience and forgiveness; of benevolence\nand self-sacrifice; the strength and glory of that burning love for\nhuman beings which could stoop from heaven to earth that it might\nseek and save that which was lost.\n\nYes.  Look at Christ upon his Cross; the sight which melted the\nhearts of our fierce forefathers, and turned them from the worship\nof Thor and Odin to the worship of 'The white Christ;' and from the\nhope of a Valhalla of brute prowess, to the hope of a heaven of\nrighteousness and love.  Look at Christ upon his Cross, and see\nthere, as they saw, the true prowess, the true valour, the true\nchivalry, the true glory, the true manhood, most human when most\ndivine, which is self-sacrifice and love--as possible to the\nweakest, meanest, simplest, as to the strongest, most gallant, and\nmost wise.\n\nLook upon him, and learn from him, and take his yoke upon you, for\nhe is meek and lowly of heart, and you shall find rest unto your\nsouls; and in you shall be fulfilled the prophecy of Jeremiah, which\nhe spake, saying, 'Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither\nthe mighty man glory in his might, neither let the rich man glory in\nhis wealth:  but let him that glorieth glory in this, that he\nunderstandeth and knoweth me, that I am the Lord, who exercises\nloving-kindness, judgment, and righteousness in the earth:  for in\nthese things I delight, saith the Lord.'\n\n\n\nSERMON II.  DAVID'S STRENGTH\n\n\n\nPsalm xxvii.  1.  The Lord is my light, and my salvation; whom then\nshall I fear?  The Lord is the strength of my life; of whom then\nshall I be afraid?\n\nI said, last Sunday, that the key-note of David's character was not\nthe assertion of his own strength, but the confession of his own\nweakness.  And I say it again.\n\nBut it is plain that David had strength, and of no common order;\nthat he was an eminently powerful, able, and successful man.  From\nwhence then came that strength?  He says, from God.  He says,\nthroughout his life, as emphatically as did St. Paul after him, that\nGod's strength was made perfect in his weakness.\n\nGod is his deliverer, his guide, his teacher, his inspirer.  The\nLord is his strength, who teaches his hands to war, and his fingers\nto fight; his hope and his fortress, his castle and deliverer, his\ndefence, in whom he trusts; who subdueth the people that is under\nhim.\n\nTo God he ascribes, not only his success in life, but his physical\nprowess.  By God's help he slays the lion and the bear.  By God's\nhelp he has nerve to kill the Philistine giant.  By God's help he is\nso strong that his arms can break even a bow of steel.  It is God\nwho makes his feet like hart's feet, and enables him to leap over\nthe walls of the mountain fortresses.\n\nAnd we must pause ere we call such utterances mere Eastern metaphor.\nIt is far more probable that they were meant as and were literal\ntruths.  David was not likely to have been a man of brute gigantic\nstrength.  So delicate a brain was probably coupled to a delicate\nbody.  Such a nature, at the same time, would be the very one most\ncapable, under the influence--call it boldly, inspiration--of a\ngreat and patriotic cause, of great dangers and great purposes;\ncapable, I say, at moments, of accesses of almost superhuman energy,\nwhich he ascribed, and most rightly, to the inspiration of God.\n\nBut it is not merely as his physical inspirer or protector that he\nhas faith in God.  He has a deeper, a far deeper instinct than even\nthat; the instinct of a communion, personal, practical, living,\nbetween God, the fount of light and goodness, and his own soul, with\nits capacity of darkness as well as light, of evil as well as good.\n\nIn one word, David is a man of faith and a man of prayer--as God\ngrant all you may be.  It is this one fixed idea, that God could\nhear him, and that God would help him, which gives unity and\ncoherence to the wonderful variety of David's Psalms.  It is this\nfaith which gives calm confidence to his views of nature and of man;\nand enables him to say, as he looks upon his sheep feeding round\nhim, 'The Lord is my Shepherd, therefore I shall not want.'  Faith\nit is which enables him to foresee that though the heathen rage, and\nthe kings of the earth stand up, and the rulers take counsel\ntogether against the Lord and his Anointed, yet the righteous cause\nwill surely prevail, for God is king himself.  Faith it is which\nenables him to bear up against the general immorality, and while he\ncries, 'Help me, Lord, for there is not one godly man left, for the\nfaithful fail from among the children of men'--to make answer to\nhimself in words of noble hope and consolation, 'Now for the\ncomfortless troubles' sake of the needy, and because of the deep\nsighing of the poor, I will up, saith the Lord, and will help every\none from him that swelleth against him, and will set him at rest.'\n\nFaith it is which gives a character, which no other like utterances\nhave, to those cries of agony--cries as of a lost child--which he\nutters at times with such noble and truthful simplicity.  They\nissue, almost every one of them, in a sudden counter-cry of joy as\npathetic as the sorrow which has gone before.  'O Lord, rebuke me\nnot in thine indignation:  neither chasten me in thy displeasure.\nHave mercy upon me, O Lord, for I am weak:  O Lord, heal me, for my\nbones are vexed.  My soul also is sore troubled:  but, Lord, how\nlong wilt thou punish me?  Turn thee, O Lord, and deliver my soul:\nO save me for thy mercy's sake.  For in death no man remembereth\nthee:  and who will give thee thanks in the pit?  I am weary of my\ngroaning; every night wash I my bed:  and water my couch with my\ntears.  My beauty is gone for very trouble:  and worn away because\nof all mine enemies.  Away from me, all ye that work vanity, for the\nLord hath heard the voice of my weeping.  The Lord hath heard my\npetition:  the Lord will receive my prayer.'\n\nFaith it is, in like wise, which gives its peculiar grandeur to that\nwonderful 18th Psalm, David's song of triumph; his masterpiece, and\nit may be the masterpiece of human poetry, inspired or uninspired,\nonly approached by the companion-Psalm, the 144th.  From whence\ncomes that cumulative energy, by which it rushes on, even in our\ntranslation, with a force and swiftness which are indeed divine;\nthought following thought, image image, verse verse, before the\nbreath of the Spirit of God, as wave leaps after wave before the\ngale?  What is the element in that ode, which even now makes it stir\nthe heart like a trumpet?  Surely that which it itself declares in\nthe very first verse:\n\n'I will love thee, O Lord, my strength; the Lord is my stony rock,\nand my defence:  my Saviour, my God, and my might, in whom I will\ntrust, my buckler, the horn also of my salvation, and my refuge.'\n\nWhat is it which gives life and reality to the magnificent imagery\nof the seventh and following verses?  'The earth trembled and\nquaked:  the very foundations also of the hills shook, and were\nremoved, because he was wroth.  There went a smoke out in his\npresence:  and a consuming fire out of his mouth, so that coals were\nkindled at it.  He bowed the heavens also, and came down:  and it\nwas dark under his feet.  He rode upon the cherubims, and did fly:\nhe came flying upon the wings of the wind.  He made darkness his\nsecret place:  his pavilion round about him with dark water, and\nthick clouds to cover him.  At the brightness of his presence his\nclouds removed:  hailstones, and coals of fire.  The Lord also\nthundered out of heaven, and the Highest gave his thunder:\nhailstones, and coals of fire.  He sent out his arrows, and\nscattered them:  he cast forth lightnings, and destroyed them.  The\nsprings of waters were seen, and the foundations of the round world\nwere discovered, at thy chiding, O Lord:  at the blasting of the\nbreath of thy displeasure.  He shall send down from on high to fetch\nme:  and shall take me out of many waters.'  What protects such\nwords from the imputation of mere Eastern exaggeration?  The firm\nconviction that God is the deliverer, not only of David, but of all\nwho trust in God; that the whole majesty of God, and all the powers\nof nature, are arrayed on the side of the good and of the oppressed.\n'The Lord shall reward me after my righteous dealing:  according to\nthe cleanness of my hands shall he recompense me.  Because I have\nkept the ways of the Lord:  and have not forsaken my God, as the\nwicked doth.  For I have an eye unto all his laws:  and will not\ncast out his commandments from me.  I was also uncorrupt before him:\nand eschewed mine own wickedness.  Therefore shall the Lord reward\nme after my righteous dealing:  and according unto the cleanness of\nmy hands in his eyesight.  With the holy thou shalt be holy:  and\nwith a perfect man thou shalt be perfect.'\n\nFaith, again, it is, to turn from David's highest to his lowest\nphase--faith in God it is which has made that 51st Psalm the model\nof all true penitence for evermore.  Faith in God, in the spite of\nhis full consciousness that God is about to punish him bitterly for\nthe rest of his life.  Faith it is which gives to that Psalm its\npeculiarly simple, deliberate, manly tone; free from all exaggerated\nself-accusations, all cowardly cries of terror.  He is crushed down,\nit is true.  The tone of his words shews us that throughout.  But\ncrushed by what?  By the discovery that he has offended God?  Not in\nthe least.  For the sake of your own souls, as well as for that of\nhonest critical understanding of the Scriptures, do not foist that\nmeaning into David's words.  He never says that he had offended God.\nHad he been a mediaeval monk, had he been an average superstitious\nman of any creed or time, he would have said so, and cried, I have\noffended God; he is offended and angry with me, how shall I avert\nhis wrath?\n\nNot so.  David has discovered not an angry, but a forgiving God; a\nGod of love and goodness, who desires to make his creatures good.\nPenitential prayers in all ages have too often wanted faith in God,\nand therefore have been too often prayers to avert punishment.\nThis, this--the model of all truly penitent prayers--is that of a\nman who is to be punished, and is content to take his punishment,\nknowing that he deserves it, and far more beside.  And why?\nBecause, as always, David has faith in God.  God is a good and just\nbeing, and he trusts him accordingly; and that very discovery of the\ngoodness, not the sternness of God, is the bitterest pang, the\ndeepest shame to David's spirit.  Therefore he can face without\ndespair the discovery of a more deep, radical inbred evil in himself\nthan he ever expected before.  'Behold, I was shapen in wickedness:\nand in sin hath my mother conceived me;' because he could say also,\n'Thou requirest truth in the inward parts; and shalt make me to\nunderstand wisdom secretly.'  He can cry to God, out of the depths\nof his foulness, 'Make me a clean heart, O God:  and renew a right\nspirit within me.  Cast me not away from thy presence:  and take not\nthy holy Spirit from me.  O give me the comfort of thy help again:\nand stablish me with thy free Spirit.  Then shall I teach thy ways\nunto the wicked:  and sinners shall be converted unto thee.'  He can\ncry thus, because he has discovered that the will of God is not to\nhate, not to torture, not to cast away from his presence, but to\nrestore his creatures to goodness, that he may thereby restore them\nto usefulness.  David has discovered that God demands no sacrifice,\nmuch less self-torturing penance.  What he demands is the heart.\nThe sacrifice of God is a troubled spirit.  A broken and a contrite\nheart he will not despise.  It is such utterances as these which\nhave given, for now many hundred years, their priceless value to the\nlittle book of Psalms ascribed to the shepherd outlaw of the Judaean\nhills.  It is such utterances as these which have sent the sound of\nhis name into all lands, and his words throughout all the world.\nEvery form of human sorrow, doubt, struggle, error, sin; the nun\nagonising in the cloister; the settler struggling for his life in\nTransatlantic forests; the pauper shivering over the embers in his\nhovel, and waiting for kind death; the man of business striving to\nkeep his honour pure amid the temptations of commerce; the prodigal\nson starving in the far country, and recollecting the words which he\nlearnt long ago at his mother's knee; the peasant boy trudging a-\nfield in the chill dawn, and remembering that the Lord is his\nshepherd, therefore he will not want--all shapes of humanity have\nfound, and will find to the end of time, a word said to their inmost\nhearts, and more, a word said for those hearts to the living God of\nheaven, by the vast humanity of David, the man after God's own\nheart; the most thoroughly human figure, as it seems to me, which\nhad appeared upon the earth before the coming of that perfect Son of\nman, who is over all, God blessed for ever.  Amen.\n\nIt may be said, David's belief is no more than the common belief of\nfanatics.  They have in all ages fancied themselves under the\nspecial protection of Deity, the object of special communications\nfrom above.\n\nDoubtless they have; and evil conclusions have they drawn therefrom,\nin every age.  But the existence of a counterfeit is no argument\nagainst the existence of the reality; rather it is an argument for\nthe existence of the reality.  In this case it is impossible to\nconceive how the idea of communion with an unseen being ever entered\nthe human mind at all, unless it had been put there originally by\nfact and experience.  Man would never have even dreamed of a living\nGod, had not that living God been a reality, who did not leave the\ncreature to find his Creator, but stooped from heaven, at the very\nbeginning of our race, to find his creature.\n\nAnd a reality you will surely find it--that living and practical\ncommunication between your souls, and that Father in heaven who\ncreated them.  It will not be real, but morbid, even imaginary, just\nin proportion as your souls are tainted with self-conceit, ambition,\nself-will, malice, passion, or any wilful vice; especially with the\nvice of bigotry, which settles beforehand for God what he shall\nteach the soul, and in what manner he shall teach it, and turns a\ndeaf ear to his plainest lessons if they cannot be made to fit into\nsome favourite formula or theory.  But it will be real, practical,\nhealthy, soul-saving, in the very deepest sense of that word, just\nin proportion as your eye is single and your heart pure; just in\nproportion as you hunger and thirst after righteousness, and wish\nand try simply and humbly to do your duty in that station to which\nGod has called you, and to learn joyfully and trustingly anything\nand everything which God may see fit to teach you.  Then as your day\nyour strength shall be.  Then will the Lord teach you, and inform\nyou with his eye, and guide you in the way wherein you should go.\nThen will you obey that appeal of the Psalmist, 'Be ye not like to\nhorse and mule, which have no understanding, whose mouths must be\nheld in with bit and bridle, lest they fall upon thee.  Great\nplagues remain for the ungodly.  But whoso putteth his trust in the\nLord, mercy embraceth him on every side.'\n\nFor understand this well, young men, and settle it in your hearts as\nthe first condition of human life, yea, of the life of every\nrational created being, that a man is justified only by faith; and\nnot only a man, but angels, archangels, and all possible created\nspirits, past, present, and to come.  All stand, all are in their\nright state, only as long as they are consciously dependent on God\nthe Father of spirits and his Son Jesus Christ the Lord, in whom\nthey live and move and have their being.  The moment they attempt to\nassert themselves, whether their own power, their own genius, their\nown wisdom, or even their own virtue, they ipso facto sin, and are\njustified and just no longer; because they are trying to take\nthemselves out of their just and right state of dependence, and to\nput themselves into an unjust and wrong state of independence.  To\nassert that anything is their own, to assert that their virtue is\ntheir own, just as much as to assert that their wisdom, or any other\npart of their being, is their own, is to deny the primary fact of\ntheir existence--that in God they live and move and have that being.\nAnd therefore Milton's Satan, though, over and above all his other\ngrandeurs, he had been adorned with every virtue, would have been\nSatan still by the one sin of ingratitude, just because and just as\nlong as he set up himself, apart from that God from whom alone comes\nevery good and perfect gift.\n\nSettle it in your hearts, young men, settle it in your hearts--or\nrather pray to God to settle it therein; and if you would love life\nand see good days, recollect daily and hourly that the only sane and\nsafe human life is dependence on God himself, and that--\n\n\n   Unless above himself he can\nExalt himself, how poor a thing is man.\n\n\n\nSERMON III.  DAVID'S ANGER\n\n\n\nPsalm cxliii. 11, 12.  Quicken me, O Lord, for thy name's sake:  for\nthy righteousness' sake bring my soul out of trouble.  And of thy\nmercy cut off mine enemies, and destroy all them that afflict my\nsoul:  for I am thy servant.\n\nThere are those who would say that I dealt unfairly last Sunday by\nthe Psalms of David; that in order to prove them inspired, I ignored\nan element in them which is plainly uninspired, wrong, and\noffensive; namely, the curses which he invokes upon his enemies.  I\nignored it, they would say, because it was fatal to my theory!\nbecause it proved David to have the vindictive passions of other\nEasterns; to be speaking, not by the inspiration of God, but of his\nown private likes and dislikes; to be at least a fanatic who thinks\nthat his cause must needs be God's cause, and who invokes the\nlightnings of heaven on all who dare to differ from him.  Others\nwould say that such words were excusable in David, living under the\nOld Law; for it was said by them of old time, 'Thou shalt love thy\nneighbour and hate thine enemy:' but that our Lord has formally\nabrogated that permission; 'But I say unto you, Love your enemies,\nbless them that curse you, and do good to those who despitefully use\nyou and persecute you.'  How unnecessary, and how wrong then, they\nwould say, it is of the Church of England to retain these cursing\nPsalms in her public worship, and put them into the mouths of her\ncongregations.  Either they are merely painful, as well as\nunnecessary to Christians; or if they mean anything, they excuse and\nfoster the habit too common among religious controversialists of\ninvoking the wrath of heaven on their opponents.\n\nI argue with neither of the objectors.  But the question is a\ncurious and an important one; and I am bound, I think, to examine it\nin a sermon which, like the present, treats of David's chivalry.\n\nWhat David meant by these curses can be best known from his own\nactions.  What certain persons have meant by them since is patent\nenough from their actions.  Mediaeval monks considered but too often\nthe enemies of their creed, of their ecclesiastical organisation,\neven of their particular monastery, to be ipso facto enemies of God;\nand applied to them the seeming curses of David's Psalms, with\nfearful additions, of which David, to his honour, never dreamed.\n'May they feel with Dathan and Abiram the damnation of Gehenna,'\n{285} is a fair sample of the formulae which are found in the\nwritings of men who, while they called themselves the servants of\nJesus Christ our Lord, derived their notions of the next world\nprincipally from the sixth book of Virgil's AEneid.  And what they\nmeant by their words their acts shewed.  Whenever they had the\npower, they were but too apt to treat their supposed enemies in this\nlife, as they expected God to treat them in the next.  The history\nof the Inquisition on the continent, in America, and in the\nPortuguese Indies--of the Marian persecutions in England--of the\nPiedmontese massacres in the 17th century--are facts never to be\nforgotten.  Their horrors have been described in too authentic\ndocuments; they remain for ever the most hideous pages in the\nhistory of sinful human nature.  Do we find a hint of any similar\nconduct on the part of David?  If not, it is surely probable that he\ndid not mean by his imprecations what the mediaeval clergy meant.\n\nCertainly, whatsoever likeness there may have been in language, the\ncontrast in conduct is most striking.  It is a special mark of\nDavid's character, as special as his faith in God, that he never\navenges himself with his own hand.  Twice he has Saul in his power:\nonce in the cave at Engedi, once at the camp at Hachilah, and both\ntimes he refuses nobly to use his opportunity.  He is his master,\nthe Lord's Anointed; and his person is sacred in the eyes of David\nhis servant--his knight, as he would have been called in the Middle\nAge.  The second time David's temptation is a terrible one.  He has\nsoftened Saul's wild heart by his courtesy and pathos when he\npleaded with him, after letting him escape from the cave; and he has\nsworn to Saul that when he becomes king he will never cut off his\nchildren, or destroy his name out of his father's home.  Yet we find\nSaul, immediately after, attacking him again out of mere caprice;\nand once more falling into his hands.  Abishai says--and who can\nwonder?--'Let me smite him with the spear to the earth this once,\nand I will not smite a second time.'  What wonder?  The man is not\nto be trusted--truce with him is impossible; but David still keeps\nhis chivalry, in the true meaning of that word:  'Destroy him not,\nfor who can stretch forth his hand against the Lord's Anointed, and\nbe guiltless?  As the Lord liveth, the Lord shall smite him, or his\nday shall come to die; or he shall go down into battle, and perish.\nBut the Lord forbid that I should stretch forth my hand against the\nLord's Anointed.'\n\nAnd if it be argued, that David regarded the person of a king as\nlegally sacred, there is a case more clear still, in which he\nabjures the right of revenge upon a private person.\n\nNabal, in addition to his ingratitude, has insulted him with the\nbitterest insult which could be offered to a free man in a slave-\nholding country.  He has hinted that David is neither more nor less\nthan a runaway slave.  And David's heart is stirred by a terrible\nand evil spirit.  He dare not trust his men, even himself, with his\nblack thoughts.  'Gird on your swords,' is all that he can say\naloud.  But he had said in his heart, 'God do so and more to the\nenemies of David, if I leave a man alive by the morning light of all\nthat pertain to him.'\n\nAnd yet at the first words of reason and of wisdom, urged doubtless\nby the eloquence of a beautiful and noble woman, but no less by the\nSpirit of God speaking through her, as all who call themselves\ngentlemen should know already, his right spirit returns to him.  The\nchivalrous instinct of forgiveness and duty is roused once more; and\nhe cries, 'Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, which sent thee this\nday to meet me; and blessed be thou, which hast kept me this day\nfrom shedding blood, and from avenging myself with mine own hand.'\n\nIt is plain then, that David's notion of his duty to his enemies was\nvery different from that of the monks.  But still they are\nundeniably imprecations, the imprecations of a man smarting under\ncruel injustice; who cannot, and in some cases must not avenge\nhimself, and who therefore calls on the just God to avenge him.  Are\nwe therefore to say that these utterances of David are uninspired?\nNot in the least:  we are boldly to say that they are inspired, and\nby the very Spirit of God, who is the Spirit of justice and of\njudgment.\n\nDoubtless there were, in after ages, far higher inspirations.  The\nSpirit of God was, and is gradually educating mankind, and\nindividuals among mankind, like David, upward from lower truths to\nhigher ones.  That is the express assertion of our Lord and of his\nApostles.  But the higher and later inspiration does not make the\nlower and earlier false.  It does not even always supersede it\naltogether.  Each is true; and, for the most part, each must remain,\nand be respected, that they may complement each other.\n\nLet us look at this question rationally and reverently, free from\nall sentimental and immoral indulgence for sin and wrong.\n\nThe first instinct of man is the Lex Talionis.  As you do to me--\nsays the savage--so I have a right to do to you.  If you try to kill\nme or mine, I have a right to kill you in return.  Is this notion\nuninspired?  I should be sorry to say so.  It is surely the first\nform and the only possible first form of the sense of justice and\nretribution.  As a man sows so shall he reap.  If a man does wrong\nhe deserves to be punished.  No arguments will drive that great\ndivine law out of the human mind; for God has put it there.\n\nAfter that inspiration comes a higher one.  The man is taught to\nsay, I must not punish my enemy if I can avoid it.  God must punish\nhim, either by the law of the land or by his providential judgments.\nTo this height David rises.  In a seemingly lawless age and country,\nunder the most extreme temptation, he learns to say, 'Blessed be God\nwho hath kept me from avenging myself with my own hand.'\n\nBut still, it may be said, David calls down God's vengeance on his\nenemies.  He has not learnt to hate the sin and yet love the sinner.\nDoubtless he has not:  and it may have been right for his education,\nand for the education of the human race through him, that he did\nnot.  It may have been a good thing for him, as a future king; it\nmay be a good thing for many a man now, to learn the sinfulness of\nsin, by feeling its effects in his own person; by writhing under\nthose miseries of body and soul, which wicked men can, and do\ninflict on their fellow-creatures.\n\nThere are sins which a good man will not pity, but wage internecine\nwar against them; sins for which he is justified, if God have called\nhim thereto, to destroy the sinner in his sins.  The traitor, the\ntyrant, the ravisher, the robber, the extortioner, are not objects\nof pity, but of punishment; and it may have been very good for David\nto be taught by sharp personal experience, that those who robbed the\nwidow and put the fatherless to death, like the lawless lords of his\ntime; those like Saul, who smote the city of the priests for having\ngiven David food--men and women, children and sucklings, oxen and\nasses and sheep, with the edge of the sword; those who, like the\nnameless traitor who so often rouses his indignation--his own\nfamiliar friend who lifted up his heel against him--sought men's\nlives under the guise of friendship:  that such, I say, were persons\nnot to be tolerated upon the face of God's earth.  We do not\ntolerate them now.  We punish them by law.  We even destroy them\nwholesale in war, without inquiring into their individual guilt or\ninnocence.  David was taught, not by abstract meditation in his\nstudy, but by bitter need and agony, not to tolerate them then.  If\nhe could have destroyed them as we do now, it is not for us to say\nthat he would have been wrong.  And what if he were indignant, and\nwhat if he expressed that indignation?  I have yet to discover that\nindignation against wrong is aught but righteous, noble, and divine.\nThe flush of rage and scorn which rises, and ought to rise in every\nhonest heart, when we see a woman or a child ill-used, a poor man\nwronged or crushed--What is that, but the inspiration of Almighty\nGod?  What is that but the likeness of Christ?  Woe to the man who\nhas lost that feeling!  Woe to the man who can stand coolly by, and\nsee wrong done without a shock or a murmur, or even more, to the\nvery limits of the just laws of this land.  He may think it a fine\nthing so to do; a proof that he is an easy, prudent man of the\nworld, and not a meddlesome enthusiast.  But all that it does prove\nis:  That the Spirit of God, who is the Spirit of justice and\njudgment, has departed from him.\n\nI say the Spirit of God and the likeness of Christ.  Instead of\nbelieving David's own statement of the wrong doings of these men\nabout him, we may say cynically, and as it seems to me most\nunfairly, 'Of course there were two sides to David's quarrels, as\nthere are to all such; and of course he took his own side; and\nconsidered himself always in the right, and every one who differed\nfrom him in the wrong;' and such a speech will sound sufficiently\nworldly-wise to pass for philosophy with some critics; but,\nunfortunately, he who says that of David, will be bound in all\nfairness to say it of our Lord Jesus Christ.\n\nFor you must remember that there was a class of sinners in Judaea,\nto whom our Lord speaks no word of pity or forgiveness:  namely, the\nvery men who were his own personal enemies, who were persecuting\nhim, and going about to kill him; and that therefore, by any hard\nwords toward them, he must have laid himself open, just as much as\nDavid laid himself open, to the imputation of personal spite.  And\nyet, what did he say to the scribes and Pharisees:  'Ye go about to\nkill me, and therefore I am bound to say nothing harsh concerning\nyou'?  What he did say was this:  'Ye serpents, ye generation of\nvipers, how can ye escape the damnation of hell?'\n\nYes; in the Son of David, as in David's self, there was, and is, and\nwill be for ever and ever, no weak, and really cruel indulgence; but\na burning fire of indignation against all hypocrisy, tyranny, lust,\ncruelty, and every other sin by which men oppress, torment, deceive,\ndegrade their fellow-men; and still more, still more, remember that,\nall young men, their fellow-women.  That fire burns for ever--the\nDivine fire of God; the fire not of hatred, but of love to mankind,\nwhich will therefore punish, and if need be, exterminate all who\nshall dare to make mankind the worse, whether in body or soul or\nmind.\n\nBut David prays God to kill his enemies.  No doubt he does.\nProbably they deserved to be killed.  He does not ask, you will\nalways remember, if you be worthy of the name of critical students\nof the Bible--he does not ask, as did the mediaeval monks, that his\nenemies should go to endless torments after they died.  True or\nfalse, that is a more modern notion--and if it be applied to the\nPsalms, an interpolation--of which David knew nothing.  He asks\nsimply that the men may die.  Probably he knew his own business\nbest, and the men deserved to die; to be killed either by God or by\nman, as do too many in all ages.\n\nIf we take the Bible as it stands (and we have no right to do\notherwise), these men were trying to kill David.  He could not, and\nupon a point of honour, would not kill them himself.  But he\nbelieved, and rightly, that God can punish the offender whom man\ncannot touch, and that He will, and does punish them.  And if he\ncalls on God to execute justice and judgment upon these men, he only\ncalls on God to do what God is doing continually on the face of the\nwhole earth.  In fact, God does punish here, in this life.  He does\nnot, as false preachers say, give over this life to impunity, and\nthis world to the devil, and only resume the reins of moral\ngovernment and the right of retribution when men die and go into the\nnext world.  Here, in this life, he punishes sin; slowly, but\nsurely, God punishes.  And if any of you doubt my words, you have\nonly to commit sin, and then see whether your sin will find you out.\n\nThe whole question turns on this, Are we to believe in a living God,\nor are we not?  If we are not, then David's words are of course\nworse than nothing.  If we are, I do not see why David was wrong in\ncalling on God to exercise that moral and providential government of\nthe world, which is the very note and definition of a living God.\n\nBut what right have we to use these words?  My friends, if the\nChurch bids us use these words, she certainly does not bid us act\nupon them.  She keeps them, I believe most rightly, as a record of a\nhuman experience, which happily seems to us special and extreme, of\nwhich we, in a well-governed Christian land, know nothing, and shall\nnever know.\n\nSpecial and extreme?  Alas, alas!  In too many countries, in too\nmany ages, it has been the common, the almost universal experience\nof the many weak, enslaved, tortured, butchered at the wicked will\nof the few strong.\n\nThere have been those in tens of thousands, there may be those again\nwho will have a right to cry to God, 'Of thy goodness slay mine\nenemies, lest they slay, or worse than slay, both me and mine.'\nThere were thousands of English after the Norman Conquest; there\nwere thousands of Hindoos in Oude before its annexation; there are\nthousands of <DW64>s at this moment in their native land of Africa,\ncrushed and outraged by hereditary tyrants, who had and have a right\nto appeal to God, as David appealed to him against the robber lords\nof Palestine; a right to cry, 'Rid us, O God; if thou be a living\nGod, a God of justice and mercy, rid us not only of these men, but\nof their children after them.  This tyrant, stained with lust and\nwine and blood; this robber chieftain who privily in his lurking\ndens murders the innocent, and ravishes the poor when he getteth him\ninto his net; this slave-hunting king who kills the captives whom he\ncannot sell; and whose children after him will inevitably imitate\nhis cruelties and his rapine and treacheries--deal with him and his\nas they deserve.  Set an ungodly man to be ruler over him; that he\nmay find out what we have been enduring from his ungodly rule.  Let\nhis days be few, and another take his office.  Let his children be\nfatherless, and his wife a widow.  Let his children beg their bread\nout of desolate places.  Let there be no man to pity him or take\ncompassion on his fatherless children--to take his part, and breed\nup a fresh race of tyrants to our misery.  Let the extortioner\nconsume all he hath, and the stranger spoil his labour--for what he\nhas is itself taken by extortion, and he has spoiled the labour of\nthousands.  Let his posterity be destroyed, and in the next\ngeneration his name be clean put out.  Let the wickedness of his\nfather and the sin of his mother be had in remembrance in the sight\nof the Lord; that he may root out the memorial of them from the\nearth, and enable law and justice, peace and freedom to take the\nplace of anarchy and tyranny and blood.'\n\nThat prayer was answered--if we are to believe the records of\nNorman, not English, monks in England after the Conquest, by the\nspeedy extinction of the most guilty families among the Norman\nconquerors.  It is being answered, thank God, in Hindostan at this\nmoment.  It will surely be answered in Africa in God's good time;\nfor the Lord reigneth, be the nations never so unquiet.  And we, if\nwe will read such words rationally and humanly, remembering the\nstate of society in which they were written--a state of society,\nalas! which has endured, and still endures over a vast portion of\nthe habitable globe; where might is right, and there is little or no\nprinciple, save those of lust and greed and revenge--then instead of\nwishing such words out of the Bible, we shall be glad to keep them\nthere, as testimonies to the moral government of the world by a God\nand a Christ who will surely avenge the innocent blood; and as a\nGospel of comfort to suffering millions, when the news reaches them\nat last, that they may call on God to deliver them from their\ntormentors, and that he will hear their cry, and will help them.\n\n\n\nSERMON IV.  DAVID'S DESERTS\n\n\n\n2 Samuel i. 26.  I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan:\nvery pleasant hast thou been unto me:  thy love to me was wonderful,\npassing the love of women.\n\nPassing the love of woman?  How can that be, we of these days shall\nsay.  What love can pass that, saving the boundless love of him who\nstooped from heaven to earth, that he might die on the Cross for us?\nNo.  David, when he sang those words, knew not the depth of woman's\nlove.  And we shall have a right so to speak.  The indefeasible and\nDivine right which is bestowed by fact.\n\nAs a fact, we do not find among the ancient Jews that exalting and\npurifying ideal of the relations between man and woman, which is to\nbe found, thank God, in these days, in almost every British work of\nfiction or fancy.\n\nIt is enunciated, remember always, in the oldest Hebrew document.\nOn the very threshold of the Bible, in the very first chapters of\nGenesis, it is enunciated in its most ideal purity and perfection.\nBut in practice it was never fulfilled.  No man seems to have\nattempted to fulfil it.  Man becomes a polygamist, lower than the\nvery birds of the air.  Abraham, the father of the faithful, has his\nSarah, his princess-wife:  but he has others beside, as many as he\nwill.  And so has David in like wise, to the grief and harm of both\nhim and Abraham.\n\nSo, it would seem, had the majority of the Jews till after the\nCaptivity; and even then the law of divorce seems to have been as\nindulgent toward the man as it was unjust and cruel toward the\nwoman.  Then our blessed Lord reasserted the ideal and primaeval\nlaw.  He testified in behalf of woman, the puppet of a tyrant who\nrepudiated her upon the most frivolous pretext, and declared that in\nthe beginning God made them male and female; the one husband for the\none wife.  But his words fell on unwilling ears.  His disciples\nanswered, that if the case of a man with his wife be such, it is not\ngood for a man to marry.  And such, as a fact, was the general\nopinion of Christendom for many centuries.\n\nBut of that, as of other sayings of our Lord's, were his own words\nfulfilled, that the kingdom of God is as if a man should put seed\ninto the ground, and sleep and wake, and the seed should spring up,\nand bear fruit, he knew not how.\n\nIn due course of time, when the Teutonic nations were Christianised,\nthere sprang up among them an idea of married love, which showed\nthat our Lord's words had at last fallen on good ground, and were\ndestined to bear fruit an hundredfold.\n\nGradually, with many confusions, and sometimes sinful mistakes,\nthere arose, not in the cloister, not in the study--not even, alas!\n\n### Summary:"}

Bunny said, \"You dear little fellow, how did you get stuck\nfast in the snowdrift?\"\n\nSusan looked hard over her spectacles and said, \"Why, it is our own\ndear grandchild, Snubby Nose.\"\n\nThen Snubby Nose cried and he screamed and he howled! Bunny Cotton-Tail\nshoveled as fast as he could, and in sixteen minutes he had Snubby Nose\nout of the snowdrift. Susan put him in the wheelbarrow and wheeled him\nto the house. All the time Snubby Nose cried and he screamed and he\nhowled!\n\nSusan said, \"Go and get the big tub and we will give Snubby Nose a hot\nbath.\"\n\nBunny got the tub and some warm water and he and Susan gave Snubby Nose\na hot bath. They rubbed him dry with a soft towel, and all the time\nSnubby Nose cried and he screamed and he howled!\n\nJust at this very minute Grandpa Grumbles came in shaking the snow off\nhis fur and whiskers. He shook his green cotton umbrella. He came in\ngrumbling,\n\n     \"It's noisy here, I do declare,\n     I just came out to take the air.\"\n\nSnubby Nose stopped his noise and stared at Grandpa Grumbles. Bunny and\nSusan said, \"Sit down by the fire, Grandpa, and warm your paws.\"\nGrandpa Grumbles sat down.\n\nSnubby Nose cried, \"Grandpa Grumbles, tell us a story, please tell us a\nstory.\"\n\nBunny Cotton-Tail said, in a whisper, \"Please don't mention\n_noses_.\"\n\nSusan Cotton-Tail said, \"Please don't mention _snowdrifts_.\"\n\nGrandpa Grumbles was wet and cold, so he grumbled right out loud, \"I\nwill tell about as many _noses_ and _snowdrifts_ as I please\nin this story!\" Then Snubby Nose cried and he screamed and he howled!\n\nSusan took him up in her arms. She carried him to bed and sang him a\nnonsense song. By and by Snubby Nose fell asleep. Susan went back\ndownstairs and found Grandpa Grumbles asleep by the fire.\n\nBunny said, \"I wonder what makes him grumble so much?\"\n\nSusan said, \"T wonder what happened to Snubby Nose. He has such a funny\nlittle nose!\"\n\n_Then the most surprising thing happened!_\n\nAs they sat talking, \"thump, bump\" was heard, and Snubby Nose fell down\nstairs! He fell right on his ugly little nose and broke it!\n\n\"Get the camphor! Get the smelling salts! Help, help!\" cried Bunny and\nSusan.\n\nGrandpa Grumbles woke, up and cried,\n\n     \"Someone has a sad mishap,\n     Just when I try to take a nap.\"\n\nI do not know what in the world they would have done if Doctor\nCotton-Tail had not come in that very minute. He came in to dry his fur and\nwhiskers!\n\nHe set Snubby Nose's little ugly nose and said, \"It will not look very\npretty, but perhaps it did not look pretty before. You must wear a pink\nwrapper, and drink tea out of a pink cup, and eat pink wintergreen\ncandy!\"\n\nSnubby Nose liked the idea of wintergreen candy. He hugged Doctor\nCotton-Tail and stopped crying at once.\n\nSusan got a pink wrapper and got a pink china cup for his tea. Grandpa\nGrumbles felt in his overcoat pocket and took out sixteen pieces of\nWintergreen candy. It was pink wintergreen candy of course!\n\nSusan said to Doctor Cotton-Tail, \"How did you happen to come out in\nthis big snowstorm?\"\n\nDoctor Cotton-Tail said, \"I had a call to make, I was going to visit--\"\n\nJust then Susan began to sneeze. She sneezed so hard she nearly sneezed\nher head off!\n\nDoctor Cotton-Tail said,\n\n     \"Susan that is quite absurd,\n     Such sneezing I have never heard.\"\n\nSusan said by and by, \"I beg your pardon, what were you saying when I\nstarted to sneeze?\"\n\nDoctor Cotton-Tail said, \"I had a call, I was going to visit--\"\n\nAt this very minute Snubby Nose set up a shout, for dear Bunny\nCotton-Tail leaned too near the candle and burned one of his whiskers!\n\nThen Grandpa Grumbles shook his green cotton umbrella fiercely and\nsaid,\n\n     \"Such a noise I never heard,\n     I cannot hear a single word.\"\n\n[Illustration: \"GRANDPA GRUMBLES HAD NOT SEEN DR. COTTON-TAIL FOR TWO\nHUNDRED AND SIX YEARS\"]\n\nGrandpa Grumbles had been sitting very still in a corner and Doctor\nCotton-Tail had not seen him up to this minute. He got up and shook\nhands with him and said, \"How do you do, sir, How do you do, sir!\"\n\nGrandpa Grumbles was pleased as pleased could be. He had not seen\nDoctor Cotton-Tail for two hundred and six years! He cried out, \"How do\nyou do, sir! How do you do, sir!\"\n\nAll this time Snubby Nose sat up in his pink wrapper drinking tea out\nof a pink cup and eating pink wintergreen candy. By and by Susan said,\n\"Doctor Cotton-Tail you were going to tell us where you were going to\ncall when you came here!\"\n\nDoctor Cotton-Tail said, \"I was on my way to call on little Tippy\nToes!\"\n\n\"My fur and whiskers,\" said Bunny, \"I never had a grandchild named\nTippy Toes!\"\n\n\"Bless my buttons,\" said Susan, \"What a cute little name.\"\n\nThen Grandpa Grumbles got up waving his green cotton umbrella and\nshouted,\n\n     \"Though the stormy north wind blows,\n     I'll go with you to Tippy Toes.\"\n\nThen he and Doctor Cotton-Tail made a low bow and went out into the\nsnowstorm.\n\nDoctor Cotton-Tail called back, \"Don't forget to eat wintergreen\ncandy.\"\n\nBy this time Bunny and Susan and Snubby Nose were tired and sleepy, and\nthey all went to bed. Bunny began to snore and Susan began to snore,\nbut Snubby Nose was still wide awake.\n\nWhat do you suppose Snubby Nose did? You can give three guesses and you\nwill not guess what he did!\n\nHe got out of bed and lit a candle. He said, \"I believe I am the\nugliest little Bunny with the ugliest little nose of any Bunny alive.\"\n\nHe began to dance before the mirror. He danced this way and that way\nbefore the mirror. He danced very prettily on the tips of his toes.\nThen he made a low bow and said,\n\n     \"Who is so ugly? Nobody knows.\"\n     The mirror answered, \"Tippy Toes.\"\n\n\nThen Snubby Nose went back to bed. He said, \"To-morrow I will go and\nfind Tippy Toes.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n\nWhere do you suppose Tippy Toes was, and what do you suppose he was\ndoing? He woke up in his warm little bed at home and said, \"Oh, Ma! Oh,\nPa! I want to go and visit Bunny and Susan Cotton-Tail.\"\n\nMother Cotton-Tail laughed and said, \"You have read about Bunny\nCotton-Tail burning his paw by candle-light.\"\n\nPapa Cotton-Tail said, \"You have read about Susan's cookies!\"\n\nTippy Toes said, \"Please, may I go and visit Bunny and Susan?\"\n\nTippy Toes was a homely little Bunny. He had a very ugly little nose,\nbut he was polite. He always said, \"Thank you,\" and, \"If you please.\"\n\nMother Cotton-Tail said, \"You may go and pay a visit to Bunny and\nSusan. Go and pack your traveling bag at once.\"\n\nTippy Toes was so pleased he hugged Mother Cotton-Tail and said, \"Thank\nyou, Mother Cotton-Tail, I will go and pack my traveling bag.\"\n\nPapa Cotton-Tail said, \"I will go with you to the turn of the road.\"\n\nSoon they started merrily down the road and Mother Cotton-Tail called,\n\"Good-bye, good-bye.\"\n\nThey had only gone a few steps when Mother Cotton-Tail called, \"Come\nback, come back, you have forgotten your umbrella. What if it should\nrain?\"\n\nTippy Toes went dancing merrily back and Papa Cotton-Tail waited for\nhim. They started on again and this time Mother Cotton-Tail called,\n\"Come back, come back, you have forgotten your overshoes. What if there\nshould be a thunder storm?\"\n\nSo Tippy Toes went dancing merrily back and Papa Cotton-Tail waited for\nhim again. When they started the third time Tippy Toes said, \"We have\nnothing to go back for this time,\" but the wind whistled in his ears.\n\nMother Cotton-Tail called again, \"Come back, come back, Tippy Toes, you\nhave forgotten your red silk pocket handkerchief.\"\n\nThis time Papa Cotton-Tail went back with Tippy Toes and he said, \"Dear\nMother Cotton-Tail, do put on your thinking-cap and see if we have\nforgotten anything else, or we shall never get off.\"\n\nThen they looked high and low, but they could not find Mother\nCotton-Tail's thinking-cap!\n\nPapa Cotton-Tail said, \"Never mind, I will put on _my_ thinking-cap\ninstead.\" So he put on his red silk thinking-cap and said, \"Oh, I\nknow what we have forgotten; we have forgotten to send Bunny and Susan\na present!\"\n\n\"To be sure,\" said Mother Cotton-Tail, \"Now what shall the present be?\"\n\nLittle Tippy Toes did not get started on his journey that day, for it\ntook four days and fourteen hours for them to decide what to send Bunny\nand Susan. All this time Tippy Toes was as merry as you please. He\ndanced about on the tips of his toes and sang,\n\n     \"A present, a present, if all things go well,\n     What shall be the present? No one can tell.\"\n\nSuddenly, at breakfast next morning Mother Cotton-Tail said, \"I will go\nto town and buy Bunny and Susan a big parlor lamp.\"\n\n\"A lamp with a pink shade,\" said Tippy Toes.\n\nPapa Cotton-Tail said, \"A lamp with a tall chimney.\"\n\nMother Cotton-Tail said, \"I will buy a lamp with a pink shade and a\ntall chimney for Bunny, because he burns his paw in the candle.\"\n\nThen Tippy Toes danced this way, and he danced that way, and said, \"Oh,\nMa, may I go with you to town to help buy the lamp?\"\n\nMother Cotton-Tail said, \"Papa Cotton-Tail has to go to work. If I go\nto town and you go, too, who will tend the fire? Who will wash the\ndishes?\"\n\nTippy Toes wanted to go to town, but he was a good little Bunny, so he\nsaid,\n\n     \"Who will tend the fire? Whom do you suppose?\n     Who will wash the dishes? Little Tippy Toes.\"\n\nSo Mother Cotton-Tail put on her best sunbonnet and took her purse and\nshopping basket with her, and went off with Papa Cotton-Tail calling,\n\"Good-bye, I will be home to supper at five o'clock sharp.\"\n\nThen Tippy Toes danced a little fairylike dance before the mirror and\nsang,\n\n     \"Who is so ugly? Nobody knows.\"\n     The mirror answered, \"Snubby Nose.\"\n\nTippy Toes said, \"I have danced that dance before, and I sing that song\nvery often, but the mirror always gives me the same answer. Who is\nSnubby Nose? I wonder if he has a real ugly little nose like I have?\"\n\nThen Tippy Toes made up the fire and washed the dishes and began to get\nthings ready to cook for supper. He said, \"I do wish I could go and\nfind Snubby Nose; I wonder if Bunny and Susan can tell me about him.\"\n\n[Illustration: \"TIPPY TOES WASHED THE DISHES\"]\n\nTippy Toes sat down in front of the clock and began to count the hours\nuntil Mother Cotton-Tail would come home. He fell asleep and dreamed\nthat he saw a little Bunny exactly like himself stuck fast in a\nsnowdrift. When he woke up it was five o'clock and Papa Cotton-Tail had\njust come home.\n\nThey got supper and waited, and waited, for Mother Cotton-Tail. At\nexactly six o'clock she came in. She was an hour late.\n\nShe came on the stroke of the clock. She said, \"I have been shopping\nall day.\"\n\nMother Cotton-Tail took a wonderful lamp from her basket. It had a pink\nshade and a tall chimney.\n\nPapa Cotton-Tail said, \"If you send the lamp to Bunny I must send\nsomething to Susan. I will go to town to-morrow and get Susan a pair of\nspectacles.\"\n\nTippy Toes said, \"Oh Pa, may I go with you to town to-morrow?\"\n\nPapa Cotton-Tail said, \"Who will roll out the cookies for Mother\nCotton-Tail? Who will run her little errands all day?\"\n\nThen Tippy Toes danced this way, and he danced that way, and sang,\n\n     \"Who will do errands? Whom do you suppose?\n     Who will roll cookies? Little Tippy Toes.\"\n\nSo, they had a merry time at supper that evening and lighted the new\nlamp, and Papa Cotton-Tail read fairy tales.\n\nTippy Toes did not tell what the mirror had answered him. He kept that\nas a secret. He said to himself, \"I do wonder _who_ Snubby Nose\nis!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n\nNext day Tippy Toes woke up early and cried out, \"Oh, Mother\nCotton-Tail, it is time to wake up! Oh, Papa Cotton-Tail, it is time to\nwake up!\"\n\nSure enough it was time for Bunnies to wake up because it was sunrise.\n\nTippy Toes helped to get breakfast. He went to the well to draw water.\nHe began to sing a little fairy song,\n\n     \"Ding, dong bell,\n     Pussy's in the well.\"\n\n\"Poor Pussy, I wonder if she is still in the well,\" he said. He peeped\ndown to look into the well.\n\nPapa Cotton-Tail called, \"Hurry, hurry, it is time for breakfast.\"\n\nThen Tippy Toes drew a bucket full of water and said, \"Is poor Pussy\nstill in the well?\"\n\nPapa Cotton-Tail said, \"If you ever read your Mother Goose you would\nknow she is not in the well.\"\n\n\"Who pulled her out?\" asked Tippy Toes.\n\nMother Cotton-Tail said, \"Hush, be still, you ask too many questions!\"\n\nTippy Toes wondered all day who pulled poor Pussy out. He danced this\nway, and he danced that way, and he set the table for breakfast.\n\nHe said, \"If you are home by dinner time Papa Cotton-Tail, may I go and\nvisit Bunny and Susan?\"\n\nPapa Cotton-Tail said, \"If I get home in time with Susan's spectacles\nyou may go to-day.\"\n\nPapa Cotton-Tail put on his big fur coat and went merrily down the\nroad. Mother Cotton-Tail began to make cookies and Tippy Toes rolled\nthem out for her. Now, will you believe it? before they had a single\npan of cookies baked, Papa Cotton-Tail was back home again.\n\nMother Cotton-Tail said, \"Why are you back so soon?\"\n\nTippy Toes said, \"Did you get the spectacles already?\"\n\nPapa Cotton-Tail said, \"I met a peddler and he had a pair of black\nspectacles in his pack.\"\n\nPapa Cotton-Tail put on the black spectacles and he looked so funny\nthat Mother Cotton-Tail said, \"Let me try them on,\" and Tippy Toes\ncried, \"Please let me try them on!\"\n\nMother Cotton-Tail said, \"I will pack Bunny's lamp and Susan's\nspectacles and you may start on your long journey at once.\"\n\nTippy Toes put on his best coat and cap and kissed his mother good-bye.\nPapa Cotton-Tail went with him again to the bend of the road. Suddenly\nTippy Toes stopped still. He stopped stock-still in the road. He said,\n\"Oh, Pa, I must go back, I forgot something!\"\n\nWhat do you suppose Tippy Toes forgot?\n\nHe always danced up and down before the mirror before he went out. So,\nhe went back home, hoppity, skippity, hop; and Papa Cotton-Tail waited\nfor him at the bend of the road.\n\nTippy Toes stood before the mirror and he danced this way and he danced\nthat way and said,\n\n     \"Who is so ugly? Nobody knows.\"\n     The mirror answered, \"Snubby Nose.\"\n\nThen Tippy Toes laughed and laughed.\n\n\"I will go and find Snubby Nose,\" he said, \"for he must be as ugly as I\nam with my little turned-up nose.\"\n\nHe went running down the road and was soon off and away. The wind\nwhistled in his ears.\n\nAt that very minute he heard Papa Cotton-Tail crying, \"Hello, hello!\nCome back to the bend in the road, Tippy Toes.\"\n\nTippy Toes said to himself, \"What can Papa Cotton-Tail want? Shall I\nnever get started?\"\n\nPapa Cotton-Tail said, \"How will you know the house when you come to\nit?\"\n\nTippy Toes said, \"I will ask any one I meet.\"\n\nPapa Cotton-Tail said, \"That is right, and be sure to bow when you meet\nGrandpa Grumbles.\"\n\nThen they said \"Good-bye\" again, and Tippy Toes went merrily along. He met\nBushy-Tail, the sly old Fox. Bushy-Tail asked, \"Where are you going in\nsuch a hurry, Snubby Nose?\"\n\nThen Tippy Toes danced this way and he danced that way, and he said,\n\n     \"That is a matter I do not disclose,\n     But, sir, my name is not Snubby Nose.\"\n\n[Illustration: \"'MY NAME IS NOT SNUBBY NOSE'\"]\n\nBushy-Tail was surprised you may be sure. He said, \"Well, you and\nSnubby Nose are as much alike as two peas.\"\n\nTippy Toes bowed and said, \"Will you please tell me how I may know when\nI have passed by the house Bunny and Susan Cotton-Tail live in?\"\n\nTippy Toes did not say he was going to stop and see Bunny and Susan.\n\nBushy-Tail looked cross-eyed. He said, \"If you will tell me your name\nlittle fellow, I will take you straight to Bunny Cotton-Tail's house\nin the woods.\"\n\nI do not know what would have happened next if Grandpa Grumbles and\nDoctor Cotton-Tail had not come along.\n\nGrandpa Grumbles thought it was Snubby Nose, of course, and he shouted,\n\n     \"You're a careless Bunny, it is not funny,\n     The Doctor costs us a lot of money.\"\n\nThen whisk! Before Tippy Toes or Doctor Cotton-Tail could say a word,\nGrandpa Grumbles opened his green cotton umbrella and set Tippy Toes\ninside and carried him through the woods. The wind whistled in their\nears as they went. Grandpa Grumbles kept saying over and over to\nhimself,\n\n     \"You were ill, and it is not funny,\n     To call the Doctor and pay out money.\"\n\nTippy Toes shouted at last so loud he could be heard,\n\n     \"Grandpa, I have a funny nose,\n     But my real name is Tippy Toes.\"\n\nGrandpa Grumbles answered him,\n\n     \"Snubby Nose, you can't fool me,\n     Though I'm foolish as can be.\"\n\nThen Tippy Toes stuffed his furry little paw into his mouth to keep\nfrom laughing out loud.\n\n\"I wonder if Bunny and Susan will think I am Snubby Nose, too,\" he\nsaid. \"What fun that will be. I will visit them until Snubby Nose comes\nhome.\"\n\nBy and by they came to Bunny Cotton-Tail's house. Grandpa Grumbles set\nTippy Toes down on the doorstep and shouted,\n\n     \"The house is dark, as you can see,\n     You'll have to come and visit me.\"\n\nSo, they went on through the woods to Grandpa Grumble's house; for,\nsure enough, Bunny and Susan had gone to bed and turned out all the\nlights.\n\nWhen they got to Grandpa Grumble's house a fire was burning merrily on\nthe hearth, and they went up and warmed their paws. Tippy Toes danced\nup and down before the mirror and cried,\n\n     \"Who is so ugly? Nobody knows.\"\n     The mirror answered, \"Snubby Nose.\"\n\nGrandpa Grumbles looked at Tippy Toes over his spectacles and said, \"I\nhave not heard you cry or scream or howl for thirty minutes.\"\n\nTippy Toes did not know what this meant, for he had never cried or\nscreamed or howled in all his life.\n\nHe went up to Grandpa Grumbles and made a low bow and said, \"Dear\nGrandpa Grumbles, I want to thank you for the ride in your green cotton\numbrella.\"\n\nGrandpa Grumbles could hardly believe his ears. He grumbled,\n\n     \"You might be fooling me I suppose,\n     Except for your ugly little nose.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n\nWhat do you suppose Snubby Nose was doing all this time? He woke early\none morning and danced before the mirror and asked,\n\n     \"Who is so ugly? Nobody knows.\"\n     The mirror answered, \"Tippy Toes.\"\n\nSnubby Nose cried, \"That settles it, broken nose, or no broken nose, I\nwill go out and find Tippy Toes to-day. Perhaps he will be a fine\nplaymate for me.\"\n\nSnubby Nose crept down stairs. He ran down the road and was soon out of\nsight.\n\nBunny and Susan woke up and they looked in Snubby Nose's little bed,\nbut he was not there. They expected to hear him cry and scream and howl\nany minute. They looked in the big chair. There was the pink flannel\nwrapper but Snubby Nose was gone.\n\nBunny cried, \"My fur and whiskers, he has gone out with his broken\nnose.\"\n\nSusan cried, \"Bless my buttons, I expect to see him back any minute.\"\n\nAt that very minute Tippy Toes came tripping along, swinging his basket\nto and fro and singing a nonsense song.\n\n\"My fur and whiskers, here he comes,\" cried Bunny, \"and he is not\ncrying, but he is singing a song.\"\n\n\"Bless my buttons,\" said Susan, \"he is not crying this time.\"\n\nTippy Toes came in and said, \"Good morning Bunny and Susan, I have\nbrought you a present this fine winter morning.\"\n\nBunny and Susan could scarcely believe their ears, but Tippy Toes\nopened his basket and took out the lamp and spectacles, and Bunny and\nSusan were pleased, you may be sure.\n\nBunny lighted the lamp, saying, \"How can I ever thank you, Snubby Nose?\nNow I shall not burn my paw, as I read by candle-light.\"\n\nTippy Toes tried not to laugh when he was called \"Snubby Nose.\" He\nsaid, \"Please tell me how you burned your paw, I am never tired hearing\nabout it.\"\n\nBunny Cotton-Tail began, \"Once when I was young--\"\n\n\"Rap-a-tap\" was heard on the door, and Tippy Toes was so polite he went\nto the door and brought the milk in.\n\nTippy Toes curled up then at Bunny Cotton-Tail's feet and begged, \"Do\ntell me now why you liked to read by candlelight.\"\n\nBunny Cotton-Tail began again, \"Once when I was young--\"\n\n\"Rap-a-tap\" sounded on the door.\n\nTippy Toes went and let in the Grocer boy. He curled up again at Bunny\nCotton-Tail's feet and said, \"Now Bunny, please tell me the story.\"\n\nBunny Cotton-Tail began again, \"Once, when I was young--\"\n\n_Then the most surprising thing happened!_\n\nSoot began to pour down the chimney. It flew all over the room. It\ncovered the carpet and furniture and pictures.\n\nBunny shouted, \"My fur and whiskers, what can be the matter?\"\n\nSusan said, \"Bless my buttons, there is soot all over the room.\" Tippy\nToes danced on this foot, and danced on that foot, and said,\n\n     \"Let me go up the chimney because,\n     I think it may be Santa Claus.\"\n\nThen Bunny and Susan laughed, but soon Bunny Cotton-Tail coughed, and\nSusan sneezed, so Tippy Toes knew something must be done at once. He\nran outdoors and looked up at the chimney.\n\nThere was Bushy-Tail, the sly old Fox acting as a chimney-sweep. He was\nsweeping the chimney with his long, beautiful tail.\n\n[Illustration: \"HE WAS SWEEPING THE CHIMNEY WITH HIS LONG, BEAUTIFUL\nTAIL\"]\n\nTippy Toes cried, \"Please come down and I will show you how to dance.\"\nBushy-Tail was surprised you may be sure. He thought it was Snubby\nNose, and Snubby Nose never said, \"Please.\"\n\nHe jumped off the roof with a bound and howled, \"Oh, ho! So you will\nshow me how to dance, will you?\"\n\nThen Bushy-Tail chased Tippy Toes away and away and away in the woods.\n\nTippy Toes said to himself,\n\n     \"I'm in a corner without a doubt,\n     But if I keep cheerful I will get out.\"\n\nAt that very minute they met old Grandpa Grumbles. He said,\n\n     \"It is getting cold I've heard it said,\n     Bushy-Tail where are your mittens, red?\"\n\n_Then the most surprising thing happened!_\n\nBushy-Tail gave a howl and ran away as fast as his legs could carry\nhim.\n\n\"What does it all mean?\" asked Tippy Toes.\n\nGrandpa Grumbles replied, \"Why, Snubby Nose, you have a poor memory if\nyou have forgotten about the red mittens. Don't you remember that Santa\nClaus gave Bushy-Tail a pair of magic mittens?\"\n\nTippy Toes said, politely, \"Please tell me about it.\"\n\nGrandpa Grumbles said, \"Bushy-Tail put on the red magic mittens and\nthey pinched his paws.\"\n\n\"Ha, ha, ha!\" laughed Tippy Toes, \"How long did he have to wear those\nmittens?\" Grandpa Grumbles answered,\n\n     \"Really, now, I cannot say,\n     But I guess it was a year and a day.\"\n\nThen Tippy Toes laughed so hard that he doubled right up in a little\nball and rolled over and over.\n\n\"Come, come,\" said Grandpa Grumbles, \"You had better go back to see\nBunny and Susan, they may think Bushy-Tail has eaten you up.\"\n\nSo they traveled back together to see Bunny and Susan. When they came\nto the house there was soot on everything. There was soot on the carpet\nand furniture and pictures. There was soot on the new lamp, and on\nSusan's spectacles.\n\nGrandpa Grumbles shouted,\n\n     \"You are careless folks, I do declare,\n     To let the soot blow everywhere.\"\n\nBunny Cotton-Tail coughed, and Susan sneezed, and Grandpa Grumbles\nsaid,\n\n     \"Into the kitchen, one, seven, three,\n     You are as careless as can be.\"\n\nHe made Bunny and Susan go into the kitchen; then he said to Tippy\nToes,\n\n     \"Come, get a broom and an apron or two,\n     We'll clean this room, that's what we'll do.\"\n\nSoon Grandpa Grumbles and Tippy Toes had everything out of the room. It\ndid not take long to make it as clean as a pin.\n\nGrandpa Grumbles looked hard at Tippy Toes.\n\n\"How does your nose feel?\" he asked. \"Come, sir, why don't you cry any\nmore?\"\n\nTippy Toes danced this way, and danced that way, and sang to the big\nmirror that hung on the wall,\n\n     \"Who is so ugly? Nobody knows.\"\n     The mirror answered, \"Snubby Nose.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n\n\"My fur and whiskers, the room is all clean!\" Bunny Cotton-Tail cried.\n\nSusan Cotton-Tail cried, \"Bless my buttons, everything is in order.\"\n\nGrandpa Grumbles said,\n\n     \"There is a mystery in the air,\n     There is something strange, I do declare.\"\n\nTippy Toes cried, \"Good night Bunny and Susan, good night dear Grandpa\nGrumbles,\" and he danced this way, and danced that way, and he danced\nhimself right up to bed.\n\n\"How polite he is,\" said Bunny Cotton-Tail. Susan said, \"He does not\nseem to mind when we speak of noses!\"\n\nGrandpa Grumbles said, \"He does not cry any more.\"\n\nThey all sat by the fire warming their paws. Grandpa Grumbles was\nthinking. At last he said to Bunny and Susan, \"One day I heard Snubby\nNose talking as he stood before a mirror, and he said,\"\n\n     \"Who is so ugly? Nobody knows.\"\n     The mirror answered, \"Tippy Toes.\"\n\nNow this Little Cotton-Tail dances before the mirror, and he says,\n\n     \"Who is so ugly? Nobody knows.\"\n     The mirror answers, \"Snubby Nose.\"\n\n\"Snubby Nose, Tippy Toes,\" repeated Bunny and Susan over and over as\nthey warmed their paws by the fire.\n\nBy and by Grandpa Grumbles said, talking very fast, \"Suppose there were\ntwo little Cotton-Tails, one named Snubby Nose, and one named Tippy\nToes, suppose--just suppose they looked as much alike as two peas.\"\n\nBunny Cotton-Tail said, \"My fur and whiskers, it seems like a fairy\ntale, but Snubby Nose always cried, and this little Cotton-Tail is so\npolite.\"\n\nSusan cried, \"Hark! I hear a rap-a-tap, who can be coming at this hour\nof the night?\"\n\nThe door opened; in fell Snubby Nose in a heap, and he cried and he\nscreamed and he howled!\n\nBunny and Susan and Grandpa Grumbles cried, \"Hush, be still, stop\ncrying, and tell us what is the matter.\"\n\nGrandpa Grumbles asked, \"Did you hurt your ugly little nose?\"\n\nThen Snubby Nose cried and he screamed and he howled louder than ever.\n\nBunny asked, \"Did you get stuck fast in another snowdrift?\"\n\nSnubby Nose cried so loudly that they did not hear the \"patter, patter,\npatter\" of little feet. They did not know that Tippy Toes was coming\ndown the staircase. Tippy Toes came dancing into the room, singing at\nthe top of his lungs,\n\n     \"Who is so ugly? Nobody knows.\"\n     The mirror answers, \"Snubby Nose?\"\n\nThen for one single minute Snubby Nose was still. He looked at Tippy\nToes. He looked him up and down.\n\nTippy Toes kissed him on both cheeks and nearly hugged the life out of\nhim.\n\nBunny and Susan and Grandpa Grumbles said, \"They are as much alike as\ntwo peas. They both have ugly noses!\"\n\nWhen Snubby Nose heard them speak of _noses_ he cried and he\nscreamed and he howled!\n\nTippy Toes said, \"Don't care about your nose. People know you wherever\nyou go.\"\n\nSnubby Nose pricked up his ears and asked, \"Don't you mind about your\nugly nose at all.\"\n\nTippy Toes danced this way and he danced that way and answered,\n\n     \"I don't mind noses, for you see,\n     I am polite as I can be.\"\n\nThen Snubby Nose stopped crying and hugged Tippy Toes and said, \"I am\nso glad to find you, Tippy Toes. How do you make up those funny little\nrhymes. They tickle my eardrums.\"\n\nAll this time Grandpa Grumbles was thumping on the floor with his\numbrella. He made such a noise that Bunny said, \"Hush, listen, Grandpa\nGrumbles has something to say.\"\n\nSusan said, \"Hush, be still, Grandpa Grumbles wants to speak.\"\n\nAt last Snubby Nose and Tippy Toes stopped talking and dancing, and\nthey all listened to Grandpa Grumbles. He said,\n\n     \"I want you both to come and stay,\n     With Grandpa Grumbles a year and a day.\"\n\nTippy Toes answered, \"Thank you, Grandpa Grumbles, I will come and\nvisit you for a year and a day,\" but Snubby Nose cried and he screamed\nand he howled.\n\nI don't know what would have happened next, but Grandpa Grumbles went\noutside, and opened wide his green cotton umbrella, and invited Snubby\nNose and Tippy Toes to step inside.\n\nThey did so, and in less time than it takes to tell it they were\nsailing away with Grandpa Grumbles in his green cotton umbrella!\n\n[Illustration: \"THEY WERE SAILING AWAY WITH GRANDPA GRUMBLES\"]\n\nBunny and Susan said, \"How will he ever get along with Snubby Nose for\na year and a day? We wish Tippy Toes was back. He was such a good\nlittle fellow.\"\n\nSusan picked up the pink wrapper and Bunny picked up the pink cup and\nsaucer. Bunny Cotton-Tail said, \"We will have a long quiet evening\nalone.\"\n\n\"Don't be too sure of that,\" sang the wind as it whistled down the\nchimney.\n\nSusan said, \"I will put on my new spectacles and we will read by the\nnew lamp.\"\n\n_Then the most surprising thing happened!_\n\nThe Seventeen Little Bears came tumbling in the doors and windows!\nThey came in laughing and shouting,\n\n     \"The Circus Cotton-Tails you see\n     Are just as funny as can be.\"\n\nThey got out their seventeen little stools and sat by the fire.\n\nBunny and Susan said, \"What do you know about the Circus Cotton-Tails?\"\n\nThe Seventeen Little Bears said,\n\n     \"You only see them now at Fairs,\n     But we've become the Circus Bears.\"\n\n\"Have you got a Circus tent? Have you got a merry-go-round?\" asked\nBunny and Susan. \"Do tell us how long you have been Circus Bears.\"\n\nThe Seventeen Little Bears got on top of their seventeen little stools\nand shouted, \"We have just become Circus Bears today, that is the\nreason we came tumbling in the door and windows.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n\nThe Seventeen Little Bears woke up early next morning. They all\nwhispered together so they would not wake Bunny and Susan.\n\nThe Seventeen Little Bears tiptoed very softly out of bed, and\n\"pitter-patter, pitter-patter\" went their little feet down the stairs.\n\n     \"We can stew, we can bake,\n     If we make no mistake.\"\n\nThey made the fire and began to stew and bake. They made coffee and\nfried sausages and cakes. By and by Bunny and Susan woke up.\n\n\"My fur and whiskers, I smell something cooking,\" said Bunny.\n\nSusan said, \"Bless my buttons, I smell something cooking, too.\"\n\nThe Seventeen Little Bears said, \"Ha, ha, ha! Bunny is talking about\nhis fur and whiskers. Ha, ha, ha! Susan is talking about her buttons.\nWe will give old Bunny and Susan something new to talk about!\"\n\nThe Seventeen Little Bears shouted at the top of their lungs,\n\n     \"We are Circus Bears, as all can see,\n     The merry-go-round waits you and me.\"\n\nSusan called, \"Hurry, hurry, hurry! Bunny do get dressed! Let us see\nwhat the Seventeen Little Bears mean. How I do love to ride in a\nmerry-go-round!\"\n\nWhen Bunny and Susan got downstairs they were surprised to see a fine\nbreakfast ready for them all on the table. They all sat down and had a\nvery merry time.\n\nAfter breakfast the Seventeen Little Bears began to practice their\ntricks. They slid on the banister and came downstairs head first.\n\nSoon they were all crying, \"Oh,\" and \"Ah, how I hurt my head;\" and\n\"Oh,\" and \"Ah, how I hurt my toes!\"\n\nBunny cried, \"Bring the camphor! Bring the smelling salts, while they\nare practicing their tricks!\"\n\nSusan Cotton-Tail sat down in the corner. She wiped her eyes.\n\nBunny said, \"Have you lost your spectacles?\"\n\nSusan Cotton-Tail said, \"Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear!\"\n\nThe Seventeen Little Bears all came crowding around Susan to see what\nwas the matter.\n\nSusan still rocked to and fro and said, \"Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear!\"\n\nBunny said, \"Will you never tell us what is the matter?\" Susan said\nfinally,\n\n     \"I have some pride, but thought to ride,\n     In the merry-go-round, above the ground.\"\n\nThen the Seventeen Little Bears all turned somersaults at once, and\nSusan cried, \"Stop them, stop them, or they will break their little\nbones.\"\n\n_Then the most surprising thing happened!_\n\nThe Seventeen Little Bears made a low bow and said,\n\n     \"In the merry-go-round we'll go,\n     Laughing gayly, ha, ha, ho, ho!\"\n\nThey ran out the back door and Bunny and Susan went after them. There\nstood a neat little merry-go-round, as fine as you please.\n\n\"Where?\" and \"How?\" and \"Why?\" and \"Please tell us about it,\" said\nBunny and Susan.\n\nThe Seventeen Little Bears replied,\n\n     \"Get inside, and have a ride,\n     Bunny and Susan, side by side.\"\n\nThey all jumped into the merry-go-round and rode in seats side by\nside. Round and round and round they went.\n\nBunny waved his hat and Susan waved her red sunbonnet! The Seventeen\nLittle Bears shouted, \"Hurrah, hurrah!\"\n\nThey went faster and faster. Bunny said, \"I am afraid the wind will\nblow off my fur and whiskers.\"\n\nSusan said, \"The wind will blow off my spectacles.\"\n\nFaster, faster, faster they went! Would they never stop?\n\nThe Seventeen Little Bears said,\n\n     \"This is a very funny business,\n     It gives us all a little dizziness.\"\n\nFaster, faster, faster they went! It began to rain. First the rain fell\nwith a few drops, then it came down in sheets. My! how wet they were!\n\nFaster, faster, faster went the merry-go-round.\n\nSuddenly Bushy-Tail ran and jumped right into the merry-go-round and\nsaid, \"What will you give me if I stop the merry-go-round?\"\n\nBunny said, \"I will give you a warm seat by the fire, sir.\"\n\nSusan said, \"I will give you a basket of cookies.\"\n\nThe Seventeen Little Bears said, \"We will give you seventeen pieces of\npeppermint candy.\"\n\n\"Help, help, help!\" they all cried, \"Do stop the merry-go-round!\"\n\nBushy-Tail looked as saucy as you please.\n\n\"I can ride faster than this,\" he said, \"I was brought up in a\nmerry-go-round. I want Snubby Nose and Tippy Toes to come and pay me\na visit.\"\n\nBushy-Tail said no more, and Bunny saw there was no use to mince\nmatters, and the rain was coming down harder and harder.\n\nBunny said, \"If Snubby Nose and Tippy Toes want to pay you a visit I\nhave no objection.\"\n\nThen the merry-go-round went slower and slower, and slower, and finally\nstopped.\n\nBushy-Tail said, \"Go get Snubby Nose and Tippy Toes for me or _I will\neat you all up!_\"\n\nThey all went into the house. They pretended to look for Snubby Nose\nand Tippy Toes, though they knew they had gone away. They looked in\nevery nook and corner, but knew well enough that Snubby Nose and Tippy\nToes had gone sailing away with Grandpa Grumbles.\n\nBushy-Tail was angry. He went down the road calling, \"Woo, woo, woo!\"\nHe would not even stop for his basket of cookies.\n\nBushy-Tail called back,\n\n     \"Where they have gone to nobody knows,\n     I'll find Snubby Nose and Tippy Toes.\"\n\nBunny and Susan said, \"We are glad to get out of the merry-go-round,\nbut we must send word to Grandpa Grumbles not to let Snubby Nose and\nTippy Toes out. Who will carry the message?\"\n\nThe First Little Bear said, \"It is so far to go.\"\n\nThe Second Little Bear said, \"I am all out of breath.\"\n\nThe Third Little Bear said, \"Oh wait 'till to-morrow.\"\n\nNow, will you believe it? The Seventeen Little Bears sat on their\nseventeen little stools as though, nothing had happened!\n\nBunny and Susan got ready to go out in the rain. They took their\nraincoats and caps and umbrellas. They went to Grandpa Grumbles' house.\n\nThe Seventeen Little Bears said in a sing-song way,\n\n     \"We really are not quite polite,\n     We're selfish as can be,\n     We sit on stools around the fire,\n     Just singing merrily!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n\nWhen Snubby Nose and Tippy Toes rode home with Grandpa Grumbles in his\ngreen cotton umbrella they sang a merry song,\n\n     \"Oh, ho! It is fun to go riding along,\n     Singing and whistling a right merry song.\"\n\nThe umbrella came to the chimney of Grandpa Grumbles' house. It began\nto close up a little.\n\n\"Help, help!\" cried Snubby Nose, \"we shall be squeezed to death!\"\n\nTippy Toes sat very still. He made himself as small as possible.\n\nGrandpa Grumbles said,\n\n     \"Down my chimney every one goes,\n     How we shall travel the umbrella knows!\"\n\nThen whisk! Before they could wink an eyelash they were safely down the\nchimney.\n\nSnubby Nose cried and he screamed and he howled!\n\nTippy Toes danced this way, and he danced that way, and said, \"Oh,\nGrandpa Grumbles, how I enjoyed the ride!\"\n\nGrandpa Grumbles said,\n\n     \"Off to bed when the merry winds blow,\n     So back up the chimney old Grandpa can go.\"\n\nSnubby Nose said, \"You are not going to leave us alone in this house\nare you?\" Then he cried and he screamed and he howled!\n\nTippy Toes danced this way, and danced that way, and before they could\nsay another word, whisk! up the chimney old Grandpa Grumbles was off\nand away. He went off to ride in his green cotton umbrella.\n\nTippy Toes kissed Snubby Nose and led him before the mirror, singing,\n\n     \"Who will visit us to-day?\"\n\nThe mirror answered,\n\n     \"Bushy-Tail is on his way.\"\n\nSnubby Nose said, \"What fun it is to have the mirror talk. Come, let us\nbolt the doors and windows. We will not let Bushy-Tail in.\"\n\nThey danced again before the mirror and sang,\n\n     \"We're locked in safely, that we know,\"\n\nThe mirror said,\n\n     \"Down the chimney he can go.\"\n\nSnubby Nose and Tippy Toes said, \"Oh\" and \"Ah,\" and \"Oh\" and \"Ah.\" \"We\nnever thought of the chimney! What shall we do with the chimney?\"\n\nThey built a roaring fire, and none too soon, for they could hear the\n\"patter, patter, patter\" of feet upon the roof.\n\nBushy-Tail climbed down from the roof. He looked in at the window and\nsaid, \"Please let me in, please let me in.\"\n\nSnubby Nose and Tippy Toes sat as still as they could in their little\nchairs by the fire and never winked an eyelash.\n\nBushy-Tail said, \"Let me in or I will come down the chimney, fire or no\nfire.\"\n\nThen Snubby Nose coughed and Tippy Toes sneezed.\n\nBushy-Tail climbed the roof once more. Out came the smoke in great\npuffs. He gave it up and then went away down the path growling every\nstep of the way.\n\nAll this time Bunny and Susan were coming nearer every minute. They\nsaid, \"What if we should meet Bushy-Tail?\"\n\nIn less time than it takes to tell it, Bushy-Tail came down the bend of\nthe road scolding and waving his beautiful tail to and fro.\n\nHe howled, \"Bring out Snubby Nose, bring out Tippy Toes or _I will\neat you up_.\"\n\nI do not know what in the world would have happened if Grandpa Grumbles\nhad not come sailing along just then. He came sailing down in his green\ncotton umbrella and said, looking hard at Bushy-Tail,\n\n     \"Jump inside and have a ride,\n     There's room for you and me beside.\"\n\nBushy-Tail jumped into the umbrella. He was pleased you may be sure.\nThey rode away, and away, and away, over houses, over tree-tops, and\nover a big blue lake. Then they began to sail slowly down, down, down.\n\nBushy-Tail said, \"Oh, Grandpa Grumbles, don't land us in the lake! Oh,\nGrandpa Grumbles, look out what you are doing!\"\n\nGrandpa Grumbles then said loudly,\n\n     \"Speak into my better ear,\n     I am so deaf I cannot hear.\"\n\nBushy-Tail cried out as loud as he could, \"Oh, Grandpa Grumbles, we are\ngoing down into the lake! Look out, look out! We shall be drowned!\"\n\nGrandpa Grumbles shouted,\n\n     \"Speak a little louder, please,\n     Shall we sail above the trees?\"\n\nBushy-Tail got so excited he did not know what he was doing. He got\nright out of the umbrella and went splash, dash, into the lake.\n\n[Illustration: \"BUSHY-TAIL WENT SPLASH, DASH, INTO THE LAKE\"]\n\nGrandpa Grumbles, as he sailed homeward, said,\n\n     \"Sink or swim, just as you please,\n     For I have no desire to tease.\"\n\nHe left poor Bushy-Tail to swim to shore.\n\nWhen Grandpa Grumbles got home he saw smoke coming out of his chimney.\nHe grumbled,\n\n     \"It seems to me quite like a bore,\n     To have to enter by the door.\"\n\nHe was so used to sailing down the chimney!\n\nThe door opened for him and there stood Bunny and Susan. Snubby Nose\nand Tippy Toes danced up to him and told him how Bushy-Tail had tried\nto get in.\n\nGrandpa Grumbles shook his green umbrella fiercely and said,\n\n     \"He will not come this way again,\n     Either in sunshine or in rain.\"\n\nThen Bunny and Susan and Snubby Nose and Tippy Toes begged Grandpa\nGrumbles to tell what had become of Bushy-Tail, but Grandpa Grumbles\nwould only say,\n\n     \"I am so deaf 'tis hard to hear,\n     Come, speak a little louder, dear.\"\n\nThen Bunny spoke into his right ear, and Susan spoke into his left ear,\nand asked him to tell where he had left Bushy-Tail.\n\nGrandpa Grumbles shook his head and said,\n\n     \"Bunny and Susan, what do you say?\n     I am so old and deaf to-day.\"\n\nThen Snubby Nose cried into his right ear, and Tippy Toes cried into\nhis left ear, but Grandpa Grumbles only said,\n\n     \"I can't hear, my deafness grows;\n     Ask the umbrella, for it knows.\"\n\nThen the Cotton-Tails asked the umbrella what had become of Bushy-Tail\nand the umbrella said,\n\n     \"Bushy-Tail went swimming away,\n     But he'll come back in a year and a day.\"\n\n\"Oh\" and \"Ah\" and \"Oh\" and \"Ah,\" cried all the little Cotton-Tails,\n\"Bushy-Tail is swimming away is he?\"\n\nThey all went merrily to bed.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n\nThe next morning Grandpa Grumbles called out,\n\n     \"The Cotton-Tails are all in bed,\n     Every one is a sleepy-head.\"\n\n\"My fur and whiskers, we have overslept,\" said Bunny Cotton-Tail. \"It\nis nine o'clock by my little silver watch.\"\n\n\"Bless my buttons,\" cried Susan, \"I meant to get up and get breakfast.\"\n\nTippy Toes was the first down stairs after Grandpa Grumbles. He danced\nthis way and he danced that way, and set the table for breakfast.\n\nGrandpa Grumbles had a fine breakfast ready. They all sat down except\nSnubby Nose. Grandpa Grumbles said,\n\n     \"Where is Snubby Nose? 'tis plain,\n     He must have gone to sleep again.\"\n\nNow, what do you suppose happened next? Grandpa Grumbles went upstairs\nand took Snubby Nose by the feet and dragged him out of bed. He made\nhim dress in a hurry and come down to breakfast! All the time Snubby\nNose cried and he screamed and he howled!\n\nBunny and Susan and Grandpa Grumbles soon finished their breakfast.\nThey went for a walk but Tippy Toes sat at the table and said, \"Oh,\nSnubby Nose, why do you cry so much? I have just as ugly a nose as you\nhave.\"\n\nThen Snubby Nose stopped crying. He stared at Tippy Toes. Sure enough,\nTippy Toes had a very ugly nose.\n\nSnubby Nose shouted, \"Pass me the cream! Pass me the butter! Pass me\nthe bread! Can't you see I am starving?\"\n\nThe mirror spoke up suddenly,\n\n     \"Snubby Nose it's no use to tease,\n     You might say, 'Thank you,' and 'if you please.'\"\n\nTippy Toes slipped down from his chair and ran out after Bunny and\nSusan.\n\nSnubby Nose cried and he screamed and he howled! He reached for the\nsugar bowl and it sailed away in the air! He reached for the bread and\nbutter but they went farther out of his reach. He was very hungry and\nhe cried and he screamed and he howled, but there was no one to answer\nhim. By and by he danced before the mirror and said,\n\n     \"Mirror, mirror, I'll be good,\n     And speak politely as I should.\"\n\nThe mirror said,\n\n     \"If you say, 'Thank you' I suppose,\n     You'll be loved like Tippy Toes.\"\n\n_Then the most surprising thing happened!_\n\nSnubby Nose said, \"Thank you for a bowl of milk.\" The milk stood at his\nplate. Then he said, \"Thank you for cookies and sugar and pie.\" The\ncookies and sugar and pie stood by his plate. He had never had so much\nfun before in all his life. He kept on ordering things and they came\nbefore him.\n\nBy and by Snubby Nose cleared off the table and washed the dishes,\nsaying over and over,\n\n     \"I must forget to try to tease,\n     I will say, 'Thank you' and 'If you Please.'\"\n\nAt this very minute in came the Seventeen Little Bears. They cried,\n\n     \"Hurrah, hurrah, old Snubby Nose!\n     What has happened, do you suppose?\"\n\nSnubby Nose made a low bow and said, \"If you please I should like to\nknow what has happened.\"\n\nThe Seventeen Little Bears stared at Snubby Nose. They had never seen\nhim so polite before.\n\nThey said, \"We met Bunny and Susan and Grandpa Grumbles and they said\nwe could go up in the garret and get skates and go skating.\"\n\nNo sooner said than done. Up to the garret danced the Seventeen Little\nBears. They found seventeen pairs of skates and danced out again.\n\nSnubby Nose was left alone in the house. He forgot to be polite. He\ncried and he screamed and he howled!\n\nThe mirror said,\n\n     \"If you're polite, as you should be,\n     Perhaps a pair of skates you'll see.\"\n\nSnubby Nose looked about the house. He looked high and low, but he\ncould not find any skates. He rubbed his eyes and he rubbed his little\nred nose. He put on his cap and mittens and went to the pond. Tippy\nToes came to meet him. He had two pairs of skates and cried,\n\n     \"Where were you so long, goodness knows,\n     Here are your skates. Come Snubby Nose.\"\n\nHe kissed Snubby Nose on both cheeks.\n\nThe Seventeen Little Bears sat on the bank trying to fasten their\nskates. Their little paws got colder and colder every minute. Snubby\nNose helped them fasten their skates and Tippy Toes helped them too.\nThen they put on their own skates and went skating away, and away, and\naway.\n\nBy and by Bunny and Susan said,\n\n     \"'Tis rather sad now to relate,\n     We are too old and stiff to skate.'\"\n\nGrandpa Grumbles said,\n\n     \"Chilly business this sport I think,\n     Let's go roller-skating in a rink.\"\n\nBunny and Susan said they must really go home and Grandpa Grumbles said\nhe, too, would go to his own home.\n\n### Summary:"}

[Price 2_d_.\n\nVol. XII\n\n[Illustration: KINGSTON NEW BRIDGE]\n\n\n\n\nKINGSTON NEW BRIDGE.\n\nThrough many a bridge the wealthy river roll'd.\nSOUTHEY.\n\nThe annexed picturesque engraving represents the new bridge[1] from\nKingston-upon-Thames to Hampton-Wick, in the royal manor of Hampton\nCourt. It is built of Portland stone, and consists of five elliptical\narches, the centre arch being 60 feet span by 19 in height, and the side\narches 56 and 52 feet span respectively. The abutments are terminated by\ntowers or bastions, and the whole is surmounted by a cornice and\nbalustrade, with galleries projecting over the pier; which give a bold\nrelief to the general elevation. The length of the bridge is 382 feet by\n27 feet in width. It is of chaste Grecian architecture, from the design\nof Mr. Lapidge, to whose courtesy we are indebted for the original of\nour engraving. The building contract was undertaken by Mr. Herbert for\nL26,800. and the extra work has not exceeded L100. a very rare, if not\nan unprecedented occurrence in either public or private undertakings of\nthis description. The first stone was laid by the Earl of Liverpool,\nNovember 7, 1825, and the bridge was opened in due form by her royal\nhighness the Duchess of Clarence, on July 17, 1828.\n\nKingston is one of the most picturesque towns on the banks of the\nThames; and its antiquarian attractions are of the highest order. It was\noccupied by the Romans, and in aftertimes it was either a royal\nresidence or a royal demesne, so early as the union of the Saxon\nHeptarchy; for there is a record extant of a council held there in 838,\nat which Egbert, the first king of all England, and his son Athelwolf\nwere present; and in this record it is styled _Kyningenstum famosa ilia\nlocus_. Some of our Saxon kings were also crowned here; and adjoining\nthe church is a large stone, on which, according to tradition, they were\nplaced during the ceremony. Many interesting relics have from time to\ntime been discovered in illustration of these historical facts, and till\nthe year 1730, the figures of some of the above kings and that of king\nJohn (who chartered the town) were preserved in a chapel adjoining the\nabove spot. In that year, however, the chapel fell, and with it were\ndemolished the royal _effigies_.[2] Mr. Lysons, with his usual accuracy,\nenumerates nine kings who were crowned here.\n\nKingston formerly sent members to parliament, till, by petition, the\ninhabitants prayed to be relieved from the burden!\n\nAt Hampton Wick, the village on the opposite bank, resided the witty but\nprofligate Sir Richard Steele, in a house which he whimsically\ndenominated \"the hovel;\" and \"from the Hovel at Hampton Wick, April 7,\n1711,\" he dedicated the fourth volume of the _Tatler_ to Charles, Lord\nHalifax. This was probably about the time he became surveyor of the\nroyal stables at Hampton Court, governor of the king's comedians, a\njustice of the peace for Middlesex, and a knight.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\nARCHBISHOPS OF CANTERBURY.\n\nThe first Archbishop of Canterbury was Austin, appointed by King\nEthelbert, on his conversion to Christianity, about the year 598. Before\nthe coming of the Saxons into England, the Christian Britons had three\nArchbishops, viz. of London, York, and Caerleon, an ancient city of\nSouth Wales. The Britons being driven out of these parts, the\nArchbishoprick of London became extinct; and when Pope Gregory the Great\nhad afterwards sent thither Augustine, and his fellow-labourer to preach\nthe Gospel to the then heathen Saxons, the Archiepiscopal See was\nplanted at Canterbury, as being the metropolis of the kingdom of Kent,\nwhere King Ethelbert had received the same St. Augustine, and with his\nkingdom was baptized, and embraced the doctrines of Christianity before\nthe rest of the Heptarchy. The other Archbishoprick of Caerleon was\ntranslated to St. David's in Pembrokeshire, and afterwards wholly to the\nSee of Canterbury; since which, all England and Wales reckon but two\nArchbishops, Canterbury and York. The following Archbishops have died at\nLambeth Palace;--Wittlesey, in 1375; Kemp, 1453; Dean, 1504; all buried\nin Canterbury Cathedral: Cardinal Pole, 1558, after lying in state here\n40 days was buried at Canterbury; Parker, 1575, buried in Lambeth\nChapel; Whitgift, 1604, buried at Croydon; Bancroft, 1610, buried at\nLambeth; Juxon, 1663, buried in the chapel of St. John's College,\nOxford; Sheldon, 1667, buried at Croydon; Tillotson, 1694, buried in the\nchurch of St. Laurence Jewry, London; Tennison, 1715; and Potter, 1747,\nboth buried at Croydon; Seeker, 1768; Cornwallis, 1783, and Moore,\n1805, all buried at Lambeth. In 1381, the Archbishop, Simon of Sudbury,\nfell a victim to Wat Tyler and his crew, when they attacked Lambeth\nPalace.\n\nP. T. W.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\nDAYS OF FLY FISHING.\n\nThat an ex-president (Sir Humphry Davy) of the Royal Society should\nwrite a book on field sports may at first sight appear rather\n_unphilosophical_; although it is not more fanciful than Bishop\nBerkeley's volume on tar water, Bishop Watson's improvement in the\nmanufacture of gunpowder, Sir Walter Scott writing a sermon, or a Scotch\nminister inventing a safety gun, and, as we are told, _presenting_ the\nsame to the King in person. Be this as it may, since our first\nacquaintance with the \"prince of piscators,\" the patriarch of anglers,\nIsaak Walton, it has seldom been our lot to meet with so pleasant a\nvolume as _Salmonia, or Days of Fly Fishing_, to whose contents we are\nabout to introduce our readers.\n\nIn our last number we gave a _flying_ extract, entitled, \"Superstitions\non the Weather,\" being a fair specimen of the very agreeable manner of\nthe digressions in the above work, which is, perhaps, less practical\nthan it might have been; but this defect is more than atoned for in the\nauthor's felicitous mode of intermingling with the main subject, some of\nthe most curious facts and phenomena in natural history and philosophy\nso as to familiarize the angler with many causes and effects which\naltogether belong to a higher class of reading than that of mere\namusement. All this, too, is done in a simple, graceful, and flowing\nstyle, always amusive, and sometimes humorously illustrative--advantages\nwhich our philosophical writers do not generally exhibit, but which are\nmore or less evident in every page of Sir Humphry Davy's writings.\n\n_Salmonia_ consists of a series of conversations between four\ncharacters--Halieus,[3] Poietes, Physicus, Ornither. In the \"First Day\"\nwe have an ingenious vindication of fly fishing against the well-known\nsatire of Johnson[4] and Lord Byron, and the following:--\n\n_Halieus._--A noble lady, long distinguished at court for pre-eminent\nbeauty and grace, and whose mind possesses undying charms, has written\nsome lines in my copy of Walton, which, if you will allow me, I will\nrepeat to you:--\n\nAlbeit, gentle Angler, I\n  Delight not in thy trade,\nYet in thy pages there doth lie\nSo much of quaint simplicity,\n    So much of mind,\n    Of such good kind.\n  That none need be afraid,\nCaught by thy cunning bait, this book,\nTo be ensnared on thy hook.\n\nGladly from thee, I'm lur'd to bear\n  With things that seem'd most vile before,\nFor thou didst on poor subjects rear\nMatter the wisest sage might hear.\n    And with a grace,\n    That doth efface\n  More laboured works, thy simple lore\nCan teach us that thy skilful _lines_,\nMore than the scaly brood _confines_.\n\nOur hearts and senses too, we see,\n  Rise quickly at thy master hand,\nAnd ready to be caught by thee\nAre lured to virtue willingly.\n    Content and peace,\n    With health and ease,\n  Walk by thy side. At thy command\nWe bid adieu to worldly care.\nAnd joy in gifts that all may share.\n\nGladly with thee, I pace along.\n  And of sweet fancies dream;\nWaiting till some inspired song,\nWithin my memory cherished long,\n    Comes fairer forth.\n    With more of worth;\n  Because that time upon its stream\nFeathers and chaff will bear away,\nBut give to gems a brighter ray.\n\nAnd though the charming and intellectual author of this poem is not an\nangler herself, yet I can quote the example of her lovely daughters to\nvindicate fly fishing from the charge of cruelty, and to prove that the\nmost delicate and refined minds can take pleasure in this innocent\namusement.\n\nGay's passionate love for angling is well known; it was his principal\noccupation in the summer at Amesbury; and \"the late excellent John\nTobin, author of the _Honey Moon_, was an ardent angler.\" Among heroes,\nTrajan was fond of angling. Nelson was a good fly-fisher, and continued\nthe pursuit even with his left hand; and, says the author, \"I have known\na person who fished with him at Merton, in the Wandle. Dr. Paley was so\nmuch attached to this amusement, that when the Bishop of Durham inquired\nof him when one of his most important works would be finished, he said,\nwith great simplicity and good-humour, 'My lord, I shall work steadily\nat it when the fly-fishing season is over.'\"--Then we have a poetical\ndescription of river scenery, till two of the party arrive at the\nfollowing conclusions:--\n\nI have already admitted the danger of analyzing, too closely, the moral\ncharacter of any of our field sports; yet I think it cannot be doubted\nthat the nervous system of fish, and cold-blooded animals in general, is\nless sensitive than that of warm-blooded animals. The hook usually is\nfixed in the cartilaginous part of the mouth, where there are no nerves;\nand a proof that the sufferings of a hooked fish cannot be great is\nfound in the circumstance, that though a trout has been hooked and\nplayed for some minutes, he will often, after his escape with the\nartificial fly in his mouth, take the natural fly, and feed as if\nnothing had happened; having apparently learnt only from the experiment,\nthat the artificial fly is not proper for food. And I have caught pikes\nwith four or five hooks in their mouths, and tackle which they had\nbroken only a few minutes before; and the hooks seemed to have had no\nother effect than that of serving as a sort of _sauce piquante_, urging\nthem to seize another morsel of the same kind.--The advocates for a\nfavourite pursuit never want sophisms to defend it. I have even heard it\nasserted, that a hare enjoys being hunted. Yet I will allow that\nfly-fishing, after your vindication, appears amongst the least cruel of\nfield sports.\n\nWe must, however, confine ourselves to a few colloquial extracts from\nthe _practical_ portion of the volume; as\n\n_Flies on the Wandle, &c._\n\n_Orn._--Surely the May-fly season is not the only season for day-fishing\nin this river? [the Wandle.]--_Hal._ Certainly not. There are as many\nfish to be taken, perhaps, in the spring fishing; but in this deep river\nthey are seldom in good season till the May-fly has been on, and a\nfortnight hence they will be still better than even now. In September\nthere may be good fish taken here; but the autumnal flies are less\nplentiful in this river than the spring flies--_Phys_, Pray tell me what\nare the species of fly which take in these two seasons.--_Hal_. You know\nthat trout spawn or deposit their ova, &c. in the end of the autumn or\nbeginning of winter, from the middle of November till the beginning of\nJanuary, their maturity depending upon the temperature of the season,\ntheir quantity of food, &c. They are at least six weeks or two months\nafter they have spawned before they recover their flesh; and the time\nwhen these fish are at the worst, is likewise the worst time for\nfly-fishing, both on account of the cold weather, and because there are\nfewer flies on the water than at any other season. Even in December and\nJanuary there are a few small gnats or water-flies on the water in the\nmiddle of the day, in bright days, or when there is sunshine. These are\ngenerally black, and they escape the influence of the frost by the\neffects of light on their black bodies, and probably by the extreme\nrapidity of the motions of their fluids, and generally of their organs.\nThey are found only at the surface of the water, where the temperature\nmust be above the freezing point. In February a few double-winged\nwater-flies, which swim down the stream, are usually found in the middle\nof the day, such as the willow-fly; and the cow-dung-fly is sometimes\ncarried on the water by winds. In March there are several flies found on\nmost rivers. The grannam, or green-tail-fly, with a wing like a moth,\ncomes on generally morning and evening, from five till eight o'clock,\nA.M. in mild weather, in the end of March and through April. Then there\nare the blue and the brown, both ephemerae, which come on, the first in\ndark days, the second in bright days; these flies, when well imitated,\nare very destructive to fish. The first is a small fly, with a palish\nyellow body, and slender, beautiful wings, which rest on the back as it\nfloats down the water. The second, called the cob in Wales, is three or\nfour times as large, and has brown wings, which likewise protrude from\nthe back, and its wings are shaded like those of a partridge, brown and\nyellow brown. These three kinds of flies lay their eggs in the water,\nwhich produce larvae that remain in the state of worms, feeding and\nbreathing in the water till they are prepared for their metamorphosis,\nand quit the bottoms of the rivers, and the mud and stones, for the\nsurface, and light and air. The brown fly usually disappears before the\nend of April, likewise the grannam; but of the blue dun there is a\nsuccession of different tints, or species, or varieties, which appear in\nthe middle of the day all the summer and autumn long. These are the\nprincipal flies on the Wandle--the best and clearest stream near London.\nIn early spring these flies have dark olive bodies; in the end of April\nand the beginning of May they are found yellow; and in the summer they\nbecome cinnamon coloured; and again, as the winter approaches, gain a\ndarker hue. I do not, however, mean to say that they are the same flies,\nbut more probably successive generations of ephemerae of the same\nspecies. The excess of heat seems equally unfavourable, as the excess of\ncold, to the existence of the smaller species of water-insects, which,\nduring the intensity of sunshine, seldom appear in summer, but rise\nmorning and evening only. The blue dun has, in June and July, a yellow\nbody; and there is a water-fly which, in the evening, is generally found\nbefore the moths appear, called the red spinner. Towards the end of\nAugust, the ephemerae appear again in the middle of the day--a very\npale, small ephemera, which is of the same colour as that which is seen\nin some rivers in the beginning of July. In September and October this\nkind of fly is found with an olive body, and it becomes darker in\nOctober and paler in November. There are two other flies which appear in\nthe end of September and continue during October, if the weather be\nmild; a large yellow fly, with a fleshy body, and wings like a moth; and\na small fly with four wings, with a dark or claret coloured body, that\nwhen it falls on the water has its wings like the great yellow fly, flat\non its back. This, or a claret bodied fly, very similar in character,\nmay be likewise found in March or April, on some waters. In this river I\nhave often caught many large trout in April and the beginning of May,\nwith the blue dun, having the yellow body; and in the upper part of the\nstream below St. Albans, and between that and Watford, I have sometimes,\neven as early as April, caught fish in good condition; but the _true_\nseason for the Colne is the season of the May-fly. The same may be said\nof most of the large English rivers containing large trouts, and\nabounding in May-fly--such as the Test and the Kennett, the one running\nby Stockbridge, the other by Hungerford. But in the Wandle, at\nCarshalton and Beddington, the May-fly is not found; and the little\nblues are the constant, and, when well imitated, killing flies on this\nwater; to which may be joined a dark alder-fly, and a red evening fly.\nIn the Avon, at Ringwood and Fordingbridge, the May-fly is likewise a\nkilling fly; but as this is a grayling river, the other flies,\nparticularly the grannam and blue and brown, are good in spring, and the\nalder-fly or pale blue later, and the blue dun in September and October,\nand even November. In the streams in the mountainous parts of Britain,\nthe spring and autumnal flies are by far the most killing. The Usk was\nformerly a very productive trout-stream, and the fish being well fed by\nthe worms washed down by the winter floods, were often in good season,\ncutting red, in March and the beginning of April: and at this season the\nblues and browns, particularly when the water was a little stained after\na small flood, afforded the angler good sport. In Herefordshire and\nDerbyshire, where trout and grayling are often found together, the same\nperiods are generally best for angling; but in the Dove, Lathkill, and\nWye, with the natural May-fly many fish may be taken; and in old times,\nin peculiarly windy days, or high and troubled water, even the\nartificial May-fly, according to Cotton, was very killing.\n\nHere we must end, at least _for the present_; but there is so much\nanecdotical pleasantry in _Salmonia_ that we might continue our extracts\nthrough many columns, and we are persuaded, to the gratification of the\nmajority of our readers. Even when we announced the publication of this\nwork a few weeks since, we were led to anticipate the delight it would\nafford many of our esteemed correspondents, especially our friend\n_W.H.H._, who has \"caught about forty trout in two or three hours\" in\nthe rocky basins of Pot-beck, &c.[5]\n\nSir Humphry Davy mentions the Wandle in Surrey, as we have quoted; but\nhe does not allude to the trout-fishing in the Mole, in the Vale of\nLeatherhead in the same county. There are in the course of the work a\nfew expressions which make humanity shudder, and would drive a\nPythagorean to madness,[6] notwithstanding the ingenuity with which the\nauthor attempts to vindicate his favourite amusement.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\nSHROPSHIRE AND WELSH GIRLS.\n\nThere are few Londoners who in their suburban strolls have failed to\nnotice the scores of _female_ fruit-carriers by whose toil the markets\nare supplied with some of their choicest delicacies. As an interesting\nillustration of the meritorious character of these handmaids to luxury,\nI send you the following extract from Sir Richard Phillips's _Walk from\nLondon to Kew_.\n\nPHILO.\n\nIn the strawberry season, hundreds of women are employed to carry that\ndelicate fruit to market on their heads; and their industry in\nperforming this task is as wonderful, as their remuneration is unworthy\nof the opulent classes who derive enjoyment from their labour. They\nconsist, for the most part, of Shropshire and Welsh girls, who walk to\nLondon at this season in droves, to perform this drudgery, just as the\nIrish peasantry come to assist in the hay and corn harvests. I learnt\nthat these women carry upon their heads baskets of strawberries or\nraspberries, weighing from forty to fifty pounds, and make two turns in\nthe day, from Isleworth to market, a distance of thirteen miles each\nway; three turns from Brentford, a distance of nine miles; and four\nturns from Hammersmith, a distance of six miles. For the most part, they\nfind some conveyance back; but even then these industrious creatures\ncarry loads from twenty-four to thirty miles a-day, besides walking back\nunladen some part of each turn! Their remuneration for this unparalleled\nslavery is from 8_s_. to 9_s_. per day; each turn from the distance of\nIsleworth being 4_s_. or 4_s_. 6_d_.; and from that of Hammersmith 2_s_.\nor 2_s_. 3_d_. Their diet is coarse and simple, their drink, tea and\nsmall-beer; costing not above 1_s_. or 1_s_. 6_d_. and their back\nconveyance about 2_s_. or 2_s_. 6_d_.; so that their net gains are about\n5_s_. per day, which, in the strawberry season, of forty days, amounts\nto 10_l_. After this period the same women find employment in gathering\nand marketing vegetables, at lower wages, for other sixty days, netting\nabout 5_l_. more. With this poor pittance they return to their native\ncounty, and it adds either to their humble comforts, or creates a small\ndowry towards a rustic establishment for life. Can a more interesting\npicture be drawn of virtuous exertion? Why have our poets failed to\ncolour and finish it? More virtue never existed in their favourite\nshepherdesses than in these Welsh and Shropshire girls! For beauty,\nsymmetry, and complexion, they are not inferior to the nymphs of\nArcadia, and they far outvie the pallid specimens of Circassia! Their\nmorals too are exemplary; and they often perform this labour to support\naged parents, or to keep their own children from the workhouse! In keen\nsuffering, they endure all that the imagination of a poet could desire;\nthey live hard, they sleep on straw in hovels and barns, and they often\nburst an artery, or drop down dead from the effect of heat and\nover-exertion! Yet, such is the state of one portion of our female\npopulation, at a time when we are calling ourselves the most polished\nnation on earth.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\nCOLEBROOK-DALE IRON-WORKS--THE REYNOLDS'.\n\n(_To the Editor of the Mirror_.)\n\nIn the interesting extract you have given in your excellent Miscellany\n(No. 321) from Bakewell's Introduction to Geology, when speaking of the\nexhausted or impoverished state of the iron-ore and coals in Shropshire,\n&c., an allusion is made in a note to that truly excellent man, the late\nMr. Richard Reynolds, and to the final extinction of the furnaces at\nColebrook-Dale, which is not altogether correct.\n\nI beg leave, therefore, to point out the errors to you, and to add a\nfact or two more relating to that distinguished philanthropist and his\nfamily, which, perhaps, will not be unacceptable to many of your\nreaders.\n\nMr. Reynolds was by no means the _original_, nor, I believe, ever the\n_sole_ proprietor, of the iron-works in Colebrook-Dale, as stated by Mr.\nBakewell; he derived his right in them from his wife's family the\nDarbies; and the firm of \"Darby and Company\" was the well known mark on\nthe iron from these works for a very long period; more recently, that of\n\"Colebrook-Dale Company\" was adopted.\n\nThe Darbies were an old and respectable family of the Society of\nFriends, and a pair of the elder branches of it were the original \"Darby\nand Joan,\" whose names are so well known throughout the whole kingdom. I\nhad this anecdote from one of the sons of Mr. Reynolds,[7] and have no\ndoubt of its authenticity.\n\nIt may not be generally known to your readers, perhaps, that the first\niron bridge in England was projected at, and cast from, the furnaces of\nColebrook-Dale, and erected over the Severn, near that place, about the\nyear 1779; and, considering it to be the _first_ bridge of the kind, I\nfeel little hesitation in stating it to be, even now, the most beautiful\none. This structure, at that time thought to be a wonderful attempt, was\nthe entire offspring of Mr. Reynolds' genius; it was planned, cast, and\nerected, under his immediate care and superintendance.\n\nI cannot suppose the reason given by your author for the discontinuance\nof the works at Colebrook-Dale to be correct, as there is another large\nfurnace in the immediate neighbourhood, called \"Madeley Wood Furnace\"\n(also belonging to Mr. Reynolds's family), which was allowed to make,\nand, I believe, still makes, the best iron and steel in the United\nKingdom. Mr. Reynolds had also other great iron-works at Ketley, since\ncarried on by his two sons, William and Joseph, and still in high\nreputation, as to the quality of the iron made there; these are not more\ndistant from Colebrook-Dale than six or seven miles, and between the two\nthere are the extensive and highly valuable works of \"Old Park,\" &c.,\nbelonging to Mr. Botfield (so that the whole district abounds in the\nmaterials), which not having the advantage of the immediate vicinity of\nthe Severn for conveyance, would have been more likely to have stopped\nfrom the circumstances stated in your extract; _viz._ the failure in\nquality or quantity of iron-stone, coals, or other necessary matter. The\nColebrook-Dale fires must, therefore, I conceive, have ceased to blaze,\nand the blast of her furnaces to roar, from some other cause, and from\nsome private reason of her late proprietors.\n\nYour constant reader,\n\n_Shrewsbury._ SALOPIENSIS.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\nNOTES OF A READER.\n\nTRAGEDY.\n\nWe do not see any necessary and natural connexion between death and the\nend of the third volume of a novel, or the conclusion of the fifth act\nof a play,--though that connexion in some modern novels, and in most\nEnglish tragedies, seems to be assumed. Nor does it seem to follow,\nthat, because death is the object of universal dread and aversion, and\nbecause terror is one of the objects of tragedy, death must, therefore,\nnecessarily be represented; and not only so, but the more deaths the\nbetter. If it be true that familiarity has a tendency to create\nindifference, if not contempt, it must be considered prudent to have\nrecourse to this strong exhibition as to drastic remedies in medicine,\nwith caution and discrimination, and with a view to the continuance of\nits effect. We cannot help wishing that our own Shakspeare, who lays\ndown such excellent rules for the guidance of actors, and cautions them\nso earnestly against \"overstepping the modesty of nature,\" and the\ndanger of \"tearing passion to rags,\" had remembered, that the poet\nhimself has certain limits imposed upon him, which he cannot transgress\nwith impunity. We should not then have observed, in the perusal of some\nof his plays, the marginal notice of [\"_dies_\"] with about as much\nemotion as a note of exclamation; nor, when at the actual\nrepresentation, we behold the few remaining persons of the drama\nscarcely able to cross the stage without stumbling over the bodies of\ntheir fallen companions, should we have felt our thoughts unavoidably\nwandering from the higher business and moral effect of the scene, to the\nmere physical and repelling images of fleshly mortality.--_Edinburgh\nRev._\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe inquiries of the committee appointed to devise means for the\nsuppression of mendicity, leave us no reason to doubt that in an average\nof cases a London beggar made by \"his trade\" eighteen-pence per day, or\ntwenty-seven pounds per annum!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_One-ninth_ of the whole population of Paris are wholly maintained by\nfunds which the different bureaux of charity distribute for their\nrelief; and still a countless horde of mendicants infest her streets,\nher quays, and all her public places.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nScience and literature are \"the nourishment of youth, the delight of\nage, the ornaments of prosperous life, the refuge and consolation of\nadversity, the companions of our weary travels, of our rural solitudes,\nof our sleepless nights.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe following quotation from _Jamieson's Scottish Dictionary_ points out\nthe frugal and temperate Scot; and, in illustration, may be contrasted\nwith the proverbial invitation of the better feeding English, \"Will you\ncome and take your mutton with me?\"\n\n\"KAIL, used metonimically for the whole dinner; as constituting among\nour temperate ancestors the principal part, _s_.\n\n\"Hence, in giving a friendly invitation to dinner, it is common to say,\n'Will you come and tak your _kail_ wi' me?'

Let me\nbe careful how I read, and, above all, how I read ancient history. You\nhave heard, and read too, much of its inundations. If the thousands of\nlarge and small canals from it, and the thousands of men and machines\nemployed to transfer, by artificial means, the water of the Nile to the\nmeadows on its banks--if this be the inundation that is meant, it is\ntrue; any other is false; it is not an inundating river.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Jewish children to this day celebrate the fall and death of Haman,\nand on that anniversary represent the blows which they would fain deal\non his scull, by striking with envenomed fury on the floor with wooden\nhammers.

On April 17, in the presence of many witnesses, he was shown\nupwards of two hundred culprits, of whom he had never heard till that\nmoment, and to whose crimes and dispositions he was a total stranger.\nDr. Gall immediately pointed out, as a general feature in one of the\nwards, an extraordinary development in the region of the head where the\norgan of theft is situated, and in fact every prisoner there was a\nthief. Some children, also detained for theft, were then shown to him;\nand in them, too, the same organ was very prominent. In two of them\nparticularly it was excessively large; and the prison-registers\nconfirmed his opinion that these two were most incorrigible. In another\nroom, where the women were kept apart, he distinguished one drest\nexactly like the others, occupied like them, and differing in no one\nthing but in the form of her head. \"For what reason is this woman here,\"\nasked Gall, \"for her head announces no propensity to theft?\" The answer\nwas, \"She is the inspectress of this room.\" One prisoner had the organs\nof benevolence and of religion as strongly developed as those of theft\nand cunning; and his boast was, that he never had committed an act of\nviolence, and that it was repugnant to his feelings to rob a church. In\na man named Fritze, detained for the murder of his wife, though his\ncrime was not proved, the organs of cunning and firmness were fully\ndeveloped; and it was by these that he had eluded conviction. In\nMaschke, he found the organ of the mechanical arts, together with a head\nvery well organized in many respects; and his crime was coining. In\nTroppe he saw the same organ. This man was a shoemaker, who, without\ninstruction, made clocks and watches, to gain a livelihood in his\nconfinement. On a nearer inspection, the organ of imitation was found to\nbe large. \"If this man had ever been near a theatre,\" said Gall, \"he\nwould in all probability have turned actor.\" Troppe, astonished at the\naccuracy of this sentence, confessed that he had joined a company of\nstrolling players for six months. His crime, too, was having personated\na police-officer, to extort money. The organs of circumspection,\nprurience, foresight, were sadly deficient in Heisig, who, in a drunken\nfit, had stabbed his best friend. In some prisoners he found the organ\nof language, in others of colour, in others of mathematics; and his\nopinion in no single instance failed to be confirmed by the known\ntalents and dispositions of the individual.--_For.

To leave the world in a natural way was out of\nthe question; and to be dispatched to the Hall of Odin by an ignoble\nhand was scarcely less to be dreaded. Leaning on two crutches, with a\nsword at each side, he waited for some one to give him the mortal\nstroke. To tempt the avarice of such a one, he suspended from his neck a\nvaluable gold chain. He slew a peasant passing, who, rallying him on his\ninfirm state, had ventured to beg one of his swords, as neither could\nany longer be of service to him. At last his good fortune brought him a\nworthy executioner in Hather, the son of a prince whom he had slain. The\nyoung hero was hunting, and seeing the old man, he ordered two of his\nattendants to tease him. Both lost their lives for their temerity. The\nprince then advanced; and the old man, after relating his great actions,\ndesired the former to kill him. To make the inducement stronger, he\ndisplayed the golden chain, which would be the reward of the deed; and\nto excite his rage, as well as avarice, he avowed that it was he who had\nslain the late prince, and that revenge was the sacred duty of the son.\nInfluenced by both considerations, the latter consented to behead him.\nSterkodder exhorted him to strike manfully. The head was accordingly\nsevered from the body at a single blow; and as it touched the earth, the\nteeth fastened themselves furiously in the ground.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWORKHOUSES\n\nWere first erected in England in the year 1723, when they had an instant\nand striking effect in reducing the number of poor.

I fancied that I was still on the sea; that the\nmassive copper-coloured clouds which hovered scarcely a yard overhead,\nwere suddenly transformed into uncouth shapes, who glared at me from\nbetween saffron chinks, made by the scudding wrack; that the waters\nteemed with life, cold, slimy, preternatural things of life; that their\neyes after assuming a variety of awful expressions, settled down into\nthat dull frozen character, and their voices into that low, sepulchral,\nindefinable tone, which marked the Mysterious Tailor. This wretch was\nthe Abaddon of my dreamy Pandaemonium. He was ever before me; he lent an\nadded splendour to the day, and deepened the midnight gloom. On the\nheights of Bologne I saw him; far away over the foaming waters he\nfloated still and lifeless beside me, his eye never once off my face,\nhis voice never silent in my ear.\n\nMy tale would scarcely have an end, were I to repeat but the one half of\nwhat during two brief days (two centuries in suffering) I experienced\nfrom this derangement of the nervous system. My readers may fancy that I\nhave exaggerated my state of mind: far from it, I have purposely\nsoftened down the more distressing particulars, apprehensive, if not of\nbeing discredited, at least of incurring ridicule. Towards the close of\nthe third day my fever began to abate, I became more sobered in my turn\nof thought, could contrive to answer questions, and listen with\ntolerable composure to my landlord's details of my miraculous\npreservation. The storm was slowly rolling off my mind, but the swell\nwas still left behind it. The fourth day found me so far recovered, that\nI was enabled to quit my chamber, sit beside an open window, and derive\namusement from the uncouth appearance of a Dutch crew, whose brig was\nlying at anchor in the harbour. From this time forward, every hour\nbrought fresh accession to my strength, until at the expiration of the\ntenth day--so sudden is recovery in cases of violent fever when once the\ncrisis is passed--I was sufficiently restored to take my place by a\nnight-coach for London. The first few stages I endured tolerably well,\nnotwithstanding that I had somewhat rashly ventured upon an outside\nplace; but as midnight drew on, the wind became so piercingly keen,\naccompanied every now and then by a squally shower of sleet, that I was\nglad to bargain for an inside berth. By good luck, there was just room\nenough left for one, which I instantly appropriated, in spite of sundry\nhints _hemmed_ forth by a crusty old gentleman, that the coach was full\nalready. I took my place in the coach, to the dissatisfaction of those\nalready seated there. Not a word was spoken for miles: for the\ncircumstance of its being dark increased the distrust of all, and, in\nthe firm conviction that I was an adventurer, they had already, I make\nno doubt, buttoned up their pockets, and diligently adjusted their\nwatch-chains. In a short time, this reserve wore away. From this moment\nthe conversation became general. Each individual had some invalid story\nto relate, and I too, so far forgot my usual taciturnity as to indulge\nmy hearers with a detail of my late indisposition--of its origin in the\nMysterious Tailor--of the wretch's inconceivable persecution--of the\nfiendish peculiarities of his appearance--of his astonishing ubiquity,\nand lastly, of my conviction that he was either more or less than man.\nScarcely had the very uncourteous laughter that accompanied this\nnarrative concluded, when a low, intermittent snore, proceeding from a\nperson close at my elbow, challenged my most serious notice. The sound\nwas peculiar--original--unearthly--and reminded me of the same music\nwhich had so harrowed my nerves at Bologne. Yet it could not surely be\nhe--he, the very thoughts of whom now sent a thrill through every vein.\nOh, no! it must be some one else--there were other harmonious\nsternutators beside him, he could not be the only nasal nightingale in\nthe three kingdoms. While I thus argued the matter, silently, yet\nsuspiciously, a wandering gleam of day, streaming in at the coach\nwindows, faintly lit up a nose the penultimate peculiarities of which\ngave a very ominous turn to my reflections. In due time this light\nbecame more vivid; and beneath its encouraging influence, first, a pair\nof eyes--then two sallow, juiceless cheeks, then an upper lip, then a\nprojecting chin; and lastly, the entire figure of the Mysterious Tailor\nhimself, whose head, it seems, had hitherto been folded, bird-like, upon\nhis breast, grew into atrocious distinctness, while from the depths of\nthe creature's throat came forth the strangely-solemn whisper, \"touching\nthat little account.\" For this once, indignation got the better of\naffright. \"Go where I will,\" I exclaimed, passionately interrupting him,\n\"I find I cannot avoid you, you have a supernatural gift of\nomnipresence, but be you fiend or mortal I will now grapple with you;\"\nand accordingly snatching at that obnoxious feature which, like the tail\nof the rattle-snake, had twice warned me of its master's fatal presence,\nI grasped it with such zealous good will, that had it been of mortal\nmanufacture it must assuredly have come off in my hands. Aroused by the\nlaughter of my fellow passengers, the coachman--who was just preparing\nto mount, after having changed horses at Dartford--abruptly opened the\ndoor, on which I as abruptly jumped out; and after paying my fare the\nwhole way to town, and casting on the fiend a look of \"inextinguishable\nhatred,\" made an instant retreat into the inn. About the middle of the\nnext day I reached London, and without a moment's pause hurried to the\nlodgings of my beforementioned friend C----. Luckily he was at home, but\nstarted at the strange forlorn figure that presented itself. And well\nindeed he might. My eye-balls were glazed and bloody, my cheeks white as\na shroud, my mouth a-jar, my lips blue and quivering. \"For God's sake,\nC----,\" I began, vouchsafing no further explanation, \"lend me--(I\nspecified the sum)--or I am ruined; that infernal, inconceivable Tailor\nhas--.\" C----smilingly interrupted me by an instant compliance with my\ndemand; on which, without a moment's delay, I bounded off, breathless\nand semi-frantic, towards my arch fiend's Pandaemonium at High Holborn.\nI cannot--cannot say what I felt as I crossed over from Drury-lane\ntowards his den, more particularly when, on entering, I beheld the demon\nhimself behind his counter--calm, moveless, and sepulchral, as if\nnothing of moment had occurred; as if he were an every-day dun, or I an\nevery-day debtor. The instant he espied me, a sardonic smile, together\nwith that appalling dissyllable, \"touching\" (which I never to this day\nhear, see, or write without a shudder) escaped him; but before he could\nclose his oration, I had approached, trembling with rage and reverence,\ntowards him, and, thrusting forth the exact sum, was rushing from his\npresence, when he beckoned me back for a receipt. A receipt, and from\nhim too! It was like taking a receipt for one's soul from Satan!!\n\nThe reader will doubtless conclude that, now at least, having\nsatisfactorily settled his demands, I had done with my Tormentor for\never. This inference is in part correct. I followed up my vocation with\nan energy strangely contrasted with my recent indifference, was early\nand late in the schools, and for three months pursued this course with\nsuch ardour, that my adventures with the Mysterious Tailor, though not\nforgotten, were yet gradually losing their once powerful hold on my\nimagination. This was precisely the state of my feelings, when early one\nautumnal morning, just seven months from the date of my last visit to\nHigh Holborn, I chanced to be turning down Saint Giles's Church, on my\nway to--Hospital. I had nothing to render me more than usually pensive;\nno new vexations, no sudden pecuniary embarrassment; yet it so happened,\nthat on this particular morning I felt a weight at my heart, and a cloud\non my brain, for which I could in no way account. As I passed along\nBroad Street, I made one or two bold attempts to rally. I stared\ninquisitively at the different passers by, endeavouring, by a snatch at\nthe expression of their faces, to speculate on the turn of their minds,\nand the nature of their occupations; I then began to whistle and hum\nsome lively air, at the same time twirling my glove with affected\nunconcern; but nothing would do; every exertion I made to appear\ncheerful, not only found no answering sympathy from within, but even\nexaggerated by constrast my despondency. In this condition I reached\nSaint Giles's Church. A crowd was assembled at the gate opposite its\nentrance, and presently the long surly toll of the death-bell--that\nsolemn and oracular memento--announced that a funeral was on the eve of\ntaking place. The funeral halted at the entrance gate, where the coffin\nwas taken from the hearse, and and thence borne into the chancel. This\nceremony concluded, the procession again set forth towards the home\nappointed for the departed in a remote quarter of the church-yard. And\nnow the interest began in reality to deepen. As the necessary\npreparations were making for lowering the coffin into earth, the\nmourners--even those who had hitherto looked unmoved--pressed gradually\nnearer, and with a momentary show of interest, to the grave. Such is the\nennobling character of death.\n\nThe preparations were by this time concluded, and nothing now remained\nbut the last summons of the sexton. At this juncture, while the coffin\nwas being lowered into its resting place, my eyes, accidentally, it may\nbe said, but in reality by some fatal instinct, fell full upon the lid,\non which I instantly recognised a name, long and fearfully known to\nme--the name of the Mysterious Tailor of High Holborn. Oh, how many\nthrilling recollections did this one name recal? The rencontre in the\nstreets of London--the scene at the masquerade--the meeting at\nBologne--the storm--the shipwreck--the sinking vessel--the appearance at\nthat moment of _the man_ himself--the subsequent visions of mingled\nfever and insanity: all, all now swept across my mind, as for the last\ntime I gazed on the remains of him who was powerless henceforth for\never.\n\n### Summary:"}

F\n\nALL-SOULS' CHURCH,\n\nLANGHAM PLACE.\n\n \"Whoever walks through London streets,\"\n  Said Momus to the son of Saturn,\n \"Each day new edifices meets,\n  Of queer proportion, queerer pattern:\nIf thou, O cloud-compelling god,\n  Wilt aid me with thy special grace,\nI, too, will wield my motley hod,\n  And build a church in Langham-place.\"\n\n \"Agreed,\" the Thunderer cries; \"go plant\n  Thine edifice, I care not how ill;\nTake notice, earth. I hereby grant\n  _Carte blanche_ of mortar, stone, and trowel.\nGo Hermes, Hercules, and Mars,\n  Fraught with these bills on Henry Hase,\nDrop with yon jester from the stars,\n  And build a church in Langham-place.\"\n\n         _London Lyrics-New Monthly Mag._\n\nAmong all our specimens of contemporary church-building, none has\nexcited more animadversion than _All-Souls'_, Langham-place, erected in\n1822-1825, from the designs of Mr. Nash. Its general effect is\nextraordinary and objectionable; but, unfortunately for what merit it\nreally possesses, many of its assailants have so far disregarded the\njust principles of taste and criticism, as to go laboriously out of\ntheir way to be profanely witty on its defects. Song and satire,\nraillery and ridicule, pun and pasquinade, and even the coarseness of\ncaricature, have thus been let off at this specimen of NASH-_ional_\narchitecture; whilst their authors have wittingly kept out any redeeming\ngraces which could be found in its architectural details.\n\nThe principal features of the exterior were suggested by its situation,\nit being placed on an angular plot of ground, between Langham-place and\nRegent-street. To afford an advantageous view from either point, the\ntower, which is circular, is nearly detached from the body of the\nchurch, and is surrounded by columns of the modern Ionic order,\nsupporting an entablature, crowned by a balustrade, which is continued\nalong the sides of the church. Above the portico is a Corinthian\nperistyle, the base of which is also that of a fluted cone, which forms\nthe spire, and is terminated in an acute point. The steeple is complete\nin itself, and adapted to its situation, having the same appearance\nwhich ever way it is viewed. This portion of the edifice has, however,\nbeen more stigmatized than any other, although it has been pronounced by\npersons of taste and accredited judgment to be the best steeple recently\nerected. To our eye, the church itself, _apart_ from the tower, (for\nsuch it almost is) is perhaps, one of the most miserable structures in\nthe metropolis,--in its starved proportions more resembling a\nmanufactory, or warehouse, than the impressive character of a church\nexterior; an effect to which the Londoner is not an entire stranger.\nHere, too, we are inclined to ascribe much of the ridicule, which the\nwhole church has received, to its puny proportions and scantiness of\ndecoration, which are far from being assisted by any stupendousness in\ntheir details, the first impression of which might probably have fixed\nthe attention of the spectator. Indeed, the whole style of the tower and\nsteeple appears peculiarly illadapted for so small a scale as has here\nbeen attempted.\n\nAs we love \"a jest's prosperity,\" we recommend such of our readers as\nare partial to innocent pasquinade, to turn to the \"Lyric,\" in a recent\nvolume of the _New Monthly Magazine_, commencing as above. It is too\nlong for entire insertion here, but its raciness will doubtless gratify\nthose who may be induced to refer to it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTREMENDOUS RAINS.\n\n_(For the Mirror.)_\n\nLike a low-hung cloud, _it rains so fast_,\nThat all at once it falls.--DRYDEN.\n\nThere are two English proverbs relative to rain; the first is, \"_It\nrains by Planets._\" \"This the country people (says Ray) use when it\nrains in one place and not in another; meaning that the showers are\ngoverned by planets, which being erratic in their own motions, cause\nsuch uncertain wandering of clouds and falls of rain. Or it rains by\nplanets--that is, the falls of showers are as uncertain, as the motions\nof the planets are imagined to be.\" The second--\"_It never rains but it\npours:_\" which appears to be the case at present. In the year 553 it\nrained violently in Scotland for five months; in 918 there was a\ncontinual rain in that country for five months; a violent one in London\n1222; again 1233, so violent that the harvest did not begin till\nMichaelmas; 1338, from Midsummer to Christmas, so that there was not one\nday or night dry together; in Wales, which destroyed 10,000 sheep,\nSeptember 19th 1752; in Languedoc, which destroyed the village of Bar le\nDue, April 26th, 1776; and in the Island of Cuba, on the 21st of June,\n1791, 3,000 persons and 11,700 cattle of various kinds perished by the\ntorrents occasioned by the rains.\n\nP.

The observation\nwas made at Babylon the 19th of March.--In ancient days, for want of\nparchment to draw deeds upon, great estates were frequently conveyed\nfrom one family to another only by the ceremony of a turf and a stone,\ndelivered before witnesses, and without any written agreement.--It is\nsingular, that by the Doomsday Book, as quoted by Camden, there appears\nto have been in Lincoln, when that survey was taken, no less than 1070\n\"inns for entertainment.\"--Henry I., about the year 1125, caused to be\nmade a standard yard, from the length of his own arm, in order to\nprevent frauds in the measurement of cloth. This standard is supposed to\nhave been deposited, with other measures, &c. in Winchester; he likewise\n(it is said) ordered halfpence and farthings to be made round, which\nbefore his time were square.--The Universities of Oxford and Cambridge\nwere first called \"studia,\" or \"studies.\"--Edward the Confessor received\nyearly, from the manor of Barton, near Gloucester, 3,000 loaves of bread\nfor the maintenance of his dogs--In the reign of Edward III., only three\ntaverns might sell sweet wines in London; one in Cheape, one in\nWallbrook, and the other in Lombard Street.--Lord Lyttleton, in his Life\nof Henry II., vol. i. p. 50, says, \"Most of our ancient historians give\nhim the character of a very religious prince, but his religion was,\nafter the fashion of those times, belief without examination, and\ndevotion without piety. It was a religion that at the same time allowed\nhim to pillage kingdoms, that threw him on his knees before a relic or a\ncross, but suffered him unrestrained to trample upon the liberties and\nrights of mankind;\" again, \"his government was harsh and despotic,\nviolating even the principles of that institution which he himself had\nestablished. Yet so far he performed the duty of a sovereign that he\ntook care to maintain a good police in his realm; which, in the\ntumultuous state of his government, was a great and difficult work.\" How\nwell he performed it, we may learn even from the testimony of a\ncontemporary Saxon historian, who says, \"during his reign a man might\nhave travelled in perfect security all over the kingdom, with his bosom\nfull of gold; nor durst any kill another in revenge of the greatest\noffences, nor offer violence to the chastity of a woman. But it was a\npoor compensation that the highways were safe, when the courts of\njustice were dens of thieves, and when almost every man in authority, or\nin office, used his power to oppress and pillage the people.\"--Towards\nthe close of the life of Henry IV., he kept the regal diadem always in\nhis sight by day, and at night it shared his pillow. Once the Prince of\nWales, whom Henry always suspected more than he loved, seeing his father\nin a most violent paroxysm of disease, removed the crown from his bed.\nThe king on his recovery missed it, sent for his son, and taxed him with\nhis impatience and want of duty, but the prince defended his conduct\nwith such rational modesty, that Henry, convinced of his innocence,\nembraced and blessed him. \"Alas!\" said Henry to his son, \"you know too\nwell how I gained this crown. How will you defend this ill-gotten\npossession?\" \"With my sword,\" said the prince, \"as my father has done.\"\n\nHenry V. was, perhaps, the first English monarch who had ships of his\nown. Two of these, which sailed against Harfleur, were called \"The\nKing's Chamber,\" and \"The King's Hall.\" They had purple sails, and were\nlarge and beautiful.\n\nParty rage ran so high in 1403, that an act of parliament was found\nnecessary to declare, \"Pulling out of eyes and cutting out of tongues to\nbe felony.\"--Dr. Rush, of Philadelphia, in his \"Inquiry into the effects\nof spirituous liquors on the human body, and their influence on the\nhappiness of society;\" says, \"Among the inhabitants of cities, spirits\nproduce debts, disgrace, and bankruptcy. Among farmers, they produce\nidleness with its usual consequence, such as houses without windows,\nbarns without roofs, gardens without enclosures, fields without fences,\nhogs without yokes, sheep without wool, meagre cattle, feeble horses,\nand half clad, dirty children, without principles, morals, or manners.\"\n\nP.

Sir Saunders had\nbeen a great traveller, and saw these chairs at Sedan, where they were\nfirst invented. It is remarkable that Capt. Bailey introduced the use of\nhackney-coaches in this year; a tolerable ride might then be obtained,\nin either of these vehicles for four pence.\n\n_Heroism--Seward_, \"the brave Earl of Northumberland,\" feeling in his\nsickness that he drew near his end, quitted his bed and put on his\narmour, saying, \"That it became not a man to die like a beast,\" on which\nhe died standing; an act as singular as it was heroic.\n\n_Epigram on Epigrams._\nWhat is an epigram? a dwarfish whole,\nIts body brevity, and wit its soul.\n\nW.

That which we\nconsider the most delicious and exhilarating portion of our common\nbeverage, porter, contains carbonic acid gas, commonly known by the\n\"spirit,\" and which the poor miners dread with the utmost horror, like\nthe Arabian does the destructive blast of the simoon. Oxalic acid, so\nmuch the fear of those accustomed to the medicine--Epsom salts, is made\nfrom that useful article, _sugar_, by uniting with it a smaller portion,\nmore than it has naturally, of oxygen gas. The air we breathe contains a\nmost deadly poison, called by chemists azotic gas, which, by its being\nmixed with what is called vital air, (oxygen gas,) becomes necessary to\nour existence, as much as the one (vital air or oxygen gas) would be\nprejudicial without the other; and _Prussic acid_, the most violent of\nall poisons, is contained in the common bitter-almond. But these most\ndestructive substances are always found combined with others, which\nrender them often perfectly harmless, and can be separated only by the\nskill of the chemist.\n\nThe Prussic acid (by some called hydrocyanic acid) is a liquid,\nextracted from vegetables, and contains one part of cyanogen and one\npart of hydrogen. It is extracted from the bitter-almond, (as has been\nstated,) peach-blossom, and the leaves of the laurocerasus. It may also\nbe obtained from animal substances, although a vegetable acid. If lime\nbe added to water, distilled from these substances, a Prussiate of lime\nis formed; when, if an acid solution of iron be added to this mixture,\ncommon Prussian blue (or Prussiate of iron) is precipitated. The acid\nmay be obtained from Prussiate of potash, by making a strong solution of\nthis salt, and then adding as much tartaric acid as will precipitate the\npotash, when the acid will be left in solution, which must be decanted\nand distilled.\n\nIts properties are a pungent odour, very much resembling that of\nbitter-almonds, with a hot but sweetish taste, and extremely volatile.\nIt contains azote, with which no other vegetable acid is combined; it is\nlargely used in the manufacture of Prussian blue. It is the most violent\nof all poisons, and destroys animals by being applied to the skin only.\nIt is stated by an able chemist, that a single drop applied to the\ntongue of a mastiff dog caused death so instantaneously, that it\nappeared to have been destroyed by lightning. One drop to the human\nframe destroys life in two minutes.\n\nBut when chemically combined with other substances, its power is in a\ngreat measure neutralized, and it becomes a valuable article, both to\nthe chemist as a test, and to the physician as a medicine. The Prussiate\nof potash and iron will enable the chemist to discover nearly the whole\nof the metals when in solution, by the colours its combination produces.\nDr. Zollekoffer says, that in intermittent fevers the Prussiate of iron\nis in its effects superior to Cinchona bark, and says it never disagrees\nwith the stomach, or creates nausea even in the most irritable state,\nwhile bark is not unfrequently rejected; a patient will recover from the\ninfluence of intermitting and remitting fevers, in the generality of\ncases, in much less time than is usual in those cases in which bark is\nemployed. S.S.T.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTHE ANECDOTE GALLERY.\n\nVOLTAIRE.\n\n(_Continued from page 64_.)\n\nA certain Hungarian traveller, a man of consequence in his country, but\nnot particularly wise, had fruitlessly tried to be introduced, without\nfinding any one at Geneva, willing to undertake the task, as they were\nall afraid Voltaire would be rude to him. A young man, who heard of\nthis, engaged to procure the stranger an interview with Voltaire; and on\nthe day appointed, contrived to have him conveyed out of town to a\ngood-looking residence, where well-dressed servants received him at the\ndoor, and ushered him up stairs in due form. Here then at last he found\nhimself, as he thought, _tete-a-tete_ with Voltaire. The _malade de\nFerney_, personated by our young friend, was lying down on a sofa,\nwrapped up in a damask robe-de-chambre, a night-cap of black velvet,\nwith gold lace, on his head, or rather on the top of an immense periwig,\n_a la Louis XIV_., in the midst of which his little, sallow and\ndeeply-wrinkled visage seemed buried; a table was near him, covered with\npapers, and the curtains being drawn, made the room rather dark. The\nphilosopher apologized in a hollow voice, interrupted by occasional fits\nof coughing; he was ill _bien malade_, could not get up, begged the\nstranger to be seated, asked questions about the countries he had\nvisited, made him tell his adventures, those of gallantry particularly,\nand was himself most facetious, and most profanely witty. The Hungarian\ndelighted, and far more at ease than he had imagined possible, casting a\nglance on the papers, ventured to inquire what new work? \"Ah,\nnothing!\"--_le faible Enfant de ma Vieillesse--a tragedy_. \"May I ask\nthe subject?\" \"The subject is wholly Genevan,\" replied Voltaire, \"the\nname, _Empro-Giro_, and the dramatis personae _Carin-Caro, Dupins-Simon_,\nand _Carcail Briffon, &c_.\" He then began to repeat, with great\nanimation, a number of passages, to which his visitor listened in\nperfect raptures, but drew, meanwhile, a snuff-box from his pocket, and\nbegan to look attentively on him and on a picture on the lid; thus\nconfronted with a portrait of Voltaire, and compared face to face, was a\ntrial for which our mimic was not prepared, and his courage nearly\nforsook him, yet he kept up appearances, only coughing more, and ranting\non the high-sounding lines of his _Empro-Giro_. The Hungarian, not\nundeceived by this close examination, replaced the snuff-box in his\npocket, declaring it to be the best likeness he had ever seen. He rose\nat last, thanked his friend Voltaire, kissed his hand respectfully, and\nwent away, distributing to the servants he met on the stairs liberal\ntokens of his satisfaction. These servants were the intimate friends and\ncompanions of the chief actor, and one of them, his brother, unwilling\nto carry the joke to the length of pocketing the money of their dupe,\nthey contrived to give him a dinner at a tavern, where he was made to\ntell the story of his visit to Voltaire, and express his admiration of\nthe great man. The latter heard of this, was much amused, and desired to\nsee his double, told him he would make a bargain with him--half his fame\nfor half the tiresome visitors it procured him.\n\nThe poet lived like a prince, but kept his accounts like a citizen;\nknowing to a sous where his money went: a good deal of it was bestowed\ncharitably, for he was munificent, and certainly much loved in his\nneighbourhood. One night, when _Tancrede_ was acting, and the court of\nthe chateau was full of carriages and servants, there arrived, as ill\nluck would have it, a cask of the best chambertin that ever came from\nBurgundy; his own people could not attend to it, and the cask remained\nat his cellar door; the servants contrived to get at it, and while their\nmasters and mistresses were shedding tears at the tragedy, they sipped\nthe poet's wine. There was generally a supper after the play, where more\nthan once two hundred people sat down, and Voltaire had something to say\nto every one of his guests. As the gates of the town are shut at night,\nmany of them usually remained in the _chateau_, poorly accommodated with\nbeds. One night as M. de B----, was groping in the dark, for a place\nwhere he might lie down to sleep, he accidently put his finger into the\nmouth of M. de Florian, who bit it.\n\nVoltaire kept company only with the aristocracy of Geneva; neither his\nliberality nor his wit secured him the good-will of the patriots placed\nout of the sphere of his influence; they only saw him a sham\nphilosopher, without principles and solidity; a courtier, the slave of\nrank and fashion; the corrupter of their country, of which he made a\njest. _Quand je secoue ma perruque,_ he used to say, _je poudre toute la\nrepublique!_\n\nWhatever might be Voltaire's antipathy to the visits of strangers at his\n_chateau_, he seems to have met with an equal specimen of that temper\nfrom an Englishman. When in London, he waited upon Congreve, the poet,\nand passed him some compliments as to the reputation and merit of his\nworks. Congreve thanked him; but at the same, time told Voltaire _he did\nnot choose to be considered as an author, but only as a private\ngentleman, and in that light expected to be visited._ Voltaire answered,\n_that if he had never been any thing but a private gentleman, in all\nprobability he had never been troubled with that visit._ He also\nobserves, in his own account of this affair, he was not a little\ndisgusted with so unseasonable a piece of vanity.\n\nThe memory of Voltaire and Rousseau is still cherished by the French\npeople with great fondness; their busts or figures in bronze or plaster\nare frequently met with, and remind one of _Penates_, or household gods.\n\nPHILO.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\nPOPULAR SUPERSTITIONS.\n\n\nWITCHCRAFT.\n\n(_For the Mirror_.)\n\n--Why should the envious world\nThrow all their scandalous malice upon me?\n'Cause I am poor, deform'd, and ignorant;\nAnd like a bow, buckled and bent together,\nBy some more strong in mischiefs than myself:\nMust I for that be made a common sink\nFor all the filth and rubbish of men's tongues,\nTo fall and run into? some call me witch;\nAnd, being ignorant of myself, they go\nAbout to teach me how to be one; urging\nThat my bad tongue (by their bad usage made so)\nForespeaks their cattle, doth bewitch their corn,\nThemselves, their servants, and their babes at nurse;\nThis they enforce upon me; and in part\nMake me to credit it. _Witch of Edmonton._\n\nThe belief in witchcraft may be considered as forming a prominent and\nimportant feature in the history of the human mind. It is certainly one\nlink of the degrading chain of superstitions which have long enslaved\nmankind, but which are now quivering to their fall. The desire for power\nto pry into hidden things, and more especially events to come, is\ninherent in the human race, and has always been considered as of no\nordinary importance, and rendered the supposed possessors objects of\nreverence and fear. The belief in astrology, or the power to read in the\nstars the knowledge of futurity, from time immemorial has been\nconsidered as the most difficult of attainment, and important in its\nresults. And by the aid of a little supernatural machinery, both\nmagicians and astrologers exercised the most unlimited influence over\nthe understandings of their adherents. An astrologer, only two or three\ncenturies since, was a regular appendage to the establishments of\nprinces and nobles. Sir Walter Scott has drawn an interesting portrait\nof one in _Kenilworth_; and the eagerness with which the Earl of\nLeicester listened to his doctrines and predictions, affords a good\nspecimen of the manners of those times. The movements of the heavenly\nbodies, (imperfectly as they were then understood,) seemed to afford the\nmost plausible vehicle for these \"oracles of human destiny;\" and even\nnow, while we are tracing these lines, the red and glaring appearance of\nthe planet Mars, shining so beautifully in the south-east, is considered\nby the many as a forerunner and sign of long wars and much bloodshed:\n\nThese dreams and terrors magical,\n  These miracles and witches,\nNight walking sprites, et cetera,\n  Esteem them not two rushes.\n\nMankind are universally prone to the belief in omens, and the casual\noccurrence of certain contingent circumstances soon creates the easiest\nof theories. Should a bird of good omen, in ancient times, perch on the\nstandard, or hover about an army, the omen was of good import, and\nfavourable to conquest. Should a raven or crow accidentally fly over the\nfield of action, the spirits of the combatants would be proportionably\ndepressed. Should a planet be shining in its brilliancy at the birth of\nany one whose fortunes rose to pre-eminence, it was always thought to\nexert an influence over his future destiny. Such was the origin of many\nof our later superstitions, which \"grew with their growth, and\nstrengthened with their strength,\" till the more extensive introduction\nof the art of printing partly dissipated the illusion. It has been\nremarked, therefore, that the existence of the parent stock of the\nsubject more immediately under our consideration, witchcraft, may be\ntraced to a very remote period indeed. It is, however, needless to enter\ninto any remarks on those witches mentioned in the Scriptures. The\nearliest dabbler of the _genus_, as a contemporary writer observes, is\nsaid to be Zoroaster, thought to be the king of the Bactrians, who\nflourished about 3,800 years ago, or A.M. 2000. He is supposed to have\nbeen well versed in the arts of divination and astrology, and was the\norigin of the Persian magi. \"At his birth,\" remarks an old writer, \"he\nlaughed; and his head did so beat, that it struck back the midwife's\nhand--a good sign of abundance of spirits, which are the best\ninstruments of a ready wit.\" The _magi_ in Persia, the Brahmins in\nIndia, the Chaldae in Assyria, the magicians of Arabia, the priesthood\nof Egypt, Greece, and Rome, and the Druids of Britain, were all members\nof a class which comprised astrology, omens, divination, conjuration,\nportents, chiromancy, and sorcery; and all united in the pursuit of\nenslaving mankind for the purposes of gain and power, with artfully\ndevised schemes, and a skilful series of impostures; and we can easily\nimagine the influence they must have exercised over the minds of their\nproselytes, when we bear in mind the effect produced by similar\ncontrivances in later days. The enchantress Theoris of Athens seems to\nhave been the first witch that had recourse to charms. Demosthenes uses\nthe terms both of witchery and imposture in speaking of her. This witch\nwas put to death by the Athenians--an accomplice having displayed to\nthem the charms, &c., by which she wrought her miracles. Our Saviour's\nwords, that _faith_ can remove mountains, are applicable particularly to\nthe supposed powers of witchcraft; and the influence of charms and\namulets in averting disease is well known. We have alluded, in our first\npaper, to the trial of Rose Cullender and Amy Duny, at Norwich, for\nwitchcraft; and we now give the speech of Sir Thomas Browne, the\ncelebrated physician of that period, (1664,) to whom, in consequence of\ndefect in the proof, the case was referred, which was the cause of their\nconviction. Sir Thomas Browne offered it as his opinion, \"that the\ndevil, in such cases, did work upon the bodies of men and women, upon a\nnatural foundation, (that is) to stir up and excite such humours\nsuperabounding in their bodies to a great excess, whereby he did, in an\nextraordinary manner, afflict them with such distempers as their bodies\nwere most subject to, as particularly appeared in the children of\nDorothy Dunent, (one of the indictments against the prisoners being for\ntheir bewitchment;) for he conceived that these swooning fits were\nnatural, and nothing else but that they call the mother, but _only\nheightened to a great excess by the subtilty of the devil co-operating\nwith the malice of these, which we term witches, at whose instance he\ndoth the villanies_.\"\n\nThe ceremony of initiation to the dreadful vocation and great powers of\nwitchcraft was attended with considerable form and mystery:--\n\n----They call me hag and witch.\nWhat is the name? When, and by what art learned?\nWith what spell, what charm or invocation,\nMay the thing call'd _familiar_ be purchas'd?\n\nThe older and more ugly the performer in these appalling ceremonies, the\nbetter. Some witches seem to have had the devil quite at their beck; but\nhis visits to most of them appear to have been \"few and far between.\"\nThe convention (remarks John Gaule, an old writer) for such a solemn\ninitiation being proclaimed (by some herald imp) to some others of the\nconfederation, on some great holy or Lord's day, they meet in some\nchurch, either before the consecrated bell hath tolled, or else very\nlate, after all the services are past and over. \"The party, in some\nvesture for that purpose, is presented by some confederate or familiar\nto the prince of devills, sitting now in a throne of infernall majesty,\nappearing in the form of a man, only labouring to hide his cloven foot.\nTo whom, after bowing and homage done, a petition is presented to be\nreceived into his association and protection; and first, if the witch be\noutwardly Christian, baptism must be renounced, and the party must be\nre-baptised in the devill's name, and a new name is also imposed by him,\nand here must be godfathers too... But above all he is very busie with\nhis long nails, in scraping and scratching those places of the forehead\nwhere the signe of the crosse was made, or where the chrisme was laid.\nInstead of both which, he impresses or inures the mark of the beast (the\ndevill's flesh brand) upon one or other part of the body. Further, the\nwitch (for her part) vows, either by word of mouth, or peradventure by\nwriting, (and that in her owne bloode,) to give both body and soul to\nthe devill, to deny and defy God the Father, the Son, and the Holy\nGhost; but especially the blessed Virgin, convitiating her with one\ninfamous nickname or other; to abhor the word and sacraments, but\nespecially to spit at the saying of masse; to spurn at the crosse, and\ntread saints' images under feet; and as much as possibly they may, to\nprofane all saints' reliques, holy water, consecrated salt, wax, &c.; to\nbe sure to fast on Sundays, and eat flesh on Fridays; not to confess\ntheir sins, whatsoever they do, especially to a priest; to separate from\nthe Catholic church, and despise his vicar's primacy; to attend the\ndevill's nocturnal conventicles, sabbaths, and sacrifices; to take him\nfor their god, worship, invoke, and obey him; to devote their children\nto him, and to labour all that they may to bring others into the same\nconfederacy. Then the devill, for his part, promises to be always\npresent with them, to serve them at their beck; that they shall have\ntheir wills upon any body; that they shall have what riches, honours,\nand pleasures they can imagine; and if any be so wary as to think of\ntheir future being, he tells them they shall be princes ruling in the\naire, or shall be but turned into impes at worst. Then he preaches to\nthem to be mindful of their covenant, and not to fail to revenge\nthemselves upon their enemies, Then, he commends to them (for this\npurpose) an imp, or familiar in the shape of a cat, &c. After this they\nshake hands, embrace in arms, dance, feast, and banquet, according as\nthe devill hath provided in imitation of the supper. Nay, ofttimes he\nmarries them ere they part, either to himselfe, or to their familiar, or\nto one another, and that by the Book of Common Prayer, as a pretender to\nwitch-finding told me, in the presence of many.\" After this they part,\nand a general meeting is held thrice a year, on some holy day; they are\n\"conveyed to it as swift as the winds from the remotest parts of the\nearth, where they that have done the most execrable mischiefe, and can\nbrag of it, make most merry with the devill;\" while the \"indiligent\" are\njeered and derided by the devil and the others. Non-attendance was\nseverely punished by the culprits being beaten on the soles of the feet,\nwhipped with iron rods, \"pinched and sucked by their familiars till\ntheir heart's blood come--till they repent them of their sloth, &c.\"\n\nMany regulations were, however, to be observed after the above\ninitiatory ceremony, which we have given at length in consequence of its\nsingularity. There existed a community or commonwealth, of \"fallen\nangels\" or spirits, with the various titles of kings, dukes, &c.,\nprelates and knights, of which the head was _Baal_, \"who, when he was\nconjured up, appeared with three heads, one like a man, one like a toad,\nand one like a cat.\" The title of king conferred no extra power; indeed,\n_Agares_, \"the first duke, came in the likeness of a faire old man,\nriding upon a crocodile, and carrying a hawk on his fist\"--_Marbas_, who\nappeared in the form of a \"mightie lion\"--_Amon_, \"a great and mightie\nmarques, who came abroad in the likeness of a wolf, having a serpent's\ntaile, and breathing out and spitting flames of fire,\" and was one of\nthe \"best and kindest of devills,\" with sixty-five more of these\nmaster-spirits, enumerated in _Scot_, \"appeared to be entirely and\nexclusively appropriated to the service of witches,\" were alike\npossessed of nearly similar power, and had many hundreds of legions of\ndevils (each legion 6,666 in number) at their command.\n\nThere were stated times for each rank of devils to be called on, for\nthey aught not to be invoked \"rashly or at all seasons;\" and the\nfollowing extracts from Reginald Scot are fully explanatory of the\nformalities to be observed on these occasions:--\n\n\"_The houres wherein the principal devills may be raised.--_A king may\nbe raised from the third houre till noone, and from the ninth hour till\nevening. Dukes may be raised from the first hour till noon, and clear\nweather is to be observed. Marquesses may be raised from the ninth hour\ntill compline, and from compline till the end of day. Countes, or\nearles, may be raised at any hour of the day, so it be in the woodes or\nfieldes, where men resort not. Prelates likewise may be raised at any\nhoure of the day. A president may not be raised at any hour of the day,\nexcept the king, whom he obeyeth, be invocated; nor at the shutting in\nof the evening. Knights from day-dawning till sun-rising, or from\neven-song till sun-set.\n\n\"_The forme of adjuring and citing the spirits aforesaid to\nappeare_.--When you will have any spirit, you must knowe his name and\noffice; you must also fast and be cleane from all pollution three or\nfoure days before; so will the spirit be more obedient unto you. Then\nmake a circle, and call up the spirit with great intention, rehearse in\nyour owne name, and your companion's, (for one must alwaies be with\nyou,) this prayer following; and so no spirit shall annoy you, and your\npurpose shall take effect. And note how thw prayer agreeth with popish\ncharmes and conjurations.\"\n\nThe prayer alluded to (see _Scot's Discovery_, b. 15, c. 2) is of the\nmost diabolical and blasphemous nature. A contemporary writer observes,\nthat there is not the least doubt but that the witches of the olden time\nobserved all the formalities of these ridiculous and disgusting\nceremonies to the very letter. In later times, however, though the\nformalities were quite simple, yet the hag of the sixteenth century\nexercised her vocation with all its ancient potency.\n\nThe broomstick has been the theme of many a story connected with this\nsubject:--\n\n  As men in sleep, though motionless they lie,\n  Fledged by a dream, believe they mount and fly;\n  So witches some enchanted wand bestride\n  And think they through the airy regions ride.\n\nBut the reason of its possessing such extensive powers of locomotion, or\nrather aerostation, is not generally understood. The witches either\nsteal or dig dead children out of their graves, which are then seethed\nin a cauldron, and the ointment and liquid so produced, enables them,\n\"observing certain ceremonies, to immediately become a master, or rather\na mistresse, in the practise or faculty\" of flying in the air:--\n\n  High in, air, amid the rising storm\n  ----wrapt in midnight\n  Her doubtful form appears and fades!\n  Her spirits are abroad! they do her bidding!\n  Hark to that shriek!\n\nIn addition to the above, they possessed another very useful faculty,\nfor the transfer of the patent of which, I doubt not scores of\nadventurers would have given a tolerable consideration. It is briefly\nthat of \"sailing in an egg-shell, a cockle, or a muscle-shell, through\nand under the tempestuous seas.\"\n\nFrom the length to which this article has extended, I must reserve an\naccount of witch-finders, charms, dreams, and confessions, &c. for the\nnext and concluding paper.

Anozoff made experiments on the hardening of steel\ninstruments, by putting them, when heated, into a powerful current of\nair, instead of quenching them in water. From the experiments already\nmade, he expects ultimate success. He finds that, for very sharp-edged\ninstruments, this method is much better than the ordinary one; that the\ncolder the air and the more rapid its stream, the greater is the effect.\nThe effect varies with the thickness of the mass to be hardened. The\nmethod succeeds well with case-hardened goods.-- _From the French_.\n\n\n_Detection of Blood_.\n\n\nA controversy has recently taken place in Paris, relative to the\nefficacy of certain chemical means of ascertaining whether dried spots\nor stains of matter suspected to be blood, are or were blood, or not. M.\nOrfila gives various chemical characters of blood under such\ncircumstances, which he thinks sufficient to enable an accurate\ndiscrimination. This opinion is opposed by M. Raspail, who states, that\nall the indications supposed to belong to true blood, may be obtained\nfrom, linen rags, dipped, not into blood, but into a mixture of white of\negg and infusion of madder, and that, therefore, the indications are\ninjurious rather than useful.\n\n\n_Cedars of Lebanon_.\n\n\nMr. Wolff, the missionary, counted on Mount Lebanus, thirteen large and\nancient cedars, besides the numerous small ones, in the whole 387\ntrees. The largest of these trees was about 15 feet high, not one-third\nof the height of hundreds of English cedars; for instance, those at\nWhitton, Pain's Hill, Caenwood, and Juniper Hall, near Dorking.\n\n_Leeches_.\n\nIn the _Medical Repository_, a case is quoted, where some leeches, which\nhad been employed first on a syphylitic patient and afterwards on an\ninfant, communicated the disease to the latter.\n\n_Stinging Flies_.\n\nThere is a fly which exteriorly much resembles the house-fly, and which\nis often very troublesome about this time; this is called the stinging\nfly, one of the greatest plagues to cattle, as well as to persons\nwearing thin stockings.\n\n_Mont Blanc_.\n\nThe height of Mont Blanc and of the Lake of Geneva has lately been\ncarefully ascertained by M. Roger, an officer of engineers in the\nservice of the Swiss Confederation. The summit of the mountain appears\nto be 4,435 metres, or 14,542 English feet above the Lake of Geneva, and\nthe surface of the Lake 367 metres, or 1,233 English feet above the sea.\nThe mountain is, therefore, 15,775 feet above the level of the sea.\n\n_Bird Catching_.\n\nThe golden-crested wren may be taken by striking the bough upon which it\nis sitting, sharply, with a stone or stick. The timid bird immediately\ndrops to the ground, and generally dead. As their skins are tender,\nthose who want them for stuffing will find this preferable to using the\ngun.--_Mag. Nat. Hist._\n\n_Shower of Herrings in Ross-shire_.\n\nIn April last, as Major Forbes, of Fodderty, in Strathpfeffer, was\ntraversing a field on his farm, he found a considerable portion of the\nground covered with herring fry, of from three to four inches in length.\nThe fish were fresh and entire, and had no appearance of being dropped\nby birds--a medium by which they must have been bruised and mutilated.\nThe only rational conjecture that can be formed of the circumstance is,\nthat the fish were transported thither in a water-spout--a phenomenon\nthat has before occurred in the same county. The Firth of Dengwall lies\nat a distance of three miles from the place in question; but no\nobstruction occurs between the field and the sea, the whole is a level\nstrath or plain, and water spouts have been known to travel even farther\nthan this.--_Inverness Courier._\n\n_Spanish Asses_.\n\nThe Duke of Buckingham has, at his seat at Avington, a team of Spanish\nasses, resembling the zebra in appearance, which are extremely\ntractable, and take more freely to the collar than any of our native\nspecies.\n\n_Drawing Instrument_.\n\nAn ingenious invention of this description was recently exhibited at the\nRoyal Institution. A pencil and a small bead are so connected together\nby means of a thread passing over pullies, that if a person, looking\nthrough an eye-piece, will hold the pencil upon a sheet of paper, and\nthen, watching the bead, will move his hand, so that the bead shall\ntrace the lines of any object that is selected or looked at, he will\nfind that, whilst he has been doing this, he has also made a drawing of\nthe subject upon the paper; for the pencil and the bead describe exactly\nthe same lines, though upon different planes. Thus, a drawing is made,\nwithout even looking at the paper, but solely at the object.\n\n_White Cats_.\n\nIn a recent number we quoted from _Loudon's Gardener's Magazine_, that\n\"white cats with blue eyes are always deaf,\" of which extraordinary fact\nthere is the following confirmation in the _Magazine of Natural\nHistory_, No. 2, likewise conducted by Mr. Loudon:--\"Some years ago a\nwhite cat of the Persian kind (probably not a thorough-bred one)\nprocured from Lord Dudley's at Hindley, was kept in my family as a\nfavourite. The animal was a female, quite white, and perfectly deaf. She\nproduced, at various times, many litters of kittens, of which,\ngenerally, some were quite white, others more or less mottled, tabby,\n&c. But the extraordinary circumstance is, that of the offspring\nproduced at one and the same birth, such as, like the mother, were\nentirely white, were, like her, invariably deaf; while those that had\nthe least speck of colour on their fur, as invariably possessed the\nusual faculty of hearing--\" _W. T. Bree, Allersley Rectory, near\nCoventry_.\n\n_Ultramarine_.\n\nA French journal announces a discovery of the method of making\nUltramarine, by which means the public are supplied with the article at\none guinea per ounce, the colour having hitherto been sold from two\nguineas to two pounds ten shillings per ounce.\n\n_Indication of Storms_.\n\nProfessor Scott, of Sandhurst College, observed in Shetland, that\ndrinking-glasses placed in an inverted position upon a shelf in a\ncupboard, on the ground floor of Belmont House, occasionally emitted\nsounds as if they were tapped with a knife, or raised up a little, and\nthen let fall on the shelf. These sounds preceded wind, and when they\noccurred, boats and vessels were immediately secured. The strength of\nthe sound is said to be proportional to the tempest that\nfollows.--_Brewster's Jour._\n\n_To preserve Wine in draught._\n\nM. Imery, of Toulouse, gives the following simple means of preserving\nwine in draught for a considerable time; it is sufficient to pour into\nthe cask a flask of fine olive oil. The wine may thus continue in\ndraught for more than a year. The oil spread in a thin layer upon the\nsurface of the wine, hinders the evaporation of its alcoholic part, and\nprevents it from combining with the atmospheric air, which would not\nonly turn the wine sour, but change its constituent parts.\n\n_Union of the Atlantic and Pacific._\n\nA letter from Amsterdam states, that the project of cutting a canal, to\nunite the Gulf of Mexico with the Pacific Ocean, is about to be revived.\n\n_Vesuvius._\n\nAn eruption took place on the morning of last March 22nd. An eye-witness\nwrites \"the cone of the mountain puts you in mind of an immense piece of\nartillery, firing red-hot stones, and ashes, and smoke into the\natmosphere; or, of a huge animal in pain, groaning;, crying, and\nvomiting; or, like an immense whale in the arctic circle, blowing after\nit has been struck with several harpoons.\"\n\n_Bees in Mourning._\n\nA correspondent in _Loudon's Magazine of Natural History_, states that\nin the neighbourhood of Coventry, there is a superstitious belief, that\nin the event of the death of any of the family, it is necessary to\ninform the bees of the circumstance, otherwise they will desert the\nhive, and seek out other quarters.\n\n_Rare Insects._\n\nThere exists in Livonia, a very rare insect, which is not met with in\nmore northern countries, and whose existence was for a long time\nconsidered doubtful, called the _Furia Infernalis._ It is so small that\nit is very difficult to distinguish it by the naked eye; and its sting\nproduces a swelling, which, unless a proper remedy be applied, proves\nmortal.\n\nDuring the hay harvest, other insects named _Meggar,_ occasion great\ninjury both to men and beasts. They are of the size of a grain of sand.\nAt sunset they appear in great numbers, descend in a perpendicular line,\npierce the strongest linen, and cause an itching, and pustules, which if\nscratched, become dangerous. Cattle, which breathe these insects, are\nattacked with swellings in the throat, which destroy them, unless\npromptly relieved.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSPIRIT OF THE PUBLIC JOURNALS\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMEN AND MONKEYS.\n\nMonkeys are certainly, there is no denying it, very like men; and, what\nis worse, men are still more like monkeys. Many worthy people, who have\na high respect for what they choose to call the Dignity of Human Nature,\nare much distressed by this similitude, approaching in many cases to\nabsolute identity; and some of them have written books of considerable\nerudition and ingenuity, to prove that a man is not a monkey; nay, not\nso much as even an ape; but truth compels us to confess, that their\nspeculations have been far from carrying conviction to our minds. All\nsuch inquirers, from Aristotle to Smellie, principally insist on two\ngreat leading distinctions--speech and reason. But it is obvious to the\nmeanest capacity, that monkeys have both speech and reason. They have a\nlanguage of their own, which, though not so capacious as the Greek, is\nmuch more so than the Hottentottish; and as for reason, no man of a\ntruly philosophical genius ever saw a monkey crack a nut, without\nperceiving that the creature possesses that endowment, or faculty, in no\nsmall perfection. Their speech, indeed, is said not to be articulate;\nbut it is audibly more so than the Gaelic. The words unquestionably do\nrun into each other, in a way that, to our ears, renders it rather\nunintelligible; but it is contrary to all the rules of sound\nphilosophizing, to confuse the obtuseness of our own senses with the\nwant of any faculty in others; and they have just as good a right to\nmaintain, and to complain of, our inarticulate mode of speaking, as we\nhave of theirs--indeed much more--for monkeys speak the same, or nearly\nthe same, language all over the habitable globe, whereas men, ever since\nthe Tower of Babel, have kept chattering, muttering, humming, and\nhawing, in divers ways and sundry manners, so that one nation is unable\nto comprehend what another would be at, and the earth groans in vain\nwith vocabularies and dictionaries. That monkeys and men are one and the\nsame animal, we shall not take upon ourselves absolutely to assert, for\nthe truth is, we, for one or two, know nothing whatever about the\nmatter; all we mean to say is, that nobody has yet proved that they are\nnot, and farther, that whatever may be the case with men, monkeys have\nreason and speech.\n\nThe monkey has not had justice done him, we repeat and insist upon it;\nfor what right have you to judge of a whole people, from a few isolated\nindividuals,--and from a few isolated individuals, too, running up poles\nwith a chain round their waist, twenty times the length of their own\ntail, or grinning in ones or twos through the bars of a cage in a\nmenagerie? His eyes are red with perpetual weeping--and his smile is\nsardonic in captivity. His fur is mouldy and mangy, and he is manifestly\nashamed of his tail, prehensile no more--and of his paws, \"very hands,\nas you may say,\" miserable matches to his miserable feet. To know him as\nhe is, you must go to Senegal; or if that be too far off for a trip\nduring the summer vacation, to the Rock of Gebir, now called Gibraltar,\nand see him at his gambols among the cliffs. Sailor nor slater would\nhave a chance with him there, standing on his head on a ledge of six\ninches, five hundred feet above the level of the sea, without ever so\nmuch as once tumbling down; or hanging at the same height from a bush by\nthe tail, to dry, or air, or sun himself, as if he were flower or fruit.\nThere he is, a monkey indeed; but you catch him young, clap a pair of\nbreeches on him, and an old red jacket, and oblige him to dance a\nsaraband on the stones of a street, or perch upon the shoulder of Bruin,\nequally out of his natural element, which is a cave among the woods.\nHere he is but the ape of a monkey. Now if we were to catch you young,\ngood subscriber or contributor, yourself, and put you into a cage to\ncrack nuts and pull ugly faces, although you might, from continued\npractice, do both to perfection, at a shilling a-head for grown-up\nladies and gentlemen, and sixpence for children and servants, and even\nat a lower rate after the collection had been some weeks in town, would\nyou not think it exceedingly hard to be judged of in that one of your\npredicaments, not only individually, but nationally--that is, not only\nas Ben Hoppus, your own name, but as John Bull, the name of the people\nof which you are an incarcerated specimen? You would keep incessantly\ncrying out against this with angry vociferation, as a most unwarrantable\nand unjust Test and Corporation Act. And, no doubt, were an\nOurang-outang to see you in such a situation, he would not only form a\nmost mean opinion of you as an individual, but go away with a most false\nimpression of the whole human race. _Blackwood's Magazine._\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSONNET WRITTEN IN THE SPRING.\n\nHow heavenly o'er my frame steals the life-breath\nOf beautiful Spring! who with her amorous gales\nKissing the violets, each stray sweet exhales\nOf May-thorn, and the wild flower on the heath.\nI love thee, virgin daughter of the year!\nYet, ah! not cups,--dyed like the dawn, impart\nTheir elves' dew-nectar to a fainting heart!--\nYe birds!\n\n### Summary:"}

Palestine!\n\nNo war correspondents, no Red Cross or relief committees have gone to\nPalestine, because no actual fighting has taken place there, and yet\nhundreds of thousands are suffering there that worst of agonies, the\nagony of the spirit.\n\nThose who have devoted their lives to show the world that Palestine can\nbe made again a country flowing with milk and honey, those who have\ndreamed of reviving the spirit of the prophets and the great teachers,\nare hanged and persecuted and exiled, their dreams shattered, their holy\nplaces profaned, their work ruined. Cut off from the world, with no\nbread to sustain the starving body, the heavy boot of a barbarian\nsoldiery trampling their very soul, the dreamers of Palestine refuse to\nsurrender, and amidst the clash of guns and swords they are battling for\nthe spirit with the weapons of the spirit.\n\nThe time has not yet come to write the record of these battles, nor even\nto attempt to render justice to the sublime heroes of Palestine. This\nbook is merely the story of some of the personal experiences of one who\nhas done less and suffered less than thousands of his comrades.\n\nALEXANDER AARONSOHN\n\n\n\n\nWITH THE TURKS IN PALESTINE.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nZICRON-JACOB\n\n\nThirty-five years ago, the impulse which has since been organized as the\nZionist Movement led my parents to leave their homes in Roumania and\nemigrate to Palestine, where they joined a number of other Jewish\npioneers in founding Zicron-Jacob--a little village lying just south of\nMount Carmel, in that fertile coastal region close to the ancient Plains\nof Armageddon.\n\nHere I was born; my childhood was passed here in the peace and harmony\nof this little agricultural community, with its whitewashed stone houses\nhuddled close together for protection against the native Arabs who, at\nfirst, menaced the life of the new colony. The village was far more\nsuggestive of Switzerland than of the conventional slovenly villages of\nthe East, mud-built and filthy; for while it was the purpose of our\npeople, in returning to the Holy Land, to foster the Jewish language and\nthe social conditions of the Old Testament as far as possible, there\nwas nothing retrograde in this movement. No time was lost in introducing\nprogressive methods of agriculture, and the climatological experiments\nof other countries were observed and made use of in developing the ample\nnatural resources of the land.\n\n[ILLUSTRATION: THE CEMETERY OF ZICRON-JACOB]\n\nEucalyptus, imported from Australia, soon gave the shade of its cool,\nhealthful foliage where previously no trees had grown. In the course of\ntime dry farming (which some people consider a recent discovery, but\nwhich in reality is as old as the Old Testament) was introduced and\nextended with American agricultural implements; blooded cattle were\nimported, and poultry-raising on a large scale was undertaken with the\naid of incubators--to the disgust of the Arabs, who look on such\nusurpation of the hen's functions as against nature and sinful. Our\npeople replaced the wretched native trails with good roads, bordered by\nhedges of thorny acacia which, in season, were covered with downy little\nyellow blossoms that smelled sweeter than honey when the sun was on\nthem.\n\nMore important than all these, a communistic village government was\nestablished, in which both sexes enjoyed equal rights, including that of\nsuffrage--strange as this may seem to persons who (when they think of\nthe matter at all) form vague conceptions of all the women-folk of\nPalestine as shut up in harems.\n\nA short experience with Turkish courts and Turkish justice taught our\npeople that they would have to establish a legal system of their own;\ntwo collaborating judges were therefore appointed--one to interpret the\nMosaic law, another to temper it with modern jurisprudence. All Jewish\ndisputes were settled by this court. Its effectiveness may be judged by\nthe fact that the Arabs, weary of Turkish venality,--as open and\nshameless as anywhere in the world,--began in increasing numbers to\nbring their difficulties to our tribunal. Jews are law-abiding people,\nand life in those Palestine colonies tended to bring out the fraternal\nqualities of our race; but it is interesting to note that in over thirty\nyears not one Jewish criminal case was reported from forty-five\nvillages.\n\nZicron-Jacob was a little town of one hundred and thirty \"fires\"--so we\ncall it--when, in 1910, on the advice of my elder brother, who was head\nof the Jewish Experiment Station at Athlit, an ancient town of the\nCrusaders, I left for America to enter the service of the United States\nin the Department of Agriculture. A few days after reaching this country\nI took out my first naturalization papers and proceeded to Washington,\nwhere I became part of that great government service whose beneficent\nactivity is too little known by Americans. Here I remained until June,\n1913, when I returned to Palestine with the object of taking\nmotion-pictures and stereopticon views. These I intended to use in a\nlecturing tour for spreading the Zionist propaganda in the United\nStates.\n\nDuring the years of my residence in America, I was able to appreciate\nand judge in their right value the beauty and inspiration of the life\nwhich my people led in the Holy Land. From a distance, too, I saw better\nthe need for organization among our communities, and I determined to\nbuild up a fraternal union of the young Jewish men all over the country.\n\nTwo months after my return from America, an event occurred which gave\nimpetus to these projects. The physician of our village, an old man who\nhad devoted his entire life to serving and healing the people of\nPalestine, without distinction of race or religion, was driving home one\nevening in his carriage from a neighboring settlement. With him was a\nyoung girl of sixteen. In a deserted place they were set upon by four\narmed Arabs, who beat the old man to unconsciousness as he tried, in\nvain, to defend the girl from the terrible fate which awaited her.\n\nNight came on. Alarmed by the absence of the physician, we young men\nrode out in search of him. We finally discovered what had happened; and\nthen and there, in the serene moonlight of that Eastern night, with\ntragedy close at hand, I made my comrades take oath on the honor of\ntheir sisters to organize themselves into a strong society for the\ndefense of the life and honor of our villagers and of our people at\nlarge.\n\nThese details are, perhaps, useful for the better understanding of the\ndisturbances that came thick and fast when in August, 1914, the\nwar-madness broke out among the nations of Europe. The repercussion was\nat once felt even in our remote corner of the earth. Soon after the\nGerman invasion of Belgium the Turkish army was mobilized and all\ncitizens of the Empire between nineteen and forty-five years were called\nto the colors. As the Young Turk Constitution of 1909 provided that all\nChristians and Jews were equally liable to military service, our young\nmen knew that they, too, would be called upon to make the common\nsacrifice. For the most part, they were not unwilling to sustain the\nTurkish Government. While the Constitution imposed on them the burden of\nmilitarism, it had brought with it the compensation of freedom of\nreligion and equal rights; and we could not forget that for six hundred\nyears Turkey has held her gates wide open to the Jews who fled from the\nSpanish Inquisition and similar ministrations of other civilized\ncountries.\n\nOf course, we never dreamed that Turkey would do anything but remain\nneutral. If we had had any idea of the turn things were ultimately to\ntake, we should have given a different greeting to the _mouchtar_, or\nsheriff, who came to our village with the list of mobilizable men to be\ncalled on for service. My own position was a curious one. I had every\nintention of completing the process of becoming an American citizen,\nwhich I had begun by taking out \"first papers.\" In the eyes of the law,\nhowever, I was still a Turkish subject, with no claim to American\nprotection. This was sneeringly pointed out to me by the American Consul\nat Haifa, who happens to be a German; so there was no other course but\nto surrender myself to the Turkish Government.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nPRESSED INTO THE SERVICE\n\n\nThere was no question as to my eligibility for service. I was young and\nstrong and healthy--and even if I had not been, the physical examination\nof Turkish recruits is a farce. The enlisting officers have a theory of\ntheir own that no man is really unfit for the army--a theory which has\nbeen fostered by the ingenious devices of the Arabs to avoid\nconscription. To these wild people the protracted discipline of military\ntraining is simply a purgatory, and for weeks before the recruiting\nofficers are due, they dose themselves with powerful herbs and physics\nand fast, and nurse sores into being, until they are in a really\ndeplorable condition. Some of them go so far as to cut off a finger or\ntwo. The officers, however, have learned to see beyond these little\ntricks, and few Arabs succeed in wriggling through their drag-net. I\nhave watched dozens of Arabs being brought in to the recruiting office\non camels or horses, so weak were they, and welcomed into the service\nwith a severe beating--the sick and the shammers sharing the same fate.\nThus it often happens that some of the new recruits die after their\nfirst day of garrison life.\n\nTogether with twenty of my comrades, I presented myself at the\nrecruiting station at Acco (the St. Jean d'Acre of history). We had been\ngiven to understand that, once our names were registered, we should be\nallowed to return home to provide ourselves with money, suitable\nclothing, and food, as well as to bid our families good-bye. To our\nastonishment, however, we were marched off to the Han, or caravanserai,\nand locked into the great courtyard with hundreds of dirty Arabs. Hour\nafter hour passed; darkness came, and finally we had to stretch\nourselves on the ground and make the best of a bad situation. It was a\nnight of horrors. Few of us had closed an eye when, at dawn, an officer\nappeared and ordered us out of the Han. From our total number about\nthree hundred (including four young men from our village and myself)\nwere picked out and told to make ready to start at once for Saffed, a\ntown in the hills of northern Galilee near the Sea of Tiberias, where\nour garrison was to be located. No attention was paid to our requests\nthat we be allowed to return to our homes for a final visit. That same\nmorning we were on our way to Saffed--a motley, disgruntled crew.\n\n[ILLUSTRATION: SAFFED]\n\nIt was a four days' march--four days of heat and dust and physical\nsuffering. The September sun smote us mercilessly as we straggled along\nthe miserable native trail, full of gullies and loose stones. It would\nnot have been so bad if we had been adequately shod or clothed; but soon\nwe found ourselves envying the ragged Arabs as they trudged along\nbarefoot, paying no heed to the jagged flints. (Shoes, to the Arab, are\narticles for ceremonious indoor use; when any serious walking is to be\ndone, he takes them off, slings them over his shoulder, and trusts to\nthe horny soles of his feet.)\n\nTo add to our troubles, the Turkish officers, with characteristic\nfatalism, had made no commissary provision for us whatever. Any food we\nate had to be purchased by the roadside from our own funds, which were\nscant enough to start with. The Arabs were in a terrible plight. Most of\nthem were penniless, and, as the pangs of hunger set in, they began\npillaging right and left from the little farms by the wayside. From\nmodest beginnings--poultry and vegetables--they progressed to larger\ngame, unhindered by the officers. Houses were entered, women insulted;\ntime and again I saw a stray horse, grazing by the roadside, seized by a\ncrowd of grinning Arabs, who piled on the poor beast's back until he was\nalmost crushed to earth, and rode off triumphantly, while their comrades\nheld back the weeping owner. The result of this sort of\n\"requisitioning,\" was that our band of recruits was followed by an\nincreasing throng of farmers--imploring, threatening, trying by hook or\nby crook to win back the stolen goods. Little satisfaction did they get,\nalthough some of them went with us as far as Saffed.\n\nOur garrison town is not an inviting place, nor has it an inviting\nreputation. Lord Kitchener himself had good reason to remember it. As a\nyoung lieutenant of twenty-three, in the Royal Engineering Corps, he was\nnearly killed there by a band of fanatical Arabs while surveying for the\nPalestine Exploration Fund. Kitchener had a narrow escape of it (one of\nhis fellow officers was shot dead close by him), but he went calmly\nahead and completed his maps, splendid large-scale affairs which have\nnever since been equaled--and which are now in use by the Turkish and\nGerman armies! However, though Saffed combines most of the unpleasant\ncharacteristics of Palestine native towns, we welcomed the sight of it,\nfor we were used up by the march. An old deserted mosque was given us\nfor barracks; there, on the bare stone floor, in close-packed\npromiscuity, too tired to react to filth and vermin, we spent our first\nnight as soldiers of the Sultan, while the milky moonlight streamed in\nthrough every chink and aperture, and bats flitted round the vaulting\nabove the snoring carcasses of the recruits.\n\nNext morning we were routed out at five. The black depths of the well in\nthe center of the mosque courtyard provided doubtful water for washing,\nbathing, and drinking; then came breakfast,--our first government\nmeal,--consisting, simply enough, of boiled rice, which was ladled out\ninto tin wash-basins holding rations for ten men. In true Eastern\nfashion we squatted down round the basin and dug into the rice with our\nfingers. At first I was rather upset by this sort of table manners, and\nfor some time I ate with my eyes fixed on my own portion, to avoid\nseeing the Arabs, who fill the palms of their hands with rice, pat it\ninto a ball and cram it into their mouths just so, the bolus making a\ngreat lump in their lean throats as it reluctantly descends.\n\nIn the course of that same morning we were allotted our uniforms. The\nTurkish uniform, under indirect German influence, has been greatly\nmodified during the past five years. It is of khaki--a greener khaki\nthan that of the British army, and of conventional European cut. Spiral\nputtees and good boots are provided; the only peculiar feature is the\nheadgear--a curious, uncouth-looking combination of the turban and the\nGerman helmet, devised by Enver Pasha to combine religion and\npracticality, and called in his honor _enverieh_. (With commendable\nthrift, Enver patented his invention, and it is rumored that he has\ndrawn a comfortable fortune from its sale.) An excellent uniform it is,\non the whole; but, to our disgust, we found that in the great olive-drab\npile to which we were led, there was not a single new one. All were old,\ndiscarded, and dirty, and the mere thought of putting on the clothes of\nsome unknown Arab legionary, who, perhaps, had died of cholera at Mecca\nor Yemen, made me shudder. After some indecision, my friends and I\nfinally went up to one of the officers and offered to _buy_ new uniforms\nwith the money we expected daily from our families. The officer,\nscenting the chance for a little private profit, gave his consent.\n\nThe days and weeks following were busy ones. From morning till night, it\nwas drill, drill, and again drill. We were divided into groups of fifty,\neach of which was put in charge of a young non-commissioned officer from\nthe Military School of Constantinople or Damascus, or of some Arab who\nhad seen several years' service. These instructors had a hard time of\nit; the German military system, which had only recently been introduced,\nwas too much for them. They kept mixing up the old and the new methods\nof training, with the result that it was often hopeless to try and make\nout their orders. Whole weeks were spent in grinding into the Arabs the\nnames of the different parts of the rifle; weeks more went to teaching\nthem to clean it--although it must be said that, once they had mastered\nthese technicalities, they were excellent shots. Their efficiency would\nhave been considerably greater if there had been more target-shooting.\nFrom the very first, however, we felt that there was a scarcity of\nammunition. This shortage the drill-masters, in a spirit of\ncompensation, attempted to make up by abundant severity. The whip of\nsoft, flexible, stinging leather, which seldom leaves the Turkish\nofficer's hand, was never idle. This was not surprising, for the Arab is\na cunning fellow, whose only respect is for brute force. He exercises it\nhimself on every possible victim, and expects the same treatment from\nhis superiors.\n\nSo far as my comrades and I were concerned, I must admit that we were\ngenerally treated kindly. We knew most of the drill-exercises from the\ngymnastic training we had practiced since childhood, and the officers\nrealized that we were educated and came from respectable families. The\nsame was also true with regard to the native Christians, most of whom\ncan read and write and are of a better class than the Mohammedans of the\ncountry. When Turkey threw in her lot with the Germanic powers, the\nattitude toward the Jews and Christians changed radically; but of this I\nshall speak later.\n\nIt was a hard life we led while in training at Saffed; evening would\nfind us dead tired, and little disposed for anything but rest. As the\ntremendous light-play of the Eastern sunsets faded away, we would gather\nin little groups in the courtyard of our mosque--its minaret towering\nblack against a turquoise sky--and talk fitfully of the little\nhappenings of the day, while the Arabs murmured gutturally around us.\nOccasionally, one of them would burst into a quavering, hot-blooded\ntribal love-song. It happened that I was fairly well known among these\nnatives through my horse Kochba--of pure Maneghi-Sbeli blood--which I\nhad purchased from some Anazzi Bedouins who were encamped not far from\nAleppo: a swift and intelligent animal he was, winner of many races, and\nin a land where a horse is considerably more valuable than a wife, his\nownership cast quite a glamour over me.\n\n[ILLUSTRATION: THE AUTHOR ON HIS HORSE KOCHBA]\n\nIn the evenings, then, the Arabs would come up to chat. As they speak\nseldom of their children, of their women-folk never, the conversation\nwas limited to generalities about the crops and the weather, or to the\nrecitation of never-ending tales of Abou-Zeid, the famous hero of the\nBeni-Hilal, or of Antar the glorious. Politics, of which they have\namazing ideas, also came in for discussion. Napoleon Bonaparte and Queen\nVictoria are still living figures to them; but (significantly enough)\nthey considered the Kaiser king of all the kings of this world, with the\nexception of the Sultan, whom they admitted to equality.\n\nSeldom did an evening pass without a dance. As darkness fell, the Arabs\nwould gather in a great circle around one of their comrades, who\nsquatted on the ground with a bamboo flute; to a weird minor music they\nwould begin swaying and moving about while some self-chosen poet among\nthem would sing impromptu verses to the flute _obbligato_. As a rule the\nthemes were homely.\n\n\"To-morrow we shall eat rice and meat,\" the singer would wail.\n\n\"_Yaha lili-amali\"_ (my endeavor be granted), came the full-throated\nresponse of all the others. The chorus was tremendously effective.\nSometimes the singer would indulge in pointed personalities, with\nanswering roars of laughter.\n\nThese dances lasted for hours, and as they progressed the men gradually\nworked themselves up into a frenzy. I never failed to wonder at these\npeople, who, without the aid of alcohol, could reproduce the various\nstages of intoxication. As I lay by and watched the moon riding serenely\nabove these frantic men and their twisting black shadows, I reflected\nthat they were just in the condition when one word from a holy man would\nsuffice to send them off to wholesale murder and rapine.\n\nIt was my good fortune soon to be released from the noise and dirt of\nthe mosque. I had had experience with corruptible Turkish officers; and\none day, when barrack conditions became unendurable, I went to the\nofficer commanding our division--an old Arab from Latakieh who had been\ncalled from retirement at the time of the mobilization. He lived in a\nlittle tent near the mosque, where I found him squatting on the floor,\nnodding drowsily over his comfortable paunch. As he was an officer of\nthe old regime, I entered boldly, squatted beside him and told him my\ntroubles. The answer came with an enormous shrug of the shoulders.\n\n\"You are serving the Sultan. Hardship should be sweet!\"\n\n\"I should be more fit to serve him if I got more sleep and rest.\"\n\nHe waved a fat hand about the tent.\n\n\"Look at me! Here I am, an officer of rank and\"--shooting a knowing\nlook at me--\"I have not even a nice blanket.\"\n\n\"A crime! A crime!\" I interrupted. \"To think of it, when I, a humble\nsoldier, have dozens of them at home! I should be honored if you would\nallow me--\" My voice trailed off suggestively.\n\n\"How could you get one?\" he asked.\n\n\"Oh, I have friends here in Saffed but I _must_ be able to sleep in a\nnice place.\"\n\n\"Of course; certainly. What would you suggest?\"\n\n\"That hotel kept by the Jewish widow might do,\" I replied.\n\nMore amenities were exchanged, the upshot of which was that my four\nfriends and I were given permission to sleep at the inn--a humble place,\nbut infinitely better than the mosque. It was all perfectly simple.\n\n[ILLUSTRATION: SOLDIERS' TENTS IN SAMARIA]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nTHE GERMAN PROPAGANDA\n\n\nSo passed the days of our training, swiftly, monotonously, until the\nfateful December morning when the news came like a thunderbolt that\nTurkey was about to join hands with Germany. We had had reports of the\nwar--of a kind. Copies of telegrams from Constantinople, printed in\nArabic, were circulated among us, giving accounts of endless German\nvictories. These, however, we had laughed at as fabrications of a\nPrussophile press agency, and in our skepticism we had failed to give\nthe Teutons credit for the successes they had actually won. To us, born\nand bred in the East as we were, the success of German propaganda in the\nTurkish Empire could not come as an overwhelming surprise; but its\nfullness amazed us.\n\nIt may be of timely interest to say a few words here regarding this\npropaganda as I have seen it in Palestine, spreading under strong and\nefficient organization for twenty years.\n\nIn order to realize her imperialistic dreams, Germany absolutely needed\nPalestine. It was the key to the whole Oriental situation. No mere\ncoincidence brought the Kaiser to Damascus in November, 1898,--the same\nmonth that Kitchener, in London, was hailed as Gordon's avenger,--when\nhe uttered his famous phrase at the tomb of Saladin: \"Tell the three\nhundred million Moslems of the world that I am their friend!\" We have\nall seen photographs of the imperial figure, draped in an amazing\nburnous of his own designing (above which the Prussian _Pickelhaube_\nrises supreme), as he moved from point to point in this portentous\nvisit: we may also have seen Caran d'Ache's celebrated cartoon (a\nsubject of diplomatic correspondence) representing this same imperial\nfigure, in its Oriental toggery, riding into Jerusalem on an ass.\n\nThe nations of Europe laughed at this visit and its transparent purpose,\nbut it was all part of the scheme which won for the Germans the\nconcessions for the Konia-Bagdad Railway, and made them owners of the\ndouble valley of the Euphrates and Tigris. Through branch lines\nprojected through the firman, they are practically in control of both\nthe Syrian routes toward the Cypriotic Mediterranean and the Lebanon\nvalleys. They also control the three Armenian routes of Cappadocia, the\nBlack Sea, and the trans-Caucasian branch of Urfa, Marach, and Mardine.\n(The fall of Erzerum has altered conditions respecting this last.) They\ndominate the Persian routes toward Tauris and Teheran as well; and last,\nbut not least, the Gulf branch of Zobeir. These railways delivered into\nGerman hands the control of Persia, whence the road to India may be made\neasy: through Syria lies the route to the Suez Canal and Egypt, which\nwas used in February, 1915, and will probably be used again this year.\n\nTo make this Oriental dream a reality, the Germans have not relied on\ntheir railway concessions alone. Their Government has done everything in\nits power to encourage German colonization in Palestine. Scattered all\nover the country are German mills that half of the time have nothing to\ngrind. German hotels have been opened in places seldom frequented by\ntourists. German engineers appeared in force, surveying, sounding,\nnoting. All these colonists held gatherings in the Arab villages, when\nthe ignorant natives were told of the greatness of Germany, of her good\nintentions, and of the evil machinations of other powers. What I state\nhere can be corroborated by any one who knows Palestine and has lived in\nit.\n\nAbout the time when we first knew that Turkey would join the Germanic\npowers came the news that the \"Capitulations\" had been revoked. As is\ngenerally known, foreigners formerly enjoyed the protection of their\nrespective consuls. The Turkish Government, under the terms of the\nso-called Capitulations, or agreements, had no jurisdiction over an\nAmerican, for instance, or a Frenchman, who could not be arrested\nwithout the consent of his consul. In the Ottoman Empire, where law and\njustice are not at a premium, such protection was a wholesome and\nnecessary policy.\n\nThe revoking of the Capitulations was a terrible blow to all the\nEuropeans, meaning, as it did, the practical abolition of all their\nrights. Upon the Arabs it acted like an intoxicant. Every boot-black or\nboatman felt that he was the equal of the accursed Frank, who now had no\nconsul to protect him; and abuses began immediately. Moreover, as if by\nmagic, the whole country became Germanized. In all the mosques, Friday\nprayers were ended with an invocation for the welfare of the Sultan and\n\"Hadji Wilhelm.\" The significance of this lies in the fact that the\ntitle \"Hadji\" can be properly applied only to a Moslem who has made the\npilgrimage to Mecca and kissed the sacred stone of the Kaaba. Instant\ndeath is the penalty paid by any Christian who is found within that\nenclosure: yet Wilhelm II, head of the Lutheran faith, stepped forward\nas \"Hadji Wilhelm.\" His pictures were sold everywhere; German officers\nappeared; and it seemed as if a wind of brutal mastery were blowing.\n\nThe dominant figure of this movement in Palestine was, without doubt,\nthe German Consul at Haifa, Leutweld von Hardegg. He traveled about the\ncountry, making speeches, and distributing pamphlets in Arabic, in which\nit was elaborately proved that Germans are not Christians, like the\nFrench or English, but that they are descendants of the prophet\nMohammed. Passages from the Koran were quoted, prophesying the coming of\nthe Kaiser as the Savior of Islam.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nROAD-MAKING AND DISCHARGE\n\n\nThe news of the actual declaration of war by Turkey caused a tremendous\nstir in our regiment. The prevailing feeling was one of great\nrestlessness and discontent. The Arabs made many bitter remarks against\nGermany. \"Why didn't she help us against the Italians during the war for\nTripoli?\" they said. \"Now that she is in trouble she is drawing us into\nthe fight.\" Their opinions, however, soon underwent a change. In the\nfirst place, they came to realize that Turkey had taken up arms against\nRussia; and Russia is considered first and foremost the arch-enemy.\nGerman reports of German successes also had a powerful effect on them.\nThey began to grow boastful, arrogant; and the sight of the plundering\nof Europeans, Jews, and Christians convinced them that a very desirable\nregime was setting in. Saffed has a large Jewish colony, and it was\ntorment for me to have to witness the outrages that my people suffered\nin the name of \"requisitioning.\"\n\nThe final blow came one morning when all the Jewish and Christian\nsoldiers of our regiment were called out and told that henceforth they\nwere to serve in the _taboor amlieh_, or working corps. The object of\nthis action, plainly enough, was to conciliate and flatter the\nMohammedan population, and at the same time to put the Jews and\nChristians, who for the most part favored the cause of the Allies, in a\nposition where they would be least dangerous. We were disarmed; our\nuniforms were taken away, and we became hard-driven \"gangsters.\" I shall\nnever forget the humiliation of that day when we, who, after all, were\nthe best-disciplined troops of the lot, were first herded to our work of\npushing wheelbarrows and handling spades, by grinning Arabs, rifle on\nshoulder. We were set to building the road between Saffed and Tiberias,\non the Sea of Galilee--a link in the military highway from Damascus to\nthe coast, which would be used for the movement of troops in case the\nrailroad should be cut off. It had no immediate strategic bearing on the\nattack against Suez, however.\n\nFrom six in the morning till seven at night we were hard at it, except\nfor one hour's rest at noon. While we had money, it was possible to get\nsome slight relief by bribing our taskmasters; but this soon came to an\nend, and we had to endure their brutality as best we could. The\nwheelbarrows we used were the property of a French company which,\nbefore the war, was undertaking a highway to Beirut. No grease was\nprovided for the wheels, so that there was a maddening squeaking and\nsquealing in addition to the difficulty of pushing the barrows. One day\nI suggested to an inspection officer that if the wheels were not greased\nthe axles would be burned out. He agreed with me and issued an order\nthat the men were to provide their own oil to lubricate the wheels!\n\nI shall not dwell on the physical sufferings we underwent while working\non this road, for the reason that the conditions I have described were\nprevalent over the whole country; and later, when I had the opportunity\nto visit some construction camps in Samaria and Judaea found that in\ncomparison our lot had been a happy one. While we were breaking stones\nand trundling squeaking wheelbarrows, however, the most disquieting\nrumors began to drift in to us from our home villages. Plundering had\nbeen going on in the name of \"requisitioning\"; the country was full of\nsoldiery whose capacity for mischief-making was well known to us, and it\nwas torture to think of what might be happening in our peaceful homes\nwhere so few men had been left for protection. All the barbed-wire\nfences, we heard, had been torn up and sent north for the construction\nof barricades. In a wild land like Palestine, where the native has no\nrespect for property, where fields and crops are always at the mercy of\nmarauders, the barbed-wire fence has been a tremendous factor for\ncivilization, and with these gone the Arabs were once more free to sweep\nacross the country unhindered, stealing and destroying.\n\nThe situation grew more and more unbearable. One day a little Christian\nsoldier--a Nazarene--disappeared from the ranks. We never saw him again,\nbut we learned that his sister, a very young girl, had been forcibly\ntaken by a Turkish officer of the Nazareth garrison. In Palestine, the\ndishonor of a girl can be redeemed by blood alone. The young soldier had\nhunted for his sister, found her in the barracks, and shot her; he then\nsurrendered himself to the military authorities, who undoubtedly put him\nto death. He had not dared to kill the real criminal,--the officer,--for\nhe knew that this would not only bring death to his family, but would\ncall down terrible suffering on all the Christians of Nazareth.\n\n[ILLUSTRATION: NAZARETH, FROM THE NORTHEAST]\n\nWhen I learned of this tragedy, I determined to get out of the army and\nreturn to my village at all costs. Nine Turkish officers out of ten can\nbe bought, and I had reason to know that the officer in command at\nSaffed was not that tenth man. Now, according to the law of the country,\na man has the right to purchase exemption from military service for a\nsum equivalent to two hundred dollars. My case was different, for I was\nalready enrolled; but everything is possible in Turkey. I set to work,\nand in less than two weeks I had bought half a dozen officers, ranging\nfrom corporal to captain, and had obtained consent of the higher\nauthorities to my departure, provided I could get a physician's\ncertificate declaring me unfit for service.\n\nThis was arranged in short order, although I am healthy-looking and the\ndoctor found some difficulty in hitting on an appropriate ailment.\nFinally he decided that I had \"too much blood\"--whatever that might\nmean. With his certificate in hand, I paid the regular price of two\nhundred dollars from funds which had been sent me by my family, and\nwalked out of the barracks a free man. My happiness was mingled with\nsadness at the thought of leaving the comrades with whom I had suffered\nand hoped. The four boys from my village were splendid. They felt that I\nwas right in going home to do what I could for the people, but when they\nkissed me good-bye, in the Eastern fashion, the tears were running down\ntheir cheeks; and they were all strong, brave fellows.\n\nOn my way back to Zicron-Jacob, I passed through the town of Sheff'amr,\nwhere I got a foretaste of the conditions I was to find at home. A\nTurkish soldier, sauntering along the street, helped himself to fruit\nfrom the basket of an old vender, and went on without offering to pay a\nfarthing. When the old man ventured to protest, the soldier turned like\na flash and began beating him mercilessly, knocking him down and\nbattering him until he was bruised, bleeding, and covered with the mud\nof the street. There was a hubbub; a crowd formed, through which a\nTurkish officer forced his way, demanding explanations. The soldier\nsketched the situation in a few words, whereupon the officer, turning to\nthe old man, said impressively,--\"If a soldier of the Sultan should\nchoose to heap filth on your head, it is for you to kiss his hand in\ngratitude.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nTHE HIDDEN ARMS\n\n\nWhen I finally reached Zicron-Jacob, I found rather a sad state of\naffairs. Military law had been declared. No one was supposed to be seen\nin the streets after sundown. The village was full of soldiers, and\ncivilians had to put up with all kinds of ill-treatment. Moreover, our\npeople were in a state of great excitement because an order had recently\ncome from the Turkish authorities bidding them surrender whatever\nfire-arms or weapons they had in their possession. A sinister command,\nthis: we knew that similar measures had been taken before the terrible\nArmenian massacres, and we felt that some such fate might be in\npreparation for our people. With the arms gone, the head men of the\nvillage knew that our last hold over the Arabs, our last chance for\ndefense against sudden violence, would be gone, and they had refused to\ngive them up. A house-to-house search had been made--fruitlessly, for\nour little arsenal was safely cached in a field, beneath growing grain.\n\nIt was a tense, unpleasant situation. At any time the Turks might decide\nto back up their demand by some of the violent methods of which they\nare past masters. A family council was held in my home, and it was\ndecided to send my sister, a girl of twenty-three, to some friends at\nthe American Syrian Protestant College at Beirut, so that we might be\nable to move freely without the responsibility of having a girl at home,\nin a country where, as a matter of course, the women-folk are seized and\ncarried off before a massacre. At Beirut we knew that there was an\nAmerican Consul-General, who kept in continual touch with the battleship\nanchored in the harbor for the protection of American interests.\n\nMy sister got away none too soon. One evening shortly after her\ndeparture, when I was standing in the doorway of our house watching the\never fresh miracle of the Eastern sunset, a Turkish officer came riding\ndown the street with about thirty cavalrymen. He called me out and\nordered me to follow him to the little village inn, where he dismounted\nand led me to one of the inner rooms, his spurs jingling loudly as we\npassed along the stone corridor.\n\nI never knew whether I had been selected for this attention because of\nmy prominence as a leader of the Jewish young men or simply because I\nhad been standing conveniently in the doorway. The officer closed the\ndoor and came straight to the point by asking me where our store of\narms was hidden. He was a big fellow, with the handsome, cruel features\nusual enough in his class. There was no open menace in his first\nquestion. When I refused to tell him, he began wheedling and offering\nall sorts of favors if I would betray my people. Then, all of a sudden,\nhe whipped out a revolver and stuck the muzzle right in my face. I felt\nthe blood leave my heart, but I was able to control myself and refuse\nhis demand. The officer was not easily discouraged; the hours I passed\nin that little room, with its smoky kerosene lamp, were terrible ones. I\nrealized, however, how tremendously important the question of the arms\nwas, and strength was given me to hold out until the officer gave up in\ndisgust and let me go home.\n\n[ILLUSTRATION: HOUSE OF THE AUTHOR'S FATHER, EPHRAIM FISHL AARONSOHN, IN\nZICRON-JACOB]\n\nMy father, an old man, knew nothing of what had happened, but the rest\nof my family were tremendously excited. I made light of the whole\naffair, but I felt sure that this was only the beginning. Sure enough,\nnext morning--the Sabbath--the same officer returned and put three of\nthe leading elders of the village, together with myself, under arrest.\nAfter another fruitless inquisition at the hotel, we were handcuffed and\nstarted on foot toward the prison, a day's journey away. As our little\nprocession passed my home, my father, who was aged and feeble, came\ntottering forward to say good-bye to me. A soldier pushed him roughly\nback; he reeled, then fell full-length in the street before my eyes.\n\nIt was a dismal departure. We were driven through the streets shackled\nlike criminals, and the women and children came out of the houses and\nwatched us in silence--their heads bowed, tears running down their\ncheeks. They realized that for thirty-five years these old men, my\ncomrades, had been struggling and suffering for their ideal--a\nregenerated Palestine; now, in the dusk of their life, it seemed as if\nall their hopes and dreams were coming to ruin. The oppressive tragedy\nof the situation settled down on me more and more heavily as the day\nwore on and heat and fatigue told on my companions. My feelings must\nhave been written large on my face, for one of them, a fine-looking\npatriarch, tried to give me comfort by reminding me that we must not\nrely upon strength of arms, and that our spirit could never be broken,\nno matter how defenseless we were. Thus he, an old man, was encouraging\nme instead of receiving help from my youth and enthusiasm.\n\nAt last we arrived at the prison and were locked into separate cells.\nThat same night we were tortured with the _falagy_, or bastinado. The\nvictim of this horrible punishment is trussed up, arms and legs, and\nthrown on his knees; then, on the bare soles of his feet a pliant green\nrod is brought down with all the force of a soldier's arm. The pain is\nexquisite; blood leaps out at the first cut, and strong men usually\nfaint after thirty or forty strokes. Strange to say, the worst part of\nit is not the blow itself, but the whistling of the rod through the air\nas it rushes to its mark. The groans of my older comrades, whose gasps\nand prayers I could hear through the walls of the cell, helped me bear\nthe agony until unconsciousness mercifully came to the rescue.\n\nFor several days more we were kept in the prison, sick and broken with\nsuffering. The second night, as I lay sleepless and desperate on the\nstrip of dirty matting that served as bed, I heard a scratch-scratching\nat the grated slit of a window, and presently a slender stick was\ninserted into the cell. I went over and shook it; some one at the other\nend was holding it firm. And then, a curious whispering sound began to\ncome from the end of the stick. I put my ear down, and caught the voice\nof one of the men from our village. He had taken a long bamboo pole,\npierced the joints, and crept up behind a broken old wall close beneath\nmy window. By means of this primitive telephone we talked as long as we\ndared. I assured him that we were still enduring, and urged him on no\naccount to give up the arms to the Turkish authorities--not even if we\nhad to make the ultimate sacrifice.\n\nFinally, when it was found that torture and imprisonment would not make\nus yield our secret, the Turks resorted to the final test--the ordeal\nwhich we could not withstand. They announced that on a certain date a\nnumber of our young girls would be carried off and handed over to the\nofficers, to be kept until the arms were disclosed. We knew that they\nwere capable of carrying out this threat; we knew exactly what it meant.\nThere was no alternative. The people of our village had nothing to do\nbut dig up the treasured arms and, with broken hearts, hand them over to\nthe authorities.\n\nAnd so the terrible news was brought to us one morning that we were\nfree. Personally, I felt much happier on the day I was put in prison\nthan when I was released. I had often wondered how our people had been\nable to bear the rack and thumbscrew of the Spanish Inquisition; but\nwhen my turn and my comrades' came for torture, I realized that the same\nspirit that helped our ancestors was working in us also.\n\nNow I knew that our suffering had been useless. Whenever the Turkish\nauthorities wished, the horrors of the Armenian massacres would live\nagain in Zicron-Jacob, and we should be powerless to raise a hand to\nprotect ourselves. As we came limping home through the streets of our\nvillage, I caught sight of my own Smith & Wesson revolver in the hands\nof a mere boy of fifteen--the son of a well-known Arab outlaw. I\nrealized then that the Turks had not only taken our weapons, but had\ndistributed them among the natives in order to complete our humiliation.\nThe blood rushed to my face. I started forward to take the revolver away\nfrom the boy, but one of the old men caught hold of my sleeve and held\nme back.\n\n[ILLUSTRATION: IN A NATIVE CAFE, SAFFED/A LEMONADE-SELLER OF DAMASCUS]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nTHE SUEZ CAMPAIGN\n\n\nI have already spoken of the so-called \"requisitioning\" that took place\namong our people while I was working at Saffed. This, of course, really\namounted to wholesale pillage. The hand of the Turkish looters had\nfallen particularly heavy on carts and draught animals. As the Arabs\nknow little or nothing of carting, hauling, or the management of horses\nand mules, the Turks, simply enough, had \"requisitioned\" many of the\nowners--middle-aged or elderly men--and forced them to go south to help\nalong with the tremendous preparations that were being made for the\nattack on Suez. Among these were a number of men from our village. In\nthe course of time their families began to get the most harrowing\nmessages from them. They were absolutely destitute, no wages being paid\nthem by the Turks; their clothes were dropping off them in rags; many\nwere sick. After much excited planning, it was decided to send another\nman and myself down south on a sort of relief expedition, with a\nsubstantial sum of money that had been raised with great difficulty by\nour people. Through the influence of my brother at the Agricultural\nExperiment Station, I got permission from the _mouchtar_ to leave\nZicron-Jacob, and about the middle of January, 1915, I set out for\nJerusalem.\n\nTo Western minds, the idea of the Holy City serving as a base for modern\nmilitary operations must be full of incongruities. And, as a matter of\nfact, it _was_ an amazing sight to see the streets packed with\nkhaki-clad soldiers and hear the brooding silence of ancient walls\nshattered by the crash of steel-shod army boots. Here, for the first\ntime, I saw the German officers--quantities of them. Strangely out of\nplace they looked, with their pink-and-whiteness that no amount of hot\nsunshine could quite burn off. They wore the regular German officer's\nuniform, except that the _Pickelhaube_ was replaced by a khaki\nsun-helmet. I was struck by the youthfulness of them; many were nothing\nbut boys, and there were weak, dissolute faces in plenty--a fact that\nwas later explained when I heard that Palestine had been the\ndumping-ground for young men of high family whose parents were anxious\nto have them as far removed as possible from the danger zone. Fast's\nHotel was the great meeting-place in Jerusalem for these young bloods.\nEvery evening thirty or forty would foregather there to drink and talk\nwomen and strategy. I well remember the evening when one of them--a\nslender young Prussian with no back to his head, braceleted and\nmonocled--rose and announced, in the decisive tones that go with a\ncertain stage of intoxication: \"What we ought to do is to hand over the\norganization of this campaign to Thomas Cook & Sons!\"\n\nHowever, the German officers were by no means all incompetents. They\nrealized (I soon found out) that they had little hope of bringing a big\narmy through the Egyptian desert and making a successful campaign there.\nTheir object was to immobilize a great force of British troops around\nthe Canal, to keep the Mohammedan population in Palestine impressed with\nTurkish power, and to stir up religious unrest among the natives in\nEgypt. It must be admitted that in the first two of these purposes they\nhave been successful.\n\nThe Turks were less far-sighted. They believed firmly that they were\ngoing to sweep the English off the face of the earth and enter Cairo in\ntriumph, and preparations for the march on Suez went on with feverish\nenthusiasm. The ideas of the common soldiers on this subject were\namusing. Some of them declared that the Canal was to be filled up by the\nsandbags which had been prepared in great quantities. Others held that\nthousands of camels would be kept without water for many days preceding\nthe attack; then the thirsty animals, when released, would rush into the\nCanal in such numbers that the troops could march to victory over the\npacked masses of drowned bodies.\n\nThe army operating against Suez numbered about one hundred and fifty\nthousand men. Of these about twenty thousand were Anatolian\nTurks--trained soldiers, splendid fighting material, as was shown by\ntheir resistance at the Dardanelles. The rest were Palestinian Arabs,\nand very inferior troops they were. The Arab as a soldier is at once\nstupid and cunning: fierce when victory is on his side, but unreliable\nwhen things go against him. In command of the expedition was the famous\nDjemal Pasha, a Young Turk general of tremendous energy, but possessing\nsmall ability to see beyond details to the big, broad concepts of\nstrategy. Although a great friend of Enver Pasha, he looked with\ndisfavor on the German officers and, in particular, on Bach Pasha, the\nGerman Governor of Jerusalem, with whom he had serious disagreements.\nThis dislike of the Germans was reflected among the lesser Turkish\nofficers. Many of these, after long years of service, found themselves\nsubordinated to young foreigners, who, in addition to arbitrary\npromotion, received much higher salaries than the Turks. What is more,\nthey were paid in clinking gold, whereas the Turks, when paid at all,\ngot paper currency.\n\nBeersheba, a prosperous town of the ancient province of Idumea, was the\nsouthern base of operations for the advance on Suez. Some of our\nvillagers had been sent to this district, and, in searching for them, I\nhad the opportunity of seeing at least the taking-off place of the\nexpedition. Beyond this point no Jew or Christian was allowed to pass,\nwith the exception of the physicians, all of whom were non-Mohammedans\nwho had been forced into the army.\n\nBeersheba was swarming with troops. They filled the town and overflowed\non to the sands outside, where a great tent-city grew up. And everywhere\nthat the Turkish soldiers went, disorganization and inefficiency\nfollowed them. From all over the country the finest camels had been\n\"requisitioned\" and sent down to Beersheba until, at the time I was\nthere, thousands and thousands of them were collected in the\nneighborhood. Through the laziness and stupidity of the Turkish\ncommissariat officers, which no amount of German efficiency could\ncounteract, no adequate provision was made for feeding them, and\nincredible numbers succumbed to starvation and neglect. Their great\ncarcasses dotted the sand in all directions; it was only the wonderful\nantiseptic power of the Eastern sun that held pestilence in check.\n\nThe soldiers themselves suffered much hardship. The crowding in the\ntents was unspeakable; the water-supply was almost as inadequate as the\nmedical service, which consisted chiefly of volunteer Red Crescent\nsocieties--among them a unit of twenty German nurses sent by the\nAmerican College at Beirut. Medical supplies, such as they were, had\nbeen taken from the different mission hospitals and pharmacies of\nPalestine--these \"requisitions\" being made by officers who knew nothing\nof medical requirements and simply scooped together everything in sight.\nAs a result, one of the army physicians told me that in Beersheba he had\nopened some medical chests consigned to him and found, to his horror,\nthat they were full of microscopes and gynecological instruments--for\nthe care of wounded soldiers in the desert!\n\nVisits of British aeroplanes to Beersheba were common occurrences. Long\nbefore the machine itself could be seen, its whanging, resonant hum\nwould come floating out of the blazing sky, seemingly from everywhere at\nonce. Soldiers rushed from their tents, squinting up into the heavens\nuntil the speck was discovered, swimming slowly through the air; then\nfollowed wholesale firing at an impossible range until the officers\nforbade it. True to the policy of avoiding all unnecessary harm to the\nnatives, these British aviators never dropped bombs on the town,\nbut--what was more dangerous from the Turkish point of view--they would\nunload packages of pamphlets, printed in Arabic, informing the natives\nthat they were being deceived; that the Allies were their only true\nfriends; that the Germans were merely making use of them to further\ntheir own schemes, etc. These cleverly worded little tracts came\nshowering down out of the sky, and at first they were eagerly picked up.\nThe Turkish commanders, however, soon announced that any one found\ncarrying them would pay the death penalty. After that, when the little\nbundles dropped near them, the natives would, run as if from high\nexplosive bombs.\n\nAll things considered, it is wonderful that the Turkish demonstration\nagainst the Canal came as near to fulfillment as it did. Twenty thousand\nsoldiers actually crossed the desert in six days on scant rations, and\nwith them they took two big guns, which they dragged by hand when the\nmules dropped from thirst and exhaustion. They also carried pontoons to\nbe used in crossing the Canal. Guns and pontoons are now at rest in the\nMuseum at Cairo.\n\nJust what took place in the attack is known to very few. The English\nhave not seen fit to make public the details, and there was little to be\ngot from the demoralized soldiers who returned to Beersheba. Piece by\npiece, however, I gathered that the attacking party had come up to the\nCanal at dawn. Finding everything quiet, they set about getting across,\nand had even launched a pontoon, when the British, who were lying in\nwait, opened a terrific fire from the farther bank, backed by armored\nlocomotives and aeroplanes. \"It was as if the gates of Jehannum were\nopened and its fires turned loose upon us,\" one soldier told me.\n\nThe Turks succeeded in getting their guns into action for a very short\nwhile. One of the men-of-war in the Canal was hit; several houses in\nIsmailia suffered damage; but the invaders were soon driven away in\nconfusion, leaving perhaps two thousand prisoners in the hands of the\nEnglish. If the latter had chosen to do so, they could have annihilated\nthe Turkish forces then and there. The ticklish state of mind of the\nMohammedan population in Egypt, however, has led them to adopt a policy\nof leniency and of keeping to the defensive, which subsequent\ndevelopments have more than justified. It is characteristic of England's\nfaculty for holding her colonies that batteries manned by Egyptians did\nthe finest work in defense of the Canal.\n\nThe reaction in Palestine after the defeat at Suez was tremendous. Just\nbefore the attack, Djemal Pasha had sent out a telegram announcing the\noverwhelming defeat of the British vanguard, which had caused wild\nenthusiasm.\n\n### Summary:"}

We could understand,\n     But none of us could lift a hand.\n     The man Flammonde appraised the youth,\n     And told a few of us the truth;\n     And thereby, for a little gold,\n     A flowered future was unrolled.\n\n     There were two citizens who fought\n     For years and years, and over nought;\n     They made life awkward for their friends,\n     And shortened their own dividends.\n     The man Flammonde said what was wrong\n     Should be made right; nor was it long\n     Before they were again in line,\n     And had each other in to dine.\n\n     And these I mention are but four\n     Of many out of many more.\n     So much for them.  But what of him--\n     So firm in every look and limb?\n     What small satanic sort of kink\n     Was in his brain?  What broken link\n     Withheld him from the destinies\n     That came so near to being his?\n\n     What was he, when we came to sift\n     His meaning, and to note the drift\n     Of incommunicable ways\n     That make us ponder while we praise?\n     Why was it that his charm revealed\n     Somehow the surface of a shield?\n     What was it that we never caught?\n     What was he, and what was he not?\n\n     How much it was of him we met\n     We cannot ever know; nor yet\n     Shall all he gave us quite atone\n     For what was his, and his alone;\n     Nor need we now, since he knew best,\n     Nourish an ethical unrest:\n     Rarely at once will nature give\n     The power to be Flammonde and live.\n\n     We cannot know how much we learn\n     From those who never will return,\n     Until a flash of unforeseen\n     Remembrance falls on what has been.\n     We've each a darkening hill to climb;\n     And this is why, from time to time\n     In Tilbury Town, we look beyond\n     Horizons for the man Flammonde.\n\n\n\n\nThe Gift of God\n\n\n\n     Blessed with a joy that only she\n     Of all alive shall ever know,\n     She wears a proud humility\n     For what it was that willed it so,--\n     That her degree should be so great\n     Among the favored of the Lord\n     That she may scarcely bear the weight\n     Of her bewildering reward.\n\n     As one apart, immune, alone,\n     Or featured for the shining ones,\n     And like to none that she has known\n     Of other women's other sons,--\n     The firm fruition of her need,\n     He shines anointed; and he blurs\n     Her vision, till it seems indeed\n     A sacrilege to call him hers.\n\n     She fears a little for so much\n     Of what is best, and hardly dares\n     To think of him as one to touch\n     With aches, indignities, and cares;\n     She sees him rather at the goal,\n     Still shining; and her dream foretells\n     The proper shining of a soul\n     Where nothing ordinary dwells.\n\n     Perchance a canvass of the town\n     Would find him far from flags and shouts,\n     And leave him only the renown\n     Of many smiles and many doubts;\n     Perchance the crude and common tongue\n     Would havoc strangely with his worth;\n     But she, with innocence unwrung,\n     Would read his name around the earth.\n\n     And others, knowing how this youth\n     Would shine, if love could make him great,\n     When caught and tortured for the truth\n     Would only writhe and hesitate;\n     While she, arranging for his days\n     What centuries could not fulfill,\n     Transmutes him with her faith and praise,\n     And has him shining where she will.\n\n     She crowns him with her gratefulness,\n     And says again that life is good;\n     And should the gift of God be less\n     In him than in her motherhood,\n     His fame, though vague, will not be small,\n     As upward through her dream he fares,\n     Half clouded with a crimson fall\n     Of roses thrown on marble stairs.\n\n\n\n\nThe Clinging Vine\n\n\n\n     \"Be calm?  And was I frantic?\n      You'll have me laughing soon.\n     I'm calm as this Atlantic,\n      And quiet as the moon;\n     I may have spoken faster\n      Than once, in other days;\n     For I've no more a master,\n      And now--'Be calm,' he says.\n\n     \"Fear not, fear no commotion,--\n      I'll be as rocks and sand;\n     The moon and stars and ocean\n      Will envy my command;\n     No creature could be stiller\n      In any kind of place\n     Than I...  No, I'll not kill her;\n      Her death is in her face.\n\n     \"Be happy while she has it,\n      For she'll not have it long;\n     A year, and then you'll pass it,\n      Preparing a new song.\n     And I'm a fool for prating\n      Of what a year may bring,\n     When more like her are waiting\n      For more like you to sing.\n\n     \"You mock me with denial,\n      You mean to call me hard?\n     You see no room for trial\n      When all my doors are barred?\n     You say, and you'd say dying,\n      That I dream what I know;\n     And sighing, and denying,\n      You'd hold my hand and go.\n\n     \"You scowl--and I don't wonder;\n      I spoke too fast again;\n     But you'll forgive one blunder,\n      For you are like most men:\n     You are,--or so you've told me,\n      So many mortal times,\n     That heaven ought not to hold me\n      Accountable for crimes.\n\n     \"Be calm?  Was I unpleasant?\n      Then I'll be more discreet,\n     And grant you, for the present,\n      The balm of my defeat:\n     What she, with all her striving,\n      Could not have brought about,\n     You've done.  Your own contriving\n      Has put the last light out.\n\n     \"If she were the whole story,\n      If worse were not behind,\n     I'd creep with you to glory,\n      Believing I was blind;\n     I'd creep, and go on seeming\n      To be what I despise.\n     You laugh, and say I'm dreaming,\n      And all your laughs are lies.\n\n     \"Are women mad?  A few are,\n      And if it's true you say--\n     If most men are as you are--\n      We'll all be mad some day.\n     Be calm--and let me finish;\n      There's more for you to know.\n     I'll talk while you diminish,\n      And listen while you grow.\n\n     \"There was a man who married\n      Because he couldn't see;\n     And all his days he carried\n      The mark of his degree.\n     But you--you came clear-sighted,\n      And found truth in my eyes;\n     And all my wrongs you've righted\n      With lies, and lies, and lies.\n\n     \"You've killed the last assurance\n      That once would have me strive\n     To rouse an old endurance\n      That is no more alive.\n     It makes two people chilly\n      To say what we have said,\n     But you--you'll not be silly\n      And wrangle for the dead.\n\n     \"You don't?  You never wrangle?\n      Why scold then,--or complain?\n     More words will only mangle\n      What you've already slain.\n     Your pride you can't surrender?\n      My name--for that you fear?\n     Since when were men so tender,\n      And honor so severe?\n\n     \"No more--I'll never bear it.\n      I'm going.  I'm like ice.\n     My burden?  You would share it?\n      Forbid the sacrifice!\n     Forget so quaint a notion,\n      And let no more be told;\n     For moon and stars and ocean\n      And you and I are cold.\"\n\n\n\n\nCassandra\n\n\n\n     I heard one who said:  \"Verily,\n      What word have I for children here?\n     Your Dollar is your only Word,\n      The wrath of it your only fear.\n\n     \"You build it altars tall enough\n      To make you see, but you are blind;\n     You cannot leave it long enough\n      To look before you or behind.\n\n     \"When Reason beckons you to pause,\n      You laugh and say that you know best;\n     But what it is you know, you keep\n      As dark as ingots in a chest.\n\n     \"You laugh and answer, 'We are young;\n      O leave us now, and let us grow.'--\n     Not asking how much more of this\n      Will Time endure or Fate bestow.\n\n     \"Because a few complacent years\n      Have made your peril of your pride,\n     Think you that you are to go on\n      Forever pampered and untried?\n\n     \"What lost eclipse of history,\n      What bivouac of the marching stars,\n     Has given the sign for you to see\n      Millenniums and last great wars?\n\n     \"What unrecorded overthrow\n      Of all the world has ever known,\n     Or ever been, has made itself\n      So plain to you, and you alone?\n\n     \"Your Dollar, Dove and Eagle make\n      A Trinity that even you\n     Rate higher than you rate yourselves;\n      It pays, it flatters, and it's new.\n\n     \"And though your very flesh and blood\n      Be what your Eagle eats and drinks,\n     You'll praise him for the best of birds,\n      Not knowing what the Eagle thinks.\n\n     \"The power is yours, but not the sight;\n      You see not upon what you tread;\n     You have the ages for your guide,\n      But not the wisdom to be led.\n\n     \"Think you to tread forever down\n      The merciless old verities?\n     And are you never to have eyes\n      To see the world for what it is?\n\n     \"Are you to pay for what you have\n      With all you are?\"--No other word\n     We caught, but with a laughing crowd\n      Moved on.  None heeded, and few heard.\n\n\n\n\nJohn Gorham\n\n\n\n     \"Tell me what you're doing over here, John Gorham,\n     Sighing hard and seeming to be sorry when you're not;\n     Make me laugh or let me go now, for long faces in the moonlight\n     Are a sign for me to say again a word that you forgot.\"--\n\n     \"I'm over here to tell you what the moon already\n     May have said or maybe shouted ever since a year ago;\n     I'm over here to tell you what you are, Jane Wayland,\n     And to make you rather sorry, I should say, for being so.\"--\n\n     \"Tell me what you're saying to me now, John Gorham,\n     Or you'll never see as much of me as ribbons any more;\n     I'll vanish in as many ways as I have toes and fingers,\n     And you'll not follow far for one where flocks have been before.\"--\n\n     \"I'm sorry now you never saw the flocks, Jane Wayland,\n     But you're the one to make of them as many as you need.\n     And then about the vanishing.  It's I who mean to vanish;\n     And when I'm here no longer you'll be done with me indeed.\"--\n\n     \"That's a way to tell me what I am, John Gorham!\n     How am I to know myself until I make you smile?\n     Try to look as if the moon were making faces at you,\n     And a little more as if you meant to stay a little while.\"--\n\n     \"You are what it is that over rose-blown gardens\n     Makes a pretty flutter for a season in the sun;\n     You are what it is that with a mouse, Jane Wayland,\n     Catches him and lets him go and eats him up for fun.\"--\n\n     \"Sure I never took you for a mouse, John Gorham;\n     All you say is easy, but so far from being true\n     That I wish you wouldn't ever be again the one to think so;\n     For it isn't cats and butterflies that I would be to you.\"--\n\n     \"All your little animals are in one picture--\n     One I've had before me since a year ago to-night;\n     And the picture where they live will be of you, Jane Wayland,\n     Till you find a way to kill them or to keep them out of sight.\"--\n\n     \"Won't you ever see me as I am, John Gorham,\n     Leaving out the foolishness and all I never meant?\n     Somewhere in me there's a woman, if you know the way to find her.\n     Will you like me any better if I prove it and repent?\"\n\n     \"I doubt if I shall ever have the time, Jane Wayland;\n     And I dare say all this moonlight lying round us might as well\n     Fall for nothing on the shards of broken urns that are forgotten,\n     As on two that have no longer much of anything to tell.\"\n\n\n\n\nStafford's Cabin\n\n\n\n     Once there was a cabin here, and once there was a man;\n     And something happened here before my memory began.\n     Time has made the two of them the fuel of one flame\n     And all we have of them is now a legend and a name.\n\n     All I have to say is what an old man said to me,\n     And that would seem to be as much as there will ever be.\n     \"Fifty years ago it was we found it where it sat.\"--\n     And forty years ago it was old Archibald said that.\n\n     \"An apple tree that's yet alive saw something, I suppose,\n     Of what it was that happened there, and what no mortal knows.\n     Some one on the mountain heard far off a master shriek,\n     And then there was a light that showed the way for men to seek.\n\n     \"We found it in the morning with an iron bar behind,\n     And there were chains around it; but no search could ever find,\n     Either in the ashes that were left, or anywhere,\n     A sign to tell of who or what had been with Stafford there.\n\n     \"Stafford was a likely man with ideas of his own--\n     Though I could never like the kind that likes to live alone;\n     And when you met, you found his eyes were always on your shoes,\n     As if they did the talking when he asked you for the news.\n\n     \"That's all, my son.  Were I to talk for half a hundred years\n     I'd never clear away from there the cloud that never clears.\n     We buried what was left of it,--the bar, too, and the chains;\n     And only for the apple tree there's nothing that remains.\"\n\n     Forty years ago it was I heard the old man say,\n     \"That's all, my son.\"--And here again I find the place to-day,\n     Deserted and told only by the tree that knows the most,\n     And overgrown with golden-rod as if there were no ghost.\n\n\n\n\nHillcrest\n\n         (To Mrs. Edward MacDowell)\n\n\n\n     No sound of any storm that shakes\n     Old island walls with older seas\n     Comes here where now September makes\n     An island in a sea of trees.\n\n     Between the sunlight and the shade\n     A man may learn till he forgets\n     The roaring of a world remade,\n     And all his ruins and regrets;\n\n     And if he still remembers here\n     Poor fights he may have won or lost,--\n     If he be ridden with the fear\n     Of what some other fight may cost,--\n\n     If, eager to confuse too soon,\n     What he has known with what may be,\n     He reads a planet out of tune\n     For cause of his jarred harmony,--\n\n     If here he venture to unroll\n     His index of adagios,\n     And he be given to console\n     Humanity with what he knows,--\n\n     He may by contemplation learn\n     A little more than what he knew,\n     And even see great oaks return\n     To acorns out of which they grew.\n\n     He may, if he but listen well,\n     Through twilight and the silence here,\n     Be told what there are none may tell\n     To vanity's impatient ear;\n\n     And he may never dare again\n     Say what awaits him, or be sure\n     What sunlit labyrinth of pain\n     He may not enter and endure.\n\n     Who knows to-day from yesterday\n     May learn to count no thing too strange:\n     Love builds of what Time takes away,\n     Till Death itself is less than Change.\n\n     Who sees enough in his duress\n     May go as far as dreams have gone;\n     Who sees a little may do less\n     Than many who are blind have done;\n\n     Who sees unchastened here the soul\n     Triumphant has no other sight\n     Than has a child who sees the whole\n     World radiant with his own delight.\n\n     Far journeys and hard wandering\n     Await him in whose crude surmise\n     Peace, like a mask, hides everything\n     That is and has been from his eyes;\n\n     And all his wisdom is unfound,\n     Or like a web that error weaves\n     On airy looms that have a sound\n     No louder now than falling leaves.\n\n\n\n\nOld King Cole\n\n\n\n     In Tilbury Town did Old King Cole\n     A wise old age anticipate,\n     Desiring, with his pipe and bowl,\n     No Khan's extravagant estate.\n     No crown annoyed his honest head,\n     No fiddlers three were called or needed;\n     For two disastrous heirs instead\n     Made music more than ever three did.\n\n     Bereft of her with whom his life\n     Was harmony without a flaw,\n     He took no other for a wife,\n     Nor sighed for any that he saw;\n     And if he doubted his two sons,\n     And heirs, Alexis and Evander,\n     He might have been as doubtful once\n     Of Robert Burns and Alexander.\n\n     Alexis, in his early youth,\n     Began to steal--from old and young.\n     Likewise Evander, and the truth\n     Was like a bad taste on his tongue.\n     Born thieves and liars, their affair\n     Seemed only to be tarred with evil--\n     The most insufferable pair\n     Of scamps that ever cheered the devil.\n\n     The world went on, their fame went on,\n     And they went on--from bad to worse;\n     Till, goaded hot with nothing done,\n     And each accoutred with a curse,\n     The friends of Old King Cole, by twos,\n     And fours, and sevens, and elevens,\n     Pronounced unalterable views\n     Of doings that were not of heaven's.\n\n     And having learned again whereby\n     Their baleful zeal had come about,\n     King Cole met many a wrathful eye\n     So kindly that its wrath went out--\n     Or partly out.

Oh, he knows it,--\n     And there's the Stratford in him; he denies it,\n     And there's the Shakespeare in him.  So, God help him!\n     I tell him he needs Greek; but neither God\n     Nor Greek will help him.  Nothing will help that man.\n     You see the fates have given him so much,\n     He must have all or perish,--or look out\n     Of London, where he sees too many lords;\n     They're part of half what ails him:  I suppose\n     There's nothing fouler down among the demons\n     Than what it is he feels when he remembers\n     The dust and sweat and ointment of his calling\n     With his lords looking on and laughing at him.\n     King as he is, he can't be king de facto,\n     And that's as well, because he wouldn't like it;\n     He'd frame a lower rating of men then\n     Than he has now; and after that would come\n     An abdication or an apoplexy.\n     He can't be king, not even king of Stratford,--\n     Though half the world, if not the whole of it,\n     May crown him with a crown that fits no king\n     Save Lord Apollo's homesick emissary:\n     Not there on Avon, or on any stream\n     Where Naiads and their white arms are no more,\n     Shall he find home again.  It's all too bad.\n     But there's a comfort, for he'll have that House--\n     The best you ever saw; and he'll be there\n     Anon, as you're an Alderman.  Good God!\n     He makes me lie awake o' nights and laugh.\n     And you have known him from his origin,\n     You tell me; and a most uncommon urchin\n     He must have been to the few seeing ones--\n     A trifle terrifying, I dare say,\n     Discovering a world with his man's eyes,\n     Quite as another lad might see some finches,\n     If he looked hard and had an eye for nature.\n     But this one had his eyes and their foretelling,\n     And he had you to fare with, and what else?\n     He must have had a father and a mother--\n     In fact I've heard him say so--and a dog,\n     As a boy should, I venture; and the dog,\n     Most likely, was the only man who knew him.\n     A dog, for all I know, is what he needs\n     As much as anything right here to-day,\n     To counsel him about his disillusions,\n     Old aches, and parturitions of what's coming,--\n     A dog of orders, an emeritus,\n     To wag his tail at him when he comes home,\n     And then to put his paws up on his knees\n     And say, \"For God's sake, what's it all about?\"\n\n     I don't know whether he needs a dog or not--\n     Or what he needs.  I tell him he needs Greek;\n     I'll talk of rules and Aristotle with him,\n     And if his tongue's at home he'll say to that,\n     \"I have your word that Aristotle knows,\n     And you mine that I don't know Aristotle.\"\n     He's all at odds with all the unities,\n     And what's yet worse, it doesn't seem to matter;\n     He treads along through Time's old wilderness\n     As if the tramp of all the centuries\n     Had left no roads--and there are none, for him;\n     He doesn't see them, even with those eyes,--\n     And that's a pity, or I say it is.\n     Accordingly we have him as we have him--\n     Going his way, the way that he goes best,\n     A pleasant animal with no great noise\n     Or nonsense anywhere to set him off--\n     Save only divers and inclement devils\n     Have made of late his heart their dwelling place.\n     A flame half ready to fly out sometimes\n     At some annoyance may be fanned up in him,\n     But soon it falls, and when it falls goes out;\n     He knows how little room there is in there\n     For crude and futile animosities,\n     And how much for the joy of being whole,\n     And how much for long sorrow and old pain.\n     On our side there are some who may be given\n     To grow old wondering what he thinks of us\n     And some above us, who are, in his eyes,\n     Above himself,--and that's quite right and English.\n     Yet here we smile, or disappoint the gods\n     Who made it so:  the gods have always eyes\n     To see men scratch; and they see one down here\n     Who itches, manor-bitten to the bone,\n     Albeit he knows himself--yes, yes, he knows--\n     The lord of more than England and of more\n     Than all the seas of England in all time\n     Shall ever wash.  D'ye wonder that I laugh?\n     He sees me, and he doesn't seem to care;\n     And why the devil should he?  I can't tell you.\n\n     I'll meet him out alone of a bright Sunday,\n     Trim, rather spruce, and quite the gentleman.\n     \"What ho, my lord!\" say I.  He doesn't hear me;\n     Wherefore I have to pause and look at him.\n     He's not enormous, but one looks at him.\n     A little on the round if you insist,\n     For now, God save the mark, he's growing old;\n     He's five and forty, and to hear him talk\n     These days you'd call him eighty; then you'd add\n     More years to that.  He's old enough to be\n     The father of a world, and so he is.\n     \"Ben, you're a scholar, what's the time of day?\"\n     Says he; and there shines out of him again\n     An aged light that has no age or station--\n     The mystery that's his--a mischievous\n     Half-mad serenity that laughs at fame\n     For being won so easy, and at friends\n     Who laugh at him for what he wants the most,\n     And for his dukedom down in Warwickshire;--\n     By which you see we're all a little jealous....\n     Poor Greene!  I fear the color of his name\n     Was even as that of his ascending soul;\n     And he was one where there are many others,--\n     Some scrivening to the end against their fate,\n     Their puppets all in ink and all to die there;\n     And some with hands that once would shade an eye\n     That scanned Euripides and Aeschylus\n     Will reach by this time for a pot-house mop\n     To slush their first and last of royalties.\n     Poor devils! and they all play to his hand;\n     For so it was in Athens and old Rome.\n     But that's not here or there; I've wandered off.\n     Greene does it, or I'm careful.  Where's that boy?\n\n     Yes, he'll go back to Stratford.  And we'll miss him?\n     Dear sir, there'll be no London here without him.\n     We'll all be riding, one of these fine days,\n     Down there to see him--and his wife won't like us;\n     And then we'll think of what he never said\n     Of women--which, if taken all in all\n     With what he did say, would buy many horses.\n     Though nowadays he's not so much for women:\n     \"So few of them,\" he says, \"are worth the guessing.\"\n     But there's a work at work when he says that,\n     And while he says it one feels in the air\n     A deal of circumambient hocus-pocus.\n     They've had him dancing till his toes were tender,\n     And he can feel 'em now, come chilly rains.\n     There's no long cry for going into it,\n     However, and we don't know much about it.\n     The Fitton thing was worst of all, I fancy;\n     And you in Stratford, like most here in London,\n     Have more now in the 'Sonnets' than you paid for;\n     He's put her there with all her poison on,\n     To make a singing fiction of a shadow\n     That's in his life a fact, and always will be.\n     But she's no care of ours, though Time, I fear,\n     Will have a more reverberant ado\n     About her than about another one\n     Who seems to have decoyed him, married him,\n     And sent him scuttling on his way to London,--\n     With much already learned, and more to learn,\n     And more to follow.  Lord! how I see him now,\n     Pretending, maybe trying, to be like us.\n     Whatever he may have meant, we never had him;\n     He failed us, or escaped, or what you will,--\n     And there was that about him (God knows what,--\n     We'd flayed another had he tried it on us)\n     That made as many of us as had wits\n     More fond of all his easy distances\n     Than one another's noise and clap-your-shoulder.\n     But think you not, my friend, he'd never talk!\n     Talk?  He was eldritch at it; and we listened--\n     Thereby acquiring much we knew before\n     About ourselves, and hitherto had held\n     Irrelevant, or not prime to the purpose.\n     And there were some, of course, and there be now,\n     Disordered and reduced amazedly\n     To resignation by the mystic seal\n     Of young finality the gods had laid\n     On everything that made him a young demon;\n     And one or two shot looks at him already\n     As he had been their executioner;\n     And once or twice he was, not knowing it,--\n     Or knowing, being sorry for poor clay\n     And saying nothing....  Yet, for all his engines,\n     You'll meet a thousand of an afternoon\n     Who strut and sun themselves and see around 'em\n     A world made out of more that has a reason\n     Than his, I swear, that he sees here to-day;\n     Though he may scarcely give a Fool an exit\n     But we mark how he sees in everything\n     A law that, given we flout it once too often,\n     Brings fire and iron down on our naked heads.\n     To me it looks as if the power that made him,\n     For fear of giving all things to one creature,\n     Left out the first,--faith, innocence, illusion,\n     Whatever 'tis that keeps us out o' Bedlam,--\n     And thereby, for his too consuming vision,\n     Empowered him out of nature; though to see him,\n     You'd never guess what's going on inside him.\n     He'll break out some day like a keg of ale\n     With too much independent frenzy in it;\n     And all for cellaring what he knows won't keep,\n     And what he'd best forget--but that he can't.\n     You'll have it, and have more than I'm foretelling;\n     And there'll be such a roaring at the Globe\n     As never stunned the bleeding gladiators.\n     He'll have to change the color of its hair\n     A bit, for now he calls it Cleopatra.\n     Black hair would never do for Cleopatra.\n\n     But you and I are not yet two old women,\n     And you're a man of office.  What he does\n     Is more to you than how it is he does it,--\n     And that's what the Lord God has never told him.\n     They work together, and the Devil helps 'em;\n     They do it of a morning, or if not,\n     They do it of a night; in which event\n     He's peevish of a morning.  He seems old;\n     He's not the proper stomach or the sleep--\n     And they're two sovran agents to conserve him\n     Against the fiery art that has no mercy\n     But what's in that prodigious grand new House.\n     I gather something happening in his boyhood\n     Fulfilled him with a boy's determination\n     To make all Stratford 'ware of him.  Well, well,\n     I hope at last he'll have his joy of it,\n     And all his pigs and sheep and bellowing beeves,\n     And frogs and owls and unicorns, moreover,\n     Be less than hell to his attendant ears.\n     Oh, past a doubt we'll all go down to see him.\n\n     He may be wise.  With London two days off,\n     Down there some wind of heaven may yet revive him;\n     But there's no quickening breath from anywhere\n     Shall make of him again the poised young faun\n     From Warwickshire, who'd made, it seems, already\n     A legend of himself before I came\n     To blink before the last of his first lightning.\n     Whatever there be, they'll be no more of that;\n     The coming on of his old monster Time\n     Has made him a still man; and he has dreams\n     Were fair to think on once, and all found hollow.\n     He knows how much of what men paint themselves\n     Would blister in the light of what they are;\n     He sees how much of what was great now shares\n     An eminence transformed and ordinary;\n     He knows too much of what the world has hushed\n     In others, to be loud now for himself;\n     He knows now at what height low enemies\n     May reach his heart, and high friends let him fall;\n     But what not even such as he may know\n     Bedevils him the worst:  his lark may sing\n     At heaven's gate how he will, and for as long\n     As joy may listen; but HE sees no gate,\n     Save one whereat the spent clay waits a little\n     Before the churchyard has it, and the worm.\n     Not long ago, late in an afternoon,\n     I came on him unseen down Lambeth way,\n     And on my life I was afear'd of him:\n     He gloomed and mumbled like a soul from Tophet,\n     His hands behind him and his head bent solemn.\n     \"What is it now,\" said I,--\"another woman?\"\n     That made him sorry for me, and he smiled.\n     \"No, Ben,\" he mused; \"it's Nothing.  It's all Nothing.\n     We come, we go; and when we're done, we're done;\n     Spiders and flies--we're mostly one or t'other--\n     We come, we go; and when we're done, we're done.\"\n     \"By God, you sing that song as if you knew it!\"\n     Said I, by way of cheering him; \"what ails ye?\"\n     \"I think I must have come down here to think,\"\n     Says he to that, and pulls his little beard;\n     \"Your fly will serve as well as anybody,\n     And what's his hour?  He flies, and flies, and flies,\n     And in his fly's mind has a brave appearance;\n     And then your spider gets him in her net,\n     And eats him out, and hangs him up to dry.\n     That's Nature, the kind mother of us all.\n     And then your slattern housemaid swings her broom,\n     And where's your spider?  And that's Nature, also.\n     It's Nature, and it's Nothing.  It's all Nothing.\n     It's all a world where bugs and emperors\n     Go singularly back to the same dust,\n     Each in his time; and the old, ordered stars\n     That sang together, Ben, will sing the same\n     Old stave to-morrow.\"\n\n                            When he talks like that,\n     There's nothing for a human man to do\n     But lead him to some grateful nook like this\n     Where we be now, and there to make him drink.\n     He'll drink, for love of me, and then be sick;\n     A sad sign always in a man of parts,\n     And always very ominous.  The great\n     Should be as large in liquor as in love,--\n     And our great friend is not so large in either:\n     One disaffects him, and the other fails him;\n     Whatso he drinks that has an antic in it,\n     He's wondering what's to pay in his insides;\n     And while his eyes are on the Cyprian\n     He's fribbling all the time with that damned House.\n     We laugh here at his thrift, but after all\n     It may be thrift that saves him from the devil;\n     God gave it, anyhow,--and we'll suppose\n     He knew the compound of his handiwork.\n     To-day the clouds are with him, but anon\n     He'll out of 'em enough to shake the tree\n     Of life itself and bring down fruit unheard-of,--\n     And, throwing in the bruised and whole together,\n     Prepare a wine to make us drunk with wonder;\n     And if he live, there'll be a sunset spell\n     Thrown over him as over a glassed lake\n     That yesterday was all a black wild water.\n\n     God send he live to give us, if no more,\n     What now's a-rampage in him, and exhibit,\n     With a decent half-allegiance to the ages\n     An earnest of at least a casual eye\n     Turned once on what he owes to Gutenberg,\n     And to the fealty of more centuries\n     Than are as yet a picture in our vision.\n     \"There's time enough,--I'll do it when I'm old,\n     And we're immortal men,\" he says to that;\n     And then he says to me, \"Ben, what's 'immortal'?\n     Think you by any force of ordination\n     It may be nothing of a sort more noisy\n     Than a small oblivion of component ashes\n     That of a dream-addicted world was once\n     A moving atomy much like your friend here?\"\n     Nothing will help that man.  To make him laugh,\n     I said then he was a mad mountebank,--\n     And by the Lord I nearer made him cry.\n     I could have eat an eft then, on my knees,\n     Tail, claws, and all of him; for I had stung\n     The king of men, who had no sting for me,\n     And I had hurt him in his memories;\n     And I say now, as I shall say again,\n     I love the man this side idolatry.\n\n     He'll do it when he's old, he says.  I wonder.\n     He may not be so ancient as all that.\n     For such as he, the thing that is to do\n     Will do itself,--but there's a reckoning;\n     The sessions that are now too much his own,\n     The roiling inward of a stilled outside,\n     The churning out of all those blood-fed lines,\n     The nights of many schemes and little sleep,\n     The full brain hammered hot with too much thinking,\n     The vexed heart over-worn with too much aching,--\n     This weary jangling of conjoined affairs\n     Made out of elements that have no end,\n     And all confused at once, I understand,\n     Is not what makes a man to live forever.\n     O no, not now!  He'll not be going now:\n     There'll be time yet for God knows what explosions\n     Before he goes.  He'll stay awhile.  Just wait:\n     Just wait a year or two for Cleopatra,\n     For she's to be a balsam and a comfort;\n     And that's not all a jape of mine now, either.\n     For granted once the old way of Apollo\n     Sings in a man, he may then, if he's able,\n     Strike unafraid whatever strings he will\n     Upon the last and wildest of new lyres;\n     Nor out of his new magic, though it hymn\n     The shrieks of dungeoned hell, shall he create\n     A madness or a gloom to shut quite out\n     A cleaving daylight, and a last great calm\n     Triumphant over shipwreck and all storms.\n     He might have given Aristotle creeps,\n     But surely would have given him his 'katharsis'.\n\n     He'll not be going yet.  There's too much yet\n     Unsung within the man.  But when he goes,\n     I'd stake ye coin o' the realm his only care\n     For a phantom world he sounded and found wanting\n     Will be a portion here, a portion there,\n     Of this or that thing or some other thing\n     That has a patent and intrinsical\n     Equivalence in those egregious shillings.\n     And yet he knows, God help him!  Tell me, now,\n     If ever there was anything let loose\n     On earth by gods or devils heretofore\n     Like this mad, careful, proud, indifferent Shakespeare!\n     Where was it, if it ever was?  By heaven,\n     'Twas never yet in Rhodes or Pergamon--\n     In Thebes or Nineveh, a thing like this!\n     No thing like this was ever out of England;\n     And that he knows.  I wonder if he cares.\n     Perhaps he does....  O Lord, that House in Stratford!\n\n\n\n\nEros Turannos\n\n\n\n     She fears him, and will always ask\n      What fated her to choose him;\n     She meets in his engaging mask\n      All reasons to refuse him;\n     But what she meets and what she fears\n     Are less than are the downward years,\n     Drawn slowly to the foamless weirs\n      Of age, were she to lose him.\n\n     Between a blurred sagacity\n      That once had power to sound him,\n     And Love, that will not let him be\n      The Judas that she found him,\n     Her pride assuages her almost,\n     As if it were alone the cost.--\n     He sees that he will not be lost,\n      And waits and looks around him.\n\n     A sense of ocean and old trees\n      Envelops and allures him;\n     Tradition, touching all he sees,\n      Beguiles and reassures him;\n     And all her doubts of what he says\n     Are dimmed of what she knows of days--\n     Till even prejudice delays\n      And fades, and she secures him.\n\n     The falling leaf inaugurates\n      The reign of her confusion;\n     The pounding wave reverberates\n      The dirge of her illusion;\n     And home, where passion lived and died,\n     Becomes a place where she can hide,\n     While all the town and harbor side\n      Vibrate with her seclusion.\n\n     We tell you, tapping on our brows,\n      The story as it should be,--\n     As if the story of a house\n      Were told, or ever could be;\n     We'll have no kindly veil between\n     Her visions and those we have seen,--\n     As if we guessed what hers have been,\n      Or what they are or would be.\n\n     Meanwhile we do no harm; for they\n      That with a god have striven,\n     Not hearing much of what we say,\n      Take what the god has given;\n     Though like waves breaking it may be,\n     Or like a changed familiar tree,\n     Or like a stairway to the sea\n      Where down the blind are driven.\n\n\n\n\nOld Trails\n\n         (Washington Square)\n\n\n\n     I met him, as one meets a ghost or two,\n     Between the gray Arch and the old Hotel.\n     \"King Solomon was right, there's nothing new,\"\n     Said he.  \"Behold a ruin who meant well.\"\n\n     He led me down familiar steps again,\n     Appealingly, and set me in a chair.\n     \"My dreams have all come true to other men,\"\n     Said he; \"God lives, however, and why care?\n\n     \"An hour among the ghosts will do no harm.\"\n     He laughed, and something glad within me sank.\n     I may have eyed him with a faint alarm,\n     For now his laugh was lost in what he drank.\n\n     \"They chill things here with ice from hell,\" he said;\n     \"I might have known it.\"  And he made a face\n     That showed again how much of him was dead,\n     And how much was alive and out of place,\n\n     And out of reach.  He knew as well as I\n     That all the words of wise men who are skilled\n     In using them are not much to defy\n     What comes when memory meets the unfulfilled.\n\n     What evil and infirm perversity\n     Had been at work with him to bring him back?\n     Never among the ghosts, assuredly,\n     Would he originate a new attack;\n\n     Never among the ghosts, or anywhere,\n     Till what was dead of him was put away,\n     Would he attain to his offended share\n     Of honor among others of his day.\n\n     \"You ponder like an owl,\" he said at last;\n     \"You always did, and here you have a cause.\n     For I'm a confirmation of the past,\n     A vengeance, and a flowering of what was.\n\n     \"Sorry?  Of course you are, though you compress,\n     With even your most impenetrable fears,\n     A placid and a proper consciousness\n     Of anxious angels over my arrears.\n\n     \"I see them there against me in a book\n     As large as hope, in ink that shines by night.\n     For sure I see; but now I'd rather look\n     At you, and you are not a pleasant sight.\n\n     \"Forbear, forgive.  Ten years are on my soul,\n     And on my conscience.  I've an incubus:\n     My one distinction, and a parlous toll\n     To glory; but hope lives on clamorous.\n\n     \"'Twas hope, though heaven I grant you knows of what--\n     The kind that blinks and rises when it falls,\n     Whether it sees a reason why or not--\n     That heard Broadway's hard-throated siren-calls;\n\n     \"'Twas hope that brought me through December storms,\n     To shores again where I'll not have to be\n     A lonely man with only foreign worms\n     To cheer him in his last obscurity.\n\n     \"But what it was that hurried me down here\n     To be among the ghosts, I leave to you.\n     My thanks are yours, no less, for one thing clear:\n     Though you are silent, what you say is true.\n\n     \"There may have been the devil in my feet,\n     For down I blundered, like a fugitive,\n     To find the old room in Eleventh Street.\n     God save us!--I came here again to live.\"\n\n     We rose at that, and all the ghosts rose then,\n     And followed us unseen to his old room.\n     No longer a good place for living men\n     We found it, and we shivered in the gloom.\n\n     The goods he took away from there were few,\n     And soon we found ourselves outside once more,\n     Where now the lamps along the Avenue\n     Bloomed white for miles above an iron floor.\n\n     \"Now lead me to the newest of hotels,\"\n     He said, \"and let your spleen be undeceived:\n     This ruin is not myself, but some one else;\n     I haven't failed; I've merely not achieved.\"\n\n     Whether he knew or not, he laughed and dined\n     With more of an immune regardlessness\n     Of pits before him and of sands behind\n     Than many a child at forty would confess;\n\n     And after, when the bells in 'Boris' rang\n     Their tumult at the Metropolitan,\n     He rocked himself, and I believe he sang.\n     \"God lives,\" he crooned aloud, \"and I'm the man!\"\n\n     He was.  And even though the creature spoiled\n     All prophecies, I cherish his acclaim.\n     Three weeks he fattened; and five years he toiled\n     In Yonkers,--and then sauntered into fame.\n\n     And he may go now to what streets he will--\n     Eleventh, or the last, and little care;\n     But he would find the old room very still\n     Of evenings, and the ghosts would all be there.\n\n     I doubt if he goes after them; I doubt\n     If many of them ever come to him.\n     His memories are like lamps, and they go out;\n     Or if they burn, they flicker and are dim.\n\n     A light of other gleams he has to-day\n     And adulations of applauding hosts;\n     A famous danger, but a safer way\n     Than growing old alone among the ghosts.\n\n     But we may still be glad that we were wrong:\n     He fooled us, and we'd shrivel to deny it;\n     Though sometimes when old echoes ring too long,\n     I wish the bells in 'Boris' would be quiet.\n\n\n\n\nThe Unforgiven\n\n\n\n     When he, who is the unforgiven,\n     Beheld her first, he found her fair:\n     No promise ever dreamt in heaven\n     Could then have lured him anywhere\n     That would have been away from there;\n     And all his wits had lightly striven,\n     Foiled with her voice, and eyes, and hair.\n\n     There's nothing in the saints and sages\n     To meet the shafts her glances had,\n     Or such as hers have had for ages\n     To blind a man till he be glad,\n     And humble him till he be mad.\n     The story would have many pages,\n     And would be neither good nor bad.\n\n     And, having followed, you would find him\n     Where properly the play begins;\n     But look for no red light behind him--\n     No fumes of many-colored sins,\n     Fanned high by screaming violins.\n     God knows what good it was to blind him,\n     Or whether man or woman wins.\n\n     And by the same eternal token,\n     Who knows just how it will all end?--\n     This drama of hard words unspoken,\n     This fireside farce, without a friend\n     Or enemy to comprehend\n     What augurs when two lives are broken,\n     And fear finds nothing left to mend.\n\n     He stares in vain for what awaits him,\n     And sees in Love a coin to toss;\n     He smiles, and her cold hush berates him\n     Beneath his hard half of the cross;\n     They wonder why it ever was;\n     And she, the unforgiving, hates him\n     More for her lack than for her loss.\n\n     He feeds with pride his indecision,\n     And shrinks from what will not occur,\n     Bequeathing with infirm derision\n     His ashes to the days that were,\n     Before she made him prisoner;\n     And labors to retrieve the vision\n     That he must once have had of her.\n\n     He waits, and there awaits an ending,\n     And he knows neither what nor when;\n     But no magicians are attending\n     To make him see as he saw then,\n     And he will never find again\n     The face that once had been the rending\n     Of all his purpose among men.\n\n     He blames her not, nor does he chide her,\n     And she has nothing new to say;\n     If he were Bluebeard he could hide her,\n     But that's not written in the play,\n     And there will be no change to-day;\n     Although, to the serene outsider,\n     There still would seem to be a way.\n\n\n\n\nTheophilus\n\n\n\n     By what serene malevolence of names\n     Had you the gift of yours, Theophilus?\n     Not even a smeared young Cyclops at his games\n     Would have you long,--and you are one of us.\n\n     Told of your deeds I shudder for your dreams,\n     And they, no doubt, are few and innocent.\n     Meanwhile, I marvel; for in you, it seems,\n     Heredity outshines environment.\n\n     What lingering bit of Belial, unforeseen,\n     Survives and amplifies itself in you?\n     What manner of devilry has ever been\n     That your obliquity may never do?\n\n     Humility befits a father's eyes,\n     But not a friend of us would have him weep.\n     Admiring everything that lives and dies,\n     Theophilus, we like you best asleep.\n\n     Sleep--sleep; and let us find another man\n     To lend another name less hazardous:\n     Caligula, maybe, or Caliban,\n     Or Cain,--but surely not Theophilus.\n\n\n\n\nVeteran Sirens\n\n\n\n     The ghost of Ninon would be sorry now\n     To laugh at them, were she to see them here,\n     So brave and so alert for learning how\n     To fence with reason for another year.\n\n     Age offers a far comelier diadem\n     Than theirs; but anguish has no eye for grace,\n     When time's malicious mercy cautions them\n     To think a while of number and of space.\n\n### Summary:"}
