Sheridan LeFanu\n\n1872\n\n\n\nPROLOGUE\n\n_Upon a paper attached to the Narrative which follows, Doctor Hesselius\nhas written a rather elaborate note, which he accompanies with a\nreference to his Essay on the strange subject which the MS. illuminates.\n\nThis mysterious subject he treats, in that Essay, with his usual\nlearning and acumen, and with remarkable directness and condensation. It\nwill form but one volume of the series of that extraordinary man's\ncollected papers.\n\nAs I publish the case, in this volume, simply to interest the \"laity,\" I\nshall forestall the intelligent lady, who relates it, in nothing; and\nafter due consideration, I have determined, therefore, to abstain from\npresenting any precis of the learned Doctor's reasoning, or extract from\nhis statement on a subject which he describes as \"involving, not\nimprobably, some of the profoundest arcana of our dual existence, and\nits intermediates.\"\n\nI was anxious on discovering this paper, to reopen the correspondence\ncommenced by Doctor Hesselius, so many years before, with a person so\nclever and careful as his informant seems to have been. Much to my\nregret, however, I found that she had died in the interval.\n\nShe, probably, could have added little to the Narrative _which she\ncommunicates in the following pages, with, so far as I can pronounce,\nsuch conscientious particularity_.\n\n\n\nI\n\n_An Early Fright_\n\nIn Styria, we, though by no means magnificent people, inhabit a castle,\nor schloss. A small income, in that part of the world, goes a great way.\nEight or nine hundred a year does wonders. Scantily enough ours would\nhave answered among wealthy people at home. My father is English, and I\nbear an English name, although I never saw England. But here, in this\nlonely and primitive place, where everything is so marvelously cheap, I\nreally don't see how ever so much more money would at all materially add\nto our comforts, or even luxuries.\n\nMy father was in the Austrian service, and retired upon a pension and\nhis patrimony, and purchased this feudal residence, and the small estate\non which it stands, a bargain.\n\nNothing can be more picturesque or solitary. It stands on a slight\neminence in a forest. The road, very old and narrow, passes in front of\nits drawbridge, never raised in my time, and its moat, stocked with\nperch, and sailed over by many swans, and floating on its surface white\nfleets of water lilies.\n\nOver all this the schloss shows its many-windowed front; its towers,\nand its Gothic chapel.\n\nThe forest opens in an irregular and very picturesque glade before its\ngate, and at the right a steep Gothic bridge carries the road over a\nstream that winds in deep shadow through the wood. I have said that this\nis a very lonely place. Judge whether I say truth. Looking from the hall\ndoor towards the road, the forest in which our castle stands extends\nfifteen miles to the right, and twelve to the left. The nearest\ninhabited village is about seven of your English miles to the left. The\nnearest inhabited schloss of any historic associations, is that of old\nGeneral Spielsdorf, nearly twenty miles away to the right.\n\nI have said \"the nearest _inhabited_ village,\" because there is, only\nthree miles westward, that is to say in the direction of General\nSpielsdorf's schloss, a ruined village, with its quaint little church,\nnow roofless, in the aisle of which are the moldering tombs of the proud\nfamily of Karnstein, now extinct, who once owned the equally desolate\nchateau which, in the thick of the forest, overlooks the silent ruins\nof the town.\n\nRespecting the cause of the desertion of this striking and melancholy\nspot, there is a legend which I shall relate to you another time.\n\nI must tell you now, how very small is the party who constitute the\ninhabitants of our castle. I don't include servants, or those dependents\nwho occupy rooms in the buildings attached to the schloss. Listen, and\nwonder! My father, who is the kindest man on earth, but growing old; and\nI, at the date of my story, only nineteen. Eight years have passed\nsince then.\n\nI and my father constituted the family at the schloss. My mother, a\nStyrian lady, died in my infancy, but I had a good-natured governess,\nwho had been with me from, I might almost say, my infancy. I could not\nremember the time when her fat, benignant face was not a familiar\npicture in my memory.\n\nThis was Madame Perrodon, a native of Berne, whose care and good nature\nnow in part supplied to me the loss of my mother, whom I do not even\nremember, so early I lost her. She made a third at our little dinner\nparty. There was a fourth, Mademoiselle De Lafontaine, a lady such as\nyou term, I believe, a \"finishing governess.\" She spoke French and\nGerman, Madame Perrodon French and broken English, to which my father\nand I added English, which, partly to prevent its becoming a lost\nlanguage among us, and partly from patriotic motives, we spoke every\nday. The consequence was a Babel, at which strangers used to laugh, and\nwhich I shall make no attempt to reproduce in this narrative. And there\nwere two or three young lady friends besides, pretty nearly of my own\nage, who were occasional visitors, for longer or shorter terms; and\nthese visits I sometimes returned.\n\nThese were our regular social resources; but of course there were chance\nvisits from \"neighbors\" of only five or six leagues distance. My life\nwas, notwithstanding, rather a solitary one, I can assure you.\n\nMy gouvernantes had just so much control over me as you might conjecture\nsuch sage persons would have in the case of a rather spoiled girl, whose\nonly parent allowed her pretty nearly her own way in everything.\n\nThe first occurrence in my existence, which produced a terrible\nimpression upon my mind, which, in fact, never has been effaced, was one\nof the very earliest incidents of my life which I can recollect. Some\npeople will think it so trifling that it should not be recorded here.\nYou will see, however, by-and-by, why I mention it. The nursery, as it\nwas called, though I had it all to myself, was a large room in the upper\nstory of the castle, with a steep oak roof. I can't have been more than\nsix years old, when one night I awoke, and looking round the room from\nmy bed, failed to see the nursery maid. Neither was my nurse there; and\nI thought myself alone. I was not frightened, for I was one of those\nhappy children who are studiously kept in ignorance of ghost stories, of\nfairy tales, and of all such lore as makes us cover up our heads when\nthe door cracks suddenly, or the flicker of an expiring candle makes the\nshadow of a bedpost dance upon the wall, nearer to our faces. I was\nvexed and insulted at finding myself, as I conceived, neglected, and I\nbegan to whimper, preparatory to a hearty bout of roaring; when to my\nsurprise, I saw a solemn, but very pretty face looking at me from the\nside of the bed. It was that of a young lady who was kneeling, with her\nhands under the coverlet. I looked at her with a kind of pleased wonder,\nand ceased whimpering. She caressed me with her hands, and lay down\nbeside me on the bed, and drew me towards her, smiling; I felt\nimmediately delightfully soothed, and fell asleep again. I was wakened\nby a sensation as if two needles ran into my breast very deep at the\nsame moment, and I cried loudly. The lady started back, with her eyes\nfixed on me, and then slipped down upon the floor, and, as I thought,\nhid herself under the bed.\n\nI was now for the first time frightened, and I yelled with all my might\nand main. Nurse, nursery maid, housekeeper, all came running in, and\nhearing my story, they made light of it, soothing me all they could\nmeanwhile. But, child as I was, I could perceive that their faces were\npale with an unwonted look of anxiety, and I saw them look under the\nbed, and about the room, and peep under tables and pluck open cupboards;\nand the housekeeper whispered to the nurse: \"Lay your hand along that\nhollow in the bed; someone _did_ lie there, so sure as you did not; the\nplace is still warm.\"\n\nI remember the nursery maid petting me, and all three examining my\nchest, where I told them I felt the puncture, and pronouncing that there\nwas no sign visible that any such thing had happened to me.\n\nThe housekeeper and the two other servants who were in charge of the\nnursery, remained sitting up all night; and from that time a servant\nalways sat up in the nursery until I was about fourteen.\n\nI was very nervous for a long time after this. A doctor was called in,\nhe was pallid and elderly. How well I remember his long saturnine face,\nslightly pitted with smallpox, and his chestnut wig. For a good while,\nevery second day, he came and gave me medicine, which of course I hated.\n\nThe morning after I saw this apparition I was in a state of terror, and\ncould not bear to be left alone, daylight though it was, for a moment.\n\nI remember my father coming up and standing at the bedside, and talking\ncheerfully, and asking the nurse a number of questions, and laughing\nvery heartily at one of the answers; and patting me on the shoulder, and\nkissing me, and telling me not to be frightened, that it was nothing but\na dream and could not hurt me.\n\nBut I was not comforted, for I knew the visit of the strange woman was\n_not_ a dream; and I was _awfully_ frightened.\n\nI was a little consoled by the nursery maid's assuring me that it was\nshe who had come and looked at me, and lain down beside me in the bed,\nand that I must have been half-dreaming not to have known her face. But\nthis, though supported by the nurse, did not quite satisfy me.\n\nI remembered, in the course of that day, a venerable old man, in a black\ncassock, coming into the room with the nurse and housekeeper, and\ntalking a little to them, and very kindly to me; his face was very sweet\nand gentle, and he told me they were going to pray, and joined my hands\ntogether, and desired me to say, softly, while they were praying, \"Lord\nhear all good prayers for us, for Jesus' sake.\" I think these were the\nvery words, for I often repeated them to myself, and my nurse used for\nyears to make me say them in my prayers.\n\nI remembered so well the thoughtful sweet face of that white-haired old\nman, in his black cassock, as he stood in that rude, lofty, brown room,\nwith the clumsy furniture of a fashion three hundred years old about\nhim, and the scanty light entering its shadowy atmosphere through the\nsmall lattice. He kneeled, and the three women with him, and he prayed\naloud with an earnest quavering voice for, what appeared to me, a long\ntime. I forget all my life preceding that event, and for some time after\nit is all obscure also, but the scenes I have just described stand out\nvivid as the isolated pictures of the phantasmagoria surrounded\nby darkness.\n\n\n\nII\n\n_A Guest_\n\nI am now going to tell you something so strange that it will require all\nyour faith in my veracity to believe my story. It is not only true,\nnevertheless, but truth of which I have been an eyewitness.\n\nIt was a sweet summer evening, and my father asked me, as he sometimes\ndid, to take a little ramble with him along that beautiful forest vista\nwhich I have mentioned as lying in front of the schloss.\n\n\"General Spielsdorf cannot come to us so soon as I had hoped,\" said my\nfather, as we pursued our walk.\n\nHe was to have paid us a visit of some weeks, and we had expected his\narrival next day. He was to have brought with him a young lady, his\nniece and ward, Mademoiselle Rheinfeldt, whom I had never seen, but whom\nI had heard described as a very charming girl, and in whose society I\nhad promised myself many happy days. I was more disappointed than a\nyoung lady living in a town, or a bustling neighborhood can possibly\nimagine. This visit, and the new acquaintance it promised, had furnished\nmy day dream for many weeks.\n\n\"And how soon does he come?\" I asked.\n\n\"Not till autumn. Not for two months, I dare say,\" he answered. \"And I\nam very glad now, dear, that you never knew Mademoiselle Rheinfeldt.\"\n\n\"And why?\" I asked, both mortified and curious.\n\n\"Because the poor young lady is dead,\" he replied. \"I quite forgot I had\nnot told you, but you were not in the room when I received the General's\nletter this evening.\"\n\nI was very much shocked. General Spielsdorf had mentioned in his first\nletter, six or seven weeks before, that she was not so well as he would\nwish her, but there was nothing to suggest the remotest suspicion\nof danger.\n\n\"Here is the General's letter,\" he said, handing it to me. \"I am afraid\nhe is in great affliction; the letter appears to me to have been written\nvery nearly in distraction.\"\n\nWe sat down on a rude bench, under a group of magnificent lime trees.\nThe sun was setting with all its melancholy splendor behind the sylvan\nhorizon, and the stream that flows beside our home, and passes under the\nsteep old bridge I have mentioned, wound through many a group of noble\ntrees, almost at our feet, reflecting in its current the fading crimson\nof the sky. General Spielsdorf's letter was so extraordinary, so\nvehement, and in some places so self-contradictory, that I read it twice\nover--the second time aloud to my father--and was still unable to\naccount for it, except by supposing that grief had unsettled his mind.\n\nIt said \"I have lost my darling daughter, for as such I loved her.\nDuring the last days of dear Bertha's illness I was not able to write\nto you.\n\n\"Before then I had no idea of her danger. I have lost her, and now learn\n_all_, too late. She died in the peace of innocence, and in the glorious\nhope of a blessed futurity. The fiend who betrayed our infatuated\nhospitality has done it all. I thought I was receiving into my house\ninnocence, gaiety, a charming companion for my lost Bertha. Heavens!\nwhat a fool have I been!\n\n\"I thank God my child died without a suspicion of the cause of her\nsufferings. She is gone without so much as conjecturing the nature of\nher illness, and the accursed passion of the agent of all this misery. I\ndevote my remaining days to tracking and extinguishing a monster. I am\ntold I may hope to accomplish my righteous and merciful purpose. At\npresent there is scarcely a gleam of light to guide me. I curse my\nconceited incredulity, my despicable affectation of superiority, my\nblindness, my obstinacy--all--too late. I cannot write or talk\ncollectedly now. I am distracted. So soon as I shall have a little\nrecovered, I mean to devote myself for a time to enquiry, which may\npossibly lead me as far as Vienna. Some time in the autumn, two months\nhence, or earlier if I live, I will see you--that is, if you permit me;\nI will then tell you all that I scarce dare put upon paper now.\nFarewell. Pray for me, dear friend.\"\n\nIn these terms ended this strange letter. Though I had never seen Bertha\nRheinfeldt my eyes filled with tears at the sudden intelligence; I was\nstartled, as well as profoundly disappointed.\n\nThe sun had now set, and it was twilight by the time I had returned the\nGeneral's letter to my father.\n\nIt was a soft clear evening, and we loitered, speculating upon the\npossible meanings of the violent and incoherent sentences which I had\njust been reading. We had nearly a mile to walk before reaching the road\nthat passes the schloss in front, and by that time the moon was shining\nbrilliantly. At the drawbridge we met Madame Perrodon and Mademoiselle\nDe Lafontaine, who had come out, without their bonnets, to enjoy the\nexquisite moonlight.\n\nWe heard their voices gabbling in animated dialogue as we approached. We\njoined them at the drawbridge, and turned about to admire with them the\nbeautiful scene.\n\nThe glade through which we had just walked lay before us. At our left\nthe narrow road wound away under clumps of lordly trees, and was lost to\nsight amid the thickening forest. At the right the same road crosses the\nsteep and picturesque bridge, near which stands a ruined tower which\nonce guarded that pass; and beyond the bridge an abrupt eminence rises,\ncovered with trees, and showing in the shadows some grey\nivy-clustered rocks.\n\nOver the sward and low grounds a thin film of mist was stealing like\nsmoke, marking the distances with a transparent veil; and here and there\nwe could see the river faintly flashing in the moonlight.\n\nNo softer, sweeter scene could be imagined. The news I had just heard\nmade it melancholy; but nothing could disturb its character of profound\nserenity, and the enchanted glory and vagueness of the prospect.\n\nMy father, who enjoyed the picturesque, and I, stood looking in silence\nover the expanse beneath us. The two good governesses, standing a little\nway behind us, discoursed upon the scene, and were eloquent upon\nthe moon.\n\nMadame Perrodon was fat, middle-aged, and romantic, and talked and\nsighed poetically. Mademoiselle De Lafontaine--in right of her father\nwho was a German, assumed to be psychological, metaphysical, and\nsomething of a mystic--now declared that when the moon shone with a\nlight so intense it was well known that it indicated a special spiritual\nactivity. The effect of the full moon in such a state of brilliancy was\nmanifold. It acted on dreams, it acted on lunacy, it acted on nervous\npeople, it had marvelous physical influences connected with life.\nMademoiselle related that her cousin, who was mate of a merchant ship,\nhaving taken a nap on deck on such a night, lying on his back, with his\nface full in the light on the moon, had wakened, after a dream of an old\nwoman clawing him by the cheek, with his features horribly drawn to one\nside; and his countenance had never quite recovered its equilibrium.\n\n\"The moon, this night,\" she said, \"is full of idyllic and magnetic\ninfluence--and see, when you look behind you at the front of the schloss\nhow all its windows flash and twinkle with that silvery splendor, as if\nunseen hands had lighted up the rooms to receive fairy guests.\"\n\nThere are indolent styles of the spirits in which, indisposed to talk\nourselves, the talk of others is pleasant to our listless ears; and I\ngazed on, pleased with the tinkle of the ladies' conversation.\n\n\"I have got into one of my moping moods tonight,\" said my father, after\na silence, and quoting Shakespeare, whom, by way of keeping up our\nEnglish, he used to read aloud, he said:\n\n  \"'In truth I know not why I am so sad.\n  It wearies me: you say it wearies you;\n  But how I got it--came by it.'\n\n\"I forget the rest. But I feel as if some great misfortune were hanging\nover us. I suppose the poor General's afflicted letter has had something\nto do with it.\"\n\nAt this moment the unwonted sound of carriage wheels and many hoofs upon\nthe road, arrested our attention.\n\nThey seemed to be approaching from the high ground overlooking the\nbridge, and very soon the equipage emerged from that point. Two horsemen\nfirst crossed the bridge, then came a carriage drawn by four horses, and\ntwo men rode behind.\n\nIt seemed to be the traveling carriage of a person of rank; and we were\nall immediately absorbed in watching that very unusual spectacle. It\nbecame, in a few moments, greatly more interesting, for just as the\ncarriage had passed the summit of the steep bridge, one of the leaders,\ntaking fright, communicated his panic to the rest, and after a plunge or\ntwo, the whole team broke into a wild gallop together, and dashing\nbetween the horsemen who rode in front, came thundering along the road\ntowards us with the speed of a hurricane.\n\nThe excitement of the scene was made more painful by the clear,\nlong-drawn screams of a female voice from the carriage window.\n\nWe all advanced in curiosity and horror; me rather in silence, the rest\nwith various ejaculations of terror.\n\nOur suspense did not last long. Just before you reach the castle\ndrawbridge, on the route they were coming, there stands by the roadside\na magnificent lime tree, on the other stands an ancient stone cross, at\nsight of which the horses, now going at a pace that was perfectly\nfrightful, swerved so as to bring the wheel over the projecting roots\nof the tree.\n\nI knew what was coming. I covered my eyes, unable to see it out, and\nturned my head away; at the same moment I heard a cry from my lady\nfriends, who had gone on a little.\n\nCuriosity opened my eyes, and I saw a scene of utter confusion. Two of\nthe horses were on the ground, the carriage lay upon its side with two\nwheels in the air; the men were busy removing the traces, and a lady\nwith a commanding air and figure had got out, and stood with clasped\nhands, raising the handkerchief that was in them every now and then\nto her eyes.\n\nThrough the carriage door was now lifted a young lady, who appeared to\nbe lifeless. My dear old father was already beside the elder lady, with\nhis hat in his hand, evidently tendering his aid and the resources of\nhis schloss. The lady did not appear to hear him, or to have eyes for\nanything but the slender girl who was being placed against the <DW72>\nof the bank.\n\nI approached; the young lady was apparently stunned, but she was\ncertainly not dead. My father, who piqued himself on being something of\na physician, had just had his fingers on her wrist and assured the lady,\nwho declared herself her mother, that her pulse, though faint and\nirregular, was undoubtedly still distinguishable. The lady clasped her\nhands and looked upward, as if in a momentary transport of gratitude;\nbut immediately she broke out again in that theatrical way which is, I\nbelieve, natural to some people.\n\nShe was what is called a fine looking woman for her time of life, and\nmust have been handsome; she was tall, but not thin, and dressed in\nblack velvet, and looked rather pale, but with a proud and commanding\ncountenance, though now agitated strangely.\n\n\"Who was ever being so born to calamity?\" I heard her say, with clasped\nhands, as I came up. \"Here am I, on a journey of life and death, in\nprosecuting which to lose an hour is possibly to lose all. My child will\nnot have recovered sufficiently to resume her route for who can say how\nlong. I must leave her: I cannot, dare not, delay. How far on, sir, can\nyou tell, is the nearest village? I must leave her there; and shall not\nsee my darling, or even hear of her till my return, three months hence.\"\n\nI plucked my father by the coat, and whispered earnestly in his ear:\n\"Oh! papa, pray ask her to let her stay with us--it would be so\ndelightful. Do, pray.\"\n\n\"If Madame will entrust her child to the care of my daughter, and of her\ngood gouvernante, Madame Perrodon, and permit her to remain as our\nguest, under my charge, until her return, it will confer a distinction\nand an obligation upon us, and we shall treat her with all the care and\ndevotion which so sacred a trust deserves.\"\n\n\"I cannot do that, sir, it would be to task your kindness and chivalry\ntoo cruelly,\" said the lady, distractedly.\n\n\"It would, on the contrary, be to confer on us a very great kindness at\nthe moment when we most need it. My daughter has just been disappointed\nby a cruel misfortune, in a visit from which she had long anticipated a\ngreat deal of happiness. If you confide this young lady to our care it\nwill be her best consolation. The nearest village on your route is\ndistant, and affords no such inn as you could think of placing your\ndaughter at; you cannot allow her to continue her journey for any\nconsiderable distance without danger. If, as you say, you cannot suspend\nyour journey, you must part with her tonight, and nowhere could you do\nso with more honest assurances of care and tenderness than here.\"\n\nThere was something in this lady's air and appearance so distinguished\nand even imposing, and in her manner so engaging, as to impress one,\nquite apart from the dignity of her equipage, with a conviction that she\nwas a person of consequence.\n\nBy this time the carriage was replaced in its upright position, and the\nhorses, quite tractable, in the traces again.\n\nThe lady threw on her daughter a glance which I fancied was not quite so\naffectionate as one might have anticipated from the beginning of the\nscene; then she beckoned slightly to my father, and withdrew two or\nthree steps with him out of hearing; and talked to him with a fixed and\nstern countenance, not at all like that with which she had\nhitherto spoken.\n\nI was filled with wonder that my father did not seem to perceive the\nchange, and also unspeakably curious to learn what it could be that she\nwas speaking, almost in his ear, with so much earnestness and rapidity.\n\nTwo or three minutes at most I think she remained thus employed, then\nshe turned, and a few steps brought her to where her daughter lay,\nsupported by Madame Perrodon. She kneeled beside her for a moment and\nwhispered, as Madame supposed, a little benediction in her ear; then\nhastily kissing her she stepped into her carriage, the door was closed,\nthe footmen in stately liveries jumped up behind, the outriders spurred\non, the postilions cracked their whips, the horses plunged and broke\nsuddenly into a furious canter that threatened soon again to become a\ngallop, and the carriage whirled away, followed at the same rapid pace\nby the two horsemen in the rear.\n\n\n\nIII\n\n_We Compare Notes_\n\nWe followed the _cortege_ with our eyes until it was swiftly lost to\nsight in the misty wood; and the very sound of the hoofs and the wheels\ndied away in the silent night air.\n\nNothing remained to assure us that the adventure had not been an\nillusion of a moment but the young lady, who just at that moment opened\nher eyes. I could not see, for her face was turned from me, but she\nraised her head, evidently looking about her, and I heard a very sweet\nvoice ask complainingly, \"Where is mamma?\"\n\nOur good Madame Perrodon answered tenderly, and added some comfortable\nassurances.\n\nI then heard her ask:\n\n\"Where am I? What is this place?\" and after that she said, \"I don't see\nthe carriage; and Matska, where is she?\"\n\nMadame answered all her questions in so far as she understood them; and\ngradually the young lady remembered how the misadventure came about, and\nwas glad to hear that no one in, or in attendance on, the carriage was\nhurt; and on learning that her mamma had left her here, till her return\nin about three months, she wept.\n\nI was going to add my consolations to those of Madame Perrodon when\nMademoiselle De Lafontaine placed her hand upon my arm, saying:\n\n\"Don't approach, one at a time is as much as she can at present converse\nwith; a very little excitement would possibly overpower her now.\"\n\nAs soon as she is comfortably in bed, I thought, I will run up to her\nroom and see her.\n\nMy father in the meantime had sent a servant on horseback for the\nphysician, who lived about two leagues away; and a bedroom was being\nprepared for the young lady's reception.\n\nThe stranger now rose, and leaning on Madame's arm, walked slowly over\nthe drawbridge and into the castle gate.\n\nIn the hall, servants waited to receive her, and she was conducted\nforthwith to her room. The room we usually sat in as our drawing room is\nlong, having four windows, that looked over the moat and drawbridge,\nupon the forest scene I have just described.\n\nIt is furnished in old carved oak, with large carved cabinets, and the\nchairs are cushioned with crimson Utrecht velvet. The walls are covered\nwith tapestry, and surrounded with great gold frames, the figures being\nas large as life, in ancient and very curious costume, and the subjects\nrepresented are hunting, hawking, and generally festive. It is not too\nstately to be extremely comfortable; and here we had our tea, for with\nhis usual patriotic leanings he insisted that the national beverage\nshould make its appearance regularly with our coffee and chocolate.\n\nWe sat here this night, and with candles lighted, were talking over the\nadventure of the evening.\n\nMadame Perrodon and Mademoiselle De Lafontaine were both of our party.\nThe young stranger had hardly lain down in her bed when she sank into a\ndeep sleep; and those ladies had left her in the care of a servant.\n\n\"How do you like our guest?\" I asked, as soon as Madame entered. \"Tell\nme all about her?\"\n\n\"I like her extremely,\" answered Madame, \"she is, I almost think, the\nprettiest creature I ever saw; about your age, and so gentle and nice.\"\n\n\"She is absolutely beautiful,\" threw in Mademoiselle, who had peeped for\na moment into the stranger's room.\n\n\"And such a sweet voice!\" added Madame Perrodon.\n\n\"Did you remark a woman in the carriage, after it was set up again, who\ndid not get out,\" inquired Mademoiselle, \"but only looked from\nthe window?\"\n\n\"No, we had not seen her.\"\n\nThen she described a hideous black woman, with a sort of  turban\non her head, and who was gazing all the time from the carriage window,\nnodding and grinning derisively towards the ladies, with gleaming eyes\nand large white eyeballs, and her teeth set as if in fury.\n\n\"Did you remark what an ill-looking pack of men the servants were?\"\nasked Madame.\n\n\"Yes,\" said my father, who had just come in, \"ugly, hang-dog looking\nfellows as ever I beheld in my life. I hope they mayn't rob the poor\nlady in the forest. They are clever rogues, however; they got everything\nto rights in a minute.\"\n\n\"I dare say they are worn out with too long traveling,\" said Madame.\n\n\"Besides looking wicked, their faces were so strangely lean, and dark,\nand sullen. I am very curious, I own; but I dare say the young lady will\ntell you all about it tomorrow, if she is sufficiently recovered.\"\n\n\"I don't think she will,\" said my father, with a mysterious smile, and a\nlittle nod of his head, as if he knew more about it than he cared\nto tell us.\n\nThis made us all the more inquisitive as to what had passed between him\nand the lady in the black velvet, in the brief but earnest interview\nthat had immediately preceded her departure.\n\nWe were scarcely alone, when I entreated him to tell me. He did not need\nmuch pressing.\n\n\"There is no particular reason why I should not tell you. She expressed\na reluctance to trouble us with the care of her daughter, saying she was\nin delicate health, and nervous, but not subject to any kind of\nseizure--she volunteered that--nor to any illusion; being, in fact,\nperfectly sane.\"\n\n\"How very odd to say all that!\" I interpolated. \"It was so unnecessary.\"\n\n\"At all events it _was_ said,\" he laughed, \"and as you wish to know all\nthat passed, which was indeed very little, I tell you. She then said, 'I\nam making a long journey of _vital_ importance--she emphasized the\nword--rapid and secret; I shall return for my child in three months; in\nthe meantime, she will be silent as to who we are, whence we come, and\nwhither we are traveling.' That is all she said. She spoke very pure\nFrench. When she said the word'secret,' she paused for a few seconds,\nlooking sternly, her eyes fixed on mine. I fancy she makes a great point\nof that. You saw how quickly she was gone. I hope I have not done a very\nfoolish thing, in taking charge of the young lady.\"\n\nFor my part, I was delighted. I was longing to see and talk to her; and\nonly waiting till the doctor should give me leave. You, who live in\ntowns, can have no idea how great an event the introduction of a new\nfriend is, in such a solitude as surrounded us.\n\nThe doctor did not arrive till nearly one o'clock; but I could no more\nhave gone to my bed and slept, than I could have overtaken, on foot, the\ncarriage in which the princess in black velvet had driven away.\n\nWhen the physician came down to the drawing room, it was to report very\nfavorably upon his patient. She was now sitting up, her pulse quite\nregular, apparently perfectly well. She had sustained no injury, and the\nlittle shock to her nerves had passed away quite harmlessly. There could\nbe no harm certainly in my seeing her, if we both wished it; and, with\nthis permission I sent, forthwith, to know whether she would allow me to\nvisit her for a few minutes in her room.\n\nThe servant returned immediately to say that she desired nothing more.\n\nYou may be sure I was not long in availing myself of this permission.\n\nOur visitor lay in one of the handsomest rooms in the schloss. It was,\nperhaps, a little stately. There was a somber piece of tapestry opposite\nthe foot of the bed, representing Cleopatra with the asps to her bosom;\nand other solemn classic scenes were displayed, a little faded, upon the\nother walls. But there was gold carving, and rich and varied color\nenough in the other decorations of the room, to more than redeem the\ngloom of the old tapestry.\n\nThere were candles at the bedside. She was sitting up; her slender\npretty figure enveloped in the soft silk dressing gown, embroidered with\nflowers, and lined with thick quilted silk, which her mother had thrown\nover her feet as she lay upon the ground.\n\nWhat was it that, as I reached the bedside and had just begun my little\ngreeting, struck me dumb in a moment, and made me recoil a step or two\nfrom before her? I will tell you.\n\nI saw the very face which had visited me in my childhood at night, which\nremained so fixed in my memory, and on which I had for so many years so\noften ruminated with horror, when no one suspected of what I\nwas thinking.\n\nIt was pretty, even beautiful; and when I first beheld it, wore the\nsame melancholy expression.\n\nBut this almost instantly lighted into a strange fixed smile of\nrecognition.\n\nThere was a silence of fully a minute, and then at length she spoke; I\ncould not.\n\n\"How wonderful!\" she exclaimed. \"Twelve years ago, I saw your face in a\ndream, and it has haunted me ever since.\"\n\n\"Wonderful indeed!\" I repeated, overcoming with an effort the horror\nthat had for a time suspended my utterances. \"Twelve years ago, in\nvision or reality, I certainly saw you. I could not forget your face. It\nhas remained before my eyes ever since.\"\n\nHer smile had softened. Whatever I had fancied strange in it, was gone,\nand it and her dimpling cheeks were now delightfully pretty and\nintelligent.\n\nI felt reassured, and continued more in the vein which hospitality\nindicated, to bid her welcome, and to tell her how much pleasure her\naccidental arrival had given us all, and especially what a happiness it\nwas to me.\n\nI took her hand as I spoke. I was a little shy, as lonely people are,\nbut the situation made me eloquent, and even bold. She pressed my hand,\nshe laid hers upon it, and her eyes glowed, as, looking hastily into\nmine, she smiled again, and blushed.\n\nShe answered my welcome very prettily. I sat down beside her, still\nwondering; and she said:\n\n\"I must tell you my vision about you; it is so very strange that you and\nI should have had, each of the other so vivid a dream, that each should\nhave seen, I you and you me, looking as we do now, when of course we\nboth were mere children. I was a child, about six years old, and I awoke\nfrom a confused and troubled dream, and found myself in a room, unlike\nmy nursery, wainscoted clumsily in some dark wood, and with cupboards\nand bedsteads, and chairs, and benches placed about it. The beds were,\nI thought, all empty, and the room itself without anyone but myself in\nit; and I, after looking about me for some time, and admiring especially\nan iron candlestick with two branches, which I should certainly know\nagain, crept under one of the beds to reach the window; but as I got\nfrom under the bed, I heard someone crying; and looking up, while I was\nstill upon my knees, I saw you--most assuredly you--as I see you now; a\nbeautiful young lady, with golden hair and large blue eyes, and\nlips--your lips--you as you are here.\n\n\"Your looks won me; I climbed on the bed and put my arms about you, and\nI think we both fell asleep. I was aroused by a scream; you were sitting\nup screaming. I was frightened, and slipped down upon the ground, and,\nit seemed to me, lost consciousness for a moment; and when I came to\nmyself, I was again in my nursery at home. Your face I have never\nforgotten since. I could not be misled by mere resemblance. _You are_\nthe lady whom I saw then.\"\n\nIt was now my turn to relate my corresponding vision, which I did, to\nthe undisguised wonder of my new acquaintance.\n\n\"I don't know which should be most afraid of the other,\" she said, again\nsmiling--\"If you were less pretty I think I should be very much afraid\nof you, but being as you are, and you and I both so young, I feel only\nthat I have made your acquaintance twelve years ago, and have already a\nright to your intimacy; at all events it does seem as if we were\ndestined, from our earliest childhood, to be friends. I wonder whether\nyou feel as strangely drawn towards me as I do to you; I have never had\na friend--shall I find one now?\" She sighed, and her fine dark eyes\ngazed passionately on me.\n\nNow the truth is, I felt rather unaccountably towards the beautiful\nstranger. I did feel, as she said, \"drawn towards her,\" but there was\nalso something of repulsion. In this ambiguous feeling, however, the\nsense of attraction immensely prevailed. She interested and won me; she\nwas so beautiful and so indescribably engaging.\n\nI perceived now something of languor and exhaustion stealing over her,\nand hastened to bid her good night.\n\n\"The doctor thinks,\" I added, \"that you ought to have a maid to sit up\nwith you tonight; one of ours is waiting, and you will find her a very\nuseful and quiet creature.\"\n\n\"How kind of you, but I could not sleep, I never could with an attendant\nin the room. I shan't require any assistance--and, shall I confess my\nweakness, I am haunted with a terror of robbers. Our house was robbed\nonce, and two servants murdered, so I always lock my door. It has become\na habit--and you look so kind I know you will forgive me. I see there is\na key in the lock.\"\n\nShe held me close in her pretty arms for a moment and whispered in my\near, \"Good night, darling, it is very hard to part with you, but good\nnight; tomorrow, but not early, I shall see you again.\"\n\nShe sank back on the pillow with a sigh, and her fine eyes followed me\nwith a fond and melancholy gaze, and she murmured again \"Good night,\ndear friend.\"\n\nYoung people like, and even love, on impulse. I was flattered by the\nevident, though as yet undeserved, fondness she showed me. I liked the\nconfidence with which she at once received me. She was determined that\nwe should be very near friends.\n\nNext day came and we met again. I was delighted with my companion; that\nis to say, in many respects.\n\nHer looks lost nothing in daylight--she was certainly the most beautiful\ncreature I had ever seen, and the unpleasant remembrance of the face\npresented in my early dream, had lost the effect of the first unexpected\nrecognition.\n\nShe confessed that she had experienced a similar shock on seeing me, and\nprecisely the same faint antipathy that had mingled with my admiration\nof her. We now laughed together over our momentary horrors.\n\n\n\nIV\n\n_Her Habits--A Saunter_\n\nI told you that I was charmed with her in most particulars.\n\nThere were some that did not please me so well.\n\nShe was above the middle height of women. I shall begin by describing\nher.\n\nShe was slender, and wonderfully graceful. Except that her movements\nwere languid--very languid--indeed, there was nothing in her appearance\nto indicate an invalid. Her complexion was rich and brilliant; her\nfeatures were small and beautifully formed; her eyes large, dark, and\nlustrous; her hair was quite wonderful, I never saw hair so\nmagnificently thick and long when it was down about her shoulders; I\nhave often placed my hands under it, and laughed with wonder at its\nweight. It was exquisitely fine and soft, and in color a rich very dark\nbrown, with something of gold. I loved to let it down, tumbling with its\nown weight, as, in her room, she lay back in her chair talking in her\nsweet low voice, I used to fold and braid it, and spread it out and\nplay with it. Heavens! If I had but known all!\n\nI said there were particulars which did not please me. I have told you\nthat her confidence won me the first night I saw her; but I found that\nshe exercised with respect to herself, her mother, her history,\neverything in fact connected with her life, plans, and people, an ever\nwakeful reserve. I dare say I was unreasonable, perhaps I was wrong; I\ndare say I ought to have respected the solemn injunction laid upon my\nfather by the stately lady in black velvet. But curiosity is a restless\nand unscrupulous passion, and no one girl can endure, with patience,\nthat hers should be baffled by another. What harm could it do anyone to\ntell me what I so ardently desired to know? Had she no trust in my good\nsense or honor? Why would she not believe me when I assured her, so\nsolemnly, that I would not divulge one syllable of what she told me to\nany mortal breathing.\n\nThere was a coldness, it seemed to me, beyond her years, in her smiling\nmelancholy persistent refusal to afford me the least ray of light.\n\nI cannot say we quarreled upon this point, for she would not quarrel\nupon any. It was, of course, very unfair of me to press her, very\nill-bred, but I really could not help it; and I might just as well have\nlet it alone.\n\nWhat she did tell me amounted, in my unconscionable estimation--to\nnothing.\n\nIt was all summed up in three very vague disclosures:\n\nFirst--Her name was Carmilla.\n\nSecond--Her family was very ancient and noble.\n\nThird--Her home lay in the direction of the west.\n\nShe would not tell me the name of her family, nor their armorial\nbearings, nor the name of their estate, nor even that of the country\nthey lived in.\n\nYou are not to suppose that I worried her incessantly on these subjects.\nI watched opportunity, and rather insinuated than urged my inquiries.\nOnce or twice, indeed, I did attack her more directly. But no matter\nwhat my tactics, utter failure was invariably the result. Reproaches and\ncaresses were all lost upon her. But I must add this, that her evasion\nwas conducted with so pretty a melancholy and deprecation, with so many,\nand even passionate declarations of her liking for me, and trust in my\nhonor, and with so many promises that I should at last know all, that I\ncould not find it in my heart long to be offended with her.\n\nShe used to place her pretty arms about my neck, draw me to her, and\nlaying her cheek to mine, murmur with her lips near my ear, \"Dearest,\nyour little heart is wounded; think me not cruel because I obey the\nirresistible law of my strength and weakness; if your dear heart is\nwounded, my wild heart bleeds with yours. In the rapture of my enormous\nhumiliation I live in your warm life, and you shall die--die, sweetly\ndie--into mine. I cannot help it; as I draw near to you, you, in your\nturn, will draw near to others, and learn the rapture of that cruelty,\nwhich yet is love; so, for a while, seek to know no more of me and mine,\nbut trust me with all your loving spirit.\"\n\nAnd when she had spoken such a rhapsody, she would press me more closely\nin her trembling embrace, and her lips in soft kisses gently glow\nupon my cheek.\n\nHer agitations and her language were unintelligible to me.\n\nFrom these foolish embraces, which were not of very frequent occurrence,\nI must allow, I used to wish to extricate myself; but my energies seemed\nto fail me. Her murmured words sounded like a lullaby in my ear, and\nsoothed my resistance into a trance, from which I only seemed to recover\nmyself when she withdrew her arms.\n\nIn these mysterious moods I did not like her. I experienced a strange\ntumultuous excitement that was pleasurable, ever and anon, mingled with\na vague sense of fear and disgust. I had no distinct thoughts about her\nwhile such scenes lasted, but I was conscious of a love growing into\nadoration, and also of abhorrence. This I know is paradox, but I can\nmake no other attempt to explain the feeling.\n\nI now write, after an interval of more than ten years, with a trembling\nhand, with a confused and horrible recollection of certain occurrences\nand situations, in the ordeal through which I was unconsciously passing;\nthough with a vivid and very sharp remembrance of the main current of\nmy story.\n\nBut, I suspect, in all lives there are certain emotional scenes, those\nin which our passions have been most wildly and terribly roused, that\nare of all others the most vaguely and dimly remembered.\n\nSometimes after an hour of apathy, my strange and beautiful companion\nwould take my hand and hold it with a fond pressure, renewed again and\nagain; blushing softly, gazing in my face with languid and burning eyes,\nand breathing so fast that her dress rose and fell with the tumultuous\nrespiration. It was like the ardor of a lover; it embarrassed me; it was\nhateful and yet over-powering; and with gloating eyes she drew me to\nher, and her hot lips traveled along my cheek in kisses; and she would\nwhisper, almost in sobs, \"You are mine, you _shall_ be mine, you and I\nare one for ever.\" Then she had thrown herself back in her chair, with\nher small hands over her eyes, leaving me trembling.\n\n\"Are we related,\" I used to ask; \"what can you mean by all this? I\nremind you perhaps of someone whom you love; but you must not, I hate\nit; I don't know you--I don't know myself when you look so and talk so.\"\n\nShe used to sigh at my vehemence, then turn away and drop my hand.\n\nRespecting these very extraordinary manifestations I strove in vain to\nform any satisfactory theory--I could not refer them to affectation or\ntrick. It was unmistakably the momentary breaking out of suppressed\ninstinct and emotion. Was she, notwithstanding her mother's volunteered\ndenial, subject to brief visitations of insanity; or was there here a\ndisguise and a romance? I had read in old storybooks of such things.\nWhat if a boyish lover had found his way into the house, and sought to\nprosecute his suit in masquerade, with the assistance of a clever old\nadventuress. But there were many things against this hypothesis, highly\ninteresting as it was to my vanity.\n\nI could boast of no little attentions such as masculine gallantry\ndelights to offer. Between these passionate moments there were long\nintervals of commonplace, of gaiety, of brooding melancholy, during\nwhich, except that I detected her eyes so full of melancholy fire,\nfollowing me, at times I might have been as nothing to her. Except in\nthese brief periods of mysterious excitement her ways were girlish; and\nthere was always a languor about her, quite incompatible with a\nmasculine system in a state of health.\n\nIn some respects her habits were odd. Perhaps not so singular in the\nopinion of a town lady like you, as they appeared to us rustic people.\nShe used to come down very late, generally not till one o'clock, she\nwould then take a cup of chocolate, but eat nothing; we then went out\nfor a walk, which was a mere saunter, and she seemed, almost\nimmediately, exhausted, and either returned to the schloss or sat on one\nof the benches that were placed, here and there, among the trees. This\nwas a bodily languor in which her mind did not sympathize. She was\nalways an animated talker, and very intelligent.\n\nShe sometimes alluded for a moment to her own home, or mentioned an\nadventure or situation, or an early recollection, which indicated a\npeople of strange manners, and described customs of which we knew\nnothing. I gathered from these chance hints that her native country was\nmuch more remote than I had at first fancied.\n\nAs we sat thus one afternoon under the trees a funeral passed us by. It\nwas that of a pretty young girl, whom I had often seen, the daughter of\none of the rangers of the forest. The poor man was walking behind the\ncoffin of his darling; she was his only child, and he looked quite\nheartbroken.\n\nPeasants walking two-and-two came behind, they were singing a funeral\nhymn.\n\nI rose to mark my respect as they passed, and joined in the hymn they\nwere very sweetly singing.\n\nMy companion shook me a little roughly, and I turned surprised.\n\nShe said brusquely, \"Don't you perceive how discordant that is?\"\n\n\"I think it very sweet, on the contrary,\" I answered, vexed at the\ninterruption, and very uncomfortable, lest the people who composed the\nlittle procession should observe and resent what was passing.\n\nI resumed, therefore, instantly, and was again interrupted. \"You pierce\nmy ears,\" said Carmilla, almost angrily, and stopping her ears with her\ntiny fingers. \"Besides, how can you tell that your religion and mine are\nthe same; your forms wound me, and I hate funerals. What a fuss! Why you\nmust die--_everyone_ must die; and all are happier when they do.\nCome home.\"\n\n\"My father has gone on with the clergyman to the churchyard. I thought\nyou knew she was to be buried today.\"\n\n\"She? I don't trouble my head about peasants. I don't know who she is,\"\nanswered Carmilla, with a flash from her fine eyes.\n\n\"She is the poor girl who fancied she saw a ghost a fortnight ago, and\nhas been dying ever since, till yesterday, when she expired.\"\n\n\"Tell me nothing about ghosts. I shan't sleep tonight if you do.\"\n\n\"I hope there is no plague or fever coming; all this looks very like\nit,\" I continued. \"The swineherd's young wife died only a week ago, and\nshe thought something seized her by the throat as she lay in her bed,\nand nearly strangled her. Papa says such horrible fancies do accompany\nsome forms of fever. She was quite well the day before. She sank\nafterwards, and died before a week.\"\n\n\"Well, _her_ funeral is over, I hope, and _her_ hymn sung; and our ears\nshan't be tortured with that discord and jargon. It has made me nervous.\nSit down here, beside me; sit close; hold my hand; press it\nhard-hard-harder.\"\n\nWe had moved a little back, and had come to another seat.\n\nShe sat down. Her face underwent a change that alarmed and even\nterrified me for a moment. It darkened, and became horribly livid; her\nteeth and hands were clenched, and she frowned and compressed her lips,\nwhile she stared down upon the ground at her feet, and trembled all over\nwith a continued shudder as irrepressible as ague. All her energies\nseemed strained to suppress a fit, with which she was then breathlessly\ntugging; and at length a low convulsive cry of suffering broke from her,\nand gradually the hysteria subsided. \"There! That comes of strangling\npeople with hymns!\" she said at last. \"Hold me, hold me still. It is\npassing away.\"\n\nAnd so gradually it did; and perhaps to dissipate the somber impression\nwhich the spectacle had left upon me, she became unusually animated and\nchatty; and so we got home.\n\nThis was the first time I had seen her exhibit any definable symptoms of\nthat delicacy of health which her mother had spoken of. It was the first\ntime, also, I had seen her exhibit anything like temper.\n\nBoth passed away like a summer cloud; and never but once afterwards did\nI witness on her part a momentary sign of anger. I will tell you how\nit happened.\n\nShe and I were looking out of one of the long drawing room windows, when\nthere entered the courtyard, over the drawbridge, a figure of a wanderer\nwhom I knew very well. He used to visit the schloss generally twice\na year.\n\nIt was the figure of a hunchback, with the sharp lean features that\ngenerally accompany deformity. He wore a pointed black beard, and he was\nsmiling from ear to ear, showing his white fangs. He was dressed in\nbuff, black, and scarlet, and crossed with more straps and belts than I\ncould count, from which hung all manner of things. Behind, he carried a\nmagic lantern, and two boxes, which I well knew, in one of which was a\nsalamander, and in the other a mandrake. These monsters used to make my\nfather laugh. They were compounded of parts of monkeys, parrots,\nsquirrels, fish, and hedgehogs, dried and stitched together with great\nneatness and startling effect. He had a fiddle, a box of conjuring\napparatus, a pair of foils and masks attached to his belt, several other\nmysterious cases dangling about him, and a black staff with copper\nferrules in his hand. His companion was a rough spare dog, that followed\nat his heels, but stopped short, suspiciously at the drawbridge, and in\na little while began to howl dismally.\n\nIn the meantime, the mountebank, standing in the midst of the courtyard,\nraised his grotesque hat, and made us a very ceremonious bow, paying his\ncompliments very volubly in execrable French, and German not\nmuch better.\n\nThen, disengaging his fiddle, he began to scrape a lively air to which\nhe sang with a merry discord, dancing with ludicrous airs and activity,\nthat made me laugh, in spite of the dog's howling.\n\nThen he advanced to the window with many smiles and salutations, and\nhis hat in his left hand, his fiddle under his arm, and with a fluency\nthat never took breath, he gabbled a long advertisement of all his\naccomplishments, and the resources of the various arts which he placed\nat our service, and the curiosities and entertainments which it was in\nhis power, at our bidding, to display.\n\n\"Will your ladyships be pleased to buy an amulet against the oupire,\nwhich is going like the wolf, I hear, through these woods,\" he said\ndropping his hat on the pavement. \"They are dying of it right and left\nand here is a charm that never fails; only pinned to the pillow, and you\nmay laugh in his face.\"\n\nThese charms consisted of oblong slips of vellum, with cabalistic\nciphers and diagrams upon them.\n\nCarmilla instantly purchased one, and so did I.\n\nHe was looking up, and we were smiling down upon him, amused; at least,\nI can answer for myself. His piercing black eye, as he looked up in our\nfaces, seemed to detect something that fixed for a moment his curiosity.\nIn an instant he unrolled a leather case, full of all manner of odd\nlittle steel instruments.\n\n\"See here, my lady,\" he said, displaying it, and addressing me, \"I\nprofess, among other things less useful, the art of dentistry. Plague\ntake the dog!\" he interpolated. \"Silence, beast! He howls so that your\nladyships can scarcely hear a word. Your noble friend, the young lady at\nyour right, has the sharpest tooth,--long, thin, pointed, like an awl,\nlike a needle; ha, ha! With my sharp and long sight, as I look up, I\nhave seen it distinctly; now if it happens to hurt the young lady, and I\nthink it must, here am I, here are my file, my punch, my nippers; I will\nmake it round and blunt, if her ladyship pleases; no longer the tooth of\na fish, but of a beautiful young lady as she is. Hey? Is the young lady\ndispleased? Have I been too bold? Have I offended her?\"\n\nThe young lady, indeed, looked very angry as she drew back from the\nwindow.\n\n\"How dares that mountebank insult us so? Where is your father? I shall\ndemand redress from him. My father would have had the wretch tied up to\nthe pump, and flogged with a cart whip, and burnt to the bones with the\ncattle brand!\"\n\nShe retired from the window a step or two, and sat down, and had hardly\nlost sight of the offender, when her wrath subsided as suddenly as it\nhad risen, and she gradually recovered her usual tone, and seemed to\nforget the little hunchback and his follies.\n\nMy father was out of spirits that evening. On coming in he told us that\nthere had been another case very similar to the two fatal ones which had\nlately occurred. The sister of a young peasant on his estate, only a\nmile away, was very ill, had been, as she described it, attacked very\nnearly in the same way, and was now slowly but steadily sinking.\n\n\"All this,\" said my father, \"is strictly referable to natural causes.\nThese poor people infect one another with their superstitions, and so\nrepeat in imagination the images of terror that have infested their\nneighbors.\"\n\n\"But that very circumstance frightens one horribly,\" said Carmilla.\n\n\"How so?\" inquired my father.\n\n\"I am so afraid of fancying I see such things; I think it would be as\nbad as reality.\"\n\n\"We are in God's hands: nothing can happen without his permission, and\nall will end well for those who love him. He is our faithful creator; He\nhas made us all, and will take care of us.\"\n\n\"Creator! _Nature!_\" said the young lady in answer to my gentle father.\n\"And this disease that invades the country is natural. Nature. All\nthings proceed from Nature--don't they? All things in the heaven, in the\nearth, and under the earth, act and live as Nature ordains? I\nthink so.\"\n\n\"The doctor said he would come here today,\" said my father, after a\nsilence. \"I want to know what he thinks about it, and what he thinks we\nhad better do.\"\n\n\"Doctors never did me any good,\" said Carmilla.\n\n\"Then you have been ill?\" I asked.\n\n\"More ill than ever you were,\" she answered.\n\n\"Long ago?\"\n\n\"Yes, a long time. I suffered from this very illness; but I forget all\nbut my pain and weakness, and they were not so bad as are suffered in\nother diseases.\"\n\n\"You were very young then?\"\n\n\"I dare say, let us talk no more of it. You would not wound a friend?\"\n\nShe looked languidly in my eyes, and passed her arm round my waist\nlovingly, and led me out of the room. My father was busy over some\npapers near the window.\n\n\"Why does your papa like to frighten us?\" said the pretty girl with a\nsigh and a little shudder.\n\n\"He doesn't, dear Carmilla, it is the very furthest thing from his\nmind.\"\n\n\"Are you afraid, dearest?\"\n\n\"I should be very much if I fancied there was any real danger of my\nbeing attacked as those poor people were.\"\n\n\"You are afraid to die?\"\n\n\"Yes, every one is.\"\n\n\"But to die as lovers may--to die together, so that they may live\ntogether.\n\n\"Girls are caterpillars while they live in the world, to be finally\nbutterflies when the summer comes; but in the meantime there are grubs\nand larvae, don't you see--each with their peculiar propensities,\nnecessities and structure. So says Monsieur Buffon, in his big book, in\nthe next room.\"\n\nLater in the day the doctor came, and was closeted with papa for some\ntime.\n\nHe was a skilful man, of sixty and upwards, he wore powder, and shaved\nhis pale face as smooth as a pumpkin. He and papa emerged from the room\ntogether, and I heard papa laugh, and say as they came out:\n\n\"Well, I do wonder at a wise man like you. What do you say to\nhippogriffs and dragons?\"\n\nThe doctor was smiling, and made answer, shaking his head--\n\n\"Nevertheless life and death are mysterious states, and we know little\nof the resources of either.\"\n\nAnd so they walked on, and I heard no more. I did not then know what the\ndoctor had been broaching, but I think I guess it now.\n\n\n\nV\n\n_A Wonderful Likeness_\n\nThis evening there arrived from Gratz the grave, dark-faced son of the\npicture cleaner, with a horse and cart laden with two large packing\ncases, having many pictures in each. It was a journey of ten leagues,\nand whenever a messenger arrived at the schloss from our little capital\nof Gratz, we used to crowd about him in the hall, to hear the news.\n\nThis arrival created in our secluded quarters quite a sensation. The\ncases remained in the hall, and the messenger was taken charge of by the\nservants till he had eaten his supper. Then with assistants, and armed\nwith hammer, ripping chisel, and turnscrew, he met us in the hall, where\nwe had assembled to witness the unpacking of the cases.\n\nCarmilla sat looking listlessly on, while one after the other the old\npictures, nearly all portraits, which had undergone the process of\nrenovation, were brought to light. My mother was of an old Hungarian\nfamily, and most of these pictures, which were about to be restored to\ntheir places, had come to us through her.\n\nMy father had a list in his hand, from which he read, as the artist\nrummaged out the corresponding numbers. I don't know that the pictures\nwere very good, but they were, undoubtedly, very old, and some of them\nvery curious also. They had, for the most part, the merit of being now\nseen by me, I may say, for the first time; for the smoke and dust of\ntime had all but obliterated them.\n\n\"There is a picture that I have not seen yet,\" said my father. \"In one\ncorner, at the top of it, is the name, as well as I could read, 'Marcia\nKarnstein,' and the date '1698'; and I am curious to see how it has\nturned out.\"\n\nI remembered it; it was a small picture, about a foot and a half high,\nand nearly square, without a frame; but it was so blackened by age that\nI could not make it out.\n\nThe artist now produced it, with evident pride. It was quite beautiful;\nit was startling; it seemed to live. It was the effigy of Carmilla!\n\n\"Carmilla, dear, here is an absolute miracle. Here you are, living,\nsmiling, ready to speak, in this picture. Isn't it beautiful, Papa? And\nsee, even the little mole on her throat.\"\n\nMy father laughed, and said \"Certainly it is a wonderful likeness,\" but\nhe looked away, and to my surprise seemed but little struck by it, and\nwent on talking to the picture cleaner, who was also something of an\nartist, and discoursed with intelligence about the portraits or other\nworks, which his art had just brought into light and color, while I was\nmore and more lost in wonder the more I looked at the picture.\n\n\"Will you let me hang this picture in my room, papa?\" I asked.\n\n\"Certainly, dear,\" said he, smiling, \"I'm very glad you think it so\nlike. It must be prettier even than I thought it, if it is.\"\n\nThe young lady did not acknowledge this pretty speech, did not seem to\nhear it. She was leaning back in her seat, her fine eyes under their\nlong lashes gazing on me in contemplation, and she smiled in a kind\nof rapture.\n\n\"And now you can read quite plainly the name that is written in the\ncorner. It is not Marcia; it looks as if it was done in gold. The name\nis Mircalla, Countess Karnstein, and this is a little coronet over and\nunderneath A.D. 1698. I am descended from the Karnsteins; that is,\nmamma was.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said the lady, languidly, \"so am I, I think, a very long descent,\nvery ancient. Are there any Karnsteins living now?\"\n\n\"None who bear the name, I believe. The family were ruined, I believe,\nin some civil wars, long ago, but the ruins of the castle are only about\nthree miles away.\"\n\n\"How interesting!\" she said, languidly. \"But see what beautiful\nmoonlight!\" She glanced through the hall door, which stood a little\nopen. \"Suppose you take a little ramble round the court, and look down\nat the road and river.\"\n\n\"It is so like the night you came to us,\" I said.\n\nShe sighed; smiling.\n\nShe rose, and each with her arm about the other's waist, we walked out\nupon the pavement.\n\nIn silence, slowly we walked down to the drawbridge, where the beautiful\nlandscape opened before us.\n\n\"And so you were thinking of the night I came here?\" she almost\nwhispered.\n\n\"Are you glad I came?\"\n\n\"Delighted, dear Carmilla,\" I answered.\n\n\"And you asked for the picture you think like me, to hang in your room,\"\nshe murmured with a sigh, as she drew her arm closer about my waist, and\nlet her pretty head sink upon my shoulder. \"How romantic you are,\nCarmilla,\" I said. \"Whenever you tell me your story, it will be made up\nchiefly of some one great romance.\"\n\nShe kissed me silently.\n\n\"I am sure, Carmilla, you have been in love; that there is, at this\nmoment, an affair of the heart going on.\"\n\n\"I have been in love with no one, and never shall,\" she whispered,\n\"unless it should be with you.\"\n\nHow beautiful she looked in the moonlight!\n\nShy and strange was the look with which she quickly hid her face in my\nneck and hair, with tumultuous sighs, that seemed almost to sob, and\npressed in mine a hand that trembled.\n\nHer soft cheek was glowing against mine. \"Darling, darling,\" she\nmurmured, \"I live in you; and you would die for me, I love you so.\"\n\nI started from her.\n\nShe was gazing on me with eyes from which all fire, all meaning had\nflown, and a face colorless and apathetic.\n\n\"Is there a chill in the air, dear?\" she said drowsily. \"I almost\nshiver; have I been dreaming? Let us come in. Come; come; come in.\"\n\n\"You look ill, Carmilla; a little faint. You certainly must take some\nwine,\" I said.\n\n\"Yes. I will. I'm better now. I shall be quite well in a few minutes.\nYes, do give me a little wine,\" answered Carmilla, as we approached\nthe door.\n\n\"Let us look again for a moment; it is the last time, perhaps, I shall\nsee the moonlight with you.\"\n\n\"How do you feel now, dear Carmilla? Are you really better?\" I asked.\n\nI was beginning to take alarm, lest she should have been stricken with\nthe strange epidemic that they said had invaded the country about us.\n\n\"Papa would be grieved beyond measure,\" I added, \"if he thought you were\never so little ill, without immediately letting us know. We have a very\nskilful doctor near us, the physician who was with papa today.\"\n\n\"I'm sure he is. I know how kind you all are; but, dear child, I am\nquite well again. There is nothing ever wrong with me, but a\nlittle weakness.\n\n\"People say I am languid; I am incapable of exertion; I can scarcely walk\nas far as a child of three years old: and every now and then the little\nstrength I have falters, and I become as you have just seen me. But\nafter all I am very easily set up again; in a moment I am perfectly\nmyself. See how I have recovered.\"\n\nSo, indeed, she had; and she and I talked a great deal, and very\nanimated she was; and the remainder of that evening passed without any\nrecurrence of what I called her infatuations. I mean her crazy talk and\nlooks, which embarrassed, and even frightened me.\n\nBut there occurred that night an event which gave my thoughts quite a\nnew turn, and seemed to startle even Carmilla's languid nature into\nmomentary energy.\n\n\n\nVI\n\n_A Very Strange Agony_\n\nWhen we got into the drawing room, and had sat down to our coffee and\nchocolate, although Carmilla did not take any, she seemed quite herself\nagain, and Madame, and Mademoiselle De Lafontaine, joined us, and made a\nlittle card party, in the course of which papa came in for what he\ncalled his \"dish of tea.\"\n\nWhen the game was over he sat down beside Carmilla on the sofa, and\nasked her, a little anxiously, whether she had heard from her mother\nsince her arrival.\n\nShe answered \"No.\"\n\nHe then asked whether she knew where a letter would reach her at\npresent.\n\n\"I cannot tell,\" she answered ambiguously, \"but I have been thinking of\nleaving you; you have been already too hospitable and too kind to me. I\nhave given you an infinity of trouble, and I should wish to take a\ncarriage tomorrow, and post in pursuit of her; I know where I shall\nultimately find her, although I dare not yet tell you.\"\n\n\"But you must not dream of any such thing,\" exclaimed my father, to my\ngreat relief. \"We can't afford to lose you so, and I won't consent to\nyour leaving us, except under the care of your mother, who was so good\nas to consent to your remaining with us till she should herself return.\nI should be quite happy if I knew that you heard from her: but this\nevening the accounts of the progress of the mysterious disease that has\ninvaded our neighborhood, grow even more alarming; and my beautiful\nguest, I do feel the responsibility, unaided by advice from your mother,\nvery much. But I shall do my best; and one thing is certain, that you\nmust not think of leaving us without her distinct direction to that\neffect. We should suffer too much in parting from you to consent to\nit easily.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir, a thousand times for your hospitality,\" she answered,\nsmiling bashfully. \"You have all been too kind to me; I have seldom been\nso happy in all my life before, as in your beautiful chateau, under your\ncare, and in the society of your dear daughter.\"\n\nSo he gallantly, in his old-fashioned way, kissed her hand, smiling and\npleased at her little speech.\n\nI accompanied Carmilla as usual to her room, and sat and chatted with\nher while she was preparing for bed.\n\n\"Do you think,\" I said at length, \"that you will ever confide fully in\nme?\"\n\nShe turned round smiling, but made no answer, only continued to smile on\nme.\n\n\"You won't answer that?\" I said. \"You can't answer pleasantly; I ought\nnot to have asked you.\"\n\n\"You were quite right to ask me that, or anything. You do not know how\ndear you are to me, or you could not think any confidence too great to\nlook for.  But I am under vows, no nun half so awfully, and I dare not\ntell my story yet, even to you. The time is very near when you shall\nknow everything. You will think me cruel, very selfish, but love is\nalways selfish; the more ardent the more selfish. How jealous I am you\ncannot know. You must come with me, loving me, to death; or else hate me\nand still come with me, and _hating_ me through death and after. There\nis no such word as indifference in my apathetic nature.\"\n\n\"Now, Carmilla, you are going to talk your wild nonsense again,\" I said\nhastily.\n\n\"Not I, silly little fool as I am, and full of whims and fancies; for\nyour sake I'll talk like a sage. Were you ever at a ball?\"\n\n\"No; how you do run on. What is it like? How charming it must be.\"\n\n\"I almost forget, it is years ago.\"\n\nI laughed.\n\n\"You are not so old. Your first ball can hardly be forgotten yet.\"\n\n\"I remember everything about it--with an effort. I see it all, as divers\nsee what is going on above them, through a medium, dense, rippling, but\ntransparent. There occurred that night what has confused the picture,\nand made its colours faint. I was all but assassinated in my bed,\nwounded here,\" she touched her breast, \"and never was the same since.\"\n\n\"Were you near dying?\"\n\n\"Yes, very--a cruel love--strange love, that would have taken my life.\nLove will have its sacrifices. No sacrifice without blood. Let us go to\nsleep now; I feel so lazy. How can I get up just now and lock my door?\"\n\nShe was lying with her tiny hands buried in her rich wavy hair, under\nher cheek, her little head upon the pillow, and her glittering eyes\nfollowed me wherever I moved, with a kind of shy smile that I could\nnot decipher.\n\nI bid her good night, and crept from the room with an uncomfortable\nsensation.\n\nI often wondered whether our pretty guest ever said her prayers. I\ncertainly had never seen her upon her knees. In the morning she never\ncame down until long after our family prayers were over, and at night\nshe never left the drawing room to attend our brief evening prayers\nin the hall.\n\nIf it had not been that it had casually come out in one of our careless\ntalks that she had been baptised, I should have doubted her being a\nChristian. Religion was a subject on which I had never heard her speak a\nword. If I had known the world better, this particular neglect or\nantipathy would not have so much surprised me.\n\nThe precautions of nervous people are infectious, and persons of a like\ntemperament are pretty sure, after a time, to imitate them. I had\nadopted Carmilla's habit of locking her bedroom door, having taken into\nmy head all her whimsical alarms about midnight invaders and prowling\nassassins. I had also adopted her precaution of making a brief search\nthrough her room, to satisfy herself that no lurking assassin or robber\nwas \"ensconced.\"\n\nThese wise measures taken, I got into my bed and fell asleep. A light\nwas burning in my room. This was an old habit, of very early date, and\nwhich nothing could have tempted me to dispense with.\n\nThus fortified I might take my rest in peace. But dreams come through\nstone walls, light up dark rooms, or darken light ones, and their\npersons make their exits and their entrances as they please, and laugh\nat locksmiths.\n\nI had a dream that night that was the beginning of a very strange agony.\n\nI cannot call it a nightmare, for I was quite conscious of being asleep.\n\nBut I was equally conscious of being in my room, and lying in bed,\nprecisely as I actually was. I saw, or fancied I saw, the room and its\nfurniture just as I had seen it last, except that it was very dark, and\nI saw something moving round the foot of the bed, which at first I\ncould not accurately distinguish. But I soon saw that it was a\nsooty-black animal that resembled a monstrous cat. It appeared to me\nabout four or five feet long for it measured fully the length of the\nhearthrug as it passed over it; and it continued to-ing and fro-ing with\nthe lithe, sinister restlessness of a beast in a cage. I could not cry\nout, although as you may suppose, I was terrified. Its pace was growing\nfaster, and the room rapidly darker and darker, and at length so dark\nthat I could no longer see anything of it but its eyes. I felt it spring\nlightly on the bed. The two broad eyes approached my face, and suddenly\nI felt a stinging pain as if two large needles darted, an inch or two\napart, deep into my breast. I waked with a scream. The room was lighted\nby the candle that burnt there all through the night, and I saw a female\nfigure standing at the foot of the bed, a little at the right side. It\nwas in a dark loose dress, and its hair was down and covered its\nshoulders. A block of stone could not have been more still. There was\nnot the slightest stir of respiration. As I stared at it, the figure\nappeared to have changed its place, and was now nearer the door; then,\nclose to it, the door opened, and it passed out.\n\nI was now relieved, and able to breathe and move. My first thought was\nthat Carmilla had been playing me a trick, and that I had forgotten to\nsecure my door. I hastened to it, and found it locked as usual on the\ninside. I was afraid to open it--I was horrified. I sprang into my bed\nand covered my head up in the bedclothes, and lay there more dead than\nalive till morning.\n\n\n\nVII\n\n_Descending_\n\nIt would be vain my attempting to tell you the horror with which, even\nnow, I recall the occurrence of that night. It was no such transitory\nterror as a dream leaves behind it. It seemed to deepen by time, and\ncommunicated itself to the room and the very furniture that had\nencompassed the apparition.\n\nI could not bear next day to be alone for a moment. I should have told\npapa, but for two opposite reasons. At one time I thought he would laugh\nat my story, and I could not bear its being treated as a jest; and at\nanother I thought he might fancy that I had been attacked by the\nmysterious complaint which had invaded our neighborhood. I had myself no\nmisgiving of the kind, and as he had been rather an invalid for some\ntime, I was afraid of alarming him.\n\nI was comfortable enough with my good-natured companions, Madame\nPerrodon, and the vivacious Mademoiselle Lafontaine. They both perceived\nthat I was out of spirits and nervous, and at length I told them what\nlay so heavy at my heart.\n\nMademoiselle laughed, but I fancied that Madame Perrodon looked anxious.\n\n\"By-the-by,\" said Mademoiselle, laughing, \"the long lime tree walk,\nbehind Carmilla's bedroom window, is haunted!\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" exclaimed Madame, who probably thought the theme rather\ninopportune, \"and who tells that story, my dear?\"\n\n\"Martin says that he came up twice, when the old yard gate was being\nrepaired, before sunrise, and twice saw the same female figure walking\ndown the lime tree avenue.\"\n\n\"So he well might, as long as there are cows to milk in the river\nfields,\" said Madame.\n\n\"I daresay; but Martin chooses to be frightened, and never did I see\nfool more frightened.\"\n\n\"You must not say a word about it to Carmilla, because she can see down\nthat walk from her room window,\" I interposed, \"and she is, if possible,\na greater coward than I.\"\n\nCarmilla came down rather later than usual that day.\n\n\"I was so frightened last night,\" she said, so soon as were together,\n\"and I am sure I should have seen something dreadful if it had not been\nfor that charm I bought from the poor little hunchback whom I called\nsuch hard names. I had a dream of something black coming round my bed,\nand I awoke in a perfect horror, and I really thought, for some seconds,\nI saw a dark figure near the chimney-piece, but I felt under my pillow\nfor my charm, and the moment my fingers touched it, the figure\ndisappeared, and I felt quite certain, only that I had it by me, that\nsomething frightful would have made its appearance, and, perhaps,\nthrottled me, as it did those poor people we heard of.\n\n\"Well, listen to me,\" I began, and recounted my adventure, at the\nrecital of which she appeared horrified.\n\n\"And had you the charm near you?\" she asked, earnestly.\n\n\"No, I had dropped it into a china vase in the drawing room, but I shall\ncertainly take it with me tonight, as you have so much faith in it.\"\n\nAt this distance of time I cannot tell you, or even understand, how I\novercame my horror so effectually as to lie alone in my room that night.\nI remember distinctly that I pinned the charm to my pillow. I fell\nasleep almost immediately, and slept even more soundly than usual\nall night.\n\nNext night I passed as well. My sleep was delightfully deep and\ndreamless.\n\nBut I wakened with a sense of lassitude and melancholy, which, however,\ndid not exceed a degree that was almost luxurious.\n\n\"Well, I told you so,\" said Carmilla, when I described my quiet sleep,\n\"I had such delightful sleep myself last night; I pinned the charm to\nthe breast of my nightdress. It was too far away the night before. I am\nquite sure it was all fancy, except the dreams. I used to think that\nevil spirits made dreams, but our doctor told me it is no such thing.\nOnly a fever passing by, or some other malady, as they often do, he\nsaid, knocks at the door, and not being able to get in, passes on, with\nthat alarm.\"\n\n\"And what do you think the charm is?\" said I.\n\n\"It has been fumigated or immersed in some drug, and is an antidote\nagainst the malaria,\" she answered.\n\n\"Then it acts only on the body?\"\n\n\"Certainly; you don't suppose that evil spirits are frightened by bits\nof ribbon, or the perfumes of a druggist's shop? No, these complaints,\nwandering in the air, begin by trying the nerves, and so infect the\nbrain, but before they can seize upon you, the antidote repels them.\nThat I am sure is what the charm has done for us. It is nothing magical,\nit is simply natural.\"\n\nI should have been happier if I could have quite agreed with Carmilla,\nbut I did my best, and the impression was a little losing its force.\n\nFor some nights I slept profoundly; but still every morning I felt the\nsame lassitude, and a languor weighed upon me all day. I felt myself a\nchanged girl. A strange melancholy was stealing over me, a melancholy\nthat I would not have interrupted. Dim thoughts of death began to open,\nand an idea that I was slowly sinking took gentle, and, somehow, not\nunwelcome, possession of me. If it was sad, the tone of mind which this\ninduced was also sweet.\n\nWhatever it might be, my soul acquiesced in it.\n\nI would not admit that I was ill, I would not consent to tell my papa,\nor to have the doctor sent for.\n\nCarmilla became more devoted to me than ever, and her strange paroxysms\nof languid adoration more frequent. She used to gloat on me with\nincreasing ardor the more my strength and spirits waned. This always\nshocked me like a momentary glare of insanity.\n\nWithout knowing it, I was now in a pretty advanced stage of the\nstrangest illness under which mortal ever suffered. There was an\nunaccountable fascination in its earlier symptoms that more than\nreconciled me to the incapacitating effect of that stage of the malady.\nThis fascination increased for a time, until it reached a certain point,\nwhen gradually a sense of the horrible mingled itself with it,\ndeepening, as you shall hear, until it discolored and perverted the\nwhole state of my life.\n\nThe first change I experienced was rather agreeable. It was very near\nthe turning point from which began the descent of Avernus.\n\nCertain vague and strange sensations visited me in my sleep. The\nprevailing one was of that pleasant, peculiar cold thrill which we feel\nin bathing, when we move against the current of a river. This was soon\naccompanied by dreams that seemed interminable, and were so vague that\nI could never recollect their scenery and persons, or any one connected\nportion of their action. But they left an awful impression, and a sense\nof exhaustion, as if I had passed through a long period of great mental\nexertion and danger.\n\nAfter all these dreams there remained on waking a remembrance of having\nbeen in a place very nearly dark, and of having spoken to people whom I\ncould not see; and especially of one clear voice, of a female's, very\ndeep, that spoke as if at a distance, slowly, and producing always the\nsame sensation of indescribable solemnity and fear. Sometimes there came\na sensation as if a hand was drawn softly along my cheek and neck.\nSometimes it was as if warm lips kissed me, and longer and longer and\nmore lovingly as they reached my throat, but there the caress fixed\nitself. My heart beat faster, my breathing rose and fell rapidly and\nfull drawn; a sobbing, that rose into a sense of strangulation,\nsupervened, and turned into a dreadful convulsion, in which my senses\nleft me and I became unconscious.\n\nIt was now three weeks since the commencement of this unaccountable\nstate.\n\nMy sufferings had, during the last week, told upon my appearance. I had\ngrown pale, my eyes were dilated and darkened underneath, and the\nlanguor which I had long felt began to display itself in my countenance.\n\nMy father asked me often whether I was ill; but, with an obstinacy which\nnow seems to me unaccountable, I persisted in assuring him that I was\nquite well.\n\nIn a sense this was true. I had no pain, I could complain of no bodily\nderangement. My complaint seemed to be one of the imagination, or the\nnerves, and, horrible as my sufferings were, I kept them, with a morbid\nreserve, very nearly to myself.\n\nIt could not be that terrible complaint which the peasants called the\noupire, for I had now been suffering for three weeks, and they were\nseldom ill for much more than three days, when death put an end to\ntheir miseries.\n\nCarmilla complained of dreams and feverish sensations, but by no means\nof so alarming a kind as mine. I say that mine were extremely alarming.\nHad I been capable of comprehending my condition, I would have invoked\naid and advice on my knees. The narcotic of an unsuspected influence was\nacting upon me, and my perceptions were benumbed.\n\nI am going to tell you now of a dream that led immediately to an odd\ndiscovery.\n\nOne night, instead of the voice I was accustomed to hear in the dark, I\nheard one, sweet and tender, and at the same time terrible, which said,\n\"Your mother warns you to beware of the assassin.\" At the same time a\nlight unexpectedly sprang up, and I saw Carmilla, standing, near the\nfoot of my bed, in her white nightdress, bathed, from her chin to her\nfeet, in one great stain of blood.\n\nI wakened with a shriek, possessed with the one idea that Carmilla was\nbeing murdered. I remember springing from my bed, and my next\nrecollection is that of standing on the lobby, crying for help.\n\nMadame and Mademoiselle came scurrying out of their rooms in alarm; a\nlamp burned always on the lobby, and seeing me, they soon learned the\ncause of my terror.\n\nI insisted on our knocking at Carmilla's door. Our knocking was\nunanswered.\n\nIt soon became a pounding and an uproar. We shrieked her name, but all\nwas vain.\n\nWe all grew frightened, for the door was locked. We hurried back, in\npanic, to my room. There we rang the bell long and furiously. If my\nfather's room had been at that side of the house, we would have called\nhim up at once to our aid. But, alas! he was quite out of hearing, and\nto reach him involved an excursion for which we none of us had courage.\n\nServants, however, soon came running up the stairs; I had got on my\ndressing gown and slippers meanwhile, and my companions were already\nsimilarly furnished. Recognizing the voices of the servants on the\nlobby, we sallied out together; and having renewed, as fruitlessly, our\nsummons at Carmilla's door, I ordered the men to force the lock. They\ndid so, and we stood, holding our lights aloft, in the doorway, and so\nstared into the room.\n\nWe called her by name; but there was still no reply. We looked round the\nroom. Everything was undisturbed. It was exactly in the state in which I\nhad left it on bidding her good night. But Carmilla was gone.\n\n\n\nVIII\n\n_Search_\n\nAt sight of the room, perfectly undisturbed except for our violent\nentrance, we began to cool a little, and soon recovered our senses\nsufficiently to dismiss the men. It had struck Mademoiselle that\npossibly Carmilla had been wakened by the uproar at her door, and in her\nfirst panic had jumped from her bed, and hid herself in a press, or\nbehind a curtain, from which she could not, of course, emerge until the\nmajordomo and his myrmidons had withdrawn. We now recommenced our\nsearch, and began to call her name again.\n\nIt was all to no purpose. Our perplexity and agitation increased. We\nexamined the windows, but they were secured. I implored of Carmilla, if\nshe had concealed herself, to play this cruel trick no longer--to come\nout and to end our anxieties. It was all useless. I was by this time\nconvinced that she was not in the room, nor in the dressing room, the\ndoor of which was still locked on this side. She could not have passed\nit. I was utterly puzzled. Had Carmilla discovered one of those secret\npassages which the old housekeeper said were known to exist in the\nschloss, although the tradition of their exact situation had been lost?\nA little time would, no doubt, explain all--utterly perplexed as, for\nthe present, we were.\n\nIt was past four o'clock, and I preferred passing the remaining hours of\ndarkness in Madame's room. Daylight brought no solution of the\ndifficulty.\n\nThe whole household, with my father at its head, was in a state of\nagitation next morning. Every part of the chateau was searched. The\ngrounds were explored. No trace of the missing lady could be discovered.\nThe stream was about to be dragged; my father was in distraction; what a\ntale to have to tell the poor girl's mother on her return. I, too, was\nalmost beside myself, though my grief was quite of a different kind.\n\nThe morning was passed in alarm and excitement. It was now one o'clock,\nand still no tidings. I ran up to Carmilla's room, and found her\nstanding at her dressing table. I was astounded. I could not believe my\neyes. She beckoned me to her with her pretty finger, in silence. Her\nface expressed extreme fear.\n\nI ran to her in an ecstasy of joy; I kissed and embraced her again and\nagain. I ran to the bell and rang it vehemently, to bring others to the\nspot who might at once relieve my father's anxiety.\n\n\"Dear Carmilla, what has become of you all this time? We have been in\nagonies of anxiety about you,\" I exclaimed. \"Where have you been? How\ndid you come back?\"\n\n\"Last night has been a night of wonders,\" she said.\n\n\"For mercy's sake, explain all you can.\"\n\n\"It was past two last night,\" she said, \"when I went to sleep as usual\nin my bed, with my doors locked, that of the dressing room, and that\nopening upon the gallery. My sleep was uninterrupted, and, so far as I\nknow, dreamless; but I woke just now on the sofa in the dressing room\nthere, and I found the door between the rooms open, and the other door\nforced. How could all this have happened without my being wakened? It\nmust have been accompanied with a great deal of noise, and I am\nparticularly easily wakened; and how could I have been carried out of my\nbed without my sleep having been interrupted, I whom the slightest stir\nstartles?\"\n\nBy this time, Madame, Mademoiselle, my father, and a number of the\nservants were in the room. Carmilla was, of course, overwhelmed with\ninquiries, congratulations, and welcomes. She had but one story to tell,\nand seemed the least able of all the party to suggest any way of\naccounting for what had happened.\n\nMy father took a turn up and down the room, thinking. I saw Carmilla's\neye follow him for a moment with a sly, dark glance.\n\nWhen my father had sent the servants away, Mademoiselle having gone in\nsearch of a little bottle of valerian and salvolatile, and there being\nno one now in the room with Carmilla, except my father, Madame, and\nmyself, he came to her thoughtfully, took her hand very kindly, led her\nto the sofa, and sat down beside her.\n\n\"Will you forgive me, my dear, if I risk a conjecture, and ask a\nquestion?\"\n\n\"Who can have a better right?\" she said. \"Ask what you please, and I\nwill tell you everything. But my story is simply one of bewilderment and\ndarkness. I know absolutely nothing. Put any question you please, but\nyou know, of course, the limitations mamma has placed me under.\"\n\n\"Perfectly, my dear child. I need not approach the topics on which she\ndesires our silence. Now, the marvel of last night consists in your\nhaving been removed from your bed and your room, without being wakened,\nand this removal having occurred apparently while the windows were still\nsecured, and the two doors locked upon the inside. I will tell you my\ntheory and ask you a question.\"\n\nCarmilla was leaning on her hand dejectedly; Madame and I were\nlistening breathlessly.\n\n\"Now, my question is this. Have you ever been suspected of walking in\nyour sleep?\"\n\n\"Never, since I was very young indeed.\"\n\n\"But you did walk in your sleep when you were young?\"\n\n\"Yes; I know I did. I have been told so often by my old nurse.\"\n\nMy father smiled and nodded.\n\n\"Well, what has happened is this. You got up in your sleep, unlocked the\ndoor, not leaving the key, as usual, in the lock, but taking it out and\nlocking it on the outside; you again took the key out, and carried it\naway with you to some one of the five-and-twenty rooms on this floor, or\nperhaps upstairs or downstairs. There are so many rooms and closets, so\nmuch heavy furniture, and such accumulations of lumber, that it would\nrequire a week to search this old house thoroughly. Do you see, now,\nwhat I mean?\"\n\n\"I do, but not all,\" she answered.\n\n\"And how, papa, do you account for her finding herself on the sofa in\nthe dressing room, which we had searched so carefully?\"\n\n\"She came there after you had searched it, still in her sleep, and at\nlast awoke spontaneously, and was as much surprised to find herself\nwhere she was as any one else. I wish all mysteries were as easily and\ninnocently explained as yours, Carmilla,\" he said, laughing. \"And so we\nmay congratulate ourselves on the certainty that the most natural\nexplanation of the occurrence is one that involves no drugging, no\ntampering with locks, no burglars, or poisoners, or witches--nothing\nthat need alarm Carmilla, or anyone else, for our safety.\"\n\nCarmilla was looking charmingly. Nothing could be more beautiful than\nher tints. Her beauty was, I think, enhanced by that graceful languor\nthat was peculiar to her. I think my father was silently contrasting her\nlooks with mine, for he said:\n\n\"I wish my poor Laura was looking more like herself\"; and he sighed.\n\nSo our alarms were happily ended, and Carmilla restored to her friends.\n\n\n\nIX\n\n_The Doctor_\n\nAs Carmilla would not hear of an attendant sleeping in her room, my\nfather arranged that a servant should sleep outside her door, so that\nshe would not attempt to make another such excursion without being\narrested at her own door.\n\nThat night passed quietly; and next morning early, the doctor, whom my\nfather had sent for without telling me a word about it, arrived to\nsee me.\n\nMadame accompanied me to the library; and there the grave little doctor,\nwith white hair and spectacles, whom I mentioned before, was waiting to\nreceive me.\n\nI told him my story, and as I proceeded he grew graver and graver.\n\nWe were standing, he and I, in the recess of one of the windows, facing\none another. When my statement was over, he leaned with his shoulders\nagainst the wall, and with his eyes fixed on me earnestly, with an\ninterest in which was a dash of horror.\n\nAfter a minute's reflection, he asked Madame if he could see my father.\n\nHe was sent for accordingly, and as he entered, smiling, he said:\n\n\"I dare say, doctor, you are going to tell me that I am an old fool for\nhaving brought you here; I hope I am.\"\n\nBut his smile faded into shadow as the doctor, with a very grave face,\nbeckoned him to him.\n\nHe and the doctor talked for some time in the same recess where I had\njust conferred with the physician. It seemed an earnest and\nargumentative conversation. The room is very large, and I and Madame\nstood together, burning with curiosity, at the farther end. Not a word\ncould we hear, however, for they spoke in a very low tone, and the deep\nrecess of the window quite concealed the doctor from view, and very\nnearly my father, whose foot, arm, and shoulder only could we see; and\nthe voices were, I suppose, all the less audible for the sort of closet\nwhich the thick wall and window formed.\n\nAfter a time my father's face looked into the room; it was pale,\nthoughtful, and, I fancied, agitated.\n\n\"Laura, dear, come here for a moment. Madame, we shan't trouble you, the\ndoctor says, at present.\"\n\nAccordingly I approached, for the first time a little alarmed; for,\nalthough I felt very weak, I did not feel ill; and strength, one always\nfancies, is a thing that may be picked up when we please.\n\nMy father held out his hand to me, as I drew near, but he was looking at\nthe doctor, and he said:\n\n\"It certainly is very odd; I don't understand it quite. Laura, come\nhere, dear; now attend to Doctor Spielsberg, and recollect yourself.\"\n\n\"You mentioned a sensation like that of two needles piercing the skin,\nsomewhere about your neck, on the night when you experienced your first\nhorrible dream. Is there still any soreness?\"\n\n\"None at all,\" I answered.\n\n\"Can you indicate with your finger about the point at which you think\nthis occurred?\"\n\n\"Very little below my throat--here,\" I answered.\n\nI wore a morning dress, which covered the place I pointed to.\n\n\"Now you can satisfy yourself,\" said the doctor. \"You won't mind your\npapa's lowering your dress a very little. It is necessary, to detect a\nsymptom of the complaint under which you have been suffering.\"\n\nI acquiesced. It was only an inch or two below the edge of my collar.\n\n\"God bless me!--so it is,\" exclaimed my father, growing pale.\n\n\"You see it now with your own eyes,\" said the doctor, with a gloomy\ntriumph.\n\n\"What is it?\" I exclaimed, beginning to be frightened.\n\n\"Nothing, my dear young lady, but a small blue spot, about the size of\nthe tip of your little finger; and now,\" he continued, turning to papa,\n\"the question is what is best to be done?\"\n\n\"Is there any danger?\" I urged, in great trepidation.\n\n\"I trust not, my dear,\" answered the doctor. \"I don't see why you should\nnot recover. I don't see why you should not begin immediately to get\nbetter. That is the point at which the sense of strangulation begins?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I answered.\n\n\"And--recollect as well as you can--the same point was a kind of center\nof that thrill which you described just now, like the current of a cold\nstream running against you?\"\n\n\"It may have been; I think it was.\"\n\n\"Ay, you see?\" he added, turning to my father. \"Shall I say a word to\nMadame?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" said my father.\n\nHe called Madame to him, and said:\n\n\"I find my young friend here far from well. It won't be of any great\nconsequence, I hope; but it will be necessary that some steps be taken,\nwhich I will explain by-and-by; but in the meantime, Madame, you will\nbe so good as not to let Miss Laura be alone for one moment. That is the\nonly direction I need give for the present. It is indispensable.\"\n\n\"We may rely upon your kindness, Madame, I know,\" added my father.\n\nMadame satisfied him eagerly.\n\n\"And you, dear Laura, I know you will observe the doctor's direction.\"\n\n\"I shall have to ask your opinion upon another patient, whose symptoms\nslightly resemble those of my daughter, that have just been detailed to\nyou--very much milder in degree, but I believe quite of the same sort.\nShe is a young lady--our guest; but as you say you will be passing this\nway again this evening, you can't do better than take your supper here,\nand you can then see her. She does not come down till the afternoon.\"\n\n\"I thank you,\" said the doctor. \"I shall be with you, then, at about\nseven this evening.\"\n\nAnd then they repeated their directions to me and to Madame, and with\nthis parting charge my father left us, and walked out with the doctor;\nand I saw them pacing together up and down between the road and the\nmoat, on the grassy platform in front of the castle, evidently absorbed\nin earnest conversation.\n\nThe doctor did not return. I saw him mount his horse there, take his\nleave, and ride away eastward through the forest.\n\nNearly at the same time I saw the man arrive from Dranfield with the\nletters, and dismount and hand the bag to my father.\n\nIn the meantime, Madame and I were both busy, lost in conjecture as to\nthe reasons of the singular and earnest direction which the doctor and\nmy father had concurred in imposing. Madame, as she afterwards told me,\nwas afraid the doctor apprehended a sudden seizure, and that, without\nprompt assistance, I might either lose my life in a fit, or at least be\nseriously hurt.\n\nThe interpretation did not strike me; and I fancied, perhaps luckily for\nmy nerves, that the arrangement was prescribed simply to secure a\ncompanion, who would prevent my taking too much exercise, or eating\nunripe fruit, or doing any of the fifty foolish things to which young\npeople are supposed to be prone.\n\nAbout half an hour after my father came in--he had a letter in his\nhand--and said:\n\n\"This letter had been delayed; it is from General Spielsdorf. He might\nhave been here yesterday, he may not come till tomorrow or he may be\nhere today.\"\n\nHe put the open letter into my hand; but he did not look pleased, as he\nused when a guest, especially one so much loved as the General,\nwas coming.\n\nOn the contrary, he looked as if he wished him at the bottom of the Red\nSea. There was plainly something on his mind which he did not choose\nto divulge.\n\n\"Papa, darling, will you tell me this?\" said I, suddenly laying my hand\non his arm, and looking, I am sure, imploringly in his face.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" he answered, smoothing my hair caressingly over my eyes.\n\n\"Does the doctor think me very ill?\"\n\n\"No, dear; he thinks, if right steps are taken, you will be quite well\nagain, at least, on the high road to a complete recovery, in a day or\ntwo,\" he answered, a little dryly. \"I wish our good friend, the General,\nhad chosen any other time; that is, I wish you had been perfectly well\nto receive him.\"\n\n\"But do tell me, papa,\" I insisted, \"what does he think is the matter\nwith me?\"\n\n\"Nothing; you must not plague me with questions,\" he answered, with more\nirritation than I ever remember him to have displayed before; and seeing\nthat I looked wounded, I suppose, he kissed me, and added, \"You shall\nknow all about it in a day or two; that is, all that I know. In the\nmeantime you are not to trouble your head about it.\"\n\nHe turned and left the room, but came back before I had done wondering\nand puzzling over the oddity of all this; it was merely to say that he\nwas going to Karnstein, and had ordered the carriage to be ready at\ntwelve, and that I and Madame should accompany him; he was going to see the\npriest who lived near those picturesque grounds, upon business, and as\nCarmilla had never seen them, she could follow, when she came down, with\nMademoiselle, who would bring materials for what you call a picnic,\nwhich might be laid for us in the ruined castle.\n\nAt twelve o'clock, accordingly, I was ready, and not long after, my\nfather, Madame and I set out upon our projected drive.\n\nPassing the drawbridge we turn to the right, and follow the road over\nthe steep Gothic bridge, westward, to reach the deserted village and\nruined castle of Karnstein.\n\nNo sylvan drive can be fancied prettier. The ground breaks into gentle\nhills and hollows, all clothed with beautiful wood, totally destitute of\nthe comparative formality which artificial planting and early culture\nand pruning impart.\n\nThe irregularities of the ground often lead the road out of its course,\nand cause it to wind beautifully round the sides of broken hollows and\nthe steeper sides of the hills, among varieties of ground almost\ninexhaustible.\n\nTurning one of these points, we suddenly encountered our old friend, the\nGeneral, riding towards us, attended by a mounted servant. His\nportmanteaus were following in a hired wagon, such as we term a cart.\n\nThe General dismounted as we pulled up, and, after the usual greetings,\nwas easily persuaded to accept the vacant seat in the carriage and send\nhis horse on with his servant to the schloss.\n\n\n\nX\n\n_Bereaved_\n\nIt was about ten months since we had last seen him: but that time had\nsufficed to make an alteration of years in his appearance. He had grown\nthinner; something of gloom and anxiety had taken the place of that\ncordial serenity which used to characterize his features. His dark blue\neyes, always penetrating, now gleamed with a sterner light from under\nhis shaggy grey eyebrows. It was not such a change as grief alone\nusually induces, and angrier passions seemed to have had their share in\nbringing it about.\n\nWe had not long resumed our drive, when the General began to talk, with\nhis usual soldierly directness, of the bereavement, as he termed it,\nwhich he had sustained in the death of his beloved niece and ward; and\nhe then broke out in a tone of intense bitterness and fury, inveighing\nagainst the \"hellish arts\" to which she had fallen a victim, and\nexpressing, with more exasperation than piety, his wonder that Heaven\nshould tolerate so monstrous an indulgence of the lusts and malignity\nof hell.\n\nMy father, who saw at once that something very extraordinary had\nbefallen, asked him, if not too painful to him, to detail the\ncircumstances which he thought justified the strong terms in which he\nexpressed himself.\n\n\"I should tell you all with pleasure,\" said the General, \"but you would\nnot believe me.\"\n\n\"Why should I not?\" he asked.\n\n\"Because,\" he answered testily, \"you believe in nothing but what\nconsists with your own prejudices and illusions. I remember when I was\nlike you, but I have learned better.\"\n\n\"Try me,\" said my father; \"I am not such a dogmatist as you suppose.\nBesides which, I very well know that you generally require proof for\nwhat you believe, and am, therefore, very strongly predisposed to\nrespect your conclusions.\"\n\n\"You are right in supposing that I have not been led lightly into a\nbelief in the marvelous--for what I have experienced is marvelous--and I\nhave been forced by extraordinary evidence to credit that which ran\ncounter, diametrically, to all my theories. I have been made the dupe of\na preternatural conspiracy.\"\n\nNotwithstanding his professions of confidence in the General's\npenetration, I saw my father, at this point, glance at the General,\nwith, as I thought, a marked suspicion of his sanity.\n\nThe General did not see it, luckily. He was looking gloomily and\ncuriously into the glades and vistas of the woods that were opening\nbefore us.\n\n\"You are going to the Ruins of Karnstein?\" he said. \"Yes, it is a lucky\ncoincidence; do you know I was going to ask you to bring me there to\ninspect them. I have a special object in exploring. There is a ruined\nchapel, ain't there, with a great many tombs of that extinct family?\"\n\n\"So there are--highly interesting,\" said my father. \"I hope you are\nthinking of claiming the title and estates?\"\n\nMy father said this gaily, but the General did not recollect the laugh,\nor even the smile, which courtesy exacts for a friend's joke; on the\ncontrary, he looked grave and even fierce, ruminating on a matter that\nstirred his anger and horror.\n\n\"Something very different,\" he said, gruffly. \"I mean to unearth some of\nthose fine people. I hope, by God's blessing, to accomplish a pious\nsacrilege here, which will relieve our earth of certain monsters, and\nenable honest people to sleep in their beds without being assailed by\nmurderers. I have strange things to tell you, my dear friend, such as I\nmyself would have scouted as incredible a few months since.\"\n\nMy father looked at him again, but this time not with a glance of\nsuspicion--with an eye, rather, of keen intelligence and alarm.\n\n\"The house of Karnstein,\" he said, \"has been long extinct: a hundred\nyears at least. My dear wife was maternally descended from the\nKarnsteins. But the name and title have long ceased to exist. The castle\nis a ruin; the very village is deserted; it is fifty years since the\nsmoke of a chimney was seen there; not a roof left.\"\n\n\"Quite true. I have heard a great deal about that since I last saw you;\na great deal that will astonish you. But I had better relate everything\nin the order in which it occurred,\" said the General. \"You saw my dear\nward--my child, I may call her. No creature could have been more\nbeautiful, and only three months ago none more blooming.\"\n\n\"Yes, poor thing! when I saw her last she certainly was quite lovely,\"\nsaid my father. \"I was grieved and shocked more than I can tell you, my\ndear friend; I knew what a blow it was to you.\"\n\nHe took the General's hand, and they exchanged a kind pressure. Tears\ngathered in the old soldier's eyes. He did not seek to conceal them.\nHe said:\n\n\"We have been very old friends; I knew you would feel for me, childless\nas I am. She had become an object of very near interest to me, and\nrepaid my care by an affection that cheered my home and made my life\nhappy. That is all gone. The years that remain to me on earth may not be\nvery long; but by God's mercy I hope to accomplish a service to mankind\nbefore I die, and to subserve the vengeance of Heaven upon the fiends\nwho have murdered my poor child in the spring of her hopes and beauty!\"\n\n\"You said, just now, that you intended relating everything as it\noccurred,\" said my father. \"Pray do; I assure you that it is not mere\ncuriosity that prompts me.\"\n\nBy this time we had reached the point at which the Drunstall road, by\nwhich the General had come, diverges from the road which we were\ntraveling to Karnstein.\n\n\"How far is it to the ruins?\" inquired the General, looking anxiously\nforward.\n\n\"About half a league,\" answered my father. \"Pray let us hear the story\nyou were so good as to promise.\"\n\n\n\nXI\n\n_The Story_\n\n\"With all my heart,\" said the General, with an effort; and after a short\npause in which to arrange his subject, he commenced one of the strangest\nnarratives I ever heard.\n\n\"My dear child was looking forward with great pleasure to the visit you\nhad been so good as to arrange for her to your charming daughter.\" Here\nhe made me a gallant but melancholy bow. \"In the meantime we had an\ninvitation to my old friend the Count Carlsfeld, whose schloss is about\nsix leagues to the other side of Karnstein. It was to attend the series\nof fetes which, you remember, were given by him in honor of his\nillustrious visitor, the Grand Duke Charles.\"\n\n\"Yes; and very splendid, I believe, they were,\" said my father.\n\n\"Princely! But then his hospitalities are quite regal. He has Aladdin's\nlamp. The night from which my sorrow dates was devoted to a magnificent\nmasquerade. The grounds were thrown open, the trees hung with \nlamps. There was such a display of fireworks as Paris itself had never\nwitnessed. And such music--music, you know, is my weakness--such\nravishing music! The finest instrumental band, perhaps, in the world,\nand the finest singers who could be collected from all the great operas\nin Europe. As you wandered through these fantastically illuminated\ngrounds, the moon-lighted chateau throwing a rosy light from its long\nrows of windows, you would suddenly hear these ravishing voices stealing\nfrom the silence of some grove, or rising from boats upon the lake. I\nfelt myself, as I looked and listened, carried back into the romance and\npoetry of my early youth.\n\n\"When the fireworks were ended, and the ball beginning, we returned to\nthe noble suite of rooms that were thrown open to the dancers. A masked\nball, you know, is a beautiful sight; but so brilliant a spectacle of\nthe kind I never saw before.\n\n\"It was a very aristocratic assembly. I was myself almost the only\n'nobody' present.\n\n\"My dear child was looking quite beautiful. She wore no mask. Her\nexcitement and delight added an unspeakable charm to her features,\nalways lovely. I remarked a young lady, dressed magnificently, but\nwearing a mask, who appeared to me to be observing my ward with\nextraordinary interest. I had seen her, earlier in the evening, in the\ngreat hall, and again, for a few minutes, walking near us, on the\nterrace under the castle windows, similarly employed. A lady, also\nmasked, richly and gravely dressed, and with a stately air, like a\nperson of rank, accompanied her as a chaperon.\n\n\"Had the young lady not worn a mask, I could, of course, have been much\nmore certain upon the question whether she was really watching my\npoor darling.\n\n\"I am now well assured that she was.\n\n\"We were now in one of the salons. My poor dear child had been dancing,\nand was resting a little in one of the chairs near the door; I was\nstanding near. The two ladies I have mentioned had approached and the\nyounger took the chair next my ward; while her companion stood beside\nme, and for a little time addressed herself, in a low tone, to\nher charge.\n\n\"Availing herself of the privilege of her mask, she turned to me, and in\nthe tone of an old friend, and calling me by my name, opened a\nconversation with me, which piqued my curiosity a good deal. She\nreferred to many scenes where she had met me--at Court, and at\ndistinguished houses. She alluded to little incidents which I had long\nceased to think of, but which, I found, had only lain in abeyance in my\nmemory, for they instantly started into life at her touch.\n\n\"I became more and more curious to ascertain who she was, every moment.\nShe parried my attempts to discover very adroitly and pleasantly. The\nknowledge she showed of many passages in my life seemed to me all but\nunaccountable; and she appeared to take a not unnatural pleasure in\nfoiling my curiosity, and in seeing me flounder in my eager perplexity,\nfrom one conjecture to another.\n\n\"In the meantime the young lady, whom her mother called by the odd name\nof Millarca, when she once or twice addressed her, had, with the same\nease and grace, got into conversation with my ward.\n\n\"She introduced herself by saying that her mother was a very old\nacquaintance of mine. She spoke of the agreeable audacity which a mask\nrendered practicable; she talked like a friend; she admired her dress,\nand insinuated very prettily her admiration of her beauty. She amused\nher with laughing criticisms upon the people who crowded the ballroom,\nand laughed at my poor child's fun. She was very witty and lively when\nshe pleased, and after a time they had grown very good friends, and the\nyoung stranger lowered her mask, displaying a remarkably beautiful face.\nI had never seen it before, neither had my dear child. But though it was\nnew to us, the features were so engaging, as well as lovely, that it\nwas impossible not to feel the attraction powerfully. My poor girl did\nso. I never saw anyone more taken with another at first sight, unless,\nindeed, it was the stranger herself, who seemed quite to have lost her\nheart to her.\n\n\"In the meantime, availing myself of the license of a masquerade, I put\nnot a few questions to the elder lady.\n\n\"'You have puzzled me utterly,' I said, laughing. 'Is that not enough?\nWon't you, now, consent to stand on equal terms, and do me the kindness\nto remove your mask?'\n\n\"'Can any request be more unreasonable?' she replied. 'Ask a lady to\nyield an advantage! Beside, how do you know you should recognize me?\nYears make changes.'\n\n\"'As you see,' I said, with a bow, and, I suppose, a rather melancholy\nlittle laugh.\n\n\"'As philosophers tell us,' she said; 'and how do you know that a sight\nof my face would help you?'\n\n\"'I should take chance for that,' I answered. 'It is vain trying to make\nyourself out an old woman; your figure betrays you.'\n\n\"'Years, nevertheless, have passed since I saw you, rather since you saw\nme, for that is what I am considering. Millarca, there, is my daughter;\nI cannot then be young, even in the opinion of people whom time has\ntaught to be indulgent, and I may not like to be compared with what you\nremember me. You have no mask to remove. You can offer me nothing in\nexchange.'\n\n\"'My petition is to your pity, to remove it.'\n\n\"'And mine to yours, to let it stay where it is,' she replied.\n\n\"'Well, then, at least you will tell me whether you are French or\nGerman; you speak both languages so perfectly.'\n\n\"'I don't think I shall tell you that, General; you intend a surprise,\nand are meditating the particular point of attack.'\n\n\"'At all events, you won't deny this,' I said, 'that being honored by\nyour permission to converse, I ought to know how to address you. Shall I\nsay Madame la Comtesse?'\n\n\"She laughed, and she would, no doubt, have met me with another\nevasion--if, indeed, I can treat any occurrence in an interview every\ncircumstance of which was prearranged, as I now believe, with the\nprofoundest cunning, as liable to be modified by accident.\n\n\"'As to that,' she began; but she was interrupted, almost as she opened\nher lips, by a gentleman, dressed in black, who looked particularly\nelegant and distinguished, with this drawback, that his face was the\nmost deadly pale I ever saw, except in death. He was in no\nmasquerade--in the plain evening dress of a gentleman; and he said,\nwithout a smile, but with a courtly and unusually low bow:--\n\n\"'Will Madame la Comtesse permit me to say a very few words which may\ninterest her?'\n\n\"The lady turned quickly to him, and touched her lip in token of\nsilence; she then said to me, 'Keep my place for me, General; I shall\nreturn when I have said a few words.'\n\n\"And with this injunction, playfully given, she walked a little aside\nwith the gentleman in black, and talked for some minutes, apparently\nvery earnestly. They then walked away slowly together in the crowd, and\nI lost them for some minutes.\n\n\"I spent the interval in cudgeling my brains for a conjecture as to the\nidentity of the lady who seemed to remember me so kindly, and I was\nthinking of turning about and joining in the conversation between my\npretty ward and the Countess's daughter, and trying whether, by the time\nshe returned, I might not have a surprise in store for her, by having\nher name, title, chateau, and estates at my fingers' ends. But at this\nmoment she returned, accompanied by the pale man in black, who said:\n\n\"'I shall return and inform Madame la Comtesse when her carriage is at\nthe door.'\n\n\"He withdrew with a bow.\"\n\n\n\nXII\n\n_A Petition_\n\n\"'Then we are to lose Madame la Comtesse, but I hope only for a few\nhours,' I said, with a low bow.\n\n\"'It may be that only, or it may be a few weeks. It was very unlucky his\nspeaking to me just now as he did. Do you now know me?'\n\n\"I assured her I did not.\n\n\"'You shall know me,' she said, 'but not at present. We are older and\nbetter friends than, perhaps, you suspect. I cannot yet declare myself.\nI shall in three weeks pass your beautiful schloss, about which I have\nbeen making enquiries. I shall then look in upon you for an hour or two,\nand renew a friendship which I never think of without a thousand\npleasant recollections. This moment a piece of news has reached me like\na thunderbolt. I must set out now, and travel by a devious route, nearly\na hundred miles, with all the dispatch I can possibly make. My\nperplexities multiply. I am only deterred by the compulsory reserve I\npractice as to my name from making a very singular request of you. My\npoor child has not quite recovered her strength. Her horse fell with\nher, at a hunt which she had ridden out to witness, her nerves have not\nyet recovered the shock, and our physician says that she must on no\naccount exert herself for some time to come. We came here, in\nconsequence, by very easy stages--hardly six leagues a day. I must now\ntravel day and night, on a mission of life and death--a mission the\ncritical and momentous nature of which I shall be able to explain to you\nwhen we meet, as I hope we shall, in a few weeks, without the necessity\nof any concealment.'\n\n\"She went on to make her petition, and it was in the tone of a person\nfrom whom such a request amounted to conferring, rather than seeking\na favor.\n\n\"This was only in manner, and, as it seemed, quite unconsciously. Than\nthe terms in which it was expressed, nothing could be more deprecatory.\nIt was simply that I would consent to take charge of her daughter during\nher absence.\n\n\"This was, all things considered, a strange, not to say, an audacious\nrequest. She in some sort disarmed me, by stating and admitting\neverything that could be urged against it, and throwing herself entirely\nupon my chivalry. At the same moment, by a fatality that seems to have\npredetermined all that happened, my poor child came to my side, and, in\nan undertone, besought me to invite her new friend, Millarca, to pay us\na visit. She had just been sounding her, and thought, if her mamma would\nallow her, she would like it extremely.\n\n\"At another time I should have told her to wait a little, until, at\nleast, we knew who they were. But I had not a moment to think in. The\ntwo ladies assailed me together, and I must confess the refined and\nbeautiful face of the young lady, about which there was something\nextremely engaging, as well as the elegance and fire of high birth,\ndetermined me; and, quite overpowered, I submitted, and undertook, too\neasily, the care of the young lady, whom her mother called Millarca.\n\n\"The Countess beckoned to her daughter, who listened with grave\nattention while she told her, in general terms, how suddenly and\nperemptorily she had been summoned, and also of the arrangement she had\nmade for her under my care, adding that I was one of her earliest and\nmost valued friends.\n\n\"I made, of course, such speeches as the case seemed to call for, and\nfound myself, on reflection, in a position which I did not half like.\n\n\"The gentleman in black returned, and very ceremoniously conducted the\nlady from the room.\n\n\"The demeanor of this gentleman was such as to impress me with the\nconviction that the Countess was a lady of very much more importance\nthan her modest title alone might have led me to assume.\n\n\"Her last charge to me was that no attempt was to be made to learn more\nabout her than I might have already guessed, until her return. Our\ndistinguished host, whose guest she was, knew her reasons.\n\n\"'But here,' she said, 'neither I nor my daughter could safely remain\nfor more than a day. I removed my mask imprudently for a moment, about\nan hour ago, and, too late, I fancied you saw me. So I resolved to seek\nan opportunity of talking a little to you. Had I found that you had seen\nme, I would have thrown myself on your high sense of honor to keep my\nsecret some weeks. As it is, I am satisfied that you did not see me; but\nif you now suspect, or, on reflection, should suspect, who I am, I\ncommit myself, in like manner, entirely to your honor. My daughter will\nobserve the same secrecy, and I well know that you will, from time to\ntime, remind her, lest she should thoughtlessly disclose it.'\n\n\"She whispered a few words to her daughter, kissed her hurriedly twice,\nand went away, accompanied by the pale gentleman in black, and\ndisappeared in the crowd.\n\n\"'In the next room,' said Millarca, 'there is a window that looks upon\nthe hall door. I should like to see the last of mamma, and to kiss my\nhand to her.'\n\n\"We assented, of course, and accompanied her to the window. We looked\nout, and saw a handsome old-fashioned carriage, with a troop of couriers\nand footmen. We saw the slim figure of the pale gentleman in black, as\nhe held a thick velvet cloak, and placed it about her shoulders and\nthrew the hood over her head. She nodded to him, and just touched his\nhand with hers. He bowed low repeatedly as the door closed, and the\ncarriage began to move.\n\n\"'She is gone,' said Millarca, with a sigh.\n\n\"'She is gone,' I repeated to myself, for the first time--in the hurried\nmoments that had elapsed since my consent--reflecting upon the folly\nof my act.\n\n\"'She did not look up,' said the young lady, plaintively.\n\n\"'The Countess had taken off her mask, perhaps, and did not care to show\nher face,' I said; 'and she could not know that you were in the window.'\n\n\"She sighed, and looked in my face. She was so beautiful that I\nrelented. I was sorry I had for a moment repented of my hospitality, and\nI determined to make her amends for the unavowed churlishness of my\nreception.\n\n\"The young lady, replacing her mask, joined my ward in persuading me to\nreturn to the grounds, where the concert was soon to be renewed. We did\nso, and walked up and down the terrace that lies under the\ncastle windows.\n\n\"Millarca became very intimate with us, and amused us with lively\ndescriptions and stories of most of the great people whom we saw upon\nthe terrace. I liked her more and more every minute. Her gossip without\nbeing ill-natured, was extremely diverting to me, who had been so long\nout of the great world. I thought what life she would give to our\nsometimes lonely evenings at home.\n\n\"This ball was not over until the morning sun had almost reached the\nhorizon. It pleased the Grand Duke to dance till then, so loyal people\ncould not go away, or think of bed.\n\n\"We had just got through a crowded saloon, when my ward asked me what\nhad become of Millarca. I thought she had been by her side, and she\nfancied she was by mine. The fact was, we had lost her.\n\n\"All my efforts to find her were vain. I feared that she had mistaken,\nin the confusion of a momentary separation from us, other people for her\nnew friends, and had, possibly, pursued and lost them in the extensive\ngrounds which were thrown open to us.\n\n\"Now, in its full force, I recognized a new folly in my having\nundertaken the charge of a young lady without so much as knowing her\nname; and fettered as I was by promises, of the reasons for imposing\nwhich I knew nothing, I could not even point my inquiries by saying that\nthe missing young lady was the daughter of the Countess who had taken\nher departure a few hours before.\n\n\"Morning broke. It was clear daylight before I gave up my search. It was\nnot till near two o'clock next day that we heard anything of my\nmissing charge.\n\n\"At about that time a servant knocked at my niece's door, to say that he\nhad been earnestly requested by a young lady, who appeared to be in\ngreat distress, to make out where she could find the General Baron\nSpielsdorf and the young lady his daughter, in whose charge she had been\nleft by her mother.\n\n\"There could be no doubt, notwithstanding the slight inaccuracy, that\nour young friend had turned up; and so she had. Would to heaven we\nhad lost her!\n\n\"She told my poor child a story to account for her having failed to\nrecover us for so long. Very late, she said, she had got to the\nhousekeeper's bedroom in despair of finding us, and had then fallen\ninto a deep sleep which, long as it was, had hardly sufficed to recruit\nher strength after the fatigues of the ball.\n\n\"That day Millarca came home with us. I was only too happy, after all,\nto have secured so charming a companion for my dear girl.\"\n\n\n\nXIII\n\n_The Woodman_\n\n\"There soon, however, appeared some drawbacks. In the first place,\nMillarca complained of extreme languor--the weakness that remained after\nher late illness--and she never emerged from her room till the afternoon\nwas pretty far advanced. In the next place, it was accidentally\ndiscovered, although she always locked her door on the inside, and never\ndisturbed the key from its place till she admitted the maid to assist at\nher toilet, that she was undoubtedly sometimes absent from her room in\nthe very early morning, and at various times later in the day, before\nshe wished it to be understood that she was stirring. She was repeatedly\nseen from the windows of the schloss, in the first faint grey of the\nmorning, walking through the trees, in an easterly direction, and\nlooking like a person in a trance. This convinced me that she walked in\nher sleep. But this hypothesis did not solve the puzzle. How did she\npass out from her room, leaving the door locked on the inside? How did\nshe escape from the house without unbarring door or window?\n\n\"In the midst of my perplexities, an anxiety of a far more urgent kind\npresented itself.\n\n\"My dear child began to lose her looks and health, and that in a manner\nso mysterious, and even horrible, that I became thoroughly frightened.\n\n\"She was at first visited by appalling dreams; then, as she fancied, by\na specter, sometimes resembling Millarca, sometimes in the shape of a\nbeast, indistinctly seen, walking round the foot of her bed, from\nside to side.\n\n\"Lastly came sensations. One, not unpleasant, but very peculiar, she\nsaid, resembled the flow of an icy stream against her breast. At a later\ntime, she felt something like a pair of large needles pierce her, a\nlittle below the throat, with a very sharp pain. A few nights after,\nfollowed a gradual and convulsive sense of strangulation; then came\nunconsciousness.\"\n\nI could hear distinctly every word the kind old General was saying,\nbecause by this time we were driving upon the short grass that spreads\non either side of the road as you approach the roofless village which\nhad not shown the smoke of a chimney for more than half a century.\n\nYou may guess how strangely I felt as I heard my own symptoms so exactly\ndescribed in those which had been experienced by the poor girl who, but\nfor the catastrophe which followed, would have been at that moment a\nvisitor at my father's chateau. You may suppose, also, how I felt as I\nheard him detail habits and mysterious peculiarities which were, in\nfact, those of our beautiful guest, Carmilla!\n\nA vista opened in the forest; we were on a sudden under the chimneys and\ngables of the ruined village, and the towers and battlements of the\ndismantled castle, round which gigantic trees are grouped, overhung us\nfrom a slight eminence.\n\nIn a frightened dream I got down from the carriage, and in silence, for\nwe had each abundant matter for thinking; we soon mounted the ascent,\nand were among the spacious chambers, winding stairs, and dark\ncorridors of the castle.\n\n\"And this was once the palatial residence of the Karnsteins!\" said the\nold General at length, as from a great window he looked out across the\nvillage, and saw the wide, undulating expanse of forest. \"It was a bad\nfamily, and here its bloodstained annals were written,\" he continued.\n\"It is hard that they should, after death, continue to plague the human\nrace with their atrocious lusts. That is the chapel of the Karnsteins,\ndown there.\"\n\nHe pointed down to the grey walls of the Gothic building partly visible\nthrough the foliage, a little way down the steep. \"And I hear the axe of\na woodman,\" he added, \"busy among the trees that surround it; he\npossibly may give us the information of which I am in search, and point\nout the grave of Mircalla, Countess of Karnstein. These rustics preserve\nthe local traditions of great families, whose stories die out among the\nrich and titled so soon as the families themselves become extinct.\"\n\n\"We have a portrait, at home, of Mircalla, the Countess Karnstein;\nshould you like to see it?\" asked my father.\n\n\"Time enough, dear friend,\" replied the General. \"I believe that I have\nseen the original; and one motive which has led me to you earlier than I\nat first intended, was to explore the chapel which we are now\napproaching.\"\n\n\"What! see the Countess Mircalla,\" exclaimed my father; \"why, she has\nbeen dead more than a century!\"\n\n\"Not so dead as you fancy, I am told,\" answered the General.\n\n\"I confess, General, you puzzle me utterly,\" replied my father, looking\nat him, I fancied, for a moment with a return of the suspicion I\ndetected before. But although there was anger and detestation, at times,\nin the old General's manner, there was nothing flighty.\n\n\"There remains to me,\" he said, as we passed under the heavy arch of\nthe Gothic church--for its dimensions would have justified its being so\nstyled--\"but one object which can interest me during the few years that\nremain to me on earth, and that is to wreak on her the vengeance which,\nI thank God, may still be accomplished by a mortal arm.\"\n\n\"What vengeance can you mean?\" asked my father, in increasing amazement.\n\n\"I mean, to decapitate the monster,\" he answered, with a fierce flush,\nand a stamp that echoed mournfully through the hollow ruin, and his\nclenched hand was at the same moment raised, as if it grasped the handle\nof an axe, while he shook it ferociously in the air.\n\n\"What?\" exclaimed my father, more than ever bewildered.\n\n\"To strike her head off.\"\n\n\"Cut her head off!\"\n\n\"Aye, with a hatchet, with a spade, or with anything that can cleave\nthrough her murderous throat. You shall hear,\" he answered, trembling\nwith rage. And hurrying forward he said:\n\n\"That beam will answer for a seat; your dear child is fatigued; let her\nbe seated, and I will, in a few sentences, close my dreadful story.\"\n\nThe squared block of wood, which lay on the grass-grown pavement of the\nchapel, formed a bench on which I was very glad to seat myself, and in\nthe meantime the General called to the woodman, who had been removing\nsome boughs which leaned upon the old walls; and, axe in hand, the hardy\nold fellow stood before us.\n\nHe could not tell us anything of these monuments; but there was an old\nman, he said, a ranger of this forest, at present sojourning in the\nhouse of the priest, about two miles away, who could point out every\nmonument of the old Karnstein family; and, for a trifle, he undertook\nto bring him back with him, if we would lend him one of our horses, in\nlittle more than half an hour.\n\n\"Have you been long employed about this forest?\" asked my father of the\nold man.\n\n\"I have been a woodman here,\" he answered in his patois, \"under the\nforester, all my days; so has my father before me, and so on, as many\ngenerations as I can count up. I could show you the very house in the\nvillage here, in which my ancestors lived.\"\n\n\"How came the village to be deserted?\" asked the General.\n\n\"It was troubled by revenants, sir; several were tracked to their\ngraves, there detected by the usual tests, and extinguished in the usual\nway, by decapitation, by the stake, and by burning; but not until many\nof the villagers were killed.\n\n\"But after all these proceedings according to law,\" he continued--\"so\nmany graves opened, and so many vampires deprived of their horrible\nanimation--the village was not relieved. But a Moravian nobleman, who\nhappened to be traveling this way, heard how matters were, and being\nskilled--as many people are in his country--in such affairs, he offered\nto deliver the village from its tormentor. He did so thus: There being a\nbright moon that night, he ascended, shortly after sunset, the towers of\nthe chapel here, from whence he could distinctly see the churchyard\nbeneath him; you can see it from that window. From this point he watched\nuntil he saw the vampire come out of his grave, and place near it the\nlinen clothes in which he had been folded, and then glide away towards\nthe village to plague its inhabitants.\n\n\"The stranger, having seen all this, came down from the steeple, took\nthe linen wrappings of the vampire, and carried them up to the top of\nthe tower, which he again mounted. When the vampire returned from his\nprowlings and missed his clothes, he cried furiously to the Moravian,\nwhom he saw at the summit of the tower, and who, in reply, beckoned him\nto ascend and take them. Whereupon the vampire, accepting his\ninvitation, began to climb the steeple, and so soon as he had reached\nthe battlements, the Moravian, with a stroke of his sword, clove his\nskull in twain, hurling him down to the churchyard, whither, descending\nby the winding stairs, the stranger followed and cut his head off, and\nnext day delivered it and the body to the villagers, who duly impaled\nand burnt them.\n\n\"This Moravian nobleman had authority from the then head of the family\nto remove the tomb of Mircalla, Countess Karnstein, which he did\neffectually, so that in a little while its site was quite forgotten.\"\n\n\"Can you point out where it stood?\" asked the General, eagerly.\n\nThe forester shook his head, and smiled.\n\n\"Not a soul living could tell you that now,\" he said; \"besides, they say\nher body was removed; but no one is sure of that either.\"\n\nHaving thus spoken, as time pressed, he dropped his axe and departed,\nleaving us to hear the remainder of the General's strange story.\n\n\n\nXIV\n\n_The Meeting_\n\n\"My beloved child,\" he resumed, \"was now growing rapidly worse. The\nphysician who attended her had failed to produce the slightest\nimpression on her disease, for such I then supposed it to be. He saw my\nalarm, and suggested a consultation. I called in an abler physician,\nfrom Gratz.\n\n\"Several days elapsed before he arrived. He was a good and pious, as well\nas a learned man. Having seen my poor ward together, they withdrew to my\nlibrary to confer and discuss. I, from the adjoining room, where I\nawaited their summons, heard these two gentlemen's voices raised in\nsomething sharper than a strictly philosophical discussion. I knocked at\nthe door and entered. I found the old physician from Gratz maintaining\nhis theory. His rival was combating it with undisguised ridicule,\naccompanied with bursts of laughter. This unseemly manifestation\nsubsided and the altercation ended on my entrance.\n\n\"'Sir,' said my first physician,'my learned brother seems to think that\nyou want a conjuror, and not a doctor.'\n\n\"'Pardon me,' said the old physician from Gratz, looking displeased, 'I\nshall state my own view of the case in my own way another time. I\ngrieve, Monsieur le General, that by my skill and science I can be of no\nuse. Before I go I shall do myself the honor to suggest something to\nyou.'\n\n\"He seemed thoughtful, and sat down at a table and began to write.\n\n\"Profoundly disappointed, I made my bow, and as I turned to go, the other\ndoctor pointed over his shoulder to his companion who was writing, and\nthen, with a shrug, significantly touched his forehead.\n\n\"This consultation, then, left me precisely where I was. I walked out\ninto the grounds, all but distracted. The doctor from Gratz, in ten or\nfifteen minutes, overtook me. He apologized for having followed me, but\nsaid that he could not conscientiously take his leave without a few\nwords more. He told me that he could not be mistaken; no natural disease\nexhibited the same symptoms; and that death was already very near. There\nremained, however, a day, or possibly two, of life. If the fatal seizure\nwere at once arrested, with great care and skill her strength might\npossibly return. But all hung now upon the confines of the irrevocable.\nOne more assault might extinguish the last spark of vitality which is,\nevery moment, ready to die.\n\n\"'And what is the nature of the seizure you speak of?' I entreated.\n\n\"'I have stated all fully in this note, which I place in your hands upon\nthe distinct condition that you send for the nearest clergyman, and open\nmy letter in his presence, and on no account read it till he is with\nyou; you would despise it else, and it is a matter of life and death.\nShould the priest fail you, then, indeed, you may read it.'\n\n\"He asked me, before taking his leave finally, whether I would wish to\nsee a man curiously learned upon the very subject, which, after I had\nread his letter, would probably interest me above all others, and he\nurged me earnestly to invite him to visit him there; and so took\nhis leave.\n\n\"The ecclesiastic was absent, and I read the letter by myself. At\nanother time, or in another case, it might have excited my ridicule. But\ninto what quackeries will not people rush for a last chance, where all\naccustomed means have failed, and the life of a beloved object is\nat stake?\n\n\"Nothing, you will say, could be more absurd than the learned man's\nletter.\n\n\"It was monstrous enough to have consigned him to a madhouse. He said\nthat the patient was suffering from the visits of a vampire! The\npunctures which she described as having occurred near the throat, were,\nhe insisted, the insertion of those two long, thin, and sharp teeth\nwhich, it is well known, are peculiar to vampires; and there could be no\ndoubt, he added, as to the well-defined presence of the small livid mark\nwhich all concurred in describing as that induced by the demon's lips,\nand every symptom described by the sufferer was in exact conformity with\nthose recorded in every case of a similar visitation.\n\n\"Being myself wholly skeptical as to the existence of any such portent\nas the vampire, the supernatural theory of the good doctor furnished, in\nmy opinion, but another instance of learning and intelligence oddly\nassociated with some one hallucination. I was so miserable, however,\nthat, rather\n\n### Summary:\n\n"}

man once I was,\n  And both my parents were of Lombardy,\n  And Mantuans by country both of them.\n\n'Sub Julio' was I born, though it was late,\n  And lived at Rome under the good Augustus,\n  During the time of false and lying gods.\n\nA poet was I, and I sang that just\n  Son of Anchises, who came forth from Troy,\n  After that Ilion the superb was burned.\n\nBut thou, why goest thou back to such annoyance?\n  Why climb'st thou not the Mount Delectable,\n  Which is the source and cause of every joy?\"\n\n\"Now, art thou that Virgilius and that fountain\n  Which spreads abroad so wide a river of speech?\"\n  I made response to him with bashful forehead.\n\n\"O, of the other poets honour and light,\n  Avail me the long study and great love\n  That have impelled me to explore thy volume!\n\nThou art my master, and my author thou,\n  Thou art alone the one from whom I took\n  The beautiful style that has done honour to me.\n\nBehold the beast, for which I have turned back;\n  Do thou protect me from her, famous Sage,\n  For she doth make my veins and pulses tremble.\"\n\n\"Thee it behoves to take another road,\"\n  Responded he, when he beheld me weeping,\n  \"If from this savage place thou wouldst escape;\n\nBecause this beast, at which thou criest out,\n  Suffers not any one to pass her way,\n  But so doth harass him, that she destroys him;\n\nAnd has a nature so malign and ruthless,\n  That never doth she glut her greedy will,\n  And after food is hungrier than before.\n\nMany the animals with whom she weds,\n  And more they shall be still, until the Greyhound\n  Comes, who shall make her perish in her pain.\n\nHe shall not feed on either earth or pelf,\n  But upon wisdom, and on love and virtue;\n  'Twixt Feltro and Feltro shall his nation be;\n\nOf that low Italy shall he be the saviour,\n  On whose account the maid Camilla died,\n  Euryalus, Turnus, Nisus, of their wounds;\n\nThrough every city shall he hunt her down,\n  Until he shall have driven her back to Hell,\n  There from whence envy first did let her loose.\n\nTherefore I think and judge it for thy best\n  Thou follow me, and I will be thy guide,\n  And lead thee hence through the eternal place,\n\nWhere thou shalt hear the desperate lamentations,\n  Shalt see the ancient spirits disconsolate,\n  Who cry out each one for the second death;\n\nAnd thou shalt see those who contented are\n  Within the fire, because they hope to come,\n  Whene'er it may be, to the blessed people;\n\nTo whom, then, if thou wishest to ascend,\n  A soul shall be for that than I more worthy;\n  With her at my departure I will leave thee;\n\nBecause that Emperor, who reigns above,\n  In that I was rebellious to his law,\n  Wills that through me none come into his city.\n\nHe governs everywhere, and there he reigns;\n  There is his city and his lofty throne;\n  O happy he whom thereto he elects!\"\n\nAnd I to him: \"Poet, I thee entreat,\n  By that same God whom thou didst never know,\n  So that I may escape this woe and worse,\n\nThou wouldst conduct me there where thou hast said,\n  That I may see the portal of Saint Peter,\n  And those thou makest so disconsolate.\"\n\nThen he moved on, and I behind him followed.\n\n\n\nInferno: Canto II\n\n\nDay was departing, and the embrowned air\n  Released the animals that are on earth\n  From their fatigues; and I the only one\n\nMade myself ready to sustain the war,\n  Both of the way and likewise of the woe,\n  Which memory that errs not shall retrace.\n\nO Muses, O high genius, now assist me!\n  O memory, that didst write down what I saw,\n  Here thy nobility shall be manifest!\n\nAnd I began: \"Poet, who guidest me,\n  Regard my manhood, if it be sufficient,\n  Ere to the arduous pass thou dost confide me.\n\nThou sayest, that of Silvius the parent,\n  While yet corruptible, unto the world\n  Immortal went, and was there bodily.\n\nBut if the adversary of all evil\n  Was courteous, thinking of the high effect\n  That issue would from him, and who, and what,\n\nTo men of intellect unmeet it seems not;\n  For he was of great Rome, and of her empire\n  In the empyreal heaven as father chosen;\n\nThe which and what, wishing to speak the truth,\n  Were stablished as the holy place, wherein\n  Sits the successor of the greatest Peter.\n\nUpon this journey, whence thou givest him vaunt,\n  Things did he hear, which the occasion were\n  Both of his victory and the papal mantle.\n\nThither went afterwards the Chosen Vessel,\n  To bring back comfort thence unto that Faith,\n  Which of salvation's way is the beginning.\n\nBut I, why thither come, or who concedes it?\n  I not Aeneas am, I am not Paul,\n  Nor I, nor others, think me worthy of it.\n\nTherefore, if I resign myself to come,\n  I fear the coming may be ill-advised;\n  Thou'rt wise, and knowest better than I speak.\"\n\nAnd as he is, who unwills what he willed,\n  And by new thoughts doth his intention change,\n  So that from his design he quite withdraws,\n\nSuch I became, upon that dark hillside,\n  Because, in thinking, I consumed the emprise,\n  Which was so very prompt in the beginning.\n\n\"If I have well thy language understood,\"\n  Replied that shade of the Magnanimous,\n  \"Thy soul attainted is with cowardice,\n\nWhich many times a man encumbers so,\n  It turns him back from honoured enterprise,\n  As false sight doth a beast, when he is shy.\n\nThat thou mayst free thee from this apprehension,\n  I'll tell thee why I came, and what I heard\n  At the first moment when I grieved for thee.\n\nAmong those was I who are in suspense,\n  And a fair, saintly Lady called to me\n  In such wise, I besought her to command me.\n\nHer eyes where shining brighter than the Star;\n  And she began to say, gentle and low,\n  With voice angelical, in her own language:\n\n'O spirit courteous of Mantua,\n  Of whom the fame still in the world endures,\n  And shall endure, long-lasting as the world;\n\nA friend of mine, and not the friend of fortune,\n  Upon the desert <DW72> is so impeded\n  Upon his way, that he has turned through terror,\n\nAnd may, I fear, already be so lost,\n  That I too late have risen to his succour,\n  From that which I have heard of him in Heaven.\n\nBestir thee now, and with thy speech ornate,\n  And with what needful is for his release,\n  Assist him so, that I may be consoled.\n\nBeatrice am I, who do bid thee go;\n  I come from there, where I would fain return;\n  Love moved me, which compelleth me to speak.\n\nWhen I shall be in presence of my Lord,\n  Full often will I praise thee unto him.'\n  Then paused she, and thereafter I began:\n\n'O Lady of virtue, thou alone through whom\n  The human race exceedeth all contained\n  Within the heaven that has the lesser circles,\n\nSo grateful unto me is thy commandment,\n  To obey, if 'twere already done, were late;\n  No farther need'st thou ope to me thy wish.\n\nBut the cause tell me why thou dost not shun\n  The here descending down into this centre,\n  From the vast place thou burnest to return to.'\n\n'Since thou wouldst fain so inwardly discern,\n  Briefly will I relate,' she answered me,\n  'Why I am not afraid to enter here.\n\nOf those things only should one be afraid\n  Which have the power of doing others harm;\n  Of the rest, no; because they are not fearful.\n\nGod in his mercy such created me\n  That misery of yours attains me not,\n  Nor any flame assails me of this burning.\n\nA gentle Lady is in Heaven, who grieves\n  At this impediment, to which I send thee,\n  So that stern judgment there above is broken.\n\nIn her entreaty she besought Lucia,\n  And said, \"Thy faithful one now stands in need\n  Of thee, and unto thee I recommend him.\"\n\nLucia, foe of all that cruel is,\n  Hastened away, and came unto the place\n  Where I was sitting with the ancient Rachel.\n\n\"Beatrice\" said she, \"the true praise of God,\n  Why succourest thou not him, who loved thee so,\n  For thee he issued from the vulgar herd?\n\nDost thou not hear the pity of his plaint?\n  Dost thou not see the death that combats him\n  Beside that flood, where ocean has no vaunt?\"\n\nNever were persons in the world so swift\n  To work their weal and to escape their woe,\n  As I, after such words as these were uttered,\n\nCame hither downward from my blessed seat,\n  Confiding in thy dignified discourse,\n  Which honours thee, and those who've listened to it.'\n\nAfter she thus had spoken unto me,\n  Weeping, her shining eyes she turned away;\n  Whereby she made me swifter in my coming;\n\nAnd unto thee I came, as she desired;\n  I have delivered thee from that wild beast,\n  Which barred the beautiful mountain's short ascent.\n\nWhat is it, then?  Why, why dost thou delay?\n  Why is such baseness bedded in thy heart?\n  Daring and hardihood why hast thou not,\n\nSeeing that three such Ladies benedight\n  Are caring for thee in the court of Heaven,\n  And so much good my speech doth promise thee?\"\n\nEven as the flowerets, by nocturnal chill,\n  Bowed down and closed, when the sun whitens them,\n  Uplift themselves all open on their stems;\n\nSuch I became with my exhausted strength,\n  And such good courage to my heart there coursed,\n  That I began, like an intrepid person:\n\n\"O she compassionate, who succoured me,\n  And courteous thou, who hast obeyed so soon\n  The words of truth which she addressed to thee!\n\nThou hast my heart so with desire disposed\n  To the adventure, with these words of thine,\n  That to my first intent I have returned.\n\nNow go, for one sole will is in us both,\n  Thou Leader, and thou Lord, and Master thou.\"\n  Thus said I to him; and when he had moved,\n\nI entered on the deep and savage way.\n\n\n\nInferno: Canto III\n\n\n\"Through me the way is to the city dolent;\n  Through me the way is to eternal dole;\n  Through me the way among the people lost.\n\nJustice incited my sublime Creator;\n  Created me divine Omnipotence,\n  The highest Wisdom and the primal Love.\n\nBefore me there were no created things,\n  Only eterne, and I eternal last.\n  All hope abandon, ye who enter in!\"\n\nThese words in sombre colour I beheld\n  Written upon the summit of a gate;\n  Whence I: \"Their sense is, Master, hard to me!\"\n\nAnd he to me, as one experienced:\n  \"Here all suspicion needs must be abandoned,\n  All cowardice must needs be here extinct.\n\nWe to the place have come, where I have told thee\n  Thou shalt behold the people dolorous\n  Who have foregone the good of intellect.\"\n\nAnd after he had laid his hand on mine\n  With joyful mien, whence I was comforted,\n  He led me in among the secret things.\n\nThere sighs, complaints, and ululations loud\n  Resounded through the air without a star,\n  Whence I, at the beginning, wept thereat.\n\nLanguages diverse, horrible dialects,\n  Accents of anger, words of agony,\n  And voices high and hoarse, with sound of hands,\n\nMade up a tumult that goes whirling on\n  For ever in that air for ever black,\n  Even as the sand doth, when the whirlwind breathes.\n\nAnd I, who had my head with horror bound,\n  Said: \"Master, what is this which now I hear?\n  What folk is this, which seems by pain so vanquished?\"\n\nAnd he to me: \"This miserable mode\n  Maintain the melancholy souls of those\n  Who lived withouten infamy or praise.\n\nCommingled are they with that caitiff choir\n  Of Angels, who have not rebellious been,\n  Nor faithful were to God, but were for self.\n\nThe heavens expelled them, not to be less fair;\n  Nor them the nethermore abyss receives,\n  For glory none the damned would have from them.\"\n\nAnd I: \"O Master, what so grievous is\n  To these, that maketh them lament so sore?\"\n  He answered: \"I will tell thee very briefly.\n\nThese have no longer any hope of death;\n  And this blind life of theirs is so debased,\n  They envious are of every other fate.\n\nNo fame of them the world permits to be;\n  Misericord and Justice both disdain them.\n  Let us not speak of them, but look, and pass.\"\n\nAnd I, who looked again, beheld a banner,\n  Which, whirling round, ran on so rapidly,\n  That of all pause it seemed to me indignant;\n\nAnd after it there came so long a train\n  Of people, that I ne'er would have believed\n  That ever Death so many had undone.\n\nWhen some among them I had recognised,\n  I looked, and I beheld the shade of him\n  Who made through cowardice the great refusal.\n\nForthwith I comprehended, and was certain,\n  That this the sect was of the caitiff wretches\n  Hateful to God and to his enemies.\n\nThese miscreants, who never were alive,\n  Were naked, and were stung exceedingly\n  By gadflies and by hornets that were there.\n\nThese did their faces irrigate with blood,\n  Which, with their tears commingled, at their feet\n  By the disgusting worms was gathered up.\n\nAnd when to gazing farther I betook me.\n  People I saw on a great river's bank;\n  Whence said I: \"Master, now vouchsafe to me,\n\nThat I may know who these are, and what law\n  Makes them appear so ready to pass over,\n  As I discern athwart the dusky light.\"\n\nAnd he to me: \"These things shall all be known\n  To thee, as soon as we our footsteps stay\n  Upon the dismal shore of Acheron.\"\n\nThen with mine eyes ashamed and downward cast,\n  Fearing my words might irksome be to him,\n  From speech refrained I till we reached the river.\n\nAnd lo! towards us coming in a boat\n  An old man, hoary with the hair of eld,\n  Crying: \"Woe unto you, ye souls depraved!\n\nHope nevermore to look upon the heavens;\n  I come to lead you to the other shore,\n  To the eternal shades in heat and frost.\n\nAnd thou, that yonder standest, living soul,\n  Withdraw thee from these people, who are dead!\"\n  But when he saw that I did not withdraw,\n\nHe said: \"By other ways, by other ports\n  Thou to the shore shalt come, not here, for passage;\n  A lighter vessel needs must carry thee.\"\n\nAnd unto him the Guide: \"Vex thee not, Charon;\n  It is so willed there where is power to do\n  That which is willed; and farther question not.\"\n\nThereat were quieted the fleecy cheeks\n  Of him the ferryman of the livid fen,\n  Who round about his eyes had wheels of flame.\n\nBut all those souls who weary were and naked\n  Their colour changed and gnashed their teeth together,\n  As soon as they had heard those cruel words.\n\nGod they blasphemed and their progenitors,\n  The human race, the place, the time, the seed\n  Of their engendering and of their birth!\n\nThereafter all together they drew back,\n  Bitterly weeping, to the accursed shore,\n  Which waiteth every man who fears not God.\n\nCharon the demon, with the eyes of glede,\n  Beckoning to them, collects them all together,\n  Beats with his oar whoever lags behind.\n\nAs in the autumn-time the leaves fall off,\n  First one and then another, till the branch\n  Unto the earth surrenders all its spoils;\n\nIn similar wise the evil seed of Adam\n  Throw themselves from that margin one by one,\n  At signals, as a bird unto its lure.\n\nSo they depart across the dusky wave,\n  And ere upon the other side they land,\n  Again on this side a new troop assembles.\n\n\"My son,\" the courteous Master said to me,\n  \"All those who perish in the wrath of God\n  Here meet together out of every land;\n\nAnd ready are they to pass o'er the river,\n  Because celestial Justice spurs them on,\n  So that their fear is turned into desire.\n\nThis way there never passes a good soul;\n  And hence if Charon doth complain of thee,\n  Well mayst thou know now what his speech imports.\"\n\nThis being finished, all the dusk champaign\n  Trembled so violently, that of that terror\n  The recollection bathes me still with sweat.\n\nThe land of tears gave forth a blast of wind,\n  And fulminated a vermilion light,\n  Which overmastered in me every sense,\n\nAnd as a man whom sleep hath seized I fell.\n\n\n\nInferno: Canto IV\n\n\nBroke the deep lethargy within my head\n  A heavy thunder, so that I upstarted,\n  Like to a person who by force is wakened;\n\nAnd round about I moved my rested eyes,\n  Uprisen erect, and steadfastly I gazed,\n  To recognise the place wherein I was.\n\nTrue is it, that upon the verge I found me\n  Of the abysmal valley dolorous,\n  That gathers thunder of infinite ululations.\n\nObscure, profound it was, and nebulous,\n  So that by fixing on its depths my sight\n  Nothing whatever I discerned therein.\n\n\"Let us descend now into the blind world,\"\n  Began the Poet, pallid utterly;\n  \"I will be first, and thou shalt second be.\"\n\nAnd I, who of his colour was aware,\n  Said: \"How shall I come, if thou art afraid,\n  Who'rt wont to be a comfort to my fears?\"\n\nAnd he to me: \"The anguish of the people\n  Who are below here in my face depicts\n  That pity which for terror thou hast taken.\n\nLet us go on, for the long way impels us.\"\n  Thus he went in, and thus he made me enter\n  The foremost circle that surrounds the abyss.\n\nThere, as it seemed to me from listening,\n  Were lamentations none, but only sighs,\n  That tremble made the everlasting air.\n\nAnd this arose from sorrow without torment,\n  Which the crowds had, that many were and great,\n  Of infants and of women and of men.\n\nTo me the Master good: \"Thou dost not ask\n  What spirits these, which thou beholdest, are?\n  Now will I have thee know, ere thou go farther,\n\nThat they sinned not; and if they merit had,\n  'Tis not enough, because they had not baptism\n  Which is the portal of the Faith thou holdest;\n\nAnd if they were before Christianity,\n  In the right manner they adored not God;\n  And among such as these am I myself.\n\nFor such defects, and not for other guilt,\n  Lost are we and are only so far punished,\n  That without hope we live on in desire.\"\n\nGreat grief seized on my heart when this I heard,\n  Because some people of much worthiness\n  I knew, who in that Limbo were suspended.\n\n\"Tell me, my Master, tell me, thou my Lord,\"\n  Began I, with desire of being certain\n  Of that Faith which o'ercometh every error,\n\n\"Came any one by his own merit hence,\n  Or by another's, who was blessed thereafter?\"\n  And he, who understood my covert speech,\n\nReplied: \"I was a novice in this state,\n  When I saw hither come a Mighty One,\n  With sign of victory incoronate.\n\nHence he drew forth the shade of the First Parent,\n  And that of his son Abel, and of Noah,\n  Of Moses the lawgiver, and the obedient\n\nAbraham, patriarch, and David, king,\n  Israel with his father and his children,\n  And Rachel, for whose sake he did so much,\n\nAnd others many, and he made them blessed;\n  And thou must know, that earlier than these\n  Never were any human spirits saved.\"\n\nWe ceased not to advance because he spake,\n  But still were passing onward through the forest,\n  The forest, say I, of thick-crowded ghosts.\n\nNot very far as yet our way had gone\n  This side the summit, when I saw a fire\n  That overcame a hemisphere of darkness.\n\nWe were a little distant from it still,\n  But not so far that I in part discerned not\n  That honourable people held that place.\n\n\"O thou who honourest every art and science,\n  Who may these be, which such great honour have,\n  That from the fashion of the rest it parts them?\"\n\nAnd he to me: \"The honourable name,\n  That sounds of them above there in thy life,\n  Wins grace in Heaven, that so advances them.\"\n\nIn the mean time a voice was heard by me:\n  \"All honour be to the pre-eminent Poet;\n  His shade returns again, that was departed.\"\n\nAfter the voice had ceased and quiet was,\n  Four mighty shades I saw approaching us;\n  Semblance had they nor sorrowful nor glad.\n\nTo say to me began my gracious Master:\n  \"Him with that falchion in his hand behold,\n  Who comes before the three, even as their lord.\n\nThat one is Homer, Poet sovereign;\n  He who comes next is Horace, the satirist;\n  The third is Ovid, and the last is Lucan.\n\nBecause to each of these with me applies\n  The name that solitary voice proclaimed,\n  They do me honour, and in that do well.\"\n\nThus I beheld assemble the fair school\n  Of that lord of the song pre-eminent,\n  Who o'er the others like an eagle soars.\n\nWhen they together had discoursed somewhat,\n  They turned to me with signs of salutation,\n  And on beholding this, my Master smiled;\n\nAnd more of honour still, much more, they did me,\n  In that they made me one of their own band;\n  So that the sixth was I,'mid so much wit.\n\nThus we went on as far as to the light,\n  Things saying 'tis becoming to keep silent,\n  As was the saying of them where I was.\n\nWe came unto a noble castle's foot,\n  Seven times encompassed with lofty walls,\n  Defended round by a fair rivulet;\n\nThis we passed over even as firm ground;\n  Through portals seven I entered with these Sages;\n  We came into a meadow of fresh verdure.\n\nPeople were there with solemn eyes and slow,\n  Of great authority in their countenance;\n  They spake but seldom, and with gentle voices.\n\nThus we withdrew ourselves upon one side\n  Into an opening luminous and lofty,\n  So that they all of them were visible.\n\nThere opposite, upon the green enamel,\n  Were pointed out to me the mighty spirits,\n  Whom to have seen I feel myself exalted.\n\nI saw Electra with companions many,\n  'Mongst whom I knew both Hector and Aeneas,\n  Caesar in armour with gerfalcon eyes;\n\nI saw Camilla and Penthesilea\n  On the other side, and saw the King Latinus,\n  Who with Lavinia his daughter sat;\n\nI saw that Brutus who drove Tarquin forth,\n  Lucretia, Julia, Marcia, and Cornelia,\n  And saw alone, apart, the Saladin.\n\nWhen I had lifted up my brows a little,\n  The Master I beheld of those who know,\n  Sit with his philosophic family.\n\nAll gaze upon him, and all do him honour.\n  There I beheld both Socrates and Plato,\n  Who nearer him before the others stand;\n\nDemocritus, who puts the world on chance,\n  Diogenes, Anaxagoras, and Thales,\n  Zeno, Empedocles, and Heraclitus;\n\nOf qualities I saw the good collector,\n  Hight Dioscorides; and Orpheus saw I,\n  Tully and Livy, and moral Seneca,\n\nEuclid, geometrician, and Ptolemy,\n  Galen, Hippocrates, and Avicenna,\n  Averroes, who the great Comment made.\n\nI cannot all of them pourtray in full,\n  Because so drives me onward the long theme,\n  That many times the word comes short of fact.\n\nThe sixfold company in two divides;\n  Another way my sapient Guide conducts me\n  Forth from the quiet to the air that trembles;\n\nAnd to a place I come where nothing shines.\n\n\n\nInferno: Canto V\n\n\nThus I descended out of the first circle\n  Down to the second, that less space begirds,\n  And so much greater dole, that goads to wailing.\n\nThere standeth Minos horribly, and snarls;\n  Examines the transgressions at the entrance;\n  Judges, and sends according as he girds him.\n\nI say, that when the spirit evil-born\n  Cometh before him, wholly it confesses;\n  And this discriminator of transgressions\n\nSeeth what place in Hell is meet for it;\n  Girds himself with his tail as many times\n  As grades he wishes it should be thrust down.\n\nAlways before him many of them stand;\n  They go by turns each one unto the judgment;\n  They speak, and hear, and then are downward hurled.\n\n\"O thou, that to this dolorous hostelry\n  Comest,\" said Minos to me, when he saw me,\n  Leaving the practice of so great an office,\n\n\"Look how thou enterest, and in whom thou trustest;\n  Let not the portal's amplitude deceive thee.\"\n  And unto him my Guide: \"Why criest thou too?\n\nDo not impede his journey fate-ordained;\n  It is so willed there where is power to do\n  That which is willed; and ask no further question.\"\n\nAnd now begin the dolesome notes to grow\n  Audible unto me; now am I come\n  There where much lamentation strikes upon me.\n\nI came into a place mute of all light,\n  Which bellows as the sea does in a tempest,\n  If by opposing winds 't is combated.\n\nThe infernal hurricane that never rests\n  Hurtles the spirits onward in its rapine;\n  Whirling them round, and smiting, it molests them.\n\nWhen they arrive before the precipice,\n  There are the shrieks, the plaints, and the laments,\n  There they blaspheme the puissance divine.\n\nI understood that unto such a torment\n  The carnal malefactors were condemned,\n  Who reason subjugate to appetite.\n\nAnd as the wings of starlings bear them on\n  In the cold season in large band and full,\n  So doth that blast the spirits maledict;\n\nIt hither, thither, downward, upward, drives them;\n  No hope doth comfort them for evermore,\n  Not of repose, but even of lesser pain.\n\nAnd as the cranes go chanting forth their lays,\n  Making in air a long line of themselves,\n  So saw I coming, uttering lamentations,\n\nShadows borne onward by the aforesaid stress.\n  Whereupon said I: \"Master, who are those\n  People, whom the black air so castigates?\"\n\n\"The first of those, of whom intelligence\n  Thou fain wouldst have,\" then said he unto me,\n  \"The empress was of many languages.\n\nTo sensual vices she was so abandoned,\n  That lustful she made licit in her law,\n  To remove the blame to which she had been led.\n\nShe is Semiramis, of whom we read\n  That she succeeded Ninus, and was his spouse;\n  She held the land which now the Sultan rules.\n\nThe next is she who killed herself for love,\n  And broke faith with the ashes of Sichaeus;\n  Then Cleopatra the voluptuous.\"\n\nHelen I saw, for whom so many ruthless\n  Seasons revolved; and saw the great Achilles,\n  Who at the last hour combated with Love.\n\nParis I saw, Tristan; and more than a thousand\n  Shades did he name and point out with his finger,\n  Whom Love had separated from our life.\n\nAfter that I had listened to my Teacher,\n  Naming the dames of eld and cavaliers,\n  Pity prevailed, and I was nigh bewildered.\n\nAnd I began: \"O Poet, willingly\n  Speak would I to those two, who go together,\n  And seem upon the wind to be so light.\"\n\nAnd, he to me: \"Thou'lt mark, when they shall be\n  Nearer to us; and then do thou implore them\n  By love which leadeth them, and they will come.\"\n\nSoon as the wind in our direction sways them,\n  My voice uplift I: \"O ye weary souls!\n  Come speak to us, if no one interdicts it.\"\n\nAs turtle-doves, called onward by desire,\n  With open and steady wings to the sweet nest\n  Fly through the air by their volition borne,\n\nSo came they from the band where Dido is,\n  Approaching us athwart the air malign,\n  So strong was the affectionate appeal.\n\n\"O living creature gracious and benignant,\n  Who visiting goest through the purple air\n  Us, who have stained the world incarnadine,\n\nIf were the King of the Universe our friend,\n  We would pray unto him to give thee peace,\n  Since thou hast pity on our woe perverse.\n\nOf what it pleases thee to hear and speak,\n  That will we hear, and we will speak to you,\n  While silent is the wind, as it is now.\n\nSitteth the city, wherein I was born,\n  Upon the sea-shore where the Po descends\n  To rest in peace with all his retinue.\n\nLove, that on gentle heart doth swiftly seize,\n  Seized this man for the person beautiful\n  That was ta'en from me, and still the mode offends me.\n\nLove, that exempts no one beloved from loving,\n  Seized me with pleasure of this man so strongly,\n  That, as thou seest, it doth not yet desert me;\n\nLove has conducted us unto one death;\n  Caina waiteth him who quenched our life!\"\n  These words were borne along from them to us.\n\nAs soon as I had heard those souls tormented,\n  I bowed my face, and so long held it down\n  Until the Poet said to me: \"What thinkest?\"\n\nWhen I made answer, I began: \"Alas!\n  How many pleasant thoughts, how much desire,\n  Conducted these unto the dolorous pass!\"\n\nThen unto them I turned me, and I spake,\n  And I began: \"Thine agonies, Francesca,\n  Sad and compassionate to weeping make me.\n\nBut tell me, at the time of those sweet sighs,\n  By what and in what manner Love conceded,\n  That you should know your dubious desires?\"\n\nAnd she to me: \"There is no greater sorrow\n  Than to be mindful of the happy time\n  In misery, and that thy Teacher knows.\n\nBut, if to recognise the earliest root\n  Of love in us thou hast so great desire,\n  I will do even as he who weeps and speaks.\n\nOne day we reading were for our delight\n  Of Launcelot, how Love did him enthral.\n  Alone we were and without any fear.\n\nFull many a time our eyes together drew\n  That reading, and drove the colour from our faces;\n  But one point only was it that o'ercame us.\n\nWhen as we read of the much-longed-for smile\n  Being by such a noble lover kissed,\n  This one, who ne'er from me shall be divided,\n\nKissed me upon the mouth all palpitating.\n  Galeotto was the book and he who wrote it.\n  That day no farther did we read therein.\"\n\nAnd all the while one spirit uttered this,\n  The other one did weep so, that, for pity,\n  I swooned away as if I had been dying,\n\nAnd fell, even as a dead body falls.\n\n\n\nInferno: Canto VI\n\n\nAt the return of consciousness, that closed\n  Before the pity of those two relations,\n  Which utterly with sadness had confused me,\n\nNew torments I behold, and new tormented\n  Around me, whichsoever way I move,\n  And whichsoever way I turn, and gaze.\n\nIn the third circle am I of the rain\n  Eternal, maledict, and cold, and heavy;\n  Its law and quality are never new.\n\nHuge hail, and water sombre-hued, and snow,\n  Athwart the tenebrous air pour down amain;\n  Noisome the earth is, that receiveth this.\n\nCerberus, monster cruel and uncouth,\n  With his three gullets like a dog is barking\n  Over the people that are there submerged.\n\nRed eyes he has, and unctuous beard and black,\n  And belly large, and armed with claws his hands;\n  He rends the spirits, flays, and quarters them.\n\nHowl the rain maketh them like unto dogs;\n  One side they make a shelter for the other;\n  Oft turn themselves the wretched reprobates.\n\nWhen Cerberus perceived us, the great worm!\n   His mouths he opened, and displayed his tusks;\n   Not a limb had he that was motionless.\n\nAnd my Conductor, with his spans extended,\n  Took of the earth, and with his fists well filled,\n  He threw it into those rapacious gullets.\n\nSuch as that dog is, who by barking craves,\n  And quiet grows soon as his food he gnaws,\n  For to devour it he but thinks and struggles,\n\nThe like became those muzzles filth-begrimed\n  Of Cerberus the demon, who so thunders\n  Over the souls that they would fain be deaf.\n\nWe passed across the shadows, which subdues\n  The heavy rain-storm, and we placed our feet\n  Upon their vanity that person seems.\n\nThey all were lying prone upon the earth,\n  Excepting one, who sat upright as soon\n  As he beheld us passing on before him.\n\n\"O thou that art conducted through this Hell,\"\n  He said to me, \"recall me, if thou canst;\n  Thyself wast made before I was unmade.\"\n\nAnd I to him: \"The anguish which thou hast\n  Perhaps doth draw thee out of my remembrance,\n  So that it seems not I have ever seen thee.\n\nBut tell me who thou art, that in so doleful\n  A place art put, and in such punishment,\n  If some are greater, none is so displeasing.\"\n\nAnd he to me: \"Thy city, which is full\n  Of envy so that now the sack runs over,\n  Held me within it in the life serene.\n\nYou citizens were wont to call me Ciacco;\n  For the pernicious sin of gluttony\n  I, as thou seest, am battered by this rain.\n\nAnd I, sad soul, am not the only one,\n  For all these suffer the like penalty\n  For the like sin;\" and word no more spake he.\n\nI answered him: \"Ciacco, thy wretchedness\n  Weighs on me so that it to weep invites me;\n  But tell me, if thou knowest, to what shall come\n\nThe citizens of the divided city;\n  If any there be just; and the occasion\n  Tell me why so much discord has assailed it.\"\n\nAnd he to me: \"They, after long contention,\n  Will come to bloodshed; and the rustic party\n  Will drive the other out with much offence.\n\nThen afterwards behoves it this one fall\n  Within three suns, and rise again the other\n  By force of him who now is on the coast.\n\nHigh will it hold its forehead a long while,\n  Keeping the other under heavy burdens,\n  Howe'er it weeps thereat and is indignant.\n\nThe just are two, and are not understood there;\n  Envy and Arrogance and Avarice\n  Are the three sparks that have all hearts enkindled.\"\n\nHere ended he his tearful utterance;\n  And I to him: \"I wish thee still to teach me,\n  And make a gift to me of further speech.\n\nFarinata and Tegghiaio, once so worthy,\n  Jacopo Rusticucci, Arrigo, and Mosca,\n  And others who on good deeds set their thoughts,\n\nSay where they are, and cause that I may know them;\n  For great desire constraineth me to learn\n  If Heaven doth sweeten them, or Hell envenom.\"\n\nAnd he: \"They are among the blacker souls;\n  A different sin downweighs them to the bottom;\n  If thou so far descendest, thou canst see them.\n\nBut when thou art again in the sweet world,\n  I pray thee to the mind of others bring me;\n  No more I tell thee and no more I answer.\"\n\nThen his straightforward eyes he turned askance,\n  Eyed me a little, and then bowed his head;\n  He fell therewith prone like the other blind.\n\nAnd the Guide said to me: \"He wakes no more\n  This side the sound of the angelic trumpet;\n  When shall approach the hostile Potentate,\n\nEach one shall find again his dismal tomb,\n  Shall reassume his flesh and his own figure,\n  Shall hear what through eternity re-echoes.\"\n\nSo we passed onward o'er the filthy mixture\n  Of shadows and of rain with footsteps slow,\n  Touching a little on the future life.\n\nWherefore I said: \"Master, these torments here,\n  Will they increase after the mighty sentence,\n  Or lesser be, or will they be as burning?\"\n\nAnd he to me: \"Return unto thy science,\n  Which wills, that as the thing more perfect is,\n  The more it feels of pleasure and of pain.\n\nAlbeit that this people maledict\n  To true perfection never can attain,\n  Hereafter more than now they look to be.\"\n\nRound in a circle by that road we went,\n  Speaking much more, which I do not repeat;\n  We came unto the point where the descent is;\n\nThere we found Plutus the great enemy.\n\n\n\nInferno: Canto VII\n\n\n\"Pape Satan, Pape Satan, Aleppe!\"\n  Thus Plutus with his clucking voice began;\n  And that benignant Sage, who all things knew,\n\nSaid, to encourage me: \"Let not thy fear\n  Harm thee; for any power that he may have\n  Shall not prevent thy going down this crag.\"\n\nThen he turned round unto that bloated lip,\n  And said: \"Be silent, thou accursed wolf;\n  Consume within thyself with thine own rage.\n\nNot causeless is this journey to the abyss;\n  Thus is it willed on high, where Michael wrought\n  Vengeance upon the proud adultery.\"\n\nEven as the sails inflated by the wind\n  Involved together fall when snaps the mast,\n  So fell the cruel monster to the earth.\n\nThus we descended into the fourth chasm,\n  Gaining still farther on the dolesome shore\n  Which all the woe of the universe insacks.\n\nJustice of God, ah! who heaps up so many\n  New toils and sufferings as I beheld?\n  And why doth our transgression waste us so?\n\nAs doth the billow there upon Charybdis,\n  That breaks itself on that which it encounters,\n  So here the folk must dance their roundelay.\n\nHere saw I people, more than elsewhere, many,\n  On one side and the other, with great howls,\n  Rolling weights forward by main force of chest.\n\nThey clashed together, and then at that point\n  Each one turned backward, rolling retrograde,\n  Crying, \"Why keepest?\" and, \"Why squanderest thou?\"\n\nThus they returned along the lurid circle\n  On either hand unto the opposite point,\n  Shouting their shameful metre evermore.\n\nThen each, when he arrived there, wheeled about\n  Through his half-circle to another joust;\n  And I, who had my heart pierced as it were,\n\nExclaimed: \"My Master, now declare to me\n  What people these are, and if all were clerks,\n  These shaven crowns upon the left of us.\"\n\nAnd he to me: \"All of them were asquint\n  In intellect in the first life, so much\n  That there with measure they no spending made.\n\nClearly enough their voices bark it forth,\n  Whene'er they reach the two points of the circle,\n  Where sunders them the opposite defect.\n\nClerks those were who no hairy covering\n  Have on the head, and Popes and Cardinals,\n  In whom doth Avarice practise its excess.\"\n\nAnd I: \"My Master, among such as these\n  I ought forsooth to recognise some few,\n  Who were infected with these maladies.\"\n\nAnd he to me: \"Vain thought thou entertainest;\n  The undiscerning life which made them sordid\n  Now makes them unto all discernment dim.\n\nForever shall they come to these two buttings;\n  These from the sepulchre shall rise again\n  With the fist closed, and these with tresses shorn.\n\nIll giving and ill keeping the fair world\n  Have ta'en from them, and placed them in this scuffle;\n  Whate'er it be, no words adorn I for it.\n\nNow canst thou, Son, behold the transient farce\n  Of goods that are committed unto Fortune,\n  For which the human race each other buffet;\n\nFor all the gold that is beneath the moon,\n  Or ever has been, of these weary souls\n  Could never make a single one repose.\"\n\n\"Master,\" I said to him, \"now tell me also\n  What is this Fortune which thou speakest of,\n  That has the world's goods so within its clutches?\"\n\nAnd he to me: \"O creatures imbecile,\n  What ignorance is this which doth beset you?\n  Now will I have thee learn my judgment of her.\n\nHe whose omniscience everything transcends\n  The heavens created, and gave who should guide them,\n  That every part to every part may shine,\n\nDistributing the light in equal measure;\n  He in like manner to the mundane splendours\n  Ordained a general ministress and guide,\n\nThat she might change at times the empty treasures\n  From race to race, from one blood to another,\n  Beyond resistance of all human wisdom.\n\nTherefore one people triumphs, and another\n  Languishes, in pursuance of her judgment,\n  Which hidden is, as in the grass a serpent.\n\nYour knowledge has no counterstand against her;\n  She makes provision, judges, and pursues\n  Her governance, as theirs the other gods.\n\nHer permutations have not any truce;\n  Necessity makes her precipitate,\n  So often cometh who his turn obtains.\n\nAnd this is she who is so crucified\n  Even by those who ought to give her praise,\n  Giving her blame amiss, and bad repute.\n\nBut she is blissful, and she hears it not;\n  Among the other primal creatures gladsome\n  She turns her sphere, and blissful she rejoices.\n\nLet us descend now unto greater woe;\n  Already sinks each star that was ascending\n  When I set out, and loitering is forbidden.\"\n\nWe crossed the circle to the other bank,\n  Near to a fount that boils, and pours itself\n  Along a gully that runs out of it.\n\nThe water was more sombre far than perse;\n  And we, in company with the dusky waves,\n  Made entrance downward by a path uncouth.\n\nA marsh it makes, which has the name of Styx,\n  This tristful brooklet, when it has descended\n  Down to the foot of the malign gray shores.\n\nAnd I, who stood intent upon beholding,\n  Saw people mud-besprent in that lagoon,\n  All of them naked and with angry look.\n\nThey smote each other not alone with hands,\n  But with the head and with the breast and feet,\n  Tearing each other piecemeal with their teeth.\n\nSaid the good Master: \"Son, thou now beholdest\n  The souls of those whom anger overcame;\n  And likewise I would have thee know for certain\n\nBeneath the water people are who sigh\n  And make this water bubble at the surface,\n  As the eye tells thee wheresoe'er it turns.\n\nFixed in the mire they say, 'We sullen were\n  In the sweet air, which by the sun is gladdened,\n  Bearing within ourselves the sluggish reek;\n\nNow we are sullen in this sable mire.'\n  This hymn do they keep gurgling in their throats,\n  For with unbroken words they cannot say it.\"\n\nThus we went circling round the filthy fen\n  A great arc 'twixt the dry bank and the swamp,\n  With eyes turned unto those who gorge the mire;\n\nUnto the foot of a tower we came at last.\n\n\n\nInferno: Canto VIII\n\n\nI say, continuing, that long before\n  We to the foot of that high tower had come,\n  Our eyes went upward to the summit of it,\n\nBy reason of two flamelets we saw placed there,\n  And from afar another answer them,\n  So far, that hardly could the eye attain it.\n\nAnd, to the sea of all discernment turned,\n  I said: \"What sayeth this, and what respondeth\n  That other fire? and who are they that made it?\"\n\nAnd he to me: \"Across the turbid waves\n  What is expected thou canst now discern,\n  If reek of the morass conceal it not.\"\n\nCord never shot an arrow from itself\n  That sped away athwart the air so swift,\n  As I beheld a very little boat\n\nCome o'er the water tow'rds us at that moment,\n  Under the guidance of a single pilot,\n  Who shouted, \"Now art thou arrived, fell soul?\"\n\n\"Phlegyas, Phlegyas, thou criest out in vain\n  For this once,\" said my Lord; \"thou shalt not have us\n  Longer than in the passing of the slough.\"\n\nAs he who listens to some great deceit\n  That has been done to him, and then resents it,\n  Such became Phlegyas, in his gathered wrath.\n\nMy Guide descended down into the boat,\n  And then he made me enter after him,\n  And only when I entered seemed it laden.\n\nSoon as the Guide and I were in the boat,\n  The antique prow goes on its way, dividing\n  More of the water than 'tis wont with others.\n\nWhile we were running through the dead canal,\n  Uprose in front of me one full of mire,\n  And said, \"Who 'rt thou that comest ere the hour?\"\n\nAnd I to him: \"Although I come, I stay not;\n  But who art thou that hast become so squalid?\"\n  \"Thou seest that I am one who weeps,\" he answered.\n\nAnd I to him: \"With weeping and with wailing,\n  Thou spirit maledict, do thou remain;\n  For thee I know, though thou art all defiled.\"\n\nThen stretched he both his hands unto the boat;\n  Whereat my wary Master thrust him back,\n  Saying, \"Away there with the other dogs!\"\n\nThereafter with his arms he clasped my neck;\n  He kissed my face, and said: \"Disdainful soul,\n  Blessed be she who bore thee in her bosom.\n\nThat was an arrogant person in the world;\n  Goodness is none, that decks his memory;\n  So likewise here his shade is furious.\n\nHow many are esteemed great kings up there,\n  Who here shall be like unto swine in mire,\n  Leaving behind them horrible dispraises!\"\n\nAnd I: \"My Master, much should I be pleased,\n  If I could see him soused into this broth,\n  Before we issue forth out of the lake.\"\n\nAnd he to me: \"Ere unto thee the shore\n  Reveal itself, thou shalt be satisfied;\n  Such a desire 'tis meet thou shouldst enjoy.\"\n\nA little after that, I saw such havoc\n  Made of him by the people of the mire,\n  That still I praise and thank my God for it.\n\nThey all were shouting, \"At Philippo Argenti!\"\n  And that exasperate spirit Florentine\n  Turned round upon himself with his own teeth.\n\nWe left him there, and more of him I tell not;\n  But on mine ears there smote a lamentation,\n  Whence forward I intent unbar mine eyes.\n\nAnd the good Master said: \"Even now, my Son,\n  The city draweth near whose name is Dis,\n  With the grave citizens, with the great throng.\"\n\nAnd I: \"Its mosques already, Master, clearly\n  Within there in the valley I discern\n  Vermilion, as if issuing from the fire\n\nThey were.\"  And he to me: \"The fire eternal\n  That kindles them within makes them look red,\n  As thou beholdest in this nether Hell.\"\n\nThen we arrived within the moats profound,\n  That circumvallate that disconsolate city;\n  The walls appeared to me to be of iron.\n\nNot without making first a circuit wide,\n  We came unto a place where loud the pilot\n  Cried out to us, \"Debark, here is the entrance.\"\n\nMore than a thousand at the gates I saw\n  Out of the Heavens rained down, who angrily\n  Were saying, \"Who is this that without death\n\nGoes through the kingdom of the people dead?\"\n  And my sagacious Master made a sign\n  Of wishing secretly to speak with them.\n\nA little then they quelled their great disdain,\n  And said: \"Come thou alone, and he begone\n  Who has so boldly entered these dominions.\n\nLet him return alone by his mad road;\n  Try, if he can; for thou shalt here remain,\n  Who hast escorted him through such dark regions.\"\n\nThink, Reader, if I was discomforted\n  At utterance of the accursed words;\n  For never to return here I believed.\n\n\"O my dear Guide, who more than seven times\n  Hast rendered me security, and drawn me\n  From imminent peril that before me stood,\n\nDo not desert me,\" said I, \"thus undone;\n  And if the going farther be denied us,\n  Let us retrace our steps together swiftly.\"\n\nAnd that Lord, who had led me thitherward,\n  Said unto me: \"Fear not; because our passage\n  None can take from us, it by Such is given.\n\nBut here await me, and thy weary spirit\n  Comfort and nourish with a better hope;\n  For in this nether world I will not leave thee.\"\n\nSo onward goes and there abandons me\n  My Father sweet, and I remain in doubt,\n  For No and Yes within my head contend.\n\nI could not hear what he proposed to them;\n  But with them there he did not linger long,\n  Ere each within in rivalry ran back.\n\nThey closed the portals, those our adversaries,\n  On my Lord's breast, who had remained without\n  And turned to me with footsteps far between.\n\nHis eyes cast down, his forehead shorn had he\n  Of all its boldness, and he said, with sighs,\n  \"Who has denied to me the dolesome houses?\"\n\nAnd unto me: \"Thou, because I am angry,\n  Fear not, for I will conquer in the trial,\n  Whatever for defence within be planned.\n\nThis arrogance of theirs is nothing new;\n  For once they used it at less secret gate,\n  Which finds itself without a fastening still.\n\nO'er it didst thou behold the dead inscription;\n  And now this side of it descends the steep,\n  Passing across the circles without escort,\n\nOne by whose means the city shall be opened.\"\n\n\n\nInferno: Canto IX\n\n\nThat hue which cowardice brought out on me,\n  Beholding my Conductor backward turn,\n  Sooner repressed within him his new colour.\n\nHe stopped attentive, like a man who listens,\n  Because the eye could not conduct him far\n  Through the black air, and through the heavy fog.\n\n\"Still it behoveth us to win the fight,\"\n  Began he; \"Else...Such offered us herself...\n  O how I long that some one here arrive!\"\n\nWell I perceived, as soon as the beginning\n  He covered up with what came afterward,\n  That they were words quite different from the first;\n\nBut none the less his saying gave me fear,\n  Because I carried out the broken phrase,\n  Perhaps to a worse meaning than he had.\n\n\"Into this bottom of the doleful conch\n  Doth any e'er descend from the first grade,\n  Which for its pain has only hope cut off?\"\n\nThis question put I; and he answered me:\n  \"Seldom it comes to pass that one of us\n  Maketh the journey upon which I go.\n\nTrue is it, once before I here below\n  Was conjured by that pitiless Erictho,\n  Who summoned back the shades unto their bodies.\n\nNaked of me short while the flesh had been,\n  Before within that wall she made me enter,\n  To bring a spirit from the circle of Judas;\n\nThat is the lowest region and the darkest,\n  And farthest from the heaven which circles all.\n  Well know I the way; therefore be reassured.\n\nThis fen, which a prodigious stench exhales,\n  Encompasses about the city dolent,\n  Where now we cannot enter without anger.\"\n\nAnd more he said, but not in mind I have it;\n  Because mine eye had altogether drawn me\n  Tow'rds the high tower with the red-flaming summit,\n\nWhere in a moment saw I swift uprisen\n  The three infernal Furies stained with blood,\n  Who had the limbs of women and their mien,\n\nAnd with the greenest hydras were begirt;\n  Small serpents and cerastes were their tresses,\n  Wherewith their horrid temples were entwined.\n\nAnd he who well the handmaids of the Queen\n  Of everlasting lamentation knew,\n  Said unto me: \"Behold the fierce Erinnys.\n\nThis is Megaera, on the left-hand side;\n  She who is weeping on the right, Alecto;\n  Tisiphone is between;\" and then was silent.\n\nEach one her breast was rending with her nails;\n  They beat them with their palms, and cried so loud,\n  That I for dread pressed close unto the Poet.\n\n\"Medusa come, so we to stone will change him!\"\n  All shouted looking down; \"in evil hour\n  Avenged we not on Theseus his assault!\"\n\n\"Turn thyself round, and keep thine eyes close shut,\n  For if the Gorgon appear, and thou shouldst see it,\n  No more returning upward would there be.\"\n\nThus said the Master; and he turned me round\n  Himself, and trusted not unto my hands\n  So far as not to blind me with his own.\n\nO ye who have undistempered intellects,\n  Observe the doctrine that conceals itself\n  Beneath the veil of the mysterious verses!\n\nAnd now there came across the turbid waves\n  The clangour of a sound with terror fraught,\n  Because of which both of the margins trembled;\n\nNot otherwise it was than of a wind\n  Impetuous on account of adverse heats,\n  That smites the forest, and, without restraint,\n\nThe branches rends, beats down, and bears away;\n  Right onward, laden with dust, it goes superb,\n  And puts to flight the wild beasts and the shepherds.\n\nMine eyes he loosed, and said: \"Direct the nerve\n  Of vision now along that ancient foam,\n  There yonder where that smoke is most intense.\"\n\nEven as the frogs before the hostile serpent\n  Across the water scatter all abroad,\n  Until each one is huddled in the earth.\n\nMore than a thousand ruined souls I saw,\n  Thus fleeing from before one who on foot\n  Was passing o'er the Styx with soles unwet.\n\nFrom off his face he fanned that unctuous air,\n  Waving his left hand oft in front of him,\n  And only with that anguish seemed he weary.\n\nWell I perceived one sent from Heaven was he,\n  And to the Master turned; and he made sign\n  That I should quiet stand, and bow before him.\n\nAh! how disdainful he appeared to me!\n  He reached the gate, and with a little rod\n  He opened it, for there was no resistance.\n\n\"O banished out of Heaven, people despised!\"\n  Thus he began upon the horrid threshold;\n  \"Whence is this arrogance within you couched?\n\nWherefore recalcitrate against that will,\n  From which the end can never be cut off,\n  And which has many times increased your pain?\n\nWhat helpeth it to butt against the fates?\n  Your Cerberus, if you remember well,\n  For that still bears his chin and gullet peeled.\"\n\nThen he returned along the miry road,\n  And spake no word to us, but had the look\n  Of one whom other care constrains and goads\n\nThan that of him who in his presence is;\n  And we our feet directed tow'rds the city,\n  After those holy words all confident.\n\nWithin we entered without any contest;\n  And I, who inclination had to see\n  What the condition such a fortress holds,\n\nSoon as I was within, cast round mine eye,\n  And see on every hand an ample plain,\n  Full of distress and torment terrible.\n\nEven as at Arles, where stagnant grows the Rhone,\n  Even as at Pola near to the Quarnaro,\n  That shuts in Italy and bathes its borders,\n\nThe sepulchres make all the place uneven;\n  So likewise did they there on every side,\n  Saving that there the manner was more bitter;\n\nFor flames between the sepulchres were scattered,\n  By which they so intensely heated were,\n  That iron more so asks not any art.\n\nAll of their coverings uplifted were,\n  And from them issued forth such dire laments,\n  Sooth seemed they of the wretched and tormented.\n\nAnd I: \"My Master, what are all those people\n  Who, having sepulture within those tombs,\n  Make themselves audible by doleful sighs?\"\n\nAnd he to me: \"Here are the Heresiarchs,\n  With their disciples of all sects, and much\n  More than thou thinkest laden are the tombs.\n\nHere like together with its like is buried;\n  And more and less the monuments are heated.\"\n  And when he to the right had turned, we passed\n\nBetween the torments and high parapets.\n\n\n\nInferno: Canto X\n\n\nNow onward goes, along a narrow path\n  Between the torments and the city wall,\n  My Master, and I follow at his back.\n\n\"O power supreme, that through these impious circles\n  Turnest me,\" I began, \"as pleases thee,\n  Speak to me, and my longings satisfy;\n\nThe people who are lying in these tombs,\n  Might they be seen? already are uplifted\n  The covers all, and no one keepeth guard.\"\n\nAnd he to me: \"They all will be closed up\n  When from Jehoshaphat they shall return\n  Here with the bodies they have left above.\n\nTheir cemetery have upon this side\n  With Epicurus all his followers,\n  Who with the body mortal make the soul;\n\nBut in the question thou dost put to me,\n  Within here shalt thou soon be satisfied,\n  And likewise in the wish thou keepest silent.\"\n\nAnd I: \"Good Leader, I but keep concealed\n  From thee my heart, that I may speak the less,\n  Nor only now hast thou thereto disposed me.\"\n\n\"O Tuscan, thou who through the city of fire\n  Goest alive, thus speaking modestly,\n  Be pleased to stay thy footsteps in this place.\n\nThy mode of speaking makes thee manifest\n  A native of that noble fatherland,\n  To which perhaps I too molestful was.\"\n\nUpon a sudden issued forth this sound\n  From out one of the tombs; wherefore I pressed,\n  Fearing, a little nearer to my Leader.\n\nAnd unto me he said: \"Turn thee; what dost thou?\n  Behold there Farinata who has risen;\n  From the waist upwards wholly shalt thou see him.\"\n\nI had already fixed mine eyes on his,\n  And he uprose erect with breast and front\n  E'en as if Hell he had in great despite.\n\nAnd with courageous hands and prompt my Leader\n  Thrust me between the sepulchres towards him,\n  Exclaiming, \"Let thy words explicit be.\"\n\nAs soon as I was at the foot of his tomb\n  Somewhat he eyed me, and, as if disdainful,\n  Then asked of me, \"Who were thine ancestors?\"\n\nI, who desirous of obeying was,\n  Concealed it not, but all revealed to him;\n  Whereat he raised his brows a little upward.\n\nThen said he: \"Fiercely adverse have they been\n  To me, and to my fathers, and my party;\n  So that two several times I scattered them.\"\n\n\"If they were banished, they returned on all sides,\"\n  I answered him, \"the first time and the second;\n  But yours have not acquired that art aright.\"\n\nThen there uprose upon the sight, uncovered\n  Down to the chin, a shadow at his side;\n  I think that he had risen on his knees.\n\nRound me he gazed, as if solicitude\n  He had to see if some one else were with me,\n  But after his suspicion was all spent,\n\nWeeping, he said to me: \"If through this blind\n  Prison thou goest by loftiness of genius,\n  Where is my son? and why is he not with thee?\"\n\nAnd I to him: \"I come not of myself;\n  He who is waiting yonder leads me here,\n  Whom in disdain perhaps your Guido had.\"\n\nHis language and the mode of punishment\n  Already unto me had read his name;\n  On that account my answer was so full.\n\nUp starting suddenly, he cried out: \"How\n  Saidst thou,--he had?  Is he not still alive?\n  Does not the sweet light strike upon his eyes?\"\n\nWhen he became aware of some delay,\n  Which I before my answer made, supine\n  He fell again, and forth appeared no more.\n\nBut the other, magnanimous, at whose desire\n  I had remained, did not his aspect change,\n  Neither his neck he moved, nor bent his side.\n\n\"And if,\" continuing his first discourse,\n  \"They have that art,\" he said, \"not learned aright,\n  That more tormenteth me, than doth this bed.\n\nBut fifty times shall not rekindled be\n  The countenance of the Lady who reigns here,\n  Ere thou shalt know how heavy is that art;\n\nAnd as thou wouldst to the sweet world return,\n  Say why that people is so pitiless\n  Against my race in each one of its laws?\"\n\nWhence I to him: \"The slaughter and great carnage\n  Which have with crimson stained the Arbia, cause\n  Such orisons in our temple to be made.\"\n\nAfter his head he with a sigh had shaken,\n  \"There I was not alone,\" he said, \"nor surely\n  Without a cause had with the others moved.\n\nBut there I was alone, where every one\n  Consented to the laying waste of Florence,\n  He who defended her with open face.\"\n\n\"Ah! so hereafter may your seed repose,\"\n  I him entreated, \"solve for me that knot,\n  Which has entangled my conceptions here.\n\nIt seems that you can see, if I hear rightly,\n  Beforehand whatsoe'er time brings with it,\n  And in the present have another mode.\"\n\n\"We see, like those who have imperfect sight,\n  The things,\" he said, \"that distant are from us;\n  So much still shines on us the Sovereign Ruler.\n\nWhen they draw near, or are, is wholly vain\n  Our intellect, and if none brings it to us,\n  Not anything know we of your human state.\n\nHence thou canst understand, that wholly dead\n  Will be our knowledge from the moment when\n  The portal of the future shall be closed.\"\n\nThen I, as if compunctious for my fault,\n  Said: \"Now, then, you will tell that fallen one,\n  That still his son is with the living joined.\n\nAnd if just now, in answering, I was dumb,\n  Tell him I did it because I was thinking\n  Already of the error you have solved me.\"\n\nAnd now my Master was recalling me,\n  Wherefore more eagerly I prayed the spirit\n  That he would tell me who was with him there.\n\nHe said: \"With more than a thousand here I lie;\n  Within here is the second Frederick,\n  And the Cardinal, and of the rest I speak not.\"\n\nThereon he hid himself; and I towards\n  The ancient poet turned my steps, reflecting\n  Upon that saying, which seemed hostile to me.\n\nHe moved along; and afterward thus going,\n  He said to me, \"Why art thou so bewildered?\"\n  And I in his inquiry satisfied him.\n\n\"Let memory preserve what thou hast heard\n  Against thyself,\" that Sage commanded me,\n  \"And now attend here;\" and he raised his finger.\n\n\"When thou shalt be before the radiance sweet\n  Of her whose beauteous eyes all things behold,\n  From her thou'lt know the journey of thy life.\"\n\nUnto the left hand then he turned his feet;\n  We left the wall, and went towards the middle,\n  Along a path that strikes into a valley,\n\nWhich even up there unpleasant made its stench.\n\n\n\nInferno: Canto XI\n\n\nUpon the margin of a lofty bank\n  Which great rocks broken in a circle made,\n  We came upon a still more cruel throng;\n\nAnd there, by reason of the horrible\n  Excess of stench the deep abyss throws out,\n  We drew ourselves aside behind the cover\n\nOf a great tomb, whereon I saw a writing,\n  Which said: \"Pope Anastasius I hold,\n  Whom out of the right way Photinus drew.\"\n\n\"Slow it behoveth our descent to be,\n  So that the sense be first a little used\n  To the sad blast, and then we shall not heed it.\"\n\nThe Master thus; and unto him I said,\n  \"Some compensation find, that the time pass not\n  Idly;\" and he: \"Thou seest I think of that.\n\nMy son, upon the inside of these rocks,\"\n  Began he then to say, \"are three small circles,\n  From grade to grade, like those which thou art leaving.\n\nThey all are full of spirits maledict;\n  But that hereafter sight alone suffice thee,\n  Hear how and wherefore they are in constraint.\n\nOf every malice that wins hate in Heaven,\n  Injury is the end; and all such end\n  Either by force or fraud afflicteth others.\n\nBut because fraud is man's peculiar vice,\n  More it displeases God; and so stand lowest\n  The fraudulent, and greater dole assails them.\n\nAll the first circle of the Violent is;\n  But since force may be used against three persons,\n  In three rounds 'tis divided and constructed.\n\nTo God, to ourselves, and to our neighbour can we\n  Use force; I say on them and on their things,\n  As thou shalt hear with reason manifest.\n\nA death by violence, and painful wounds,\n  Are to our neighbour given; and in his substance\n  Ruin, and arson, and injurious levies;\n\nWhence homicides, and he who smites unjustly,\n  Marauders, and freebooters, the first round\n  Tormenteth all in companies diverse.\n\nMan may lay violent hands upon himself\n  And his own goods; and therefore in the second\n  Round must perforce without avail repent\n\nWhoever of your world deprives himself,\n  Who games, and dissipates his property,\n  And weepeth there, where he should jocund be.\n\nViolence can be done the Deity,\n  In heart denying and blaspheming Him,\n  And by disdaining Nature and her bounty.\n\nAnd for this reason doth the smallest round\n  Seal with its signet Sodom and Cahors,\n  And who, disdaining God, speaks from the heart.\n\nFraud, wherewithal is every conscience stung,\n  A man may practise upon him who trusts,\n  And him who doth no confidence imburse.\n\nThis latter mode, it would appear, dissevers\n  Only the bond of love which Nature makes;\n  Wherefore within the second circle nestle\n\nHypocrisy, flattery, and who deals in magic,\n  Falsification, theft, and simony,\n  Panders, and barrators, and the like filth.\n\nBy the other mode, forgotten is that love\n  Which Nature makes, and what is after added,\n  From which there is a special faith engendered.\n\nHence in the smallest circle, where the point is\n  Of the Universe, upon which Dis is seated,\n  Whoe'er betrays for ever is consumed.\"\n\nAnd I: \"My Master, clear enough proceeds\n  Thy reasoning, and full well distinguishes\n  This cavern and the people who possess it.\n\nBut tell me, those within the fat lagoon,\n  Whom the wind drives, and whom the rain doth beat,\n  And who encounter with such bitter tongues,\n\nWherefore are they inside of the red city\n  Not punished, if God has them in his wrath,\n  And if he has not, wherefore in such fashion?\"\n\nAnd unto me he said: \"Why wanders so\n  Thine intellect from that which it is wont?\n  Or, sooth, thy mind where is it elsewhere looking?\n\nHast thou no recollection of those words\n  With which thine Ethics thoroughly discusses\n  The dispositions three, that Heaven abides not,--\n\nIncontinence, and Malice, and insane\n  Bestiality? and how Incontinence\n  Less God offendeth, and less blame attracts?\n\nIf thou regardest this conclusion well,\n  And to thy mind recallest who they are\n  That up outside are undergoing penance,\n\nClearly wilt thou perceive why from these felons\n  They separated are, and why less wroth\n  Justice divine doth smite them with its hammer.\"\n\n\"O Sun, that healest all distempered vision,\n  Thou dost content me so, when thou resolvest,\n  That doubting pleases me no less than knowing!\n\nOnce more a little backward turn thee,\" said I,\n  \"There where thou sayest that usury offends\n  Goodness divine, and disengage the knot.\"\n\n\"Philosophy,\" he said, \"to him who heeds it,\n  Noteth, not only in one place alone,\n  After what manner Nature takes her course\n\nFrom Intellect Divine, and from its art;\n  And if thy Physics carefully thou notest,\n  After not many pages shalt thou find,\n\nThat this your art as far as possible\n  Follows, as the disciple doth the master;\n  So that your art is, as it were, God's grandchild.\n\nFrom these two, if thou bringest to thy mind\n  Genesis at the beginning, it behoves\n  Mankind to gain their life and to advance;\n\nAnd since the usurer takes another way,\n  Nature herself and in her follower\n  Disdains he, for elsewhere he puts his hope.\n\nBut follow, now, as I would fain go on,\n  For quivering are the Fishes on the horizon,\n  And the Wain wholly over Caurus lies,\n\nAnd far beyond there we descend the crag.\"\n\n\n\nInferno: Canto XII\n\n\nThe place where to descend the bank we came\n  Was alpine, and from what was there, moreover,\n  Of such a kind that every eye would shun it.\n\nSuch as that ruin is which in the flank\n  Smote, on this side of Trent, the Adige,\n  Either by earthquake or by failing stay,\n\nFor from the mountain's top, from which it moved,\n  Unto the plain the cliff is shattered so,\n  Some path 'twould give to him who was above;\n\nEven such was the descent of that ravine,\n  And on the border of the broken chasm\n  The infamy of Crete was stretched along,\n\nWho was conceived in the fictitious cow;\n  And when he us beheld, he bit himself,\n  Even as one whom anger racks within.\n\nMy Sage towards him shouted: \"Peradventure\n  Thou think'st that here may be the Duke of Athens,\n  Who in the world above brought death to thee?\n\nGet thee gone, beast, for this one cometh not\n  Instructed by thy sister, but he comes\n  In order to behold your punishments.\"\n\nAs is that bull who breaks loose at the moment\n  In which he has received the mortal blow,\n  Who cannot walk, but staggers here and there,\n\nThe Minotaur beheld I do the like;\n  And he, the wary, cried: \"Run to the passage;\n  While he wroth, 'tis well thou shouldst descend.\"\n\nThus down we took our way o'er that discharge\n  Of stones, which oftentimes did move themselves\n  Beneath my feet, from the unwonted burden.\n\nThoughtful I went; and he said: \"Thou art thinking\n  Perhaps upon this ruin, which is guarded\n  By that brute anger which just now I quenched.\n\nNow will I have thee know, the other time\n  I here descended to the nether Hell,\n  This precipice had not yet fallen down.\n\nBut truly, if I well discern, a little\n  Before His coming who the mighty spoil\n  Bore off from Dis, in the supernal circle,\n\nUpon all sides the deep and loathsome valley\n  Trembled so, that I thought the Universe\n  Was thrilled with love, by which there are who think\n\nThe world ofttimes converted into chaos;\n  And at that moment this primeval crag\n  Both here and elsewhere made such overthrow.\n\nBut fix thine eyes below; for draweth near\n  The river of blood, within which boiling is\n  Whoe'er by violence doth injure others.\"\n\nO blind cupidity, O wrath insane,\n  That spurs us onward so in our short life,\n  And in the eternal then so badly steeps us!\n\nI saw an ample moat bent like a bow,\n  As one which all the plain encompasses,\n  Conformable to what my Guide had said.\n\nAnd between this and the embankment's foot\n  Centaurs in file were running, armed with arrows,\n  As in the world they used the chase to follow.\n\nBeholding us descend, each one stood still,\n  And from the squadron three detached themselves,\n  With bows and arrows in advance selected;\n\nAnd from afar one cried: \"Unto what torment\n  Come ye, who down the hillside are descending?\n  Tell us from there; if not, I draw the bow.\"\n\nMy Master said: \"Our answer will we make\n  To Chiron, near you there; in evil hour,\n  That will of thine was evermore so hasty.\"\n\nThen touched he me, and said: \"This one is Nessus,\n  Who perished for the lovely Dejanira,\n  And for himself, himself did vengeance take.\n\nAnd he in the midst, who at his breast is gazing,\n  Is the great Chiron, who brought up Achilles;\n  That other Pholus is, who was so wrathful.\n\nThousands and thousands go about the moat\n  Shooting with shafts whatever soul emerges\n  Out of the blood, more than his crime allots.\"\n\nNear we approached unto those monsters fleet;\n  Chiron an arrow took, and with the notch\n  Backward upon his jaws he put his beard.\n\nAfter he had uncovered his great mouth,\n  He said to his companions: \"Are you ware\n  That he behind moveth whate'er he touches?\n\nThus are not wont to do the feet of dead men.\"\n  And my good Guide, who now was at his breast,\n  Where the two natures are together joined,\n\nReplied: \"Indeed he lives, and thus alone\n  Me it behoves to show him the dark valley;\n  Necessity, and not delight, impels us.\n\nSome one withdrew from singing Halleluja,\n  Who unto me committed this new office;\n  No thief is he, nor I a thievish spirit.\n\nBut by that virtue through which I am moving\n  My steps along this savage thoroughfare,\n  Give us some one of thine, to be with us,\n\nAnd who may show us where to pass the ford,\n  And who may carry this one on his back;\n  For 'tis no spirit that can walk the air.\"\n\nUpon his right breast Chiron wheeled about,\n  And said to Nessus: \"Turn and do thou guide them,\n  And warn aside, if other band may meet you.\"\n\nWe with our faithful escort onward moved\n  Along the brink of the vermilion boiling,\n  Wherein the boiled were uttering loud laments.\n\nPeople I saw within up to the eyebrows,\n  And the great Centaur said: \"Tyrants are these,\n  Who dealt in bloodshed and in pillaging.\n\nHere they lament their pitiless mischiefs; here\n  Is Alexander, and fierce Dionysius\n  Who upon Sicily brought dolorous years.\n\nThat forehead there which has the hair so black\n  Is Azzolin; and the other who is blond,\n  Obizzo is of Esti, who, in truth,\n\nUp in the world was by his stepson slain.\"\n  Then turned I to the Poet; and he said,\n  \"Now he be first to thee, and second I.\"\n\nA little farther on the Centaur stopped\n  Above a folk, who far down as the throat\n  Seemed from that boiling stream to issue forth.\n\nA shade he showed us on one side alone,\n  Saying: \"He cleft asunder in God's bosom\n  The heart that still upon the Thames is honoured.\"\n\nThen people saw I, who from out the river\n  Lifted their heads and also all the chest;\n  And many among these I recognised.\n\nThus ever more and more grew shallower\n  That blood, so that the feet alone it covered;\n  And there across the moat our passage was.\n\n\"Even as thou here upon this side beholdest\n  The boiling stream, that aye diminishes,\"\n  The Centaur said, \"I wish thee to believe\n\nThat on this other more and more declines\n  Its bed, until it reunites itself\n  Where it behoveth tyranny to groan.\n\nJustice divine, upon this side, is goading\n  That Attila, who was a scourge on earth,\n  And Pyrrhus, and Sextus; and for ever milks\n\nThe tears which with the boiling it unseals\n  In Rinier da Corneto and Rinier Pazzo,\n  Who made upon the highways so much war.\"\n\nThen back he turned, and passed again the ford.\n\n\n\nInferno: Canto XIII\n\n\nNot yet had Nessus reached the other side,\n  When we had put ourselves within a wood,\n  That was not marked by any path whatever.\n\nNot foliage green, but of a dusky colour,\n  Not branches smooth, but gnarled and intertangled,\n  Not apple-trees were there, but thorns with poison.\n\nSuch tangled thickets have not, nor so dense,\n  Those savage wild beasts, that in hatred hold\n  'Twixt Cecina and Corneto the tilled places.\n\nThere do the hideous Harpies make their nests,\n  Who chased the Trojans from the Strophades,\n  With sad announcement of impending doom;\n\nBroad wings have they, and necks and faces human,\n  And feet with claws, and their great bellies fledged;\n  They make laments upon the wondrous trees.\n\nAnd the good Master: \"Ere thou enter farther,\n  Know that thou art within the second round,\"\n  Thus he began to say, \"and shalt be, till\n\nThou comest out upon the horrible sand;\n  Therefore look well around, and thou shalt see\n  Things that will credence give unto my speech.\"\n\nI heard on all sides lamentations uttered,\n  And person none beheld I who might make them,\n  Whence, utterly bewildered, I stood still.\n\nI think he thought that I perhaps might think\n  So many voices issued through those trunks\n  From people who concealed themselves from us;\n\nTherefore the Master said: \"If thou break off\n  Some little spray from any of these trees,\n  The thoughts thou hast will wholly be made vain.\"\n\nThen stretched I forth my hand a little forward,\n  And plucked a branchlet off from a great thorn;\n  And the trunk cried, \"Why dost thou mangle me?\"\n\nAfter it had become embrowned with blood,\n  It recommenced its cry: \"Why dost thou rend me?\n  Hast thou no spirit of pity whatsoever?\n\nMen once we were, and now are changed to trees;\n  Indeed, thy hand should be more pitiful,\n  Even if the souls of serpents we had been.\"\n\nAs out of a green brand, that is on fire\n  At one of the ends, and from the other drips\n  And hisses with the wind that is escaping;\n\nSo from that splinter issued forth together\n  Both words and blood; whereat I let the tip\n  Fall, and stood like a man who is afraid.\n\n\"Had he been able sooner to believe,\"\n  My Sage made answer, \"O thou wounded soul,\n  What only in my verses he has seen,\n\nNot upon thee had he stretched forth his hand;\n  Whereas the thing incredible has caused me\n  To put him to an act which grieveth me.\n\nBut tell him who thou wast, so that by way\n  Of some amends thy fame he may refresh\n  Up in the world, to which he can return.\"\n\nAnd the trunk said: \"So thy sweet words allure me,\n  I cannot silent be; and you be vexed not,\n  That I a little to discourse am tempted.\n\nI am the one who both keys had in keeping\n  Of Frederick's heart, and turned them to and fro\n  So softly in unlocking and in locking,\n\nThat from his secrets most men I withheld;\n  Fidelity I bore the glorious office\n  So great, I lost thereby my sleep and pulses.\n\nThe courtesan who never from the dwelling\n  Of Caesar turned aside her strumpet eyes,\n  Death universal and the vice of courts,\n\nInflamed against me all the other minds,\n  And they, inflamed, did so inflame Augustus,\n  That my glad honours turned to dismal mournings.\n\nMy spirit, in disdainful exultation,\n  Thinking by dying to escape disdain,\n  Made me unjust against myself, the just.\n\nI, by the roots unwonted of this wood,\n  Do swear to you that never broke I faith\n  Unto my lord, who was so worthy of honour;\n\nAnd to the world if one of you return,\n  Let him my memory comfort, which is lying\n  Still prostrate from the blow that envy dealt it.\"\n\nWaited awhile, and then: \"Since he is silent,\"\n  The Poet said to me, \"lose not the time,\n  But speak, and question him, if more may please thee.\"\n\nWhence I to him: \"Do thou again inquire\n  Concerning what thou thinks't will satisfy me;\n  For I cannot, such pity is in my heart.\"\n\nTherefore he recommenced: \"So may the man\n  Do for thee freely what thy speech implores,\n  Spirit incarcerate, again be pleased\n\nTo tell us in what way the soul is bound\n  Within these knots; and tell us, if thou canst,\n  If any from such members e'er is freed.\"\n\nThen blew the trunk amain, and afterward\n  The wind was into such a voice converted:\n  \"With brevity shall be replied to you.\n\nWhen the exasperated soul abandons\n  The body whence it rent itself away,\n  Minos consigns it to the seventh abyss.\n\nIt falls into the forest, and no part\n  Is chosen for it; but where Fortune hurls it,\n  There like a grain of spelt it germinates.\n\nIt springs a sapling, and a forest tree;\n  The Harpies, feeding then upon its leaves,\n  Do pain create, and for the pain an outlet.\n\nLike others for our spoils shall we return;\n  But not that any one may them revest,\n  For 'tis not just to have what one casts off.\n\nHere we shall drag them, and along the dismal\n  Forest our bodies shall suspended be,\n  Each to the thorn of his molested shade.\"\n\nWe were attentive still unto the trunk,\n  Thinking that more it yet might wish to tell us,\n  When by a tumult we were overtaken,\n\nIn the same way as he is who perceives\n  The boar and chase approaching to his stand,\n  Who hears the crashing of the beasts and branches;\n\nAnd two behold! upon our left-hand side,\n  Naked and scratched, fleeing so furiously,\n  That of the forest, every fan they broke.\n\nHe who was in advance: \"Now help, Death, help!\"\n  And the other one, who seemed to lag too much,\n  Was shouting: \"Lano, were not so alert\n\nThose legs of thine at joustings of the Toppo!\"\n  And then, perchance because his breath was failing,\n  He grouped himself together with a bush.\n\nBehind them was the forest full of black\n  She-mastiffs, ravenous, and swift of foot\n  As greyhounds, who are issuing from the chain.\n\nOn him who had crouched down they set their teeth,\n  And him they lacerated piece by piece,\n  Thereafter bore away those aching members.\n\nThereat my Escort took me by the hand,\n  And led me to the bush, that all in vain\n  Was weeping from its bloody lacerations.\n\n\"O Jacopo,\" it said, \"of Sant' Andrea,\n  What helped it thee of me to make a screen?\n  What blame have I in thy nefarious life?\"\n\nWhen near him had the Master stayed his steps,\n  He said: \"Who wast thou, that through wounds so many\n  Art blowing out with blood thy dolorous speech?\"\n\nAnd he to us: \"O souls, that hither come\n  To look upon the shameful massacre\n  That has so rent away from me my leaves,\n\nGather them up beneath the dismal bush;\n  I of that city was which to the Baptist\n  Changed its first patron, wherefore he for this\n\nForever with his art will make it sad.\n  And were it not that on the pass of Arno\n  Some glimpses of him are remaining still,\n\nThose citizens, who afterwards rebuilt it\n  Upon the ashes left by Attila,\n  In vain had caused their labour to be done.\n\nOf my own house I made myself a gibbet.\"\n\n\n\nInferno: Canto XIV\n\n\nBecause the charity of my native place\n  Constrained me, gathered I the scattered leaves,\n  And gave them back to him, who now was hoarse.\n\nThen came we to the confine, where disparted\n  The second round is from the third, and where\n  A horrible form of Justice is beheld.\n\nClearly to manifest these novel things,\n  I say that we arrived upon a plain,\n  Which from its bed rejecteth every plant;\n\nThe dolorous forest is a garland to it\n  All round about, as the sad moat to that;\n  There close upon the edge we stayed our feet.\n\nThe soil was of an arid and thick sand,\n  Not of another fashion made than that\n  Which by the feet of Cato once was pressed.\n\nVengeance of God, O how much oughtest thou\n  By each one to be dreaded, who doth read\n  That which was manifest unto mine eyes!\n\nOf naked souls beheld I many herds,\n  Who all were weeping very miserably,\n  And over them seemed set a law diverse.\n\nSupine upon the ground some folk were lying;\n  And some were sitting all drawn up together,\n  And others went about continually.\n\nThose who were going round were far the more,\n  And those were less who lay down to their torment,\n  But had their tongues more loosed to lamentation.\n\nO'er all the sand-waste, with a gradual fall,\n  Were raining down dilated flakes of fire,\n  As of the snow on Alp without a wind.\n\nAs Alexander, in those torrid parts\n  Of India, beheld upon his host\n  Flames fall unbroken till they reached the ground.\n\nWhence he provided with his phalanxes\n  To trample down the soil, because the vapour\n  Better extinguished was while it was single;\n\nThus was descending the eternal heat,\n  Whereby the sand was set on fire, like tinder\n  Beneath the steel, for doubling of the dole.\n\nWithout repose forever was the dance\n  Of miserable hands, now there, now here,\n  Shaking away from off them the fresh gleeds.\n\n\"Master,\" began I, \"thou who overcomest\n  All things except the demons dire, that issued\n  Against us at the entrance of the gate,\n\nWho is that mighty one who seems to heed not\n  The fire, and lieth lowering and disdainful,\n  So that the rain seems not to ripen him?\"\n\nAnd he himself, who had become aware\n  That I was questioning my Guide about him,\n  Cried: \"Such as I was living, am I, dead.\n\nIf Jove should weary out his smith, from whom\n  He seized in anger the sharp thunderbolt,\n  Wherewith upon the last day I was smitten,\n\nAnd if he wearied out by turns the others\n  In Mongibello at the swarthy forge,\n  Vociferating, 'Help, good Vulcan, help!'\n\nEven as he did there at the fight of Phlegra,\n  And shot his bolts at me with all his might,\n  He would not have thereby a joyous vengeance.\"\n\nThen did my Leader speak with such great force,\n  That I had never heard him speak so loud:\n  \"O Capaneus, in that is not extinguished\n\nThine arrogance, thou punished art the more;\n  Not any torment, saving thine own rage,\n  Would be unto thy fury pain complete.\"\n\nThen he turned round to me with better lip,\n  Saying: \"One of the Seven Kings was he\n  Who Thebes besieged, and held, and seems to hold\n\nGod in disdain, and little seems to prize him;\n  But, as I said to him, his own despites\n  Are for his breast the fittest ornaments.\n\nNow follow me, and mind thou do not place\n  As yet thy feet upon the burning sand,\n  But always keep them close unto the wood.\"\n\nSpeaking no word, we came to where there gushes\n  Forth from the wood a little rivulet,\n  Whose redness makes my hair still stand on end.\n\nAs from the Bulicame springs the brooklet,\n  The sinful women later share among them,\n  So downward through the sand it went its way.\n\nThe bottom of it, and both sloping banks,\n  Were made of stone, and the margins at the side;\n  Whence I perceived that there the passage was.\n\n\"In all the rest which I have shown to thee\n  Since we have entered in within the gate\n  Whose threshold unto no one is denied,\n\nNothing has been discovered by thine eyes\n  So notable as is the present river,\n  Which all the little flames above it quenches.\"\n\nThese words were of my Leader; whence I prayed him\n  That he would give me largess of the food,\n  For which he had given me largess of desire.\n\n\"In the mid-sea there sits a wasted land,\"\n  Said he thereafterward, \"whose name is Crete,\n  Under whose king the world of old was chaste.\n\nThere is a mountain there, that once was glad\n  With waters and with leaves, which was called Ida;\n  Now 'tis deserted, as a thing worn out.\n\nRhea once chose it for the faithful cradle\n  Of her own son; and to conceal him better,\n  Whene'er he cried, she there had clamours made.\n\nA grand old man stands in the mount erect,\n  Who holds his shoulders turned tow'rds Damietta,\n  And looks at Rome as if it were his mirror.\n\nHis head is fashioned of refined gold,\n  And of pure silver are the arms and breast;\n  Then he is brass as far down as the fork.\n\nFrom that point downward all is chosen iron,\n  Save that the right foot is of kiln-baked clay,\n  And more he stands on that than on the other.\n\nEach part, except the gold, is by a fissure\n  Asunder cleft, that dripping is with tears,\n  Which gathered together perforate that cavern.\n\nFrom rock to rock they fall into this valley;\n  Acheron, Styx, and Phlegethon they form;\n  Then downward go along this narrow sluice\n\nUnto that point where is no more descending.\n  They form Cocytus; what that pool may be\n  Thou shalt behold, so here 'tis not narrated.\"\n\nAnd I to him: \"If so the present runnel\n  Doth take its rise in this way from our world,\n  Why only on this verge appears it to us?\"\n\nAnd he to me: \"Thou knowest the place is round,\n  And notwithstanding thou hast journeyed far,\n  Still to the left descending to the bottom,\n\nThou hast not yet through all the circle turned.\n  Therefore if something new appear to us,\n  It should not bring amazement to thy face.\"\n\nAnd I again: \"Master, where shall be found\n  Lethe and Phlegethon, for of one thou'rt silent,\n  And sayest the other of this rain is made?\"\n\n\"In all thy questions truly thou dost please me,\"\n  Replied he; \"but the boiling of the red\n  Water might well solve one of them thou makest.\n\nThou shalt see Lethe, but outside this moat,\n  There where the souls repair to lave themselves,\n  When sin repented of has been removed.\"\n\nThen said he: \"It is time now to abandon\n  The wood; take heed that thou come after me;\n  A way the margins make that are not burning,\n\nAnd over them all vapours are extinguished.\"\n\n\n\nInferno: Canto XV\n\n\nNow bears us onward one of the hard margins,\n  And so the brooklet's mist o'ershadows it,\n  From fire it saves the water and the dikes.\n\nEven as the Flemings, 'twixt Cadsand and Bruges,\n  Fearing the flood that tow'rds them hurls itself,\n  Their bulwarks build to put the sea to flight;\n\nAnd as the Paduans along the Brenta,\n  To guard their villas and their villages,\n  Or ever Chiarentana feel the heat;\n\nIn such similitude had those been made,\n  Albeit not so lofty nor so thick,\n  Whoever he might be, the master made them.\n\nNow were we from the forest so remote,\n  I could not have discovered where it was,\n  Even if backward I had turned myself,\n\nWhen we a company of souls encountered,\n  Who came beside the dike, and every one\n  Gazed at us, as at evening we are wont\n\nTo eye each other under a new moon,\n  And so towards us sharpened they their brows\n  As an old tailor at the needle's eye.\n\nThus scrutinised by such a family,\n  By some one I was recognised, who seized\n  My garment's hem, and cried out, \"What a marvel!\"\n\nAnd I, when he stretched forth his arm to me,\n  On his baked aspect fastened so mine eyes,\n  That the scorched countenance prevented not\n\nHis recognition by my intellect;\n  And bowing down my face unto his own,\n  I made reply, \"Are you here, Ser Brunetto?\"\n\nAnd he: \"May't not displease thee, O my son,\n  If a brief space with thee Brunetto Latini\n  Backward return and let the trail go on.\"\n\nI said to him: \"With all my power I ask it;\n  And if you wish me to sit down with you,\n  I will, if he please, for I go with him.\"\n\n\"O son,\" he said, \"whoever of this herd\n  A moment stops, lies then a hundred years,\n  Nor fans himself when smiteth him the fire.\n\nTherefore go on; I at thy skirts will come,\n  And afterward will I rejoin my band,\n  Which goes lamenting its eternal doom.\"\n\nI did not dare to go down from the road\n  Level to walk with him; but my head bowed\n  I held as one who goeth reverently.\n\nAnd he began: \"What fortune or what fate\n  Before the last day leadeth thee down here?\n  And who is this that showeth thee the way?\"\n\n\"Up there above us in the life serene,\"\n  I answered him, \"I lost me in a valley,\n  Or ever yet my age had been completed.\n\nBut yestermorn I turned my back upon it;\n  This one appeared to me, returning thither,\n  And homeward leadeth me along this road.\"\n\nAnd he to me: \"If thou thy star do follow,\n  Thou canst not fail thee of a glorious port,\n  If well I judged in the life beautiful.\n\nAnd if I had not died so prematurely,\n  Seeing Heaven thus benignant unto thee,\n  I would have given thee comfort in the work.\n\nBut that ungrateful and malignant people,\n  Which of old time from Fesole descended,\n  And smacks still of the mountain and the granite,\n\nWill make itself, for thy good deeds, thy foe;\n  And it is right; for among crabbed sorbs\n  It ill befits the sweet fig to bear fruit.\n\nOld rumour in the world proclaims them blind;\n  A people avaricious, envious, proud;\n  Take heed that of their customs thou do cleanse thee.\n\nThy fortune so much honour doth reserve thee,\n  One party and the other shall be hungry\n  For thee; but far from goat shall be the grass.\n\nTheir litter let the beasts of Fesole\n  Make of themselves, nor let them touch the plant,\n  If any still upon their dunghill rise,\n\nIn which may yet revive the consecrated\n  Seed of those Romans, who remained there when\n  The nest of such great malice it became.\"\n\n\"If my entreaty wholly were fulfilled,\"\n  Replied I to him, \"not yet would you be\n  In banishment from human nature placed;\n\nFor in my mind is fixed, and touches now\n  My heart the dear and good paternal image\n  Of you, when in the world from hour to hour\n\nYou taught me how a man becomes eternal;\n  And how much I am grateful, while I live\n  Behoves that in my language be discerned.\n\nWhat you narrate of my career I write,\n  And keep it to be glossed with other text\n  By a Lady who can do it, if I reach her.\n\nThis much will I have manifest to you;\n  Provided that my conscience do not chide me,\n  For whatsoever Fortune I am ready.\n\nSuch handsel is not new unto mine ears;\n  Therefore let Fortune turn her wheel around\n  As it may please her, and the churl his mattock.\"\n\nMy Master thereupon on his right cheek\n  Did backward turn himself, and looked at me;\n  Then said: \"He listeneth well who noteth it.\"\n\nNor speaking less on that account, I go\n  With Ser Brunetto, and I ask who are\n  His most known and most eminent companions.\n\nAnd he to me: \"To know of some is well;\n  Of others it were laudable to be silent,\n  For short would be the time for so much speech.\n\nKnow them in sum, that all of them were clerks,\n  And men of letters great and of great fame,\n  In the world tainted with the selfsame sin.\n\nPriscian goes yonder with that wretched crowd,\n  And Francis of Accorso; and thou hadst seen there\n  If thou hadst had a hankering for such scurf,\n\nThat one, who by the Servant of the Servants\n  From Arno was transferred to Bacchiglione,\n  Where he has left his sin-excited nerves.\n\nMore would I say, but coming and discoursing\n  Can be no longer; for that I behold\n  New smoke uprising yonder from the sand.\n\nA people comes with whom I may not be;\n  Commended unto thee be my Tesoro,\n  In which I still live, and no more I ask.\"\n\nThen he turned round, and seemed to be of those\n  Who at Verona run for the Green Mantle\n  Across the plain; and seemed to be among them\n\nThe one who wins, and not the one who loses.\n\n\n\nInferno: Canto XVI\n\n\nNow was I where was heard the reverberation\n  Of water falling into the next round,\n  Like to that humming which the beehives make,\n\nWhen shadows three together started forth,\n  Running, from out a company that passed\n  Beneath the rain of the sharp martyrdom.\n\nTowards us came they, and each one cried out:\n  \"Stop, thou; for by thy garb to us thou seemest\n  To be some one of our depraved city.\"\n\nAh me! what wounds I saw upon their limbs,\n  Recent and ancient by the flames burnt in!\n  It pains me still but to remember it.\n\nUnto their cries my Teacher paused attentive;\n  He turned his face towards me, and \"Now wait,\"\n  He said; \"to these we should be courteous.\n\nAnd if it were not for the fire that darts\n  The nature of this region, I should say\n  That haste were more becoming thee than them.\"\n\nAs soon as we stood still, they recommenced\n  The old refrain, and when they overtook us,\n  Formed of themselves a wheel, all three of them.\n\nAs champions stripped and oiled are wont to do,\n  Watching for their advantage and their hold,\n  Before they come to blows and thrusts between them,\n\nThus, wheeling round, did every one his visage\n  Direct to me, so that in opposite wise\n  His neck and feet continual journey made.\n\nAnd, \"If the misery of this soft place\n  Bring in disdain ourselves and our entreaties,\"\n  Began one, \"and our aspect black and blistered,\n\nLet the renown of us thy mind incline\n  To tell us who thou art, who thus securely\n  Thy living feet dost move along through Hell.\n\nHe in whose footprints thou dost see me treading,\n  Naked and skinless though he now may go,\n  Was of a greater rank than thou dost think;\n\nHe was the grandson of the good Gualdrada;\n  His name was Guidoguerra, and in life\n  Much did he with his wisdom and his sword.\n\nThe other, who close by me treads the sand,\n  Tegghiaio Aldobrandi is, whose fame\n  Above there in the world should welcome be.\n\nAnd I, who with them on the cross am placed,\n  Jacopo Rusticucci was; and truly\n  My savage wife, more than aught else, doth harm me.\"\n\nCould I have been protected from the fire,\n  Below I should have thrown myself among them,\n  And think the Teacher would have suffered it;\n\nBut as I should have burned and baked myself,\n  My terror overmastered my good will,\n  Which made me greedy of embracing them.\n\nThen I began: \"Sorrow and not disdain\n  Did your condition fix within me so,\n  That tardily it wholly is stripped off,\n\nAs soon as this my Lord said unto me\n  Words, on account of which I thought within me\n  That people such as you are were approaching.\n\nI of your city am; and evermore\n  Your labours and your honourable names\n  I with affection have retraced and heard.\n\nI leave the gall, and go for the sweet fruits\n  Promised to me by the veracious Leader;\n  But to the centre first I needs must plunge.\"\n\n\"So may the soul for a long while conduct\n  Those limbs of thine,\" did he make answer then,\n  \"And so may thy renown shine after thee,\n\nValour and courtesy, say if they dwell\n  Within our city, as they used to do,\n  Or if they wholly have gone out of it;\n\nFor Guglielmo Borsier, who is in torment\n  With us of late, and goes there with his comrades,\n  Doth greatly mortify us with his words.\"\n\n\"The new inhabitants and the sudden gains,\n  Pride and extravagance have in thee engendered,\n  Florence, so that thou weep'st thereat already!\"\n\nIn this wise I exclaimed with face uplifted;\n  And the three, taking that for my reply,\n  Looked at each other, as one looks at truth.\n\n\"If other times so little it doth cost thee,\"\n  Replied they all, \"to satisfy another,\n  Happy art thou, thus speaking at thy will!\n\nTherefore, if thou escape from these dark places,\n  And come to rebehold the beauteous stars,\n  When it shall pleasure thee to say, 'I was,'\n\nSee that thou speak of us unto the people.\"\n  Then they broke up the wheel, and in their flight\n  It seemed as if their agile legs were wings.\n\nNot an Amen could possibly be said\n  So rapidly as they had disappeared;\n  Wherefore the Master deemed best to depart.\n\nI followed him, and little had we gone,\n  Before the sound of water was so near us,\n  That speaking we should hardly have been heard.\n\nEven as that stream which holdeth its own course\n  The first from Monte Veso tow'rds the East,\n  Upon the left-hand <DW72> of Apennine,\n\nWhich is above called Acquacheta, ere\n  It down descendeth into its low bed,\n  And at Forli is vacant of that name,\n\nReverberates there above San Benedetto\n  From Alps, by falling at a single leap,\n  Where for a thousand there were room enough;\n\nThus downward from a bank precipitate,\n  We found resounding that dark-tinted water,\n  So that it soon the ear would have offended.\n\nI had a cord around about me girt,\n  And therewithal I whilom had designed\n  To take the panther with the painted skin.\n\nAfter I this had all from me unloosed,\n  As my Conductor had commanded me,\n  I reached it to him, gathered up and coiled,\n\nWhereat he turned himself to the right side,\n  And at a little distance from the verge,\n  He cast it down into that deep abyss.\n\n\"It must needs be some novelty respond,\"\n  I said within myself, \"to the new signal\n  The Master with his eye is following so.\"\n\nAh me! how very cautious men should be\n  With those who not alone behold the act,\n  But with their wisdom look into the thoughts!\n\nHe said to me: \"Soon there will upward come\n  What I await; and what thy thought is dreaming\n  Must soon reveal itself unto thy sight.\"\n\nAye to that truth which has the face of falsehood,\n  A man should close his lips as far as may be,\n  Because without his fault it causes shame;\n\nBut here I cannot; and, Reader, by the notes\n  Of this my Comedy to thee I swear,\n  So may they not be void of lasting favour,\n\nAthwart that dense and darksome atmosphere\n  I saw a figure swimming upward come,\n  Marvellous unto every steadfast heart,\n\nEven as he returns who goeth down\n  Sometimes to clear an anchor, which has grappled\n  Reef, or aught else that in the sea is hidden,\n\nWho upward stretches, and draws in his feet.\n\n\n\nInferno: Canto XVII\n\n\n\"Behold the monster with the pointed tail,\n  Who cleaves the hills, and breaketh walls and weapons,\n  Behold him who infecteth all the world.\"\n\nThus unto me my Guide began to say,\n  And beckoned him that he should come to shore,\n  Near to the confine of the trodden marble;\n\nAnd that uncleanly image of deceit\n  Came up and thrust ashore its head and bust,\n  But on the border did not drag its tail.\n\nThe face was as the face of a just man,\n  Its semblance outwardly was so benign,\n  And of a serpent all the trunk beside.\n\nTwo paws it had, hairy unto the armpits;\n  The back, and breast, and both the sides it had\n  Depicted o'er with nooses and with shields.\n\nWith colours more, groundwork or broidery\n  Never in cloth did Tartars make nor Turks,\n  Nor were such tissues by Arachne laid.\n\nAs sometimes wherries lie upon the shore,\n  That part are in the water, part on land;\n  And as among the guzzling Germans there,\n\nThe beaver plants himself to wage his war;\n  So that vile monster lay upon the border,\n  Which is of stone, and shutteth in the sand.\n\nHis tail was wholly quivering in the void,\n  Contorting upwards the envenomed fork,\n  That in the guise of scorpion armed its point.\n\nThe Guide said: \"Now perforce must turn aside\n  Our way a little, even to that beast\n  Malevolent, that yonder coucheth him.\"\n\nWe therefore on the right side descended,\n  And made ten steps upon the outer verge,\n  Completely to avoid the sand and flame;\n\nAnd after we are come to him, I see\n  A little farther off upon the sand\n  A people sitting near the hollow place.\n\nThen said to me the Master: \"So that full\n  Experience of this round thou bear away,\n  Now go and see what their condition is.\n\nThere let thy conversation be concise;\n  Till thou returnest I will speak with him,\n  That he concede to us his stalwart shoulders.\"\n\nThus farther still upon the outermost\n  Head of that seventh circle all alone\n  I went, where sat the melancholy folk.\n\nOut of their eyes was gushing forth their woe;\n  This way, that way, they helped them with their hands\n  Now from the flames and now from the hot soil.\n\nNot otherwise in summer do the dogs,\n  Now with the foot, now with the muzzle, when\n  By fleas, or flies, or gadflies, they are bitten.\n\nWhen I had turned mine eyes upon the faces\n  Of some, on whom the dolorous fire is falling,\n  Not one of them I knew; but I perceived\n\nThat from the neck of each there hung a pouch,\n  Which certain colour had, and certain blazon;\n  And thereupon it seems their eyes are feeding.\n\nAnd as I gazing round me come among them,\n  Upon a yellow pouch I azure saw\n  That had the face and posture of a lion.\n\nProceeding then the current of my sight,\n  Another of them saw I, red as blood,\n  Display a goose more white than butter is.\n\nAnd one, who with an azure sow and gravid\n  Emblazoned had his little pouch of white,\n  Said unto me: \"What dost thou in this moat?\n\nNow get thee gone; and since thou'rt still alive,\n  Know that a neighbour of mine, Vitaliano,\n  Will have his seat here on my left-hand side.\n\nA Paduan am I with these Florentines;\n  Full many a time they thunder in mine ears,\n  Exclaiming, 'Come the sovereign cavalier,\n\nHe who shall bring the satchel with three goats;'\"\n  Then twisted he his mouth, and forth he thrust\n  His tongue, like to an ox that licks its nose.\n\nAnd fearing lest my longer stay might vex\n  Him who had warned me not to tarry long,\n  Backward I turned me from those weary souls.\n\nI found my Guide, who had already mounted\n  Upon the back of that wild animal,\n  And said to me: \"Now be both strong and bold.\n\nNow we descend by stairways such as these;\n  Mount thou in front, for I will be midway,\n  So that the tail may have no power to harm thee.\"\n\nSuch as he is who has so near the ague\n  Of quartan that his nails are blue already,\n  And trembles all, but looking at the shade;\n\nEven such became I at those proffered words;\n  But shame in me his menaces produced,\n  Which maketh servant strong before good master.\n\nI seated me upon those monstrous shoulders;\n  I wished to say, and yet the voice came not\n  As I believed, \"Take heed that thou embrace me.\"\n\nBut he, who other times had rescued me\n  In other peril, soon as I had mounted,\n  Within his arms encircled and sustained me,\n\nAnd said: \"Now, Geryon, bestir thyself;\n  The circles large, and the descent be little;\n  Think of the novel burden which thou hast.\"\n\nEven as the little vessel shoves from shore,\n  Backward, still backward, so he thence withdrew;\n  And when he wholly felt himself afloat,\n\nThere where his breast had been he turned his tail,\n  And that extended like an eel he moved,\n  And with his paws drew to himself the air.\n\nA greater fear I do not think there was\n  What time abandoned Phaeton the reins,\n  Whereby the heavens, as still appears, were scorched;\n\nNor when the wretched Icarus his flanks\n  Felt stripped of feathers by the melting wax,\n  His father crying, \"An ill way thou takest!\"\n\nThan was my own, when I perceived myself\n  On all sides in the air, and saw extinguished\n  The sight of everything but of the monster.\n\nOnward he goeth, swimming slowly, slowly;\n  Wheels and descends, but I perceive it only\n  By wind upon my face and from below.\n\nI heard already on the right the whirlpool\n  Making a horrible crashing under us;\n  Whence I thrust out my head with eyes cast downward.\n\nThen was I still more fearful of the abyss;\n  Because I fires beheld, and heard laments,\n  Whereat I, trembling, all the closer cling.\n\nI saw then, for before I had not seen it,\n  The turning and descending, by great horrors\n  That were approaching upon divers sides.\n\nAs falcon who has long been on the wing,\n  Who, without seeing either lure or bird,\n  Maketh the falconer say, \"Ah me, thou stoopest,\"\n\nDescendeth weary, whence he started swiftly,\n  Thorough a hundred circles, and alights\n  Far from his master, sullen and disdainful;\n\nEven thus did Geryon place us on the bottom,\n  Close to the bases of the rough-hewn rock,\n  And being disencumbered of our persons,\n\nHe sped away as arrow from the string.\n\n\n\nInferno: Canto XVIII\n\n\nThere is a place in Hell called Malebolge,\n  Wholly of stone and of an iron colour,\n  As is the circle that around it turns.\n\nRight in the middle of the field malign\n  There yawns a well exceeding wide and deep,\n  Of which its place the structure will recount.\n\nRound, then, is that enclosure which remains\n  Between the well and foot of the high, hard bank,\n  And has distinct in valleys ten its bottom.\n\nAs where for the protection of the walls\n  Many and many moats surround the castles,\n  The part in which they are a figure forms,\n\nJust such an image those presented there;\n  And as about such strongholds from their gates\n  Unto the outer bank are little bridges,\n\nSo from the precipice's base did crags\n  Project, which intersected dikes and moats,\n  Unto the well that truncates and collects them.\n\nWithin this place, down shaken from the back\n  Of Geryon, we found us; and the Poet\n  Held to the left, and I moved on behind.\n\nUpon my right hand I beheld new anguish,\n  New torments, and new wielders of the lash,\n  Wherewith the foremost Bolgia was replete.\n\nDown at the bottom were the sinners naked;\n  This side the middle came they facing us,\n  Beyond it, with us, but with greater steps;\n\nEven as the Romans, for the mighty host,\n  The year of Jubilee, upon the bridge,\n  Have chosen a mode to pass the people over;\n\nFor all upon one side towards the Castle\n  Their faces have, and go unto St. Peter's;\n  On the other side they go towards the Mountain.\n\nThis side and that, along the livid stone\n  Beheld I horned demons with great scourges,\n  Who cruelly were beating them behind.\n\nAh me! how they did make them lift their legs\n  At the first blows! and sooth not any one\n  The second waited for, nor for the third.\n\nWhile I was going on, mine eyes by one\n  Encountered were; and straight I said: \"Already\n  With sight of this one I am not unfed.\"\n\nTherefore I stayed my feet to make him out,\n  And with me the sweet Guide came to a stand,\n  And to my going somewhat back assented;\n\nAnd he, the scourged one, thought to hide himself,\n  Lowering his face, but little it availed him;\n  For said I: \"Thou that castest down thine eyes,\n\nIf false are not the features which thou bearest,\n  Thou art Venedico Caccianimico;\n  But what doth bring thee to such pungent sauces?\"\n\nAnd he to me: \"Unwillingly I tell it;\n  But forces me thine utterance distinct,\n  Which makes me recollect the ancient world.\n\nI was the one who the fair Ghisola\n  Induced to grant the wishes of the Marquis,\n  Howe'er the shameless story may be told.\n\nNot the sole Bolognese am I who weeps here;\n  Nay, rather is this place so full of them,\n  That not so many tongues to-day are taught\n\n'Twixt Reno and Savena to say'sipa;'\n  And if thereof thou wishest pledge or proof,\n  Bring to thy mind our avaricious heart.\"\n\nWhile speaking in this manner, with his scourge\n  A demon smote him, and said: \"Get thee gone\n  Pander, there are no women here for coin.\"\n\nI joined myself again unto mine Escort;\n  Thereafterward with footsteps few we came\n  To where a crag projected from the bank.\n\nThis very easily did we ascend,\n  And turning to the right along its ridge,\n  From those eternal circles we departed.\n\nWhen we were there, where it is hollowed out\n  Beneath, to give a passage to the scourged,\n  The Guide said: \"Wait, and see that on thee strike\n\nThe vision of those others evil-born,\n  Of whom thou hast not yet beheld the faces,\n  Because together with us they have gone.\"\n\nFrom the old bridge we looked upon the train\n  Which tow'rds us came upon the other border,\n  And which the scourges in like manner smite.\n\nAnd the good Master, without my inquiring,\n  Said to me: \"See that tall one who is coming,\n  And for his pain seems not to shed a tear;\n\nStill what a royal aspect he retains!\n  That Jason is, who by his heart and cunning\n  The Colchians of the Ram made destitute.\n\nHe by the isle of Lemnos passed along\n  After the daring women pitiless\n  Had unto death devoted all their males.\n\nThere with his tokens and with ornate words\n  Did he deceive Hypsipyle, the maiden\n  Who first, herself, had all the rest deceived.\n\nThere did he leave her pregnant and forlorn;\n  Such sin unto such punishment condemns him,\n  And also for Medea is vengeance done.\n\nWith him go those who in such wise deceive;\n  And this sufficient be of the first valley\n  To know, and those that in its jaws it holds.\"\n\nWe were already where the narrow path\n  Crosses athwart the second dike, and forms\n  Of that a buttress for another arch.\n\nThence we heard people, who are making moan\n  In the next Bolgia, snorting with their muzzles,\n  And with their palms beating upon themselves\n\nThe margins were incrusted with a mould\n  By exhalation from below, that sticks there,\n  And with the eyes and nostrils wages war.\n\nThe bottom is so deep, no place suffices\n  To give us sight of it, without ascending\n  The arch's back, where most the crag impends.\n\nThither we came, and thence down in the moat\n  I saw a people smothered in a filth\n  That out of human privies seemed to flow;\n\nAnd whilst below there with mine eye I search,\n  I saw one with his head so foul with ordure,\n  It was not clear if he were clerk or layman.\n\nHe screamed to me: \"Wherefore art thou so eager\n  To look at me more than the other foul ones?\"\n  And I to him: \"Because, if I remember,\n\nI have already seen thee with dry hair,\n  And thou'rt Alessio Interminei of Lucca;\n  Therefore I eye thee more than all the others.\"\n\nAnd he thereon, belabouring his pumpkin:\n  \"The flatteries have submerged me here below,\n  Wherewith my tongue was never surfeited.\"\n\nThen said to me the Guide: \"See that thou thrust\n  Thy visage somewhat farther in advance,\n  That with thine eyes thou well the face attain\n\nOf that uncleanly and dishevelled drab,\n  Who there doth scratch herself with filthy nails,\n  And crouches now, and now on foot is standing.\n\nThais the harlot is it, who replied\n  Unto her paramour, when he said, 'Have I\n  Great gratitude from thee?'--'Nay, marvellous;'\n\nAnd herewith let our sight be satisfied.\"\n\n\n\nInferno: Canto XIX\n\n\nO Simon Magus, O forlorn disciples,\n  Ye who the things of God, which ought to be\n  The brides of holiness, rapaciously\n\nFor silver and for gold do prostitute,\n  Now it behoves for you the trumpet sound,\n  Because in this third Bolgia ye abide.\n\nWe had already on the following tomb\n  Ascended to that portion of the crag\n  Which o'er the middle of the moat hangs plumb.\n\nWisdom supreme, O how great art thou showest\n  In heaven, in earth, and in the evil world,\n  And with what justice doth thy power distribute!\n\nI saw upon the sides and on the bottom\n  The livid stone with perforations filled,\n  All of one size, and every one was round.\n\nTo me less ample seemed they not, nor greater\n  Than those that in my beautiful Saint John\n  Are fashioned for the place of the baptisers,\n\nAnd one of which, not many years ago,\n  I broke for some one, who was drowning in it;\n  Be this a seal all men to undeceive.\n\nOut of the mouth of each one there protruded\n  The feet of a transgressor, and the legs\n  Up to the calf, the rest within remained.\n\nIn all of them the soles were both on fire;\n  Wherefore the joints so violently quivered,\n  They would have snapped asunder withes and bands.\n\nEven as the flame of unctuous things is wont\n  To move upon the outer surface only,\n  So likewise was it there from heel to point.\n\n\"Master, who is that one who writhes himself,\n  More than his other comrades quivering,\"\n  I said, \"and whom a redder flame is sucking?\"\n\nAnd he to me: \"If thou wilt have me bear thee\n  Down there along that bank which lowest lies,\n  From him thou'lt know his errors and himself.\"\n\nAnd I: \"What pleases thee, to me is pleasing;\n  Thou art my Lord, and knowest that I depart not\n  From thy desire, and knowest what is not spoken.\"\n\nStraightway upon the fourth dike we arrived;\n  We turned, and on the left-hand side descended\n  Down to the bottom full of holes and narrow.\n\nAnd the good Master yet from off his haunch\n  Deposed me not, till to the hole he brought me\n  Of him who so lamented with his shanks.\n\n\"Whoe'er thou art, that standest upside down,\n  O doleful soul, implanted like a stake,\"\n  To say began I, \"if thou canst, speak out.\"\n\nI stood even as the friar who is confessing\n  The false assassin, who, when he is fixed,\n  Recalls him, so that death may be delayed.\n\nAnd he cried out: \"Dost thou stand there already,\n  Dost thou stand there already, Boniface?\n  By many years the record lied to me.\n\nArt thou so early satiate with that wealth,\n  For which thou didst not fear to take by fraud\n  The beautiful Lady, and then work her woe?\"\n\nSuch I became, as people are who stand,\n  Not comprehending what is answered them,\n  As if bemocked, and know not how to answer.\n\nThen said Virgilius: \"Say to him straightway,\n  'I am not he, I am not he thou thinkest.'\"\n  And I replied as was imposed on me.\n\nWhereat the spirit writhed with both his feet,\n  Then, sighing, with a voice of lamentation\n  Said to me: \"Then what wantest thou of me?\n\nIf who I am thou carest so much to know,\n  That thou on that account hast crossed the bank,\n  Know that I vested was with the great mantle;\n\nAnd truly was I son of the She-bear,\n  So eager to advance the cubs, that wealth\n  Above, and here myself, I pocketed.\n\nBeneath my head the others are dragged down\n  Who have preceded me in simony,\n  Flattened along the fissure of the rock.\n\nBelow there I shall likewise fall, whenever\n  That one shall come who I believed thou wast,\n  What time the sudden question I proposed.\n\nBut longer I my feet already toast,\n  And here have been in this way upside down,\n  Than he will planted stay with reddened feet;\n\nFor after him shall come of fouler deed\n  From tow'rds the west a Pastor without law,\n  Such as befits to cover him and me.\n\nNew Jason will he be, of whom we read\n  In Maccabees; and as his king was pliant,\n  So he who governs France shall be to this one.\"\n\nI do not know if I were here too bold,\n  That him I answered only in this metre:\n  \"I pray thee tell me now how great a treasure\n\nOur Lord demanded of Saint Peter first,\n  Before he put the keys into his keeping?\n  Truly he nothing asked but 'Follow me.'\n\nNor Peter nor the rest asked of Matthias\n  Silver or gold, when he by lot was chosen\n  Unto the place the guilty soul had lost.\n\nTherefore stay here, for thou art justly punished,\n  And keep safe guard o'er the ill-gotten money,\n  Which caused thee to be valiant against Charles.\n\nAnd were it not that still forbids it me\n  The reverence for the keys superlative\n  Thou hadst in keeping in the gladsome life,\n\nI would make use of words more grievous still;\n  Because your avarice afflicts the world,\n  Trampling the good and lifting the depraved.\n\nThe Evangelist you Pastors had in mind,\n  When she who sitteth upon many waters\n  To fornicate with kings by him was seen;\n\nThe same who with the seven heads was born,\n  And power and strength from the ten horns received,\n  So long as virtue to her spouse was pleasing.\n\nYe have made yourselves a god of gold and silver;\n  And from the idolater how differ ye,\n  Save that he one, and ye a hundred worship?\n\nAh, Constantine! of how much ill was mother,\n  Not thy conversion, but that marriage dower\n  Which the first wealthy Father took from thee!\"\n\nAnd while I sang to him such notes as these,\n  Either that anger or that conscience stung him,\n  He struggled violently with both his feet.\n\nI think in sooth that it my Leader pleased,\n  With such contented lip he listened ever\n  Unto the sound of the true words expressed.\n\nTherefore with both his arms he took me up,\n  And when he had me all upon his breast,\n  Remounted by the way where he descended.\n\nNor did he tire to have me clasped to him;\n  But bore me to the summit of the arch\n  Which from the fourth dike to the fifth is passage.\n\nThere tenderly he laid his burden down,\n  Tenderly on the crag uneven and steep,\n  That would have been hard passage for the goats:\n\nThence was unveiled to me another valley.\n\n\n\nInferno: Canto XX\n\n\nOf a new pain behoves me to make verses\n  And give material to the twentieth canto\n  Of the first song, which is of the submerged.\n\nI was already thoroughly disposed\n  To peer down into the uncovered depth,\n  Which bathed itself with tears of agony;\n\nAnd people saw I through the circular valley,\n  Silent and weeping, coming at the pace\n  Which in this world the Litanies assume.\n\nAs lower down my sight descended on them,\n  Wondrously each one seemed to be distorted\n  From chin to the beginning of the chest;\n\nFor tow'rds the reins the countenance was turned,\n  And backward it behoved them to advance,\n  As to look forward had been taken from them.\n\nPerchance indeed by violence of palsy\n  Some one has been thus wholly turned awry;\n  But I ne'er saw it, nor believe it can be.\n\nAs God may let thee, Reader, gather fruit\n  From this thy reading, think now for thyself\n  How I could ever keep my face unmoistened,\n\nWhen our own image near me I beheld\n  Distorted so, the weeping of the eyes\n  Along the fissure bathed the hinder parts.\n\nTruly I wept, leaning upon a peak\n  Of the hard crag, so that my Escort said\n  To me: \"Art thou, too, of the other fools?\n\nHere pity lives when it is wholly dead;\n  Who is a greater reprobate than he\n  Who feels compassion at the doom divine?\n\nLift up, lift up thy head, and see for whom\n  Opened the earth before the Thebans' eyes;\n  Wherefore they all cried: 'Whither rushest thou,\n\nAmphiaraus?  Why dost leave the war?'\n  And downward ceased he not to fall amain\n  As far as Minos, who lays hold on all.\n\nSee, he has made a bosom of his shoulders!\n  Because he wished to see too far before him\n  Behind he looks, and backward goes his way:\n\nBehold Tiresias, who his semblance changed,\n  When from a male a female he became,\n  His members being all of them transformed;\n\nAnd afterwards was forced to strike once more\n  The two entangled serpents with his rod,\n  Ere he could have again his manly plumes.\n\nThat Aruns is, who backs the other's belly,\n  Who in the hills of Luni, there where grubs\n  The Carrarese who houses underneath,\n\nAmong the marbles white a cavern had\n  For his abode; whence to behold the stars\n  And sea, the view was not cut off from him.\n\nAnd she there, who is covering up her breasts,\n  Which thou beholdest not, with loosened tresses,\n  And on that side has all the hairy skin,\n\nWas Manto, who made quest through many lands,\n  Afterwards tarried there where I was born;\n  Whereof I would thou list to me a little.\n\nAfter her father had from life departed,\n  And the city of Bacchus had become enslaved,\n  She a long season wandered through the world.\n\nAbove in beauteous Italy lies a lake\n  At the Alp's foot that shuts in Germany\n  Over Tyrol, and has the name Benaco.\n\nBy a thousand springs, I think, and more, is bathed,\n  'Twixt Garda and Val Camonica, Pennino,\n  With water that grows stagnant in that lake.\n\nMidway a place is where the Trentine Pastor,\n  And he of Brescia, and the Veronese\n  Might give his blessing, if he passed that way.\n\nSitteth Peschiera, fortress fair and strong,\n  To front the Brescians and the Bergamasks,\n  Where round about the bank descendeth lowest.\n\nThere of necessity must fall whatever\n  In bosom of Benaco cannot stay,\n  And grows a river down through verdant pastures.\n\nSoon as the water doth begin to run,\n  No more Benaco is it called, but Mincio,\n  Far as Governo, where it falls in Po.\n\nNot far it runs before it finds a plain\n  In which it spreads itself, and makes it marshy,\n  And oft 'tis wont in summer to be sickly.\n\nPassing that way the virgin pitiless\n  Land in the middle of the fen descried,\n  Untilled and naked of inhabitants;\n\nThere to escape all human intercourse,\n  She with her servants stayed, her arts to practise\n  And lived, and left her empty body there.\n\nThe men, thereafter, who were scattered round,\n  Collected in that place, which was made strong\n  By the lagoon it had on every side;\n\nThey built their city over those dead bones,\n  And, after her who first the place selected,\n  Mantua named it, without other omen.\n\nIts people once within more crowded were,\n  Ere the stupidity of Casalodi\n  From Pinamonte had received deceit.\n\nTherefore I caution thee, if e'er thou hearest\n  Originate my city otherwise,\n  No falsehood may the verity defraud.\"\n\nAnd I: \"My Master, thy discourses are\n  To me so certain, and so take my faith,\n  That unto me the rest would be spent coals.\n\nBut tell me of the people who are passing,\n  If any one note-worthy thou beholdest,\n  For only unto that my mind reverts.\"\n\nThen said he to me: \"He who from the cheek\n  Thrusts out his beard upon his swarthy shoulders\n  Was, at the time when Greece was void of males,\n\nSo that there scarce remained one in the cradle,\n  An augur, and with Calchas gave the moment,\n  In Aulis, when to sever the first cable.\n\nEryphylus his name was, and so sings\n  My lofty Tragedy in some part or other;\n  That knowest thou well, who knowest the whole of it.\n\nThe next, who is so slender in the flanks,\n  Was Michael Scott, who of a verity\n  Of magical illusions knew the game.\n\nBehold Guido Bonatti, behold Asdente,\n  Who now unto his leather and his thread\n  Would fain have stuck, but he too late repents.\n\nBehold the wretched ones, who left the needle,\n  The spool and rock, and made them fortune-tellers;\n  They wrought their magic spells with herb and image.\n\nBut come now, for already holds the confines\n  Of both the hemispheres, and under Seville\n  Touches the ocean-wave, Cain and the thorns,\n\nAnd yesternight the moon was round already;\n  Thou shouldst remember well it did not harm thee\n  From time to time within the forest deep.\"\n\nThus spake he to me, and we walked the while.\n\n\n\nInferno: Canto XXI\n\n\nFrom bridge to bridge thus, speaking other things\n  Of which my Comedy cares not to sing,\n  We came along, and held the summit, when\n\nWe halted to behold another fissure\n  Of Malebolge and other vain laments;\n  And I beheld it marvellously dark.\n\nAs in the Arsenal of the Venetians\n  Boils in the winter the tenacious pitch\n  To smear their unsound vessels o'er again,\n\nFor sail they cannot; and instead thereof\n  One makes his vessel new, and one recaulks\n  The ribs of that which many a voyage has made;\n\nOne hammers at the prow, one at the stern,\n  This one makes oars, and that one cordage twists,\n  Another mends the mainsail and the mizzen;\n\nThus, not by fire, but by the art divine,\n  Was boiling down below there a dense pitch\n  Which upon every side the bank belimed.\n\nI saw it, but I did not see within it\n  Aught but the bubbles that the boiling raised,\n  And all swell up and resubside compressed.\n\nThe while below there fixedly I gazed,\n  My Leader, crying out: \"Beware, beware!\"\n  Drew me unto himself from where I stood.\n\nThen I turned round, as one who is impatient\n  To see what it behoves him to escape,\n  And whom a sudden terror doth unman,\n\nWho, while he looks, delays not his departure;\n  And I beheld behind us a black devil,\n  Running along upon the crag, approach.\n\nAh, how ferocious was he in his aspect!\n  And how he seemed to me in action ruthless,\n  With open wings and light upon his feet!\n\nHis shoulders, which sharp-pointed were and high,\n  A sinner did encumber with both haunches,\n  And he held clutched the sinews of the feet.\n\nFrom off our bridge, he said: \"O Malebranche,\n  Behold one of the elders of Saint Zita;\n  Plunge him beneath, for I return for others\n\nUnto that town, which is well furnished with them.\n  All there are barrators, except Bonturo;\n  No into Yes for money there is changed.\"\n\nHe hurled him down, and over the hard crag\n  Turned round, and never was a mastiff loosened\n  In so much hurry to pursue a thief.\n\nThe other sank, and rose again face downward;\n  But the demons, under cover of the bridge,\n  Cried: \"Here the Santo Volto has no place!\n\nHere swims one otherwise than in the Serchio;\n  Therefore, if for our gaffs thou wishest not,\n  Do not uplift thyself above the pitch.\"\n\nThey seized him then with more than a hundred rakes;\n  They said: \"It here behoves thee to dance covered,\n  That, if thou canst, thou secretly mayest pilfer.\"\n\nNot otherwise the cooks their scullions make\n  Immerse into the middle of the caldron\n  The meat with hooks, so that it may not float\n\n### Summary:\n\n"}

The\nfifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take\nto get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright\nsearched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This\nprojected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value\nper text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2\nmillion dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text\nfiles per month, or 384 more Etexts in 1997 for a total of 1000+\nIf these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the\ntotal should reach over 100 billion Etexts given away.\n\nThe Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext\nFiles by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]\nThis is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,\nwhich is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001\nshould have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it\nwill require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.\n\n\nWe need your donations more than ever!\n\n\nAll donations should be made to \"Project Gutenberg/CMU\": and are\ntax deductible to the extent allowable by law.

since, for her, to thee not bitter\n  Was death in Utica, where thou didst leave\n  The vesture, that will shine so, the great day.\n\nBy us the eternal edicts are not broken;\n  Since this one lives, and Minos binds not me;\n  But of that circle I, where are the chaste\n\nEyes of thy Marcia, who in looks still prays thee,\n  O holy breast, to hold her as thine own;\n  For her love, then, incline thyself to us.\n\nPermit us through thy sevenfold realm to go;\n  I will take back this grace from thee to her,\n  If to be mentioned there below thou deignest.\"\n\n\"Marcia so pleasing was unto mine eyes\n  While I was on the other side,\" then said he,\n  \"That every grace she wished of me I granted;\n\nNow that she dwells beyond the evil river,\n  She can no longer move me, by that law\n  Which, when I issued forth from there, was made.\n\nBut if a Lady of Heaven do move and rule thee,\n  As thou dost say, no flattery is needful;\n  Let it suffice thee that for her thou ask me.\n\nGo, then, and see thou gird this one about\n  With a smooth rush, and that thou wash his face,\n  So that thou cleanse away all stain therefrom,\n\nFor 'twere not fitting that the eye o'ercast\n  By any mist should go before the first\n  Angel, who is of those of Paradise.\n\nThis little island round about its base\n  Below there, yonder, where the billow beats it,\n  Doth rushes bear upon its washy ooze;\n\nNo other plant that putteth forth the leaf,\n  Or that doth indurate, can there have life,\n  Because it yieldeth not unto the shocks.\n\nThereafter be not this way your return;\n  The sun, which now is rising, will direct you\n  To take the mount by easier ascent.\"\n\nWith this he vanished; and I raised me up\n  Without a word, and wholly drew myself\n  Unto my Guide, and turned mine eyes to him.\n\nAnd he began: \"Son, follow thou my steps;\n  Let us turn back, for on this side declines\n  The plain unto its lower boundaries.\"\n\nThe dawn was vanquishing the matin hour\n  Which fled before it, so that from afar\n  I recognised the trembling of the sea.\n\nAlong the solitary plain we went\n  As one who unto the lost road returns,\n  And till he finds it seems to go in vain.\n\nAs soon as we were come to where the dew\n  Fights with the sun, and, being in a part\n  Where shadow falls, little evaporates,\n\nBoth of his hands upon the grass outspread\n  In gentle manner did my Master place;\n  Whence I, who of his action was aware,\n\nExtended unto him my tearful cheeks;\n  There did he make in me uncovered wholly\n  That hue which Hell had covered up in me.\n\nThen came we down upon the desert shore\n  Which never yet saw navigate its waters\n  Any that afterward had known return.\n\nThere he begirt me as the other pleased;\n  O marvellous! for even as he culled\n  The humble plant, such it sprang up again\n\nSuddenly there where he uprooted it.\n\n\n\nPurgatorio: Canto II\n\n\nAlready had the sun the horizon reached\n  Whose circle of meridian covers o'er\n  Jerusalem with its most lofty point,\n\nAnd night that opposite to him revolves\n  Was issuing forth from Ganges with the Scales\n  That fall from out her hand when she exceedeth;\n\nSo that the white and the vermilion cheeks\n  Of beautiful Aurora, where I was,\n  By too great age were changing into orange.\n\nWe still were on the border of the sea,\n  Like people who are thinking of their road,\n  Who go in heart and with the body stay;\n\nAnd lo! as when, upon the approach of morning,\n  Through the gross vapours Mars grows fiery red\n  Down in the West upon the ocean floor,\n\nAppeared to me--may I again behold it!--\n  A light along the sea so swiftly coming,\n  Its motion by no flight of wing is equalled;\n\nFrom which when I a little had withdrawn\n  Mine eyes, that I might question my Conductor,\n  Again I saw it brighter grown and larger.\n\nThen on each side of it appeared to me\n  I knew not what of white, and underneath it\n  Little by little there came forth another.\n\nMy Master yet had uttered not a word\n  While the first whiteness into wings unfolded;\n  But when he clearly recognised the pilot,\n\nHe cried: \"Make haste, make haste to bow the knee!\n  Behold the Angel of God! fold thou thy hands!\n  Henceforward shalt thou see such officers!\n\nSee how he scorneth human arguments,\n  So that nor oar he wants, nor other sail\n  Than his own wings, between so distant shores.\n\nSee how he holds them pointed up to heaven,\n  Fanning the air with the eternal pinions,\n  That do not moult themselves like mortal hair!\"\n\nThen as still nearer and more near us came\n  The Bird Divine, more radiant he appeared,\n  So that near by the eye could not endure him,\n\nBut down I cast it; and he came to shore\n  With a small vessel, very swift and light,\n  So that the water swallowed naught thereof.\n\nUpon the stern stood the Celestial Pilot;\n  Beatitude seemed written in his face,\n  And more than a hundred spirits sat within.\n\n\"In exitu Israel de Aegypto!\"\n  They chanted all together in one voice,\n  With whatso in that psalm is after written.\n\nThen made he sign of holy rood upon them,\n  Whereat all cast themselves upon the shore,\n  And he departed swiftly as he came.\n\nThe throng which still remained there unfamiliar\n  Seemed with the place, all round about them gazing,\n  As one who in new matters makes essay.\n\nOn every side was darting forth the day.\n  The sun, who had with his resplendent shafts\n  From the mid-heaven chased forth the Capricorn,\n\nWhen the new people lifted up their faces\n  Towards us, saying to us: \"If ye know,\n  Show us the way to go unto the mountain.\"\n\nAnd answer made Virgilius: \"Ye believe\n  Perchance that we have knowledge of this place,\n  But we are strangers even as yourselves.\n\nJust now we came, a little while before you,\n  Another way, which was so rough and steep,\n  That mounting will henceforth seem sport to us.\"\n\nThe souls who had, from seeing me draw breath,\n  Become aware that I was still alive,\n  Pallid in their astonishment became;\n\nAnd as to messenger who bears the olive\n  The people throng to listen to the news,\n  And no one shows himself afraid of crowding,\n\nSo at the sight of me stood motionless\n  Those fortunate spirits, all of them, as if\n  Oblivious to go and make them fair.\n\nOne from among them saw I coming forward,\n  As to embrace me, with such great affection,\n  That it incited me to do the like.\n\nO empty shadows, save in aspect only!\n  Three times behind it did I clasp my hands,\n  As oft returned with them to my own breast!\n\nI think with wonder I depicted me;\n  Whereat the shadow smiled and backward drew;\n  And I, pursuing it, pressed farther forward.\n\nGently it said that I should stay my steps;\n  Then knew I who it was, and I entreated\n  That it would stop awhile to speak with me.\n\nIt made reply to me: \"Even as I loved thee\n  In mortal body, so I love thee free;\n  Therefore I stop; but wherefore goest thou?\"\n\n\"My own Casella! to return once more\n  There where I am, I make this journey,\" said I;\n  \"But how from thee has so much time be taken?\"\n\nAnd he to me: \"No outrage has been done me,\n  If he who takes both when and whom he pleases\n  Has many times denied to me this passage,\n\nFor of a righteous will his own is made.\n  He, sooth to say, for three months past has taken\n  Whoever wished to enter with all peace;\n\nWhence I, who now had turned unto that shore\n  Where salt the waters of the Tiber grow,\n  Benignantly by him have been received.\n\nUnto that outlet now his wing is pointed,\n  Because for evermore assemble there\n  Those who tow'rds Acheron do not descend.\"\n\nAnd I: \"If some new law take not from thee\n  Memory or practice of the song of love,\n  Which used to quiet in me all my longings,\n\nThee may it please to comfort therewithal\n  Somewhat this soul of mine, that with its body\n  Hitherward coming is so much distressed.\"\n\n\"Love, that within my mind discourses with me,\"\n  Forthwith began he so melodiously,\n  The melody within me still is sounding.\n\nMy Master, and myself, and all that people\n  Which with him were, appeared as satisfied\n  As if naught else might touch the mind of any.\n\nWe all of us were moveless and attentive\n  Unto his notes; and lo! the grave old man,\n  Exclaiming: \"What is this, ye laggard spirits?\n\nWhat negligence, what standing still is this?\n  Run to the mountain to strip off the slough,\n  That lets not God be manifest to you.\"\n\nEven as when, collecting grain or tares,\n  The doves, together at their pasture met,\n  Quiet, nor showing their accustomed pride,\n\nIf aught appear of which they are afraid,\n  Upon a sudden leave their food alone,\n  Because they are assailed by greater care;\n\nSo that fresh company did I behold\n  The song relinquish, and go tow'rds the hill,\n  As one who goes, and knows not whitherward;\n\nNor was our own departure less in haste.\n\n\n\nPurgatorio: Canto III\n\n\nInasmuch as the instantaneous flight\n  Had scattered them asunder o'er the plain,\n  Turned to the mountain whither reason spurs us,\n\nI pressed me close unto my faithful comrade,\n  And how without him had I kept my course?\n  Who would have led me up along the mountain?\n\nHe seemed to me within himself remorseful;\n  O noble conscience, and without a stain,\n  How sharp a sting is trivial fault to thee!\n\nAfter his feet had laid aside the haste\n  Which mars the dignity of every act,\n  My mind, that hitherto had been restrained,\n\nLet loose its faculties as if delighted,\n  And I my sight directed to the hill\n  That highest tow'rds the heaven uplifts itself.\n\nThe sun, that in our rear was flaming red,\n  Was broken in front of me into the figure\n  Which had in me the stoppage of its rays;\n\nUnto one side I turned me, with the fear\n  Of being left alone, when I beheld\n  Only in front of me the ground obscured.\n\n\"Why dost thou still mistrust?\" my Comforter\n  Began to say to me turned wholly round;\n  \"Dost thou not think me with thee, and that I guide thee?\n\n'Tis evening there already where is buried\n  The body within which I cast a shadow;\n  'Tis from Brundusium ta'en, and Naples has it.\n\nNow if in front of me no shadow fall,\n  Marvel not at it more than at the heavens,\n  Because one ray impedeth not another\n\nTo suffer torments, both of cold and heat,\n  Bodies like this that Power provides, which wills\n  That how it works be not unveiled to us.\n\nInsane is he who hopeth that our reason\n  Can traverse the illimitable way,\n  Which the one Substance in three Persons follows!\n\nMortals, remain contented at the 'Quia;'\n  For if ye had been able to see all,\n  No need there were for Mary to give birth;\n\nAnd ye have seen desiring without fruit,\n  Those whose desire would have been quieted,\n  Which evermore is given them for a grief.\n\nI speak of Aristotle and of Plato,\n  And many others;\"--and here bowed his head,\n  And more he said not, and remained disturbed.\n\nWe came meanwhile unto the mountain's foot;\n  There so precipitate we found the rock,\n  That nimble legs would there have been in vain.\n\n'Twixt Lerici and Turbia, the most desert,\n  The most secluded pathway is a stair\n  Easy and open, if compared with that.\n\n\"Who knoweth now upon which hand the hill\n  <DW72>s down,\" my Master said, his footsteps staying,\n  \"So that who goeth without wings may mount?\"\n\nAnd while he held his eyes upon the ground\n  Examining the nature of the path,\n  And I was looking up around the rock,\n\nOn the left hand appeared to me a throng\n  Of souls, that moved their feet in our direction,\n  And did not seem to move, they came so slowly.\n\n\"Lift up thine eyes,\" I to the Master said;\n  \"Behold, on this side, who will give us counsel,\n  If thou of thine own self can have it not.\"\n\nThen he looked at me, and with frank expression\n  Replied: \"Let us go there, for they come slowly,\n  And thou be steadfast in thy hope, sweet son.\"\n\nStill was that people as far off from us,\n  After a thousand steps of ours I say,\n  As a good thrower with his hand would reach,\n\nWhen they all crowded unto the hard masses\n  Of the high bank, and motionless stood and close,\n  As he stands still to look who goes in doubt.\n\n\"O happy dead!  O spirits elect already!\"\n  Virgilius made beginning, \"by that peace\n  Which I believe is waiting for you all,\n\nTell us upon what side the mountain <DW72>s,\n  So that the going up be possible,\n  For to lose time irks him most who most knows.\"\n\nAs sheep come issuing forth from out the fold\n  By ones and twos and threes, and the others stand\n  Timidly, holding down their eyes and nostrils,\n\nAnd what the foremost does the others do,\n  Huddling themselves against her, if she stop,\n  Simple and quiet and the wherefore know not;\n\nSo moving to approach us thereupon\n  I saw the leader of that fortunate flock,\n  Modest in face and dignified in gait.\n\nAs soon as those in the advance saw broken\n  The light upon the ground at my right side,\n  So that from me the shadow reached the rock,\n\nThey stopped, and backward drew themselves somewhat;\n  And all the others, who came after them,\n  Not knowing why nor wherefore, did the same.\n\n\"Without your asking, I confess to you\n  This is a human body which you see,\n  Whereby the sunshine on the ground is cleft.\n\nMarvel ye not thereat, but be persuaded\n  That not without a power which comes from Heaven\n  Doth he endeavour to surmount this wall.\"\n\nThe Master thus; and said those worthy people:\n  \"Return ye then, and enter in before us,\"\n  Making a signal with the back o' the hand\n\nAnd one of them began: \"Whoe'er thou art,\n  Thus going turn thine eyes, consider well\n  If e'er thou saw me in the other world.\"\n\nI turned me tow'rds him, and looked at him closely;\n  Blond was he, beautiful, and of noble aspect,\n  But one of his eyebrows had a blow divided.\n\nWhen with humility I had disclaimed\n  E'er having seen him, \"Now behold!\" he said,\n  And showed me high upon his breast a wound.\n\nThen said he with a smile: \"I am Manfredi,\n  The grandson of the Empress Costanza;\n  Therefore, when thou returnest, I beseech thee\n\nGo to my daughter beautiful, the mother\n  Of Sicily's honour and of Aragon's,\n  And the truth tell her, if aught else be told.\n\nAfter I had my body lacerated\n  By these two mortal stabs, I gave myself\n  Weeping to Him, who willingly doth pardon.\n\nHorrible my iniquities had been;\n  But Infinite Goodness hath such ample arms,\n  That it receives whatever turns to it.\n\nHad but Cosenza's pastor, who in chase\n  Of me was sent by Clement at that time,\n  In God read understandingly this page,\n\nThe bones of my dead body still would be\n  At the bridge-head, near unto Benevento,\n  Under the safeguard of the heavy cairn.\n\nNow the rain bathes and moveth them the wind,\n  Beyond the realm, almost beside the Verde,\n  Where he transported them with tapers quenched.\n\nBy malison of theirs is not so lost\n  Eternal Love, that it cannot return,\n  So long as hope has anything of green.\n\nTrue is it, who in contumacy dies\n  Of Holy Church, though penitent at last,\n  Must wait upon the outside this bank\n\nThirty times told the time that he has been\n  In his presumption, unless such decree\n  Shorter by means of righteous prayers become.\n\nSee now if thou hast power to make me happy,\n  By making known unto my good Costanza\n  How thou hast seen me, and this ban beside,\n\nFor those on earth can much advance us here.\"\n\n\n\nPurgatorio: Canto IV\n\n\nWhenever by delight or else by pain,\n  That seizes any faculty of ours,\n  Wholly to that the soul collects itself,\n\nIt seemeth that no other power it heeds;\n  And this against that error is which thinks\n  One soul above another kindles in us.\n\nAnd hence, whenever aught is heard or seen\n  Which keeps the soul intently bent upon it,\n  Time passes on, and we perceive it not,\n\nBecause one faculty is that which listens,\n  And other that which the soul keeps entire;\n  This is as if in bonds, and that is free.\n\nOf this I had experience positive\n  In hearing and in gazing at that spirit;\n  For fifty full degrees uprisen was\n\nThe sun, and I had not perceived it, when\n  We came to where those souls with one accord\n  Cried out unto us: \"Here is what you ask.\"\n\nA greater opening ofttimes hedges up\n  With but a little forkful of his thorns\n  The villager, what time the grape imbrowns,\n\nThan was the passage-way through which ascended\n  Only my Leader and myself behind him,\n  After that company departed from us.\n\nOne climbs Sanleo and descends in Noli,\n  And mounts the summit of Bismantova,\n  With feet alone; but here one needs must fly;\n\nWith the swift pinions and the plumes I say\n  Of great desire, conducted after him\n  Who gave me hope, and made a light for me.\n\nWe mounted upward through the rifted rock,\n  And on each side the border pressed upon us,\n  And feet and hands the ground beneath required.\n\nWhen we were come upon the upper rim\n  Of the high bank, out on the open <DW72>,\n  \"My Master,\" said I, \"what way shall we take?\"\n\nAnd he to me: \"No step of thine descend;\n  Still up the mount behind me win thy way,\n  Till some sage escort shall appear to us.\"\n\nThe summit was so high it vanquished sight,\n  And the hillside precipitous far more\n  Than line from middle quadrant to the centre.\n\nSpent with fatigue was I, when I began:\n  \"O my sweet Father! turn thee and behold\n  How I remain alone, unless thou stay!\"\n\n\"O son,\" he said, \"up yonder drag thyself,\"\n  Pointing me to a terrace somewhat higher,\n  Which on that side encircles all the hill.\n\nThese words of his so spurred me on, that I\n  Strained every nerve, behind him scrambling up,\n  Until the circle was beneath my feet.\n\nThereon ourselves we seated both of us\n  Turned to the East, from which we had ascended,\n  For all men are delighted to look back.\n\nTo the low shores mine eyes I first directed,\n  Then to the sun uplifted them, and wondered\n  That on the left hand we were smitten by it.\n\nThe Poet well perceived that I was wholly\n  Bewildered at the chariot of the light,\n  Where 'twixt us and the Aquilon it entered.\n\nWhereon he said to me: \"If Castor and Pollux\n  Were in the company of yonder mirror,\n  That up and down conducteth with its light,\n\nThou wouldst behold the zodiac's jagged wheel\n  Revolving still more near unto the Bears,\n  Unless it swerved aside from its old track.\n\nHow that may be wouldst thou have power to think,\n  Collected in thyself, imagine Zion\n  Together with this mount on earth to stand,\n\nSo that they both one sole horizon have,\n  And hemispheres diverse; whereby the road\n  Which Phaeton, alas! knew not to drive,\n\nThou'lt see how of necessity must pass\n  This on one side, when that upon the other,\n  If thine intelligence right clearly heed.\"\n\n\"Truly, my Master,\" said I, \"never yet\n  Saw I so clearly as I now discern,\n  There where my wit appeared incompetent,\n\nThat the mid-circle of supernal motion,\n  Which in some art is the Equator called,\n  And aye remains between the Sun and Winter,\n\nFor reason which thou sayest, departeth hence\n  Tow'rds the Septentrion, what time the Hebrews\n  Beheld it tow'rds the region of the heat.\n\nBut, if it pleaseth thee, I fain would learn\n  How far we have to go; for the hill rises\n  Higher than eyes of mine have power to rise.\"\n\nAnd he to me: \"This mount is such, that ever\n  At the beginning down below 'tis tiresome,\n  And aye the more one climbs, the less it hurts.\n\nTherefore, when it shall seem so pleasant to thee,\n  That going up shall be to thee as easy\n  As going down the current in a boat,\n\nThen at this pathway's ending thou wilt be;\n  There to repose thy panting breath expect;\n  No more I answer; and this I know for true.\"\n\nAnd as he finished uttering these words,\n  A voice close by us sounded: \"Peradventure\n  Thou wilt have need of sitting down ere that.\"\n\nAt sound thereof each one of us turned round,\n  And saw upon the left hand a great rock,\n  Which neither I nor he before had noticed.\n\nThither we drew; and there were persons there\n  Who in the shadow stood behind the rock,\n  As one through indolence is wont to stand.\n\nAnd one of them, who seemed to me fatigued,\n  Was sitting down, and both his knees embraced,\n  Holding his face low down between them bowed.\n\n\"O my sweet Lord,\" I said, \"do turn thine eye\n  On him who shows himself more negligent\n  Then even Sloth herself his sister were.\"\n\nThen he turned round to us, and he gave heed,\n  Just lifting up his eyes above his thigh,\n  And said: \"Now go thou up, for thou art valiant.\"\n\nThen knew I who he was; and the distress,\n  That still a little did my breathing quicken,\n  My going to him hindered not; and after\n\nI came to him he hardly raised his head,\n  Saying: \"Hast thou seen clearly how the sun\n  O'er thy left shoulder drives his chariot?\"\n\nHis sluggish attitude and his curt words\n  A little unto laughter moved my lips;\n  Then I began: \"Belacqua, I grieve not\n\nFor thee henceforth; but tell me, wherefore seated\n  In this place art thou?  Waitest thou an escort?\n  Or has thy usual habit seized upon thee?\"\n\nAnd he: \"O brother, what's the use of climbing?\n  Since to my torment would not let me go\n  The Angel of God, who sitteth at the gate.\n\nFirst heaven must needs so long revolve me round\n  Outside thereof, as in my life it did,\n  Since the good sighs I to the end postponed,\n\nUnless, e'er that, some prayer may bring me aid\n  Which rises from a heart that lives in grace;\n  What profit others that in heaven are heard not?\"\n\nMeanwhile the Poet was before me mounting,\n  And saying: \"Come now; see the sun has touched\n  Meridian, and from the shore the night\n\nCovers already with her foot Morocco.\"\n\n\n\nPurgatorio: Canto V\n\n\nI had already from those shades departed,\n  And followed in the footsteps of my Guide,\n  When from behind, pointing his finger at me,\n\nOne shouted: \"See, it seems as if shone not\n  The sunshine on the left of him below,\n  And like one living seems he to conduct him.\"\n\nMine eyes I turned at utterance of these words,\n  And saw them watching with astonishment\n  But me, but me, and the light which was broken!\n\n\"Why doth thy mind so occupy itself,\"\n  The Master said, \"that thou thy pace dost slacken?\n  What matters it to thee what here is whispered?\n\nCome after me, and let the people talk;\n  Stand like a steadfast tower, that never wags\n  Its top for all the blowing of the winds;\n\nFor evermore the man in whom is springing\n  Thought upon thought, removes from him the mark,\n  Because the force of one the other weakens.\"\n\nWhat could I say in answer but \"I come\"?\n  I said it somewhat with that colour tinged\n  Which makes a man of pardon sometimes worthy.\n\nMeanwhile along the mountain-side across\n  Came people in advance of us a little,\n  Singing the Miserere verse by verse.\n\nWhen they became aware I gave no place\n  For passage of the sunshine through my body,\n  They changed their song into a long, hoarse \"Oh!\"\n\nAnd two of them, in form of messengers,\n  Ran forth to meet us, and demanded of us,\n  \"Of your condition make us cognisant.\"\n\nAnd said my Master: \"Ye can go your way\n  And carry back again to those who sent you,\n  That this one's body is of very flesh.\n\nIf they stood still because they saw his shadow,\n  As I suppose, enough is answered them;\n  Him let them honour, it may profit them.\"\n\nVapours enkindled saw I ne'er so swiftly\n  At early nightfall cleave the air serene,\n  Nor, at the set of sun, the clouds of August,\n\nBut upward they returned in briefer time,\n  And, on arriving, with the others wheeled\n  Tow'rds us, like troops that run without a rein.\n\n\"This folk that presses unto us is great,\n  And cometh to implore thee,\" said the Poet;\n  \"So still go onward, and in going listen.\"\n\n\"O soul that goest to beatitude\n  With the same members wherewith thou wast born,\"\n  Shouting they came, \"a little stay thy steps,\n\nLook, if thou e'er hast any of us seen,\n  So that o'er yonder thou bear news of him;\n  Ah, why dost thou go on?  Ah, why not stay?\n\nLong since we all were slain by violence,\n  And sinners even to the latest hour;\n  Then did a light from heaven admonish us,\n\nSo that, both penitent and pardoning, forth\n  From life we issued reconciled to God,\n  Who with desire to see Him stirs our hearts.\"\n\nAnd I: \"Although I gaze into your faces,\n  No one I recognize; but if may please you\n  Aught I have power to do, ye well-born spirits,\n\nSpeak ye, and I will do it, by that peace\n  Which, following the feet of such a Guide,\n  From world to world makes itself sought by me.\"\n\nAnd one began: \"Each one has confidence\n  In thy good offices without an oath,\n  Unless the I cannot cut off the I will;\n\nWhence I, who speak alone before the others,\n  Pray thee, if ever thou dost see the land\n  That 'twixt Romagna lies and that of Charles,\n\nThou be so courteous to me of thy prayers\n  In Fano, that they pray for me devoutly,\n  That I may purge away my grave offences.\n\nFrom thence was I; but the deep wounds, through which\n  Issued the blood wherein I had my seat,\n  Were dealt me in bosom of the Antenori,\n\nThere where I thought to be the most secure;\n  'Twas he of Este had it done, who held me\n  In hatred far beyond what justice willed.\n\nBut if towards the Mira I had fled,\n  When I was overtaken at Oriaco,\n  I still should be o'er yonder where men breathe.\n\nI ran to the lagoon, and reeds and mire\n  Did so entangle me I fell, and saw there\n  A lake made from my veins upon the ground.\"\n\nThen said another: \"Ah, be that desire\n  Fulfilled that draws thee to the lofty mountain,\n  As thou with pious pity aidest mine.\n\nI was of Montefeltro, and am Buonconte;\n  Giovanna, nor none other cares for me;\n  Hence among these I go with downcast front.\"\n\nAnd I to him: \"What violence or what chance\n  Led thee astray so far from Campaldino,\n  That never has thy sepulture been known?\"\n\n\"Oh,\" he replied, \"at Casentino's foot\n  A river crosses named Archiano, born\n  Above the Hermitage in Apennine.\n\nThere where the name thereof becometh void\n  Did I arrive, pierced through and through the throat,\n  Fleeing on foot, and bloodying the plain;\n\nThere my sight lost I, and my utterance\n  Ceased in the name of Mary, and thereat\n  I fell, and tenantless my flesh remained.\n\nTruth will I speak, repeat it to the living;\n  God's Angel took me up, and he of hell\n  Shouted: 'O thou from heaven, why dost thou rob me?\n\nThou bearest away the eternal part of him,\n  For one poor little tear, that takes him from me;\n  But with the rest I'll deal in other fashion!'\n\nWell knowest thou how in the air is gathered\n  That humid vapour which to water turns,\n  Soon as it rises where the cold doth grasp it.\n\nHe joined that evil will, which aye seeks evil,\n  To intellect, and moved the mist and wind\n  By means of power, which his own nature gave;\n\nThereafter, when the day was spent, the valley\n  From Pratomagno to the great yoke covered\n  With fog, and made the heaven above intent,\n\nSo that the pregnant air to water changed;\n  Down fell the rain, and to the gullies came\n  Whate'er of it earth tolerated not;\n\nAnd as it mingled with the mighty torrents,\n  Towards the royal river with such speed\n  It headlong rushed, that nothing held it back.\n\nMy frozen body near unto its outlet\n  The robust Archian found, and into Arno\n  Thrust it, and loosened from my breast the cross\n\nI made of me, when agony o'ercame me;\n  It rolled me on the banks and on the bottom,\n  Then with its booty covered and begirt me.\"\n\n\"Ah, when thou hast returned unto the world,\n  And rested thee from thy long journeying,\"\n  After the second followed the third spirit,\n\n\"Do thou remember me who am the Pia;\n  Siena made me, unmade me Maremma;\n  He knoweth it, who had encircled first,\n\nEspousing me, my finger with his gem.\"\n\n\n\nPurgatorio: Canto VI\n\n\nWhene'er is broken up the game of Zara,\n  He who has lost remains behind despondent,\n  The throws repeating, and in sadness learns;\n\nThe people with the other all depart;\n  One goes in front, and one behind doth pluck him,\n  And at his side one brings himself to mind;\n\nHe pauses not, and this and that one hears;\n  They crowd no more to whom his hand he stretches,\n  And from the throng he thus defends himself.\n\nEven such was I in that dense multitude,\n  Turning to them this way and that my face,\n  And, promising, I freed myself therefrom.\n\nThere was the Aretine, who from the arms\n  Untamed of Ghin di Tacco had his death,\n  And he who fleeing from pursuit was drowned.\n\nThere was imploring with his hands outstretched\n  Frederick Novello, and that one of Pisa\n  Who made the good Marzucco seem so strong.\n\nI saw Count Orso; and the soul divided\n  By hatred and by envy from its body,\n  As it declared, and not for crime committed,\n\nPierre de la Brosse I say; and here provide\n  While still on earth the Lady of Brabant,\n  So that for this she be of no worse flock!\n\nAs soon as I was free from all those shades\n  Who only prayed that some one else may pray,\n  So as to hasten their becoming holy,\n\nBegan I: \"It appears that thou deniest,\n  O light of mine, expressly in some text,\n  That orison can bend decree of Heaven;\n\nAnd ne'ertheless these people pray for this.\n  Might then their expectation bootless be?\n  Or is to me thy saying not quite clear?\"\n\nAnd he to me: \"My writing is explicit,\n  And not fallacious is the hope of these,\n  If with sane intellect 'tis well regarded;\n\nFor top of judgment doth not vail itself,\n  Because the fire of love fulfils at once\n  What he must satisfy who here installs him.\n\nAnd there, where I affirmed that proposition,\n  Defect was not amended by a prayer,\n  Because the prayer from God was separate.\n\nVerily, in so deep a questioning\n  Do not decide, unless she tell it thee,\n  Who light 'twixt truth and intellect shall be.\n\nI know not if thou understand; I speak\n  Of Beatrice; her shalt thou see above,\n  Smiling and happy, on this mountain's top.\"\n\nAnd I: \"Good Leader, let us make more haste,\n  For I no longer tire me as before;\n  And see, e'en now the hill a shadow casts.\"\n\n\"We will go forward with this day\" he answered,\n  \"As far as now is possible for us;\n  But otherwise the fact is than thou thinkest.\n\nEre thou art up there, thou shalt see return\n  Him, who now hides himself behind the hill,\n  So that thou dost not interrupt his rays.\n\nBut yonder there behold! a soul that stationed\n  All, all alone is looking hitherward;\n  It will point out to us the quickest way.\"\n\nWe came up unto it; O Lombard soul,\n  How lofty and disdainful thou didst bear thee,\n  And grand and slow in moving of thine eyes!\n\nNothing whatever did it say to us,\n  But let us go our way, eying us only\n  After the manner of a couchant lion;\n\nStill near to it Virgilius drew, entreating\n  That it would point us out the best ascent;\n  And it replied not unto his demand,\n\nBut of our native land and of our life\n  It questioned us; and the sweet Guide began:\n  \"Mantua,\"--and the shade, all in itself recluse,\n\nRose tow'rds him from the place where first it was,\n  Saying: \"O Mantuan, I am Sordello\n  Of thine own land!\" and one embraced the other.\n\nAh! servile Italy, grief's hostelry!\n  A ship without a pilot in great tempest!\n  No Lady thou of Provinces, but brothel!\n\nThat noble soul was so impatient, only\n  At the sweet sound of his own native land,\n  To make its citizen glad welcome there;\n\nAnd now within thee are not without war\n  Thy living ones, and one doth gnaw the other\n  Of those whom one wall and one fosse shut in!\n\nSearch, wretched one, all round about the shores\n  Thy seaboard, and then look within thy bosom,\n  If any part of thee enjoyeth peace!\n\nWhat boots it, that for thee Justinian\n  The bridle mend, if empty be the saddle?\n  Withouten this the shame would be the less.\n\nAh! people, thou that oughtest to be devout,\n  And to let Caesar sit upon the saddle,\n  If well thou hearest what God teacheth thee,\n\nBehold how fell this wild beast has become,\n  Being no longer by the spur corrected,\n  Since thou hast laid thy hand upon the bridle.\n\nO German Albert! who abandonest\n  Her that has grown recalcitrant and savage,\n  And oughtest to bestride her saddle-bow,\n\nMay a just judgment from the stars down fall\n  Upon thy blood, and be it new and open,\n  That thy successor may have fear thereof;\n\nBecause thy father and thyself have suffered,\n  By greed of those transalpine lands distrained,\n  The garden of the empire to be waste.\n\nCome and behold Montecchi and Cappelletti,\n  Monaldi and Fillippeschi, careless man!\n  Those sad already, and these doubt-depressed!\n\nCome, cruel one! come and behold the oppression\n  Of thy nobility, and cure their wounds,\n  And thou shalt see how safe is Santafiore!\n\nCome and behold thy Rome, that is lamenting,\n  Widowed, alone, and day and night exclaims,\n  \"My Caesar, why hast thou forsaken me?\"\n\nCome and behold how loving are the people;\n  And if for us no pity moveth thee,\n  Come and be made ashamed of thy renown!\n\nAnd if it lawful be, O Jove Supreme!\n  Who upon earth for us wast crucified,\n  Are thy just eyes averted otherwhere?\n\nOr preparation is 't, that, in the abyss\n  Of thine own counsel, for some good thou makest\n  From our perception utterly cut off?\n\nFor all the towns of Italy are full\n  Of tyrants, and becometh a Marcellus\n  Each peasant churl who plays the partisan!\n\nMy Florence! well mayst thou contented be\n  With this digression, which concerns thee not,\n  Thanks to thy people who such forethought take!\n\nMany at heart have justice, but shoot slowly,\n  That unadvised they come not to the bow,\n  But on their very lips thy people have it!\n\nMany refuse to bear the common burden;\n  But thy solicitous people answereth\n  Without being asked, and crieth: \"I submit.\"\n\nNow be thou joyful, for thou hast good reason;\n  Thou affluent, thou in peace, thou full of wisdom!\n  If I speak true, the event conceals it not.\n\nAthens and Lacedaemon, they who made\n  The ancient laws, and were so civilized,\n  Made towards living well a little sign\n\nCompared with thee, who makest such fine-spun\n  Provisions, that to middle of November\n  Reaches not what thou in October spinnest.\n\nHow oft, within the time of thy remembrance,\n  Laws, money, offices, and usages\n  Hast thou remodelled, and renewed thy members?\n\nAnd if thou mind thee well, and see the light,\n  Thou shalt behold thyself like a sick woman,\n  Who cannot find repose upon her down,\n\nBut by her tossing wardeth off her pain.\n\n\n\nPurgatorio: Canto VII\n\n\nAfter the gracious and glad salutations\n  Had three and four times been reiterated,\n  Sordello backward drew and said, \"Who are you?\"\n\n\"Or ever to this mountain were directed\n  The souls deserving to ascend to God,\n  My bones were buried by Octavian.\n\nI am Virgilius; and for no crime else\n  Did I lose heaven, than for not having faith;\"\n  In this wise then my Leader made reply.\n\nAs one who suddenly before him sees\n  Something whereat he marvels, who believes\n  And yet does not, saying, \"It is! it is not!\"\n\nSo he appeared; and then bowed down his brow,\n  And with humility returned towards him,\n  And, where inferiors embrace, embraced him.\n\n\"O glory of the Latians, thou,\" he said,\n  \"Through whom our language showed what it could do\n  O pride eternal of the place I came from,\n\nWhat merit or what grace to me reveals thee?\n  If I to hear thy words be worthy, tell me\n  If thou dost come from Hell, and from what cloister.\"\n\n\"Through all the circles of the doleful realm,\"\n  Responded he, \"have I come hitherward;\n  Heaven's power impelled me, and with that I come.\n\nI by not doing, not by doing, lost\n  The sight of that high sun which thou desirest,\n  And which too late by me was recognized.\n\nA place there is below not sad with torments,\n  But darkness only, where the lamentations\n  Have not the sound of wailing, but are sighs.\n\nThere dwell I with the little innocents\n  Snatched by the teeth of Death, or ever they\n  Were from our human sinfulness exempt.\n\nThere dwell I among those who the three saintly\n  Virtues did not put on, and without vice\n  The others knew and followed all of them.\n\nBut if thou know and can, some indication\n  Give us by which we may the sooner come\n  Where Purgatory has its right beginning.\"\n\nHe answered: \"No fixed place has been assigned us;\n  'Tis lawful for me to go up and round;\n  So far as I can go, as guide I join thee.\n\nBut see already how the day declines,\n  And to go up by night we are not able;\n  Therefore 'tis well to think of some fair sojourn.\n\nSouls are there on the right hand here withdrawn;\n  If thou permit me I will lead thee to them,\n  And thou shalt know them not without delight.\"\n\n\"How is this?\" was the answer; \"should one wish\n  To mount by night would he prevented be\n  By others? or mayhap would not have power?\"\n\nAnd on the ground the good Sordello drew\n  His finger, saying, \"See, this line alone\n  Thou couldst not pass after the sun is gone;\n\nNot that aught else would hindrance give, however,\n  To going up, save the nocturnal darkness;\n  This with the want of power the will perplexes.\n\nWe might indeed therewith return below,\n  And, wandering, walk the hill-side round about,\n  While the horizon holds the day imprisoned.\"\n\nThereon my Lord, as if in wonder, said:\n  \"Do thou conduct us thither, where thou sayest\n  That we can take delight in tarrying.\"\n\nLittle had we withdrawn us from that place,\n  When I perceived the mount was hollowed out\n  In fashion as the valleys here are hollowed.\n\n\"Thitherward,\" said that shade, \"will we repair,\n  Where of itself the hill-side makes a lap,\n  And there for the new day will we await.\"\n\n'Twixt hill and plain there was a winding path\n  Which led us to the margin of that dell,\n  Where dies the border more than half away.\n\nGold and fine silver, and scarlet and pearl-white,\n  The Indian wood resplendent and serene,\n  Fresh emerald the moment it is broken,\n\nBy herbage and by flowers within that hollow\n  Planted, each one in colour would be vanquished,\n  As by its greater vanquished is the less.\n\nNor in that place had nature painted only,\n  But of the sweetness of a thousand odours\n  Made there a mingled fragrance and unknown.\n\n\"Salve Regina,\" on the green and flowers\n  There seated, singing, spirits I beheld,\n  Which were not visible outside the valley.\n\n\"Before the scanty sun now seeks his nest,\"\n  Began the Mantuan who had led us thither,\n  \"Among them do not wish me to conduct you.\n\nBetter from off this ledge the acts and faces\n  Of all of them will you discriminate,\n  Than in the plain below received among them.\n\nHe who sits highest, and the semblance bears\n  Of having what he should have done neglected,\n  And to the others' song moves not his lips,\n\nRudolph the Emperor was, who had the power\n  To heal the wounds that Italy have slain,\n  So that through others slowly she revives.\n\nThe other, who in look doth comfort him,\n  Governed the region where the water springs,\n  The Moldau bears the Elbe, and Elbe the sea.\n\nHis name was Ottocar; and in swaddling-clothes\n  Far better he than bearded Winceslaus\n  His son, who feeds in luxury and ease.\n\nAnd the small-nosed, who close in council seems\n  With him that has an aspect so benign,\n  Died fleeing and disflowering the lily;\n\nLook there, how he is beating at his breast!\n  Behold the other one, who for his cheek\n  Sighing has made of his own palm a bed;\n\nFather and father-in-law of France's Pest\n  Are they, and know his vicious life and lewd,\n  And hence proceeds the grief that so doth pierce them.\n\nHe who appears so stalwart, and chimes in,\n  Singing, with that one of the manly nose,\n  The cord of every valour wore begirt;\n\nAnd if as King had after him remained\n  The stripling who in rear of him is sitting,\n  Well had the valour passed from vase to vase,\n\nWhich cannot of the other heirs be said.\n  Frederick and Jacomo possess the realms,\n  But none the better heritage possesses.\n\nNot oftentimes upriseth through the branches\n  The probity of man; and this He wills\n  Who gives it, so that we may ask of Him.\n\nEke to the large-nosed reach my words, no less\n  Than to the other, Pier, who with him sings;\n  Whence Provence and Apulia grieve already\n\nThe plant is as inferior to its seed,\n  As more than Beatrice and Margaret\n  Costanza boasteth of her husband still.\n\nBehold the monarch of the simple life,\n  Harry of England, sitting there alone;\n  He in his branches has a better issue.\n\nHe who the lowest on the ground among them\n  Sits looking upward, is the Marquis William,\n  For whose sake Alessandria and her war\n\nMake Monferrat and Canavese weep.\"\n\n\n\nPurgatorio: Canto VIII\n\n\n'Twas now the hour that turneth back desire\n  In those who sail the sea, and melts the heart,\n  The day they've said to their sweet friends farewell,\n\nAnd the new pilgrim penetrates with love,\n  If he doth hear from far away a bell\n  That seemeth to deplore the dying day,\n\nWhen I began to make of no avail\n  My hearing, and to watch one of the souls\n  Uprisen, that begged attention with its hand.\n\nIt joined and lifted upward both its palms,\n  Fixing its eyes upon the orient,\n  As if it said to God, \"Naught else I care for.\"\n\n\"Te lucis ante\" so devoutly issued\n  Forth from its mouth, and with such dulcet notes,\n  It made me issue forth from my own mind.\n\nAnd then the others, sweetly and devoutly,\n  Accompanied it through all the hymn entire,\n  Having their eyes on the supernal wheels.\n\nHere, Reader, fix thine eyes well on the truth,\n  For now indeed so subtile is the veil,\n  Surely to penetrate within is easy.\n\nI saw that army of the gentle-born\n  Thereafterward in silence upward gaze,\n  As if in expectation, pale and humble;\n\nAnd from on high come forth and down descend,\n  I saw two Angels with two flaming swords,\n  Truncated and deprived of their points.\n\nGreen as the little leaflets just now born\n  Their garments were, which, by their verdant pinions\n  Beaten and blown abroad, they trailed behind.\n\nOne just above us came to take his station,\n  And one descended to the opposite bank,\n  So that the people were contained between them.\n\nClearly in them discerned I the blond head;\n  But in their faces was the eye bewildered,\n  As faculty confounded by excess.\n\n\"From Mary's bosom both of them have come,\"\n  Sordello said, \"as guardians of the valley\n  Against the serpent, that will come anon.\"\n\nWhereupon I, who knew not by what road,\n  Turned round about, and closely drew myself,\n  Utterly frozen, to the faithful shoulders.\n\nAnd once again Sordello: \"Now descend we\n  'Mid the grand shades, and we will speak to them;\n  Right pleasant will it be for them to see you.\"\n\nOnly three steps I think that I descended,\n  And was below, and saw one who was looking\n  Only at me, as if he fain would know me.\n\nAlready now the air was growing dark,\n  But not so that between his eyes and mine\n  It did not show what it before locked up.\n\nTow'rds me he moved, and I tow'rds him did move;\n  Noble Judge Nino! how it me delighted,\n  When I beheld thee not among the damned!\n\nNo greeting fair was left unsaid between us;\n  Then asked he: \"How long is it since thou camest\n  O'er the far waters to the mountain's foot?\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said I to him, \"through the dismal places\n  I came this morn; and am in the first life,\n  Albeit the other, going thus, I gain.\"\n\nAnd on the instant my reply was heard,\n  He and Sordello both shrank back from me,\n  Like people who are suddenly bewildered.\n\nOne to Virgilius, and the other turned\n  To one who sat there, crying, \"Up, Currado!\n  Come and behold what God in grace has willed!\"\n\nThen, turned to me: \"By that especial grace\n  Thou owest unto Him, who so conceals\n  His own first wherefore, that it has no ford,\n\nWhen thou shalt be beyond the waters wide,\n  Tell my Giovanna that she pray for me,\n  Where answer to the innocent is made.\n\nI do not think her mother loves me more,\n  Since she has laid aside her wimple white,\n  Which she, unhappy, needs must wish again.\n\nThrough her full easily is comprehended\n  How long in woman lasts the fire of love,\n  If eye or touch do not relight it often.\n\nSo fair a hatchment will not make for her\n  The Viper marshalling the Milanese\n  A-field, as would have made Gallura's Cock.\"\n\nIn this wise spake he, with the stamp impressed\n  Upon his aspect of that righteous zeal\n  Which measurably burneth in the heart.\n\nMy greedy eyes still wandered up to heaven,\n  Still to that point where slowest are the stars,\n  Even as a wheel the nearest to its axle.\n\nAnd my Conductor: \"Son, what dost thou gaze at\n  Up there?\"  And I to him: \"At those three torches\n  With which this hither pole is all on fire.\"\n\nAnd he to me: \"The four resplendent stars\n  Thou sawest this morning are down yonder low,\n  And these have mounted up to where those were.\"\n\nAs he was speaking, to himself Sordello\n  Drew him, and said, \"Lo there our Adversary!\"\n  And pointed with his finger to look thither.\n\nUpon the side on which the little valley\n  No barrier hath, a serpent was; perchance\n  The same which gave to Eve the bitter food.\n\n'Twixt grass and flowers came on the evil streak,\n  Turning at times its head about, and licking\n  Its back like to a beast that smoothes itself.\n\nI did not see, and therefore cannot say\n  How the celestial falcons 'gan to move,\n  But well I saw that they were both in motion.\n\nHearing the air cleft by their verdant wings,\n  The serpent fled, and round the Angels wheeled,\n  Up to their stations flying back alike.\n\nThe shade that to the Judge had near approached\n  When he had called, throughout that whole assault\n  Had not a moment loosed its gaze on me.\n\n\"So may the light that leadeth thee on high\n  Find in thine own free-will as much of wax\n  As needful is up to the highest azure,\"\n\nBegan it, \"if some true intelligence\n  Of Valdimagra or its neighbourhood\n  Thou knowest, tell it me, who once was great there.\n\nCurrado Malaspina was I called;\n  I'm not the elder, but from him descended;\n  To mine I bore the love which here refineth.\"\n\n\"O,\" said I unto him, \"through your domains\n  I never passed, but where is there a dwelling\n  Throughout all Europe, where they are not known?\n\nThat fame, which doeth honour to your house,\n  Proclaims its Signors and proclaims its land,\n  So that he knows of them who ne'er was there.\n\nAnd, as I hope for heaven, I swear to you\n  Your honoured family in naught abates\n  The glory of the purse and of the sword.\n\nIt is so privileged by use and nature,\n  That though a guilty head misguide the world,\n  Sole it goes right, and scorns the evil way.\"\n\nAnd he: \"Now go; for the sun shall not lie\n  Seven times upon the pillow which the Ram\n  With all his four feet covers and bestrides,\n\nBefore that such a courteous opinion\n  Shall in the middle of thy head be nailed\n  With greater nails than of another's speech,\n\nUnless the course of justice standeth still.\"\n\n\n\nPurgatorio: Canto IX\n\n\nThe concubine of old Tithonus now\n  Gleamed white upon the eastern balcony,\n  Forth from the arms of her sweet paramour;\n\nWith gems her forehead all relucent was,\n  Set in the shape of that cold animal\n  Which with its tail doth smite amain the nations,\n\nAnd of the steps, with which she mounts, the Night\n  Had taken two in that place where we were,\n  And now the third was bending down its wings;\n\nWhen I, who something had of Adam in me,\n  Vanquished by sleep, upon the grass reclined,\n  There were all five of us already sat.\n\nJust at the hour when her sad lay begins\n  The little swallow, near unto the morning,\n  Perchance in memory of her former woes,\n\nAnd when the mind of man, a wanderer\n  More from the flesh, and less by thought imprisoned,\n  Almost prophetic in its visions is,\n\nIn dreams it seemed to me I saw suspended\n  An eagle in the sky, with plumes of gold,\n  With wings wide open, and intent to stoop,\n\nAnd this, it seemed to me, was where had been\n  By Ganymede his kith and kin abandoned,\n  When to the high consistory he was rapt.\n\nI thought within myself, perchance he strikes\n  From habit only here, and from elsewhere\n  Disdains to bear up any in his feet.\n\nThen wheeling somewhat more, it seemed to me,\n  Terrible as the lightning he descended,\n  And snatched me upward even to the fire.\n\nTherein it seemed that he and I were burning,\n  And the imagined fire did scorch me so,\n  That of necessity my sleep was broken.\n\nNot otherwise Achilles started up,\n  Around him turning his awakened eyes,\n  And knowing not the place in which he was,\n\nWhat time from Chiron stealthily his mother\n  Carried him sleeping in her arms to Scyros,\n  Wherefrom the Greeks withdrew him afterwards,\n\nThan I upstarted, when from off my face\n  Sleep fled away; and pallid I became,\n  As doth the man who freezes with affright.\n\nOnly my Comforter was at my side,\n  And now the sun was more than two hours high,\n  And turned towards the sea-shore was my face.\n\n\"Be not intimidated,\" said my Lord,\n  \"Be reassured, for all is well with us;\n  Do not restrain, but put forth all thy strength.\n\nThou hast at length arrived at Purgatory;\n  See there the cliff that closes it around;\n  See there the entrance, where it seems disjoined.\n\nWhilom at dawn, which doth precede the day,\n  When inwardly thy spirit was asleep\n  Upon the flowers that deck the land below,\n\nThere came a Lady and said: 'I am Lucia;\n  Let me take this one up, who is asleep;\n  So will I make his journey easier for him.'\n\nSordello and the other noble shapes\n  Remained; she took thee, and, as day grew bright,\n  Upward she came, and I upon her footsteps.\n\nShe laid thee here; and first her beauteous eyes\n  That open entrance pointed out to me;\n  Then she and sleep together went away.\"\n\nIn guise of one whose doubts are reassured,\n  And who to confidence his fear doth change,\n  After the truth has been discovered to him,\n\nSo did I change; and when without disquiet\n  My Leader saw me, up along the cliff\n  He moved, and I behind him, tow'rd the height.\n\nReader, thou seest well how I exalt\n  My theme, and therefore if with greater art\n  I fortify it, marvel not thereat.\n\nNearer approached we, and were in such place,\n  That there, where first appeared to me a rift\n  Like to a crevice that disparts a wall,\n\nI saw a portal, and three stairs beneath,\n  Diverse in colour, to go up to it,\n  And a gate-keeper, who yet spake no word.\n\nAnd as I opened more and more mine eyes,\n  I saw him seated on the highest stair,\n  Such in the face that I endured it not.\n\nAnd in his hand he had a naked sword,\n  Which so reflected back the sunbeams tow'rds us,\n  That oft in vain I lifted up mine eyes.\n\n\"Tell it from where you are, what is't you wish?\"\n  Began he to exclaim; \"where is the escort?\n  Take heed your coming hither harm you not!\"\n\n\"A Lady of Heaven, with these things conversant,\"\n  My Master answered him, \"but even now\n  Said to us, 'Thither go; there is the portal.'\"\n\n\"And may she speed your footsteps in all good,\"\n  Again began the courteous janitor;\n  \"Come forward then unto these stairs of ours.\"\n\nThither did we approach; and the first stair\n  Was marble white, so polished and so smooth,\n  I mirrored myself therein as I appear.\n\nThe second, tinct of deeper hue than perse,\n  Was of a calcined and uneven stone,\n  Cracked all asunder lengthwise and across.\n\nThe third, that uppermost rests massively,\n  Porphyry seemed to me, as flaming red\n  As blood that from a vein is spirting forth.\n\nBoth of his feet was holding upon this\n  The Angel of God, upon the threshold seated,\n  Which seemed to me a stone of diamond.\n\nAlong the three stairs upward with good will\n  Did my Conductor draw me, saying: \"Ask\n  Humbly that he the fastening may undo.\"\n\nDevoutly at the holy feet I cast me,\n  For mercy's sake besought that he would open,\n  But first upon my breast three times I smote.\n\nSeven P's upon my forehead he described\n  With the sword's point, and, \"Take heed that thou wash\n  These wounds, when thou shalt be within,\" he said.\n\nAshes, or earth that dry is excavated,\n  Of the same colour were with his attire,\n  And from beneath it he drew forth two keys.\n\nOne was of gold, and the other was of silver;\n  First with the white, and after with the yellow,\n  Plied he the door, so that I was content.\n\n\"Whenever faileth either of these keys\n  So that it turn not rightly in the lock,\"\n  He said to us, \"this entrance doth not open.\n\nMore precious one is, but the other needs\n  More art and intellect ere it unlock,\n  For it is that which doth the knot unloose.\n\nFrom Peter I have them; and he bade me err\n  Rather in opening than in keeping shut,\n  If people but fall down before my feet.\"\n\nThen pushed the portals of the sacred door,\n  Exclaiming: \"Enter; but I give you warning\n  That forth returns whoever looks behind.\"\n\nAnd when upon their hinges were turned round\n  The swivels of that consecrated gate,\n  Which are of metal, massive and sonorous,\n\nRoared not so loud, nor so discordant seemed\n  Tarpeia, when was ta'en from it the good\n  Metellus, wherefore meagre it remained.\n\nAt the first thunder-peal I turned attentive,\n  And \"Te Deum laudamus\" seemed to hear\n  In voices mingled with sweet melody.\n\nExactly such an image rendered me\n  That which I heard, as we are wont to catch,\n  When people singing with the organ stand;\n\nFor now we hear, and now hear not, the words.\n\n\n\nPurgatorio: Canto X\n\n\nWhen we had crossed the threshold of the door\n  Which the perverted love of souls disuses,\n  Because it makes the crooked way seem straight,\n\nRe-echoing I heard it closed again;\n  And if I had turned back mine eyes upon it,\n  What for my failing had been fit excuse?\n\nWe mounted upward through a rifted rock,\n  Which undulated to this side and that,\n  Even as a wave receding and advancing.\n\n\"Here it behoves us use a little art,\"\n  Began my Leader, \"to adapt ourselves\n  Now here, now there, to the receding side.\"\n\nAnd this our footsteps so infrequent made,\n  That sooner had the moon's decreasing disk\n  Regained its bed to sink again to rest,\n\nThan we were forth from out that needle's eye;\n  But when we free and in the open were,\n  There where the mountain backward piles itself,\n\nI wearied out, and both of us uncertain\n  About our way, we stopped upon a plain\n  More desolate than roads across the deserts.\n\nFrom where its margin borders on the void,\n  To foot of the high bank that ever rises,\n  A human body three times told would measure;\n\nAnd far as eye of mine could wing its flight,\n  Now on the left, and on the right flank now,\n  The same this cornice did appear to me.\n\nThereon our feet had not been moved as yet,\n  When I perceived the embankment round about,\n  Which all right of ascent had interdicted,\n\nTo be of marble white, and so adorned\n  With sculptures, that not only Polycletus,\n  But Nature's self, had there been put to shame.\n\nThe Angel, who came down to earth with tidings\n  Of peace, that had been wept for many a year,\n  And opened Heaven from its long interdict,\n\nIn front of us appeared so truthfully\n  There sculptured in a gracious attitude,\n  He did not seem an image that is silent.\n\nOne would have sworn that he was saying, \"Ave;\"\n  For she was there in effigy portrayed\n  Who turned the key to ope the exalted love,\n\nAnd in her mien this language had impressed,\n  \"Ecce ancilla Dei,\" as distinctly\n  As any figure stamps itself in wax.\n\n\"Keep not thy mind upon one place alone,\"\n  The gentle Master said, who had me standing\n  Upon that side where people have their hearts;\n\nWhereat I moved mine eyes, and I beheld\n  In rear of Mary, and upon that side\n  Where he was standing who conducted me,\n\nAnother story on the rock imposed;\n  Wherefore I passed Virgilius and drew near,\n  So that before mine eyes it might be set.\n\nThere sculptured in the self-same marble were\n  The cart and oxen, drawing the holy ark,\n  Wherefore one dreads an office not appointed.\n\nPeople appeared in front, and all of them\n  In seven choirs divided, of two senses\n  Made one say \"No,\" the other, \"Yes, they sing.\"\n\nLikewise unto the smoke of the frankincense,\n  Which there was imaged forth, the eyes and nose\n  Were in the yes and no discordant made.\n\nPreceded there the vessel benedight,\n  Dancing with girded loins, the humble Psalmist,\n  And more and less than King was he in this.\n\nOpposite, represented at the window\n  Of a great palace, Michal looked upon him,\n  Even as a woman scornful and afflicted.\n\nI moved my feet from where I had been standing,\n  To examine near at hand another story,\n  Which after Michal glimmered white upon me.\n\nThere the high glory of the Roman Prince\n  Was chronicled, whose great beneficence\n  Moved Gregory to his great victory;\n\n'Tis of the Emperor Trajan I am speaking;\n  And a poor widow at his bridle stood,\n  In attitude of weeping and of grief.\n\nAround about him seemed it thronged and full\n  Of cavaliers, and the eagles in the gold\n  Above them visibly in the wind were moving.\n\nThe wretched woman in the midst of these\n  Seemed to be saying: \"Give me vengeance, Lord,\n  For my dead son, for whom my heart is breaking.\"\n\nAnd he to answer her: \"Now wait until\n  I shall return.\"  And she: \"My Lord,\" like one\n  In whom grief is impatient, \"shouldst thou not\n\nReturn?\"  And he: \"Who shall be where I am\n  Will give it thee.\"  And she: \"Good deed of others\n  What boots it thee, if thou neglect thine own?\"\n\nWhence he: \"Now comfort thee, for it behoves me\n  That I discharge my duty ere I move;\n  Justice so wills, and pity doth retain me.\"\n\nHe who on no new thing has ever looked\n  Was the creator of this visible language,\n  Novel to us, for here it is not found.\n\nWhile I delighted me in contemplating\n  The images of such humility,\n  And dear to look on for their Maker's sake,\n\n\"Behold, upon this side, but rare they make\n  Their steps,\" the Poet murmured, \"many people;\n  These will direct us to the lofty stairs.\"\n\nMine eyes, that in beholding were intent\n  To see new things, of which they curious are,\n  In turning round towards him were not slow.\n\nBut still I wish not, Reader, thou shouldst swerve\n  From thy good purposes, because thou hearest\n  How God ordaineth that the debt be paid;\n\nAttend not to the fashion of the torment,\n  Think of what follows; think that at the worst\n  It cannot reach beyond the mighty sentence.\n\n\"Master,\" began I, \"that which I behold\n  Moving towards us seems to me not persons,\n  And what I know not, so in sight I waver.\"\n\nAnd he to me: \"The grievous quality\n  Of this their torment bows them so to earth,\n  That my own eyes at first contended with it;\n\nBut look there fixedly, and disentangle\n  By sight what cometh underneath those stones;\n  Already canst thou see how each is stricken.\"\n\nO ye proud Christians! wretched, weary ones!\n  Who, in the vision of the mind infirm\n  Confidence have in your backsliding steps,\n\nDo ye not comprehend that we are worms,\n  Born to bring forth the angelic butterfly\n  That flieth unto judgment without screen?\n\nWhy floats aloft your spirit high in air?\n  Like are ye unto insects undeveloped,\n  Even as the worm in whom formation fails!\n\nAs to sustain a ceiling or a roof,\n  In place of corbel, oftentimes a figure\n  Is seen to join its knees unto its breast,\n\nWhich makes of the unreal real anguish\n  Arise in him who sees it, fashioned thus\n  Beheld I those, when I had ta'en good heed.\n\nTrue is it, they were more or less bent down,\n  According as they more or less were laden;\n  And he who had most patience in his looks\n\nWeeping did seem to say, \"I can no more!\"\n\n\n\nPurgatorio: Canto XI\n\n\n\"Our Father, thou who dwellest in the heavens,\n  Not circumscribed, but from the greater love\n  Thou bearest to the first effects on high,\n\nPraised be thy name and thine omnipotence\n  By every creature, as befitting is\n  To render thanks to thy sweet effluence.\n\nCome unto us the peace of thy dominion,\n  For unto it we cannot of ourselves,\n  If it come not, with all our intellect.\n\nEven as thine own Angels of their will\n  Make sacrifice to thee, Hosanna singing,\n  So may all men make sacrifice of theirs.\n\nGive unto us this day our daily manna,\n  Withouten which in this rough wilderness\n  Backward goes he who toils most to advance.\n\nAnd even as we the trespass we have suffered\n  Pardon in one another, pardon thou\n  Benignly, and regard not our desert.\n\nOur virtue, which is easily o'ercome,\n  Put not to proof with the old Adversary,\n  But thou from him who spurs it so, deliver.\n\nThis last petition verily, dear Lord,\n  Not for ourselves is made, who need it not,\n  But for their sake who have remained behind us.\"\n\nThus for themselves and us good furtherance\n  Those shades imploring, went beneath a weight\n  Like unto that of which we sometimes dream,\n\nUnequally in anguish round and round\n  And weary all, upon that foremost cornice,\n  Purging away the smoke-stains of the world.\n\nIf there good words are always said for us,\n  What may not here be said and done for them,\n  By those who have a good root to their will?\n\nWell may we help them wash away the marks\n  That hence they carried, so that clean and light\n  They may ascend unto the starry wheels!\n\n\"Ah! so may pity and justice you disburden\n  Soon, that ye may have power to move the wing,\n  That shall uplift you after your desire,\n\nShow us on which hand tow'rd the stairs the way\n  Is shortest, and if more than one the passes,\n  Point us out that which least abruptly falls;\n\nFor he who cometh with me, through the burden\n  Of Adam's flesh wherewith he is invested,\n  Against his will is chary of his climbing.\"\n\nThe words of theirs which they returned to those\n  That he whom I was following had spoken,\n  It was not manifest from whom they came,\n\nBut it was said: \"To the right hand come with us\n  Along the bank, and ye shall find a pass\n  Possible for living person to ascend.\n\nAnd were I not impeded by the stone,\n  Which this proud neck of mine doth subjugate,\n  Whence I am forced to hold my visage down,\n\nHim, who still lives and does not name himself,\n  Would I regard, to see if I may know him\n  And make him piteous unto this burden.\n\nA Latian was I, and born of a great Tuscan;\n  Guglielmo Aldobrandeschi was my father;\n  I know not if his name were ever with you.\n\nThe ancient blood and deeds of gallantry\n  Of my progenitors so arrogant made me\n  That, thinking not upon the common mother,\n\nAll men I held in scorn to such extent\n  I died therefor, as know the Sienese,\n  And every child in Campagnatico.\n\nI am Omberto; and not to me alone\n  Has pride done harm, but all my kith and kin\n  Has with it dragged into adversity.\n\nAnd here must I this burden bear for it\n  Till God be satisfied, since I did not\n  Among the living, here among the dead.\"\n\nListening I downward bent my countenance;\n  And one of them, not this one who was speaking,\n  Twisted himself beneath the weight that cramps him,\n\nAnd looked at me, and knew me, and called out,\n  Keeping his eyes laboriously fixed\n  On me, who all bowed down was going with them.\n\n\"O,\" asked I him, \"art thou not Oderisi,\n  Agobbio's honour, and honour of that art\n  Which is in Paris called illuminating?\"\n\n\"Brother,\" said he, \"more laughing are the leaves\n  Touched by the brush of Franco Bolognese;\n  All his the honour now, and mine in part.\n\nIn sooth I had not been so courteous\n  While I was living, for the great desire\n  Of excellence, on which my heart was bent.\n\nHere of such pride is paid the forfeiture;\n  And yet I should not be here, were it not\n  That, having power to sin, I turned to God.\n\nO thou vain glory of the human powers,\n  How little green upon thy summit lingers,\n  If't be not followed by an age of grossness!\n\nIn painting Cimabue thought that he\n  Should hold the field, now Giotto has the cry,\n  So that the other's fame is growing dim.\n\nSo has one Guido from the other taken\n  The glory of our tongue, and he perchance\n  Is born, who from the nest shall chase them both.\n\nNaught is this mundane rumour but a breath\n  Of wind, that comes now this way and now that,\n  And changes name, because it changes side.\n\nWhat fame shalt thou have more, if old peel off\n  From thee thy flesh, than if thou hadst been dead\n  Before thou left the 'pappo' and the 'dindi,'\n\nEre pass a thousand years? which is a shorter\n  Space to the eterne, than twinkling of an eye\n  Unto the circle that in heaven wheels slowest.\n\nWith him, who takes so little of the road\n  In front of me, all Tuscany resounded;\n  And now he scarce is lisped of in Siena,\n\nWhere he was lord, what time was overthrown\n  The Florentine delirium, that superb\n  Was at that day as now 'tis prostitute.\n\nYour reputation is the colour of grass\n  Which comes and goes, and that discolours it\n  By which it issues green from out the earth.\"\n\nAnd I: \"Thy true speech fills my heart with good\n  Humility, and great tumour thou assuagest;\n  But who is he, of whom just now thou spakest?\"\n\n\"That,\" he replied, \"is Provenzan Salvani,\n  And he is here because he had presumed\n  To bring Siena all into his hands.\n\nHe has gone thus, and goeth without rest\n  E'er since he died; such money renders back\n  In payment he who is on earth too daring.\"\n\nAnd I: \"If every spirit who awaits\n  The verge of life before that he repent,\n  Remains below there and ascends not hither,\n\n(Unless good orison shall him bestead,)\n  Until as much time as he lived be passed,\n  How was the coming granted him in largess?\"\n\n\"When he in greatest splendour lived,\" said he,\n  \"Freely upon the Campo of Siena,\n  All shame being laid aside, he placed himself;\n\nAnd there to draw his friend from the duress\n  Which in the prison-house of Charles he suffered,\n  He brought himself to tremble in each vein.\n\nI say no more, and know that I speak darkly;\n  Yet little time shall pass before thy neighbours\n  Will so demean themselves that thou canst gloss it.\n\nThis action has released him from those confines.\"\n\n\n\nPurgatorio: Canto XII\n\n\nAbreast, like oxen going in a yoke,\n  I with that heavy-laden soul went on,\n  As long as the sweet pedagogue permitted;\n\nBut when he said, \"Leave him, and onward pass,\n  For here 'tis good that with the sail and oars,\n  As much as may be, each push on his barque;\"\n\nUpright, as walking wills it, I redressed\n  My person, notwithstanding that my thoughts\n  Remained within me downcast and abashed.\n\nI had moved on, and followed willingly\n  The footsteps of my Master, and we both\n  Already showed how light of foot we were,\n\nWhen unto me he said: \"Cast down thine eyes;\n  'Twere well for thee, to alleviate the way,\n  To look upon the bed beneath thy feet.\"\n\nAs, that some memory may exist of them,\n  Above the buried dead their tombs in earth\n  Bear sculptured on them what they were before;\n\nWhence often there we weep for them afresh,\n  From pricking of remembrance, which alone\n  To the compassionate doth set its spur;\n\nSo saw I there, but of a better semblance\n  In point of artifice, with figures covered\n  Whate'er as pathway from the mount projects.\n\nI saw that one who was created noble\n  More than all other creatures, down from heaven\n  Flaming with lightnings fall upon one side.\n\nI saw Briareus smitten by the dart\n  Celestial, lying on the other side,\n  Heavy upon the earth by mortal frost.\n\nI saw Thymbraeus, Pallas saw, and Mars,\n  Still clad in armour round about their father,\n  Gaze at the scattered members of the giants.\n\nI saw, at foot of his great labour, Nimrod,\n  As if bewildered, looking at the people\n  Who had been proud with him in Sennaar.\n\nO Niobe! with what afflicted eyes\n  Thee I beheld upon the pathway traced,\n  Between thy seven and seven children slain!\n\nO Saul! how fallen upon thy proper sword\n  Didst thou appear there lifeless in Gilboa,\n  That felt thereafter neither rain nor dew!\n\nO mad Arachne! so I thee beheld\n  E'en then half spider, sad upon the shreds\n  Of fabric wrought in evil hour for thee!\n\nO Rehoboam! no more seems to threaten\n  Thine image there; but full of consternation\n  A chariot bears it off, when none pursues!\n\nDisplayed moreo'er the adamantine pavement\n  How unto his own mother made Alcmaeon\n  Costly appear the luckless ornament;\n\nDisplayed how his own sons did throw themselves\n  Upon Sennacherib within the temple,\n  And how, he being dead, they left him there;\n\nDisplayed the ruin and the cruel carnage\n  That Tomyris wrought, when she to Cyrus said,\n  \"Blood didst thou thirst for, and with blood I glut thee!\"\n\nDisplayed how routed fled the Assyrians\n  After that Holofernes had been slain,\n  And likewise the remainder of that slaughter.\n\nI saw there Troy in ashes and in caverns;\n  O Ilion! thee, how abject and debased,\n  Displayed the image that is there discerned!\n\nWhoe'er of pencil master was or stile,\n  That could portray the shades and traits which there\n  Would cause each subtile genius to admire?\n\nDead seemed the dead, the living seemed alive;\n  Better than I saw not who saw the truth,\n  All that I trod upon while bowed I went.\n\nNow wax ye proud, and on with looks uplifted,\n  Ye sons of Eve, and bow not down your faces\n  So that ye may behold your evil ways!\n\nMore of the mount by us was now encompassed,\n  And far more spent the circuit of the sun,\n  Than had the mind preoccupied imagined,\n\nWhen he, who ever watchful in advance\n  Was going on, began: \"Lift up thy head,\n  'Tis no more time to go thus meditating.\n\nLo there an Angel who is making haste\n  To come towards us; lo, returning is\n  From service of the day the sixth handmaiden.\n\nWith reverence thine acts and looks adorn,\n  So that he may delight to speed us upward;\n  Think that this day will never dawn again.\"\n\nI was familiar with his admonition\n  Ever to lose no time; so on this theme\n  He could not unto me speak covertly.\n\nTowards us came the being beautiful\n  Vested in white, and in his countenance\n  Such as appears the tremulous morning star.\n\nHis arms he opened, and opened then his wings;\n  \"Come,\" said he, \"near at hand here are the steps,\n  And easy from henceforth is the ascent.\"\n\nAt this announcement few are they who come!\n  O human creatures, born to soar aloft,\n  Why fall ye thus before a little wind?\n\nHe led us on to where the rock was cleft;\n  There smote upon my forehead with his wings,\n  Then a safe passage promised unto me.\n\nAs on the right hand, to ascend the mount\n  Where seated is the church that lordeth it\n  O'er the well-guided, above Rubaconte,\n\nThe bold abruptness of the ascent is broken\n  By stairways that were made there in the age\n  When still were safe the ledger and the stave,\n\nE'en thus attempered is the bank which falls\n  Sheer downward from the second circle there;\n  But on this, side and that the high rock graze.\n\nAs we were turning thitherward our persons,\n  \"Beati pauperes spiritu,\" voices\n  Sang in such wise that speech could tell it not.\n\nAh me! how different are these entrances\n  From the Infernal! for with anthems here\n  One enters, and below with wild laments.\n\nWe now were hunting up the sacred stairs,\n  And it appeared to me by far more easy\n  Than on the plain it had appeared before.\n\nWhence I: \"My Master, say, what heavy thing\n  Has been uplifted from me, so that hardly\n  Aught of fatigue is felt by me in walking?\"\n\nHe answered: \"When the P's which have remained\n  Still on thy face almost obliterate\n  Shall wholly, as the first is, be erased,\n\nThy feet will be so vanquished by good will,\n  That not alone they shall not feel fatigue,\n  But urging up will be to them delight.\"\n\nThen did I even as they do who are going\n  With something on the head to them unknown,\n  Unless the signs of others make them doubt,\n\nWherefore the hand to ascertain is helpful,\n  And seeks and finds, and doth fulfill the office\n  Which cannot be accomplished by the sight;\n\nAnd with the fingers of the right hand spread\n  I found but six the letters, that had carved\n  Upon my temples he who bore the keys;\n\nUpon beholding which my Leader smiled.\n\n\n\nPurgatorio: Canto XIII\n\n\nWe were upon the summit of the stairs,\n  Where for the second time is cut away\n  The mountain, which ascending shriveth all.\n\nThere in like manner doth a cornice bind\n  The hill all round about, as does the first,\n  Save that its arc more suddenly is curved.\n\nShade is there none, nor sculpture that appears;\n  So seems the bank, and so the road seems smooth,\n  With but the livid colour of the stone.\n\n\"If to inquire we wait for people here,\"\n  The Poet said, \"I fear that peradventure\n  Too much delay will our election have.\"\n\nThen steadfast on the sun his eyes he fixed,\n  Made his right side the centre of his motion,\n  And turned the left part of himself about.\n\n\"O thou sweet light! with trust in whom I enter\n  Upon this novel journey, do thou lead us,\"\n  Said he, \"as one within here should be led.\n\nThou warmest the world, thou shinest over it;\n  If other reason prompt not otherwise,\n  Thy rays should evermore our leaders be!\"\n\nAs much as here is counted for a mile,\n  So much already there had we advanced\n  In little time, by dint of ready will;\n\nAnd tow'rds us there were heard to fly, albeit\n  They were not visible, spirits uttering\n  Unto Love's table courteous invitations,\n\nThe first voice that passed onward in its flight,\n  \"Vinum non habent,\" said in accents loud,\n  And went reiterating it behind us.\n\nAnd ere it wholly grew inaudible\n  Because of distance, passed another, crying,\n  \"I am Orestes!\" and it also stayed not.\n\n\"O,\" said I, \"Father, these, what voices are they?\"\n  And even as I asked, behold the third,\n  Saying: \"Love those from whom ye have had evil!\"\n\nAnd the good Master said: \"This circle scourges\n  The sin of envy, and on that account\n  Are drawn from love the lashes of the scourge.\n\nThe bridle of another sound shall be;\n  I think that thou wilt hear it, as I judge,\n  Before thou comest to the Pass of Pardon.\n\nBut fix thine eyes athwart the air right steadfast,\n  And people thou wilt see before us sitting,\n  And each one close against the cliff is seated.\"\n\nThen wider than at first mine eyes I opened;\n  I looked before me, and saw shades with mantles\n  Not from the colour of the stone diverse.\n\nAnd when we were a little farther onward,\n  I heard a cry of, \"Mary, pray for us!\"\n  A cry of, \"Michael, Peter, and all Saints!\"\n\nI do not think there walketh still on earth\n  A man so hard, that he would not be pierced\n  With pity at what afterward I saw.\n\nFor when I had approached so near to them\n  That manifest to me their acts became,\n  Drained was I at the eyes by heavy grief.\n\nCovered with sackcloth vile they seemed to me,\n  And one sustained the other with his shoulder,\n  And all of them were by the bank sustained.\n\nThus do the blind, in want of livelihood,\n  Stand at the doors of churches asking alms,\n  And one upon another leans his head,\n\nSo that in others pity soon may rise,\n  Not only at the accent of their words,\n  But at their aspect, which no less implores.\n\nAnd as unto the blind the sun comes not,\n  So to the shades, of whom just now I spake,\n  Heaven's light will not be bounteous of itself;\n\nFor all their lids an iron wire transpierces,\n  And sews them up, as to a sparhawk wild\n  Is done, because it will not quiet stay.\n\nTo me it seemed, in passing, to do outrage,\n  Seeing the others without being seen;\n  Wherefore I turned me to my counsel sage.\n\nWell knew he what the mute one wished to say,\n  And therefore waited not for my demand,\n  But said: \"Speak, and be brief, and to the point.\"\n\nI had Virgilius upon that side\n  Of the embankment from which one may fall,\n  Since by no border 'tis engarlanded;\n\nUpon the other side of me I had\n  The shades devout, who through the horrible seam\n  Pressed out the tears so that they bathed their cheeks.\n\nTo them I turned me, and, \"O people, certain,\"\n  Began I, \"of beholding the high light,\n  Which your desire has solely in its care,\n\nSo may grace speedily dissolve the scum\n  Upon your consciences, that limpidly\n  Through them descend the river of the mind,\n\nTell me, for dear 'twill be to me and gracious,\n  If any soul among you here is Latian,\n  And 'twill perchance be good for him I learn it.\"\n\n\"O brother mine, each one is citizen\n  Of one true city; but thy meaning is,\n  Who may have lived in Italy a pilgrim.\"\n\nBy way of answer this I seemed to hear\n  A little farther on than where I stood,\n  Whereat I made myself still nearer heard.\n\nAmong the rest I saw a shade that waited\n  In aspect, and should any one ask how,\n  Its chin it lifted upward like a blind man.\n\n\"Spirit,\" I said, \"who stoopest to ascend,\n  If thou art he who did reply to me,\n  Make thyself known to me by place or name.\"\n\n\"Sienese was I,\" it replied, \"and with\n  The others here recleanse my guilty life,\n  Weeping to Him to lend himself to us.\n\nSapient I was not, although I Sapia\n  Was called, and I was at another's harm\n  More happy far than at my own good fortune.\n\nAnd that thou mayst not think that I deceive thee,\n  Hear if I was as foolish as I tell thee.\n  The arc already of my years descending,\n\nMy fellow-citizens near unto Colle\n  Were joined in battle with their adversaries,\n  And I was praying God for what he willed.\n\nRouted were they, and turned into the bitter\n  Passes of flight; and I, the chase beholding,\n  A joy received unequalled by all others;\n\nSo that I lifted upward my bold face\n  Crying to God, 'Henceforth I fear thee not,'\n  As did the blackbird at the little sunshine.\n\nPeace I desired with God at the extreme\n  Of my existence, and as yet would not\n  My debt have been by penitence discharged,\n\nHad it not been that in remembrance held me\n  Pier Pettignano in his holy prayers,\n  Who out of charity was grieved for me.\n\nBut who art thou, that into our conditions\n  Questioning goest, and hast thine eyes unbound\n  As I believe, and breathing dost discourse?\"\n\n\"Mine eyes,\" I said, \"will yet be here ta'en from me,\n  But for short space; for small is the offence\n  Committed by their being turned with envy.\n\nFar greater is the fear, wherein suspended\n  My soul is, of the torment underneath,\n  For even now the load down there weighs on me.\"\n\nAnd she to me: \"Who led thee, then, among us\n  Up here, if to return below thou thinkest?\"\n  And I: \"He who is with me, and speaks not;\n\nAnd living am I; therefore ask of me,\n  Spirit elect, if thou wouldst have me move\n  O'er yonder yet my mortal feet for thee.\"\n\n\"O, this is such a novel thing to hear,\"\n  She answered, \"that great sign it is God loves thee;\n  Therefore with prayer of thine sometimes assist me.\n\nAnd I implore, by what thou most desirest,\n  If e'er thou treadest the soil of Tuscany,\n  Well with my kindred reinstate my fame.\n\nThem wilt thou see among that people vain\n  Who hope in Talamone, and will lose there\n  More hope than in discovering the Diana;\n\nBut there still more the admirals will lose.\"\n\n\n\nPurgatorio: Canto XIV\n\n\n\"Who is this one that goes about our mountain,\n  Or ever Death has given him power of flight,\n  And opes his eyes and shuts them at his will?\"\n\n\"I know not who, but know he's not alone;\n  Ask him thyself, for thou art nearer to him,\n  And gently, so that he may speak, accost him.\"\n\nThus did two spirits, leaning tow'rds each other,\n  Discourse about me there on the right hand;\n  Then held supine their faces to address me.\n\nAnd said the one: \"O soul, that, fastened still\n  Within the body, tow'rds the heaven art going,\n  For charity console us, and declare\n\nWhence comest and who art thou; for thou mak'st us\n  As much to marvel at this grace of thine\n  As must a thing that never yet has been.\"\n\nAnd I: \"Through midst of Tuscany there wanders\n  A streamlet that is born in Falterona,\n  And not a hundred miles of course suffice it;\n\nFrom thereupon do I this body bring.\n  To tell you who I am were speech in vain,\n  Because my name as yet makes no great noise.\"\n\n\"If well thy meaning I can penetrate\n  With intellect of mine,\" then answered me\n  He who first spake, \"thou speakest of the Arno.\"\n\nAnd said the other to him: \"Why concealed\n  This one the appellation of that river,\n  Even as a man doth of things horrible?\"\n\nAnd thus the shade that questioned was of this\n  Himself acquitted: \"I know not; but truly\n  'Tis fit the name of such a valley perish;\n\nFor from its fountain-head (where is so pregnant\n  The Alpine mountain whence is cleft Peloro\n  That in few places it that mark surpasses)\n\nTo where it yields itself in restoration\n  Of what the heaven doth of the sea dry up,\n  Whence have the rivers that which goes with them,\n\nVirtue is like an enemy avoided\n  By all, as is a serpent, through misfortune\n  Of place, or through bad habit that impels them;\n\nOn which account have so transformed their nature\n  The dwellers in that miserable valley,\n  It seems that Circe had them in her pasture.\n\n'Mid ugly swine, of acorns worthier\n  Than other food for human use created,\n  It first directeth its impoverished way.\n\nCurs findeth it thereafter, coming downward,\n  More snarling than their puissance demands,\n  And turns from them disdainfully its muzzle.\n\nIt goes on falling, and the more it grows,\n  The more it finds the dogs becoming wolves,\n  This maledict and misadventurous ditch.\n\nDescended then through many a hollow gulf,\n  It finds the foxes so replete with fraud,\n  They fear no cunning that may master them.\n\nNor will I cease because another hears me;\n  And well 'twill be for him, if still he mind him\n  Of what a truthful spirit to me unravels.\n\nThy grandson I behold, who doth become\n  A hunter of those wolves upon the bank\n  Of the wild stream, and terrifies them all.\n\nHe sells their flesh, it being yet alive;\n  Thereafter slaughters them like ancient beeves;\n  Many of life, himself of praise, deprives.\n\nBlood-stained he issues from the dismal forest;\n  He leaves it such, a thousand years from now\n  In its primeval state 'tis not re-wooded.\"\n\nAs at the announcement of impending ills\n  The face of him who listens is disturbed,\n  From whate'er side the peril seize upon him;\n\nSo I beheld that other soul, which stood\n  Turned round to listen, grow disturbed and sad,\n  When it had gathered to itself the word.\n\nThe speech of one and aspect of the other\n  Had me desirous made to know their names,\n  And question mixed with prayers I made thereof,\n\nWhereat the spirit which first spake to me\n  Began again: \"Thou wishest I should bring me\n  To do for thee what thou'lt not do for me;\n\nBut since God willeth that in thee shine forth\n  Such grace of his, I'll not be chary with thee;\n  Know, then, that I Guido del Duca am.\n\nMy blood was so with envy set on fire,\n  That if I had beheld a man make merry,\n  Thou wouldst have seen me sprinkled o'er with pallor.\n\nFrom my own sowing such the straw I reap!\n  O human race! why dost thou set thy heart\n  Where interdict of partnership must be?\n\nThis is Renier; this is the boast and honour\n  Of the house of Calboli, where no one since\n  Has made himself the heir of his desert.\n\nAnd not alone his blood is made devoid,\n  'Twixt Po and mount, and sea-shore and the Reno,\n  Of good required for truth and for diversion;\n\nFor all within these boundaries is full\n  Of venomous roots, so that too tardily\n  By cultivation now would they diminish.\n\nWhere is good Lizio, and Arrigo Manardi,\n  Pier Traversaro, and Guido di Carpigna,\n  O Romagnuoli into bastards turned?\n\nWhen in Bologna will a Fabbro rise?\n  When in Faenza a Bernardin di Fosco,\n  The noble scion of ignoble seed?\n\nBe not astonished, Tuscan, if I weep,\n  When I remember, with Guido da Prata,\n  Ugolin d' Azzo, who was living with us,\n\nFrederick Tignoso and his company,\n  The house of Traversara, and th' Anastagi,\n  And one race and the other is extinct;\n\nThe dames and cavaliers, the toils and ease\n  That filled our souls with love and courtesy,\n  There where the hearts have so malicious grown!\n\nO Brettinoro! why dost thou not flee,\n  Seeing that all thy family is gone,\n  And many people, not to be corrupted?\n\nBagnacaval does well in not begetting\n  And ill does Castrocaro, and Conio worse,\n  In taking trouble to beget such Counts.\n\nWill do well the Pagani, when their Devil\n  Shall have departed; but not therefore pure\n  Will testimony of them e'er remain.\n\nO Ugolin de' Fantoli, secure\n  Thy name is, since no longer is awaited\n  One who, degenerating, can obscure it!\n\nBut go now, Tuscan, for it now delights me\n  To weep far better than it does to speak,\n  So much has our discourse my mind distressed.\"\n\nWe were aware that those beloved souls\n  Heard us depart; therefore, by keeping silent,\n  They made us of our pathway confident.\n\nWhen we became alone by going onward,\n  Thunder, when it doth cleave the air, appeared\n  A voice, that counter to us came, exclaiming:\n\n\"Shall slay me whosoever findeth me!\"\n  And fled as the reverberation dies\n  If suddenly the cloud asunder bursts.\n\nAs soon as hearing had a truce from this,\n  Behold another, with so great a crash,\n  That it resembled thunderings following fast:\n\n\"I am Aglaurus, who became a stone!\"\n  And then, to press myself close to the Poet,\n  I backward, and not forward, took a step.\n\nAlready on all sides the air was quiet;\n  And said he to me: \"That was the hard curb\n  That ought to hold a man within his bounds;\n\nBut you take in the bait so that the hook\n  Of the old Adversary draws you to him,\n  And hence availeth little curb or call.\n\nThe heavens are calling you, and wheel around you,\n  Displaying to you their eternal beauties,\n  And still your eye is looking on the ground;\n\nWhence He, who all discerns, chastises you.\"\n\n\n\nPurgatorio: Canto XV\n\n\nAs much as 'twixt the close of the third hour\n  And dawn of day appeareth of that sphere\n  Which aye in fashion of a child is playing,\n\nSo much it now appeared, towards the night,\n  Was of his course remaining to the sun;\n  There it was evening, and 'twas midnight here;\n\nAnd the rays smote the middle of our faces,\n  Because by us the mount was so encircled,\n  That straight towards the west we now were going\n\nWhen I perceived my forehead overpowered\n  Beneath the splendour far more than at first,\n  And stupor were to me the things unknown,\n\nWhereat towards the summit of my brow\n  I raised my hands, and made myself the visor\n  Which the excessive glare diminishes.\n\nAs when from off the water, or a mirror,\n  The sunbeam leaps unto the opposite side,\n  Ascending upward in the selfsame measure\n\nThat it descends, and deviates as far\n  From falling of a stone in line direct,\n  (As demonstrate experiment and art,)\n\nSo it appeared to me that by a light\n  Refracted there before me I was smitten;\n  On which account my sight was swift to flee.\n\n\"What is that, Father sweet, from which I cannot\n  So fully screen my sight that it avail me,\"\n  Said I, \"and seems towards us to be moving?\"\n\n\"Marvel thou not, if dazzle thee as yet\n  The family of heaven,\" he answered me;\n  \"An angel 'tis, who comes to invite us upward.\n\nSoon will it be, that to behold these things\n  Shall not be grievous, but delightful to thee\n  As much as nature fashioned thee to feel.\"\n\nWhen we had reached the Angel benedight,\n  With joyful voice he said: \"Here enter in\n  To stairway far less steep than are the others.\"\n\nWe mounting were, already thence departed,\n  And \"Beati misericordes\" was\n  Behind us sung, \"Rejoice, thou that o'ercomest!\"\n\nMy Master and myself, we two alone\n  Were going upward, and I thought, in going,\n  Some profit to acquire from words of his;\n\nAnd I to him directed me, thus asking:\n  \"What did the spirit of Romagna mean,\n  Mentioning interdict and partnership?\"\n\nWhence he to me: \"Of his own greatest failing\n  He knows the harm; and therefore wonder not\n  If he reprove us, that we less may rue it.\n\nBecause are thither pointed your desires\n  Where by companionship each share is lessened,\n  Envy doth ply the bellows to your sighs.\n\nBut if the love of the supernal sphere\n  Should upwardly direct your aspiration,\n  There would not be that fear within your breast;\n\nFor there, as much the more as one says 'Our,'\n  So much the more of good each one possesses,\n  And more of charity in that cloister burns.\"\n\n\"I am more hungering to be satisfied,\"\n  I said, \"than if I had before been silent,\n  And more of doubt within my mind I gather.\n\nHow can it be, that boon distributed\n  The more possessors can more wealthy make\n  Therein, than if by few it be possessed?\"\n\nAnd he to me: \"Because thou fixest still\n  Thy mind entirely upon earthly things,\n  Thou pluckest darkness from the very light.\n\nThat goodness infinite and ineffable\n  Which is above there, runneth unto love,\n  As to a lucid body comes the sunbeam.\n\nSo much it gives itself as it finds ardour,\n  So that as far as charity extends,\n  O'er it increases the eternal valour.\n\nAnd the more people thitherward aspire,\n  More are there to love well, and more they love there,\n  And, as a mirror, one reflects the other.\n\nAnd if my reasoning appease thee not,\n  Thou shalt see Beatrice; and she will fully\n  Take from thee this and every other longing.\n\nEndeavour, then, that soon may be extinct,\n  As are the two already, the five wounds\n  That close themselves again by being painful.\"\n\nEven as I wished to say, \"Thou dost appease me,\"\n  I saw that I had reached another circle,\n  So that my eager eyes made me keep silence.\n\nThere it appeared to me that in a vision\n  Ecstatic on a sudden I was rapt,\n  And in a temple many persons saw;\n\nAnd at the door a woman, with the sweet\n  Behaviour of a mother, saying: \"Son,\n  Why in this manner hast thou dealt with us?\n\nLo, sorrowing, thy father and myself\n  Were seeking for thee;\"--and as here she ceased,\n  That which appeared at first had disappeared.\n\nThen I beheld another with those waters\n  Adown her cheeks which grief distils whenever\n  From great disdain of others it is born,\n\nAnd saying: \"If of that city thou art lord,\n  For whose name was such strife among the gods,\n  And whence doth every science scintillate,\n\nAvenge thyself on those audacious arms\n  That clasped our daughter, O Pisistratus;\"\n  And the lord seemed to me benign and mild\n\nTo answer her with aspect temperate:\n  \"What shall we do to those who wish us ill,\n  If he who loves us be by us condemned?\"\n\nThen saw I people hot in fire of wrath,\n  With stones a young man slaying, clamorously\n  Still crying to each other, \"Kill him! kill him!\"\n\nAnd him I saw bow down, because of death\n  That weighed already on him, to the earth,\n  But of his eyes made ever gates to heaven,\n\nImploring the high Lord, in so great strife,\n  That he would pardon those his persecutors,\n  With such an aspect as unlocks compassion.\n\nSoon as my soul had outwardly returned\n  To things external to it which are true,\n  Did I my not false errors recognize.\n\nMy Leader, who could see me bear myself\n  Like to a man that rouses him from sleep,\n  Exclaimed: \"What ails thee, that thou canst not stand?\n\nBut hast been coming more than half a league\n  Veiling thine eyes, and with thy legs entangled,\n  In guise of one whom wine or sleep subdues?\"\n\n\"O my sweet Father, if thou listen to me,\n  I'll tell thee,\" said I, \"what appeared to me,\n  When thus from me my legs were ta'en away.\"\n\nAnd he: \"If thou shouldst have a hundred masks\n  Upon thy face, from me would not be shut\n  Thy cogitations, howsoever small.\n\nWhat thou hast seen was that thou mayst not fail\n  To ope thy heart unto the waters of peace,\n  Which from the eternal fountain are diffused.\n\nI did not ask, 'What ails thee?' as he does\n  Who only looketh with the eyes that see not\n  When of the soul bereft the body lies,\n\nBut asked it to give vigour to thy feet;\n  Thus must we needs urge on the sluggards, slow\n  To use their wakefulness when it returns.\"\n\nWe passed along, athwart the twilight peering\n  Forward as far as ever eye could stretch\n  Against the sunbeams serotine and lucent;\n\nAnd lo! by slow degrees a smoke approached\n  In our direction, sombre as the night,\n  Nor was there place to hide one's self therefrom.\n\nThis of our eyes and the pure air bereft us.\n\n\n\nPurgatorio: Canto XVI\n\n\nDarkness of hell, and of a night deprived\n  Of every planet under a poor sky,\n  As much as may be tenebrous with cloud,\n\nNe'er made unto my sight so thick a veil,\n  As did that smoke which there enveloped us,\n  Nor to the feeling of so rough a texture;\n\nFor not an eye it suffered to stay open;\n  Whereat mine escort, faithful and sagacious,\n  Drew near to me and offered me his shoulder.\n\nE'en as a blind man goes behind his guide,\n  Lest he should wander, or should strike against\n  Aught that may harm or peradventure kill him,\n\nSo went I through the bitter and foul air,\n  Listening unto my Leader, who said only,\n  \"Look that from me thou be not separated.\"\n\nVoices I heard, and every one appeared\n  To supplicate for peace and misericord\n  The Lamb of God who takes away our sins.\n\nStill \"Agnus Dei\" their exordium was;\n  One word there was in all, and metre one,\n  So that all harmony appeared among them.\n\n\"Master,\" I said, \"are spirits those I hear?\"\n  And he to me: \"Thou apprehendest truly,\n  And they the knot of anger go unloosing.\"\n\n\"Now who art thou, that cleavest through our smoke\n  And art discoursing of us even as though\n  Thou didst by calends still divide the time?\"\n\nAfter this manner by a voice was spoken;\n  Whereon my Master said: \"Do thou reply,\n  And ask if on this side the way go upward.\"\n\nAnd I: \"O creature that dost cleanse thyself\n  To return beautiful to Him who made thee,\n  Thou shalt hear marvels if thou follow me.\"\n\n\"Thee will I follow far as is allowed me,\"\n  He answered; \"and if smoke prevent our seeing,\n  Hearing shall keep us joined instead thereof.\"\n\nThereon began I: \"With that swathing band\n  Which death unwindeth am I going upward,\n  And hither came I through the infernal anguish.\n\nAnd if God in his grace has me infolded,\n  So that he wills that I behold his court\n  By method wholly out of modern usage,\n\nConceal not from me who ere death thou wast,\n  But tell it me, and tell me if I go\n  Right for the pass, and be thy words our escort.\"\n\n\"Lombard was I, and I was Marco called;\n  The world I knew, and loved that excellence,\n  At which has each one now unbent his bow.\n\nFor mounting upward, thou art going right.\"\n  Thus he made answer, and subjoined: \"I pray thee\n  To pray for me when thou shalt be above.\"\n\nAnd I to him: \"My faith I pledge to thee\n  To do what thou dost ask me; but am bursting\n  Inly with doubt, unless I rid me of it.\n\nFirst it was simple, and is now made double\n  By thy opinion, which makes certain to me,\n  Here and elsewhere, that which I couple with it.\n\nThe world forsooth is utterly deserted\n  By every virtue, as thou tellest me,\n  And with iniquity is big and covered;\n\nBut I beseech thee point me out the cause,\n  That I may see it, and to others show it;\n  For one in the heavens, and here below one puts it.\"\n\nA sigh profound, that grief forced into Ai!\n  He first sent forth, and then began he: \"Brother,\n  The world is blind, and sooth thou comest from it!\n\nYe who are living every cause refer\n  Still upward to the heavens, as if all things\n  They of necessity moved with themselves.\n\nIf this were so, in you would be destroyed\n  Free will, nor any justice would there be\n  In having joy for good, or grief for evil.\n\nThe heavens your movements do initiate,\n  I say not all; but granting that I say it,\n  Light has been given you for good and evil,\n\nAnd free volition; which, if some fatigue\n  In the first battles with the heavens it suffers,\n  Afterwards conquers all, if well 'tis nurtured.\n\nTo greater force and to a better nature,\n  Though free, ye subject are, and that creates\n  The mind in you the heavens have not in charge.\n\nHence, if the present world doth go astray,\n  In you the cause is, be it sought in you;\n  And I therein will now be thy true spy.\n\nForth from the hand of Him, who fondles it\n  Before it is, like to a little girl\n  Weeping and laughing in her childish sport,\n\nIssues the simple soul, that nothing knows,\n  Save that, proceeding from a joyous Maker,\n  Gladly it turns to that which gives it pleasure.\n\nOf trivial good at first it tastes the savour;\n  Is cheated by it, and runs after it,\n  If guide or rein turn not aside its love.\n\nHence it behoved laws for a rein to place,\n  Behoved a king to have, who at the least\n  Of the true city should discern the tower.\n\nThe laws exist, but who sets hand to them?\n  No one; because the shepherd who precedes\n  Can ruminate, but cleaveth not the hoof;\n\nWherefore the people that perceives its guide\n  Strike only at the good for which it hankers,\n  Feeds upon that, and farther seeketh not.\n\nClearly canst thou perceive that evil guidance\n  The cause is that has made the world depraved,\n  And not that nature is corrupt in you.\n\nRome, that reformed the world, accustomed was\n  Two suns to have, which one road and the other,\n  Of God and of the world, made manifest.\n\nOne has the other quenched, and to the crosier\n  The sword is joined, and ill beseemeth it\n  That by main force one with the other go,\n\nBecause, being joined, one feareth not the other;\n  If thou believe not, think upon the grain,\n  For by its seed each herb is recognized.\n\nIn the land laved by Po and Adige,\n  Valour and courtesy used to be found,\n  Before that Frederick had his controversy;\n\nNow in security can pass that way\n  Whoever will abstain, through sense of shame,\n  From speaking with the good, or drawing near them.\n\nTrue, three old men are left, in whom upbraids\n  The ancient age the new, and late they deem it\n  That God restore them to the better life:\n\nCurrado da Palazzo, and good Gherardo,\n  And Guido da Castel, who better named is,\n  In fashion of the French, the simple Lombard:\n\nSay thou henceforward that the Church of Rome,\n  Confounding in itself two governments,\n  Falls in the mire, and soils itself and burden.\"\n\n\"O Marco mine,\" I said, \"thou reasonest well;\n  And now discern I why the sons of Levi\n  Have been excluded from the heritage.\n\nBut what Gherardo is it, who, as sample\n  Of a lost race, thou sayest has remained\n  In reprobation of the barbarous age?\"\n\n\"Either thy speech deceives me, or it tempts me,\"\n  He answered me; \"for speaking Tuscan to me,\n  It seems of good Gherardo naught thou knowest.\n\nBy other surname do I know him not,\n  Unless I take it from his daughter Gaia.\n  May God be with you, for I come no farther.\n\nBehold the dawn, that through the smoke rays out,\n  Already whitening; and I must depart--\n  Yonder the Angel is--ere he appear.\"\n\nThus did he speak, and would no farther hear me.\n\n\n\nPurgatorio: Canto XVII\n\n\nRemember, Reader, if e'er in the Alps\n  A mist o'ertook thee, through which thou couldst see\n  Not otherwise than through its membrane mole,\n\nHow, when the vapours humid and condensed\n  Begin to dissipate themselves, the sphere\n  Of the sun feebly enters in among them,\n\nAnd thy imagination will be swift\n  In coming to perceive how I re-saw\n  The sun at first, that was already setting.\n\nThus, to the faithful footsteps of my Master\n  Mating mine own, I issued from that cloud\n  To rays already dead on the low shores.\n\nO thou, Imagination, that dost steal us\n  So from without sometimes, that man perceives not,\n  Although around may sound a thousand trumpets,\n\nWho moveth thee, if sense impel thee not?\n  Moves thee a light, which in the heaven takes form,\n  By self, or by a will that downward guides it.\n\nOf her impiety, who changed her form\n  Into the bird that most delights in singing,\n  In my imagining appeared the trace;\n\nAnd hereupon my mind was so withdrawn\n  Within itself, that from without there came\n  Nothing that then might be received by it.\n\nThen reigned within my lofty fantasy\n  One crucified, disdainful and ferocious\n  In countenance, and even thus was dying.\n\nAround him were the great Ahasuerus,\n  Esther his wife, and the just Mordecai,\n  Who was in word and action so entire.\n\nAnd even as this image burst asunder\n  Of its own self, in fashion of a bubble\n  In which the water it was made of fails,\n\nThere rose up in my vision a young maiden\n  Bitterly weeping, and she said: \"O queen,\n  Why hast thou wished in anger to be naught?\n\nThou'st slain thyself, Lavinia not to lose;\n  Now hast thou lost me; I am she who mourns,\n  Mother, at thine ere at another's ruin.\"\n\nAs sleep is broken, when upon a sudden\n  New light strikes in upon the eyelids closed,\n  And broken quivers ere it dieth wholly,\n\nSo this imagining of mine fell down\n  As soon as the effulgence smote my face,\n  Greater by far than what is in our wont.\n\nI turned me round to see where I might be,\n  When said a voice, \"Here is the passage up;\"\n  Which from all other purposes removed me,\n\nAnd made my wish so full of eagerness\n  To look and see who was it that was speaking,\n  It never rests till meeting face to face;\n\nBut as before the sun, which quells the sight,\n  And in its own excess its figure veils,\n  Even so my power was insufficient here.\n\n\"This is a spirit divine, who in the way\n  Of going up directs us without asking,\n  And who with his own light himself conceals.\n\nHe does with us as man doth with himself;\n  For he who sees the need, and waits the asking,\n  Malignly leans already tow'rds denial.\n\nAccord we now our feet to such inviting,\n  Let us make haste to mount ere it grow dark;\n  For then we could not till the day return.\"\n\nThus my Conductor said; and I and he\n  Together turned our footsteps to a stairway;\n  And I, as soon as the first step I reached,\n\nNear me perceived a motion as of wings,\n  And fanning in the face, and saying, \"'Beati\n  Pacifici,' who are without ill anger.\"\n\nAlready over us were so uplifted\n  The latest sunbeams, which the night pursues,\n  That upon many sides the stars appeared.\n\n\"O manhood mine, why dost thou vanish so?\"\n  I said within myself; for I perceived\n  The vigour of my legs was put in truce.\n\nWe at the point were where no more ascends\n  The stairway upward, and were motionless,\n  Even as a ship, which at the shore arrives;\n\nAnd I gave heed a little, if I might hear\n  Aught whatsoever in the circle new;\n  Then to my Master turned me round and said:\n\n\"Say, my sweet Father, what delinquency\n  Is purged here in the circle where we are?\n  Although our feet may pause, pause not thy speech.\"\n\nAnd he to me: \"The love of good, remiss\n  In what it should have done, is here restored;\n  Here plied again the ill-belated oar;\n\nBut still more openly to understand,\n  Turn unto me thy mind, and thou shalt gather\n  Some profitable fruit from our delay.\n\nNeither Creator nor a creature ever,\n  Son,\" he began, \"was destitute of love\n  Natural or spiritual; and thou knowest it.\n\nThe natural was ever without error;\n  But err the other may by evil object,\n  Or by too much, or by too little vigour.\n\nWhile in the first it well directed is,\n  And in the second moderates itself,\n  It cannot be the cause of sinful pleasure;\n\nBut when to ill it turns, and, with more care\n  Or lesser than it ought, runs after good,\n  'Gainst the Creator works his own creation.\n\nHence thou mayst comprehend that love must be\n  The seed within yourselves of every virtue,\n  And every act that merits punishment.\n\nNow inasmuch as never from the welfare\n  Of its own subject can love turn its sight,\n  From their own hatred all things are secure;\n\nAnd since we cannot think of any being\n  Standing alone, nor from the First divided,\n  Of hating Him is all desire cut off.\n\nHence if, discriminating, I judge well,\n  The evil that one loves is of one's neighbour,\n  And this is born in three modes in your clay.\n\nThere are, who, by abasement of their neighbour,\n  Hope to excel, and therefore only long\n  That from his greatness he may be cast down;\n\nThere are, who power, grace, honour, and renown\n  Fear they may lose because another rises,\n  Thence are so sad that the reverse they love;\n\nAnd there are those whom injury seems to chafe,\n  So that it makes them greedy for revenge,\n  And such must needs shape out another's harm.\n\nThis threefold love is wept for down below;\n  Now of the other will I have thee hear,\n  That runneth after good with measure faulty.\n\nEach one confusedly a good conceives\n  Wherein the mind may rest, and longeth for it;\n  Therefore to overtake it each one strives.\n\nIf languid love to look on this attract you,\n  Or in attaining unto it, this cornice,\n  After just penitence, torments you for it.\n\nThere's other good that does not make man happy;\n  'Tis not felicity, 'tis not the good\n  Essence, of every good the fruit and root.\n\nThe love that yields itself too much to this\n  Above us is lamented in three circles;\n  But how tripartite it may be described,\n\nI say not, that thou seek it for thyself.\"\n\n\n\nPurgatorio: Canto XVIII\n\n\nAn end had put unto his reasoning\n  The lofty Teacher, and attent was looking\n  Into my face, if I appeared content;\n\nAnd I, whom a new thirst still goaded on,\n  Without was mute, and said within: \"Perchance\n  The too much questioning I make annoys him.\"\n\nBut that true Father, who had comprehended\n  The timid wish, that opened not itself,\n  By speaking gave me hardihood to speak.\n\nWhence I: \"My sight is, Master, vivified\n  So in thy light, that clearly I discern\n  Whate'er thy speech importeth or describes.\n\nTherefore I thee entreat, sweet Father dear,\n  To teach me love, to which thou dost refer\n  Every good action and its contrary.\"\n\n\"Direct,\" he said, \"towards me the keen eyes\n  Of intellect, and clear will be to thee\n  The error of the blind, who would be leaders.\n\nThe soul, which is created apt to love,\n  Is mobile unto everything that pleases,\n  Soon as by pleasure she is waked to action.\n\nYour apprehension from some real thing\n  An image draws, and in yourselves displays it\n  So that it makes the soul turn unto it.\n\nAnd if, when turned, towards it she incline,\n  Love is that inclination; it is nature,\n  Which is by pleasure bound in you anew\n\nThen even as the fire doth upward move\n  By its own form, which to ascend is born,\n  Where longest in its matter it endures,\n\nSo comes the captive soul into desire,\n  Which is a motion spiritual, and ne'er rests\n  Until she doth enjoy the thing beloved.\n\nNow may apparent be to thee how hidden\n  The truth is from those people, who aver\n  All love is in itself a laudable thing;\n\nBecause its matter may perchance appear\n  Aye to be good; but yet not each impression\n  Is good, albeit good may be the wax.\"\n\n\"Thy words, and my sequacious intellect,\"\n  I answered him, \"have love revealed to me;\n  But that has made me more impregned with doubt;\n\nFor if love from without be offered us,\n  And with another foot the soul go not,\n  If right or wrong she go, 'tis not her merit.\"\n\nAnd he to me: \"What reason seeth here,\n  Myself can tell thee; beyond that await\n  For Beatrice, since 'tis a work of faith.\n\nEvery substantial form, that segregate\n  From matter is, and with it is united,\n  Specific power has in itself collected,\n\nWhich without act is not perceptible,\n  Nor shows itself except by its effect,\n  As life does in a plant by the green leaves.\n\nBut still, whence cometh the intelligence\n  Of the first notions, man is ignorant,\n  And the affection for the first allurements,\n\nWhich are in you as instinct in the bee\n  To make its honey; and this first desire\n  Merit of praise or blame containeth not.\n\nNow, that to this all others may be gathered,\n  Innate within you is the power that counsels,\n  And it should keep the threshold of assent.\n\nThis is the principle, from which is taken\n  Occasion of desert in you, according\n  As good and guilty loves it takes and winnows.\n\nThose who, in reasoning, to the bottom went,\n  Were of this innate liberty aware,\n  Therefore bequeathed they Ethics to the world.\n\nSupposing, then, that from necessity\n  Springs every love that is within you kindled,\n  Within yourselves the power is to restrain it.\n\nThe noble virtue Beatrice understands\n  By the free will; and therefore see that thou\n  Bear it in mind, if she should speak of it.\"\n\nThe moon, belated almost unto midnight,\n  Now made the stars appear to us more rare,\n  Formed like a bucket, that is all ablaze,\n\nAnd counter to the heavens ran through those paths\n  Which the sun sets aflame, when he of Rome\n  Sees it 'twixt Sardes and Corsicans go down;\n\nAnd that patrician shade, for whom is named\n  Pietola more than any Mantuan town,\n  Had laid aside the burden of my lading;\n\nWhence I, who reason manifest and plain\n  In answer to my questions had received,\n  Stood like a man in drowsy reverie.\n\nBut taken from me was this drowsiness\n  Suddenly by a people, that behind\n  Our backs already had come round to us.\n\nAnd as, of old, Ismenus and Asopus\n  Beside them saw at night the rush and throng,\n  If but the Thebans were in need of Bacchus,\n\nSo they along that circle curve their step,\n  From what I saw of those approaching us,\n  Who by good-will and righteous love are ridden.\n\nFull soon they were upon us, because running\n  Moved onward all that mighty multitude,\n  And two in the advance cried out, lamenting,\n\n\"Mary in haste unto the mountain ran,\n  And Caesar, that he might subdue Ilerda,\n  Thrust at Marseilles, and then ran into Spain.\"\n\n\"Quick! quick! so that the time may not be lost\n  By little love!\" forthwith the others cried,\n  \"For ardour in well-doing freshens grace!\"\n\n\"O folk, in whom an eager fervour now\n  Supplies perhaps delay and negligence,\n  Put by you in well-doing, through lukewarmness,\n\nThis one who lives, and truly I lie not,\n  Would fain go up, if but the sun relight us;\n  So tell us where the passage nearest is.\"\n\nThese were the words of him who was my Guide;\n  And some one of those spirits said: \"Come on\n  Behind us, and the opening shalt thou find;\n\nSo full of longing are we to move onward,\n  That stay we cannot; therefore pardon us,\n  If thou for churlishness our justice take.\n\nI was San Zeno's Abbot at Verona,\n  Under the empire of good Barbarossa,\n  Of whom still sorrowing Milan holds discourse;\n\nAnd he has one foot in the grave already,\n  Who shall erelong lament that monastery,\n  And sorry be of having there had power,\n\nBecause his son, in his whole body sick,\n  And worse in mind, and who was evil-born,\n  He put into the place of its true pastor.\"\n\nIf more he said, or silent was, I know not,\n  He had already passed so far beyond us;\n  But this I heard, and to retain it pleased me.\n\nAnd he who was in every need my succour\n  Said: \"Turn thee hitherward; see two of them\n  Come fastening upon slothfulness their teeth.\"\n\nIn rear of all they shouted: \"Sooner were\n  The people dead to whom the sea was opened,\n  Than their inheritors the Jordan saw;\n\nAnd those who the fatigue did not endure\n  Unto the issue, with Anchises' son,\n  Themselves to life withouten glory offered.\"\n\nThen when from us so separated were\n  Those shades, that they no longer could be seen,\n  Within me a new thought did entrance find,\n\nWhence others many and diverse were born;\n  And so I lapsed from one into another,\n  That in a reverie mine eyes I closed,\n\nAnd meditation into dream transmuted.\n\n\n\nPurgatorio: Canto XIX\n\n\nIt was the hour when the diurnal heat\n  No more can warm the coldness of the moon,\n  Vanquished by earth, or peradventure Saturn,\n\nWhen geomancers their Fortuna Major\n  See in the orient before the dawn\n  Rise by a path that long remains not dim,\n\nThere came to me in dreams a stammering woman,\n  Squint in her eyes, and in her feet distorted,\n  With hands dissevered and of sallow hue.\n\nI looked at her; and as the sun restores\n  The frigid members which the night benumbs,\n  Even thus my gaze did render voluble\n\nHer tongue, and made her all erect thereafter\n  In little while, and the lost countenance\n  As love desires it so in her did colour.\n\nWhen in this wise she had her speech unloosed,\n  She 'gan to sing so, that with difficulty\n  Could I have turned my thoughts away from her.\n\n\"I am,\" she sang, \"I am the Siren sweet\n  Who mariners amid the main unman,\n  So full am I of pleasantness to hear.\n\nI drew Ulysses from his wandering way\n  Unto my song, and he who dwells with me\n  Seldom departs so wholly I content him.\"\n\nHer mouth was not yet closed again, before\n  Appeared a Lady saintly and alert\n  Close at my side to put her to confusion.\n\n\n\n### Summary:\n\n"}

This is her card.\"\n\nI read the words, \"Lady Studley.\"\n\n\"Show her in,\" I said, hastily, and the next moment a tall,\nslightly-made, fair-haired girl entered the room.\n\nShe looked very young, scarcely more than twenty, and I could hardly\nbelieve that she was, what her card indicated, a married woman.\n\nThe colour rushed into her cheeks as she held out her hand to me. I\nmotioned her to a chair, and then asked her what I could do for her.\n\n\"Oh, you can help me,\" she said, clasping her hands and speaking in a\nslightly theatrical manner. \"My husband, Sir Henry Studley, is very\nunwell, and I want you to come to see him--can you?--will you?\"\n\n\"With pleasure,\" I replied. \"Where do you live?\"\n\n\"At Studley Grange, in Wiltshire. Don't you know our place?\"\n\n\"I daresay I ought to know it,\" I replied, \"although at the present\nmoment I can't recall the name. You want me to come to see your husband.\nI presume you wish me to have a consultation with his medical\nattendant?\"\n\n\"No, no, not at all. The fact is, Sir Henry has not got a medical\nattendant. He dislikes doctors, and won't see one. I want you to come\nand stay with us for a week or so. I have heard of you through mutual\nfriends--the Onslows. I know you can effect remarkable cures, and you\nhave a great deal of tact. But you can't possibly do anything for my\nhusband unless you are willing to stay in the house and to notice his\nsymptoms.\"\n\n[Illustration: \"LADY STUDLEY SPOKE WITH GREAT EMPHASIS.\"]\n\nLady Studley spoke with great emphasis and earnestness. Her long,\nslender hands were clasped tightly together. She had drawn off her\ngloves and was bending forward in her chair. Her big, childish, and\nsomewhat restless blue eyes were fixed imploringly on my face.\n\n\"I love my husband,\" she said, tears suddenly filling them--\"and it is\ndreadful, dreadful, to see him suffer as he does. He will die unless\nsomeone comes to his aid. Oh, I know I am asking an immense thing, when\nI beg of you to leave all your patients and come to the country. But we\ncan pay. Money is no object whatever to us. We can, we will, gladly pay\nyou for your services.\"\n\n\"I must think the matter over,\" I said. \"You flatter me by wishing for\nme, and by believing that I can render you assistance, but I cannot take\na step of this kind in a hurry. I will write to you by to-night's post\nif you will give me your address. In the meantime, kindly tell me some\nof the symptoms of Sir Henry's malady.\"\n\n\"I fear it is a malady of the mind,\" she answered immediately, \"but it\nis of so vivid and so startling a character, that unless relief is soon\nobtained, the body must give way under the strain. You see that I am\nvery young, Dr. Halifax. Perhaps I look younger than I am--my age is\ntwenty-two. My husband is twenty years my senior. He would, however, be\nconsidered by most people still a young man. He is a great scholar, and\nhas always had more or less the habits of a recluse. He is fond of\nliving in his library, and likes nothing better than to be surrounded by\nbooks of all sorts. Every modern book worth reading is forwarded to him\nby its publisher. He is a very interesting man and a brilliant\nconversationalist. Perhaps I ought to put all this in the past tense,\nfor now he scarcely ever speaks--he reads next to nothing--it is\ndifficult to persuade him to eat--he will not leave the house--he used\nto have a rather ruddy complexion--he is now deadly pale and terribly\nemaciated. He sighs in the most heartrending manner, and seems to be in\na state of extreme nervous tension. In short, he is very ill, and yet he\nseems to have no bodily disease. His eyes have a terribly startled\nexpression in them--his hand trembles so that he can scarcely raise a\ncup of tea to his lips. In short, he looks like a man who has seen\na ghost.\"\n\n\"When did these symptoms begin to appear?\" I asked.\n\n\"It is mid-winter now,\" said Lady Studley. \"The queer symptoms began to\nshow themselves in my husband in October. They have been growing worse\nand worse. In short, I can stand them no longer,\" she continued, giving\nway to a short, hysterical sob. \"I felt I must come to someone--I have\nheard of you. Do, do come and save us. Do come and find out what is the\nmatter with my wretched husband.\"\n\n\"I will write to you to-night,\" I said, in as kind a voice as I could\nmuster, for the pretty, anxious wife interested me already. \"It may not\nbe possible for me to stay at Studley Grange for a week, but in any case\nI can promise to come and see the patient. One visit will probably be\nsufficient--what your husband wants is, no doubt, complete change.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, yes,\" she replied, standing up now. \"I have said so scores of\ntimes, but Sir Henry won't stir from Studley--nothing will induce him to\ngo away. He won't even leave his own special bedroom, although I expect\nhe has dreadful nights.\" Two hectic spots burnt in her cheeks as she\nspoke. I looked at her attentively.\n\n\"You will forgive me for speaking,\" I said, \"but you do not look at all\nwell yourself. I should like to prescribe for you as well as\nyour husband.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" she answered, \"I am not very strong. I never have been, but\nthat is nothing--I mean that my health is not a thing of consequence at\npresent. Well, I must not take up any more of your time. I shall expect\nto get a letter from you to-morrow morning. Please address it to Lady\nStudley, Grosvenor Hotel, Victoria.\"\n\nShe touched my hand with fingers that burnt like a living coal and left\nthe room.\n\nI thought her very ill, and was sure that if I could see my way to\nspending a week at Studley Grange, I should have two patients instead of\none. It is always difficult for a busy doctor to leave home, but after\ncarefully thinking matters over, I resolved to comply with Lady\nStudley's request.\n\n[Illustration: \"LADY STUDLEY HAD COME HERSELF TO FETCH ME.\"]\n\nAccordingly, two days later saw me on my way to Wiltshire, and to\nStudley Grange. A brougham with two smart horses was waiting at the\nstation. To my surprise I saw that Lady Studley had come herself\nto fetch me.\n\n\"I don't know how to thank you,\" she said, giving me a feverish clasp of\nher hand. \"Your visit fills me with hope--I believe that you will\ndiscover what is really wrong. Home!\" she said, giving a quick,\nimperious direction to the footman who appeared at the window of\nthe carriage.\n\nWe bowled forward at a rapid pace, and she continued:--\n\n\"I came to meet you to-day to tell you that I have used a little guile\nwith regard to your visit. I have not told Sir Henry that you are coming\nhere in the capacity of a doctor.\"\n\nHere she paused and gave me one of her restless glances.\n\n\"Do you mind?\" she asked.\n\n\"What have you said about me to Sir Henry?\" I inquired.\n\n\"That you are a great friend of the Onslows, and that I have asked you\nhere for a week's change,\" she answered immediately.\n\n\"As a guest, my husband will be polite and delightful to you--as a\ndoctor, he would treat you with scant civility, and would probably give\nyou little or none of his confidence.\"\n\nI was quite silent for a moment after Lady Studley had told me this.\nThen I said:--\n\n\"Had I known that I was not to come to your house in the capacity of a\nmedical man, I might have re-considered my earnest desire to help you.\"\n\nShe turned very pale when I said this, and tears filled her eyes.\n\n\"Never mind,\" I said now, for I could not but be touched by her\nextremely pathetic and suffering face, by the look of great illness\nwhich was manifested in every glance. \"Never mind now; I am glad you\nhave told me exactly the terms on which you wish me to approach your\nhusband; but I think that I can so put matters to Sir Henry that he will\nbe glad to consult me in my medical capacity.\"\n\n\"Oh, but he does not even know that I suspect his illness. It would\nnever do for him to know. I suspect! I see! I fear! but I say nothing.\nSir Henry would be much more miserable than he is now, if he thought\nthat I guessed that there is anything wrong with him.\"\n\n\"It is impossible for me to come to the Grange except as a medical man,\"\nI answered, firmly. \"I will tell Sir Henry that you have seen some\nchanges in him, and have asked me to visit him as a doctor. Please trust\nme. Nothing will be said to your husband that can make matters at all\nuncomfortable for you.\"\n\nLady Studley did not venture any further remonstrance, and we now\napproached the old Grange. It was an irregular pile, built evidently\naccording to the wants of the different families who had lived in it.\nThe building was long and rambling, with rows of windows filled up with\npanes of latticed glass. In front of the house was a sweeping lawn,\nwhich, even at this time of the year, presented a velvety and well-kept\nappearance. We drove rapidly round to the entrance door, and a moment\nlater I found myself in the presence of my host and patient. Sir Henry\nStudley was a tall man with a very slight stoop, and an aquiline and\nrather noble face. His eyes were dark, and his forehead inclined to be\nbald. There was a courtly, old-world sort of look about him. He greeted\nme with extreme friendliness, and we went into the hall, a very large\nand lofty apartment, to tea.\n\nLady Studley was vivacious and lively in the extreme. While she talked,\nthe hectic spots came out again on her cheeks. My uneasiness about her\nincreased as I noticed these symptoms. I felt certain that she was not\nonly consumptive, but in all probability she was even now the victim of\nan advanced stage of phthisis. I felt far more anxious about her than\nabout her husband, who appeared to me at that moment to be nothing more\nthan a somewhat nervous and hypochondriacal person. This state of things\nseemed easy to account for in a scholar and a man of sedentary habits.\n\nI remarked about the age of the house, and my host became interested,\nand told me one or two stories of the old inhabitants of the Grange. He\nsaid that to-morrow he would have much pleasure in taking me over\nthe building.\n\n[Illustration: \"'HAVE YOU A GHOST HERE?' I ASKED, WITH A LAUGH.\"]\n\n\"Have you a ghost here?\" I asked, with a laugh.\n\nI don't know what prompted me to ask the question. The moment I did so,\nSir Henry turned white to his lips, and Lady Studley held up a warning\nfinger to me to intimate that I was on dangerous ground. I felt that I\nwas, and hastened to divert the conversation into safer channels.\nInadvertently I had touched on a sore spot. I scarcely regretted having\ndone so, as the flash in the baronet's troubled eyes, and the extreme\nagitation of his face, showed me plainly that Lady Studley was right\nwhen she spoke of his nerves being in a very irritable condition. Of\ncourse, I did not believe in ghosts, and wondered that a man of Sir\nHenry's calibre could be at all under the influence of this\nold-world fear.\n\n\"I am sorry that we have no one to meet you,\" he said, after a few\nremarks of a commonplace character had divided us from the ghost\nquestion. \"But to-morrow several friends are coming, and we hope you\nwill have a pleasant time. Are you fond of hunting?\"\n\nI answered that I used to be in the old days, before medicine and\npatients occupied all my thoughts.\n\n\"If this open weather continues, I can probably give you some of your\nfavourite pastime,\" rejoined Sir Henry; \"and now perhaps you would like\nto be shown to your room.\"\n\nMy bedroom was in a modern wing of the house, and looked as cheerful and\nas unghostlike as it was possible for a room to be. I did not rejoin my\nhost and hostess until dinner-time. We had a sociable little meal, at\nwhich nothing of any importance occurred, and shortly after the servants\nwithdrew, Lady Studley left Sir Henry and me to ourselves. She gave me\nanother warning glance as she left the room. I had already quite made up\nmy mind, however, to tell Sir Henry the motive of my visit.\n\nThe moment the door closed behind his wife, he started up and asked me\nif I would mind coming with him into his library.\n\n\"The fact is.\" he said, \"I am particularly glad you have come down. I\nwant to have a talk with you about my wife. She is extremely unwell.\"\n\nI signified my willingness to listen to anything Sir Henry might say,\nand in a few minutes we found ourselves comfortably established in a\nsplendid old room, completely clothed with books from ceiling to floor.\n\n\"These are my treasures,\" said the baronet, waving his hand in the\ndirection of an old bookcase, which contained, I saw at a glance, some\nvery rare and precious first editions.\n\n\"These are my friends, the companions of my hours of solitude. Now sit\ndown, Dr. Halifax; make yourself at home. You have come here as a guest,\nbut I have heard of you before, and am inclined to confide in you. I\nmust frankly say that I hate your profession as a rule. I don't believe\nin the omniscience of medical men, but moments come in the lives of all\nmen when it is necessary to unburden the mind to another. May I give you\nmy confidence?\"\n\n\"One moment first,\" I said. \"I can't deceive you, Sir Henry. I have come\nhere, not in the capacity of a guest, but as your wife's medical man.\nShe has been anxious about you, and she begged of me to come and stay\nhere for a few days in order to render you any medical assistance within\nmy power. I only knew, on my way here to-day, that she had not\nacquainted you with the nature of my visit.\"\n\nWhile I was speaking, Sir Henry's face became extremely watchful,\neager, and tense.\n\n\"This is remarkable,\" he said. \"So Lucilla is anxious about me? I was\nnot aware that I ever gave her the least clue to the fact that I am\nnot--in perfect health. This is very strange--it troubles me.\"\n\nHe looked agitated. He placed one long, thin hand on the little table\nwhich stood near, and pouring out a glass of wine, drank it off. I\nnoticed as he did so the nervous trembling of his hand. I glanced at his\nface, and saw that it was thin to emaciation.\n\n\"Well,\" he said, \"I am obliged to you for being perfectly frank with me.\nMy wife scarcely did well to conceal the object of your visit. But now\nthat you have come, I shall make use of you both for myself and\nfor her.\"\n\n\"Then you are not well?\" I asked.\n\n\"Well!\" he answered, with almost a shout. \"Good God, no! I think that I\nam going mad. I know--I know that unless relief soon comes I shall die\nor become a raving maniac.\"\n\n\"No, nothing of the kind,\" I answered, soothingly; \"you probably want\nchange. This is a fine old house, but dull, no doubt, in winter. Why\ndon't you go away?--to the Riviera, or some other place where there is\nplenty of sunshine? Why do you stay here? The air of this place is too\ndamp to be good for either you or your wife.\"\n\nSir Henry sat silent for a moment, then he said, in a terse voice:--\n\n\"Perhaps you will advise me what to do after you know the nature of the\nmalady which afflicts me. First of all, however, I wish to speak of\nmy wife.\"\n\n\"I am ready to listen,\" I replied.\n\n\"You see,\" he continued, \"that she is very delicate?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I replied; \"to be frank with you, I should say that Lady Studley\nwas consumptive.\"\n\nHe started when I said this, and pressed his lips firmly together. After\na moment he spoke.\n\n\"You are right,\" he replied. \"I had her examined by a medical man--Sir\nJoseph Dunbar--when I was last in London; he said her lungs were\nconsiderably affected, and that, in short, she was far from well.\"\n\n\"Did he not order you to winter abroad?\"\n\n\"He did, but Lady Studley opposed the idea so strenuously that I was\nobliged to yield to her entreaties. Consumption does not seem to take\nquite the ordinary form with her. She is restless, she longs for cool\nair, she goes out on quite cold days, in a closed carriage, it is true.\nStill, except at night, she does not regard herself in any sense as an\ninvalid. She has immense spirit--I think she will keep up until\nshe dies.\"\n\n\"You speak of her being an invalid at night,\" I replied. \"What are her\nsymptoms?\"\n\nSir Henry shuddered quite visibly.\n\n\"Oh, those awful nights!\" he answered. \"How happy would many poor mortals\nbe, but for the terrible time of darkness. Lady Studley has had dreadful\nnights for some time: perspirations, cough, restlessness, bad dreams,\nand all the rest of it. But I must hasten to tell you my story quite\nbriefly. In the beginning of October we saw Sir Joseph Dunbar. I should\nthen, by his advice, have taken Lady Studley to the Riviera, but she\nopposed the idea with such passion and distress, that I abandoned it.\"\n\nSir Henry paused here, and I looked at him attentively. I remembered at\nthat moment what Lady Studley had said about her husband refusing to\nleave the Grange under any circumstances. What a strange game of\ncross-purposes these two were playing. How was it possible for me to get\nat the truth?\n\n\"At my wife's earnest request,\" continued Sir Henry, \"we returned to the\nGrange. She declared her firm intention of remaining here until\nshe died.\n\n\"Soon after our return she suggested that we should occupy separate\nrooms at night, reminding me, when she made the request, of the\ninfectious nature of consumption. I complied with her wish on condition\nthat I slept in the room next hers, and that on the smallest emergency I\nshould be summoned to her aid. This arrangement was made, and her room\nopens into mine. I have sometimes heard her moving about at night--I\nhave often heard her cough, and I have often heard her sigh. But she has\nnever once sent for me, or given me to understand that she required my\naid. She does not think herself very ill, and nothing worries her more\nthan to have her malady spoken about. That is the part of the story\nwhich relates to my wife.\"\n\n\"She is very ill,\" I said. \"But I will speak of that presently. Now will\nyou favour me with an account of your own symptoms, Sir Henry?\"\n\n[Illustration: \"HE LOCKED THE DOOR AND PUT THE KEY IN HIS POCKET.\"]\n\nHe started again when I said this, and going across the room, locked the\ndoor and put the key in his pocket.\n\n\"Perhaps you will laugh at me,\" he said, \"but it is no laughing matter,\nI assure you. The most terrible, the most awful affliction has come to\nme. In short, I am visited nightly by an appalling apparition. You\ndon't believe in ghosts, I judge that by your face. Few scientific\nmen do.\"\n\n\"Frankly, I do not,\" I replied. \"So-called ghosts can generally be\naccounted for. At the most they are only the figments of an over-excited\nor diseased brain.\"\n\n\"Be that as it may,\" said Sir Henry, \"the diseased brain can give such\ntorture to its victim that death is preferable. All my life I have been\nwhat I consider a healthy minded man. I have plenty of money, and have\nnever been troubled with the cares which torture men of commerce, or of\nsmall means. When I married, three years ago, I considered myself the\nmost lucky and the happiest of mortals.\"\n\n\"Forgive a personal question,\" I interrupted. \"Has your marriage\ndisappointed you?\"\n\n\"No, no; far from it,\" he replied with fervour. \"I love my dear wife\nbetter and more deeply even than the day when I took her as a bride to\nmy arms. It is true that I am weighed down with sorrow about her, but\nthat is entirely owing to the state of her health.\"\n\n\"It is strange,\" I said, \"that she should be weighed down with sorrow\nabout you for the same cause. Have you told her of the thing which\nterrifies you?\"\n\n\"Never, never. I have never spoken of it to mortal. It is remarkable\nthat my wife should have told you that I looked like a man who has seen\na ghost. Alas! alas! But let me tell you the cause of my shattered\nnerves, my agony, and failing health.\"\n\n\"Pray do, I shall listen attentively,\" I replied.\n\n\"Oh, doctor, that I could make you feel the horror of it!\" said Sir\nHenry, bending forward and looking into my eyes. \"Three months ago I no\nmore believed in visitations, in apparitions, in so-called ghosts, than\nyou do. Were you tried as I am, your scepticism would receive a severe\nshock. Now let me tell you what occurs. Night after night Lady Studley\nand I retire to rest at the same hour. We say good-night, and lay our\nheads on our separate pillows. The door of communication between us is\nshut. She has a night-light in her room--I prefer darkness. I close my\neyes and prepare for slumber. As a rule I fall asleep. My sleep is of\nshort duration. I awake with beads of perspiration standing on my\nforehead, with my heart thumping heavily and with every nerve wide\nawake, and waiting for the horror which will come. Sometimes I wait half\nan hour--sometimes longer. Then I know by a faint, ticking sound in the\ndarkness that the Thing, for I can clothe it with no name, is about to\nvisit me. In a certain spot of the room, always in the same spot, a\nbright light suddenly flashes; out of its midst there gleams a\npreternaturally large eye, which looks fixedly at me with a diabolical\nexpression. As time goes, it does not remain long; but as agony counts,\nit seems to take years of my life away with it. It fades as suddenly\ninto grey mist and nothingness as it comes, and, wet with perspiration,\nand struggling to keep back screams of mad terror, I bury my head in the\nbed-clothes.\"\n\n\"But have you never tried to investigate this thing?\" I said.\n\n\"I did at first. The first night I saw it, I rushed out of bed and made\nfor the spot. It disappeared at once. I struck a light--there was\nnothing whatever in the room.\"\n\n\"Why do you sleep in that room?\"\n\n\"I must not go away from Lady Studley. My terror is that she should know\nanything of this--my greater terror is that the apparition, failing me,\nmay visit her. I daresay you think I'm a fool, Halifax; but the fact is,\nthis thing is killing me, brave man as I consider myself.\"\n\n\"Do you see it every night?\" I asked.\n\n[Illustration: \"IT IS THE MOST GHASTLY, THE MOST HORRIBLE FORM OF\nTORTURE.]\n\n\"Not quite every night, but sometimes on the same night it comes twice.\nSometimes it will not come at all for two nights, or even three. It is\nthe most ghastly, the most horrible form of torture that could hurry a\nsane man into his grave or into a madhouse.\"\n\n\"I have not the least shadow of doubt,\" I said, after a pause, \"that the\nthing can be accounted for.\"\n\nSir Henry shook his head. \"No, no,\" he replied, \"it is either as you\nsuggest, a figment of my own diseased brain, and therefore just as\nhorrible as a real apparition; or it is a supernatural visitation.\nWhether it exists or not, it is reality to me and in no way a dream. The\nfull horror of it is present with me in my waking moments.\"\n\n\"Do you think anyone is playing an awful practical joke?\" I suggested.\n\n\"Certainly not. What object can anyone have in scaring me to death?\nBesides, there is no one in the room, that I can swear. My outer door is\nlocked, Lady Studley's outer door is locked. It is impossible that there\ncan be any trickery in the matter.\"\n\nI said nothing for a moment. I no more believed in ghosts than I ever\ndid, but I felt certain that there was grave mischief at work. Sir Henry\nmust be the victim of a hallucination. This might only be caused by\nfunctional disturbance of the brain, but it was quite serious enough to\ncall for immediate attention. The first thing to do was to find out\nwhether the apparition could be accounted for in any material way, or if\nit were due to the state of Sir Henry's nerves. I began to ask him\ncertain questions, going fully into the case in all its bearings. I then\nexamined his eyes with the ophthalmoscope. The result of all this was to\nassure me beyond doubt that Sir Henry Studley was in a highly nervous\ncondition, although I could detect no trace of brain disease.\n\n\"Do you mind taking me to your room?\" I said.\n\n\"Not to-night,\" he answered. \"It is late, and Lady Studley might express\nsurprise. The object of my life is to conceal this horror from her. When\nshe is out to-morrow you shall come to the room and judge for yourself.\"\n\n\"Well,\" I said, \"I shall have an interview with your wife to-morrow, and\nurge her most strongly to consent to leave the Grange and go away\nwith you.\"\n\nShortly afterwards we retired to rest, or what went by the name of rest\nin that sad house, with its troubled inmates. I must confess that,\ncomfortable as my room was, I slept very little. Sir Henry's story\nstayed with me all through the hours of darkness. I am neither nervous\nnor imaginative, but I could not help seeing that terrible eye, even in\nmy dreams.\n\nI met my host and hostess at an early breakfast. Sir Henry proposed that\nas the day was warm and fine, I should ride to a neighbouring meet. I\nwas not in the humour for this, however, and said frankly that I should\nprefer remaining at the Grange. One glance into the faces of my host and\nhostess told me only too plainly that I had two very serious patients on\nmy hands. Lady Studley looked terribly weak and excited--the hectic\nspots on her cheeks, the gleaming glitter of her eyes, the parched lips,\nthe long, white, emaciated hands, all showed only too plainly the\nstrides the malady under which she was suffering was making.\n\n\"After all, I cannot urge that poor girl to go abroad,\" I said to\nmyself. \"She is hastening rapidly to her grave, and no power on earth\ncan save her. She looks as if there were extensive disease of the lungs.\nHow restless her eyes are, too! I would much rather testify to Sir\nHenry's sanity than to hers.\"\n\nSir Henry Studley also bore traces of a sleepless night--his face was\nbloodless; he averted his eyes from mine; he ate next to nothing.\n\nImmediately after breakfast, I followed Lady Studley into her\nmorning-room. I had already made up my mind how to act. Her husband\nshould have my full confidence--she only my partial view of the\nsituation.\n\n\"Well,\" I said, \"I have seen your husband and talked to him. I hope he\nwill soon be better. I don't think you need be seriously alarmed about\nhim. Now for yourself, Lady Studley. I am anxious to examine your lungs.\nWill you allow me to do so?\"\n\n\"I suppose Henry has told you I am consumptive?\"\n\n\"He says you are not well,\" I answered. \"I don't need his word to assure\nme of that fact--I can see it with my own eyes. Please let me examine\nyour chest with my stethoscope.\"\n\nShe hesitated for a moment, looking something like a wild creature\nbrought to bay. Then she sank into a chair, and with trembling fingers\nunfastened her dress. Poor soul, she was almost a walking skeleton--her\nbeautiful face was all that was beautiful about her. A brief examination\ntold me that she was in the last stage of phthisis--in short, that her\ndays were numbered.\n\n\"What do you think of me?\" she asked, when the brief examination was\nover.\n\n\"You are ill,\" I replied.\n\n\"How soon shall I die?\"\n\n\"God only knows that, my dear lady,\" I answered.\n\n\"Oh, you needn't hide your thoughts,\" she said. \"I know that my days are\nvery few. Oh, if only, if only my husband could come with me! I am so\nafraid to go alone, and I am fond of him, very fond of him.\"\n\nI soothed her as well as I could.\n\n\"You ought to have someone to sleep in your room at night,\" I said. \"You\nought not to be left by yourself.\"\n\n\"Henry is near me--in the next room,\" she replied. \"I would not have a\nnurse for the world--I hate and detest nurses.\"\n\nSoon afterwards she left me. She was very erratic, and before she left\nthe room she had quite got over her depression. The sun shone out, and\nwith the gleam of brightness her volatile spirits rose.\n\n\"I am going for a drive,\" she said. \"Will you come with me?\"\n\n\"Not this morning,\" I replied. \"If you ask me to-morrow, I shall be\npleased to accompany you.\"\n\n\"Well, go to Henry,\" she answered. \"Talk to him--find out what ails him,\norder tonics for him. Cheer him in every way in your power. You say he\nis not ill--not seriously ill--I know better. My impression is that if\nmy days are numbered, so are his.\"\n\nShe went away, and I sought her husband. As soon as the wheels of her\nbrougham were heard bowling away over the gravel sweep, we went up\ntogether to his room.\n\n\"That eye came twice last night,\" he said in an awestruck whisper to me.\n\"I am a doomed man--a doomed man. I cannot bear this any longer.\"\n\nWe were standing in the room as he said the words. Even in broad\ndaylight, I could see that he glanced round him with apprehension. He\nwas shaking quite visibly. The room was decidedly old-fashioned, but the\ngreater part of the furniture was modern. The bed was an Albert one with\na spring mattress, and light, cheerful dimity hangings. The windows were\nFrench--they were wide open, and let in the soft, pleasant air, for the\nday was truly a spring one in winter. The paper on the walls was light.\n\n\"This is a quaint old wardrobe,\" I said. \"It looks out of place with the\nrest of the furniture. Why don't you have it removed?\"\n\n[Illustration: \"DON'T GO NEAR IT--I DREAD IT!\"]\n\n\"Hush,\" he said, with a gasp. \"Don't go near it--I dread it, I have\nlocked it. It is always in that direction that the apparition appears.\nThe apparition seems to grow out of the glass of the wardrobe. It always\nappears in that one spot.\"\n\n\"I see,\" I answered. \"The wardrobe is built into the wall. That is the\nreason it cannot be removed. Have you got the key about you?\"\n\nHe fumbled in his pocket, and presently produced a bunch of keys.\n\n\"I wish you wouldn't open the wardrobe,\" he said. \"I frankly admit that\nI dislike having it touched.\"\n\n\"All right,\" I replied. \"I will not examine it while you are in the\nroom. You will perhaps allow me to keep the key?\"\n\n\"Certainly! You can take it from the bunch, if you wish. This is it. I\nshall be only too glad to have it well out of my own keeping.\"\n\n\"We will go downstairs,\" I said.\n\nWe returned to Sir Henry's library. It was my turn now to lock the door.\n\n\"Why do you do that?\" he asked.\n\n\"Because I wish to be quite certain that no one overhears our\nconversation.\"\n\n\"What have you got to say?\"\n\n\"I have a plan to propose to you.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"I want you to change bedrooms with me to-night.\"\n\n\"What can you mean?--what will Lady Studley say?\"\n\n\"Lady Studley must know nothing whatever about the arrangement. I think\nit very likely that the apparition which troubles you will be discovered\nto have a material foundation. In short, I am determined to get to the\nbottom of this horror. You have seen it often, and your nerves are much\nshattered. I have never seen it, and my nerves are, I think, in\ntolerable order. If I sleep in your room to-night--\"\n\n\"It may not visit you.\"\n\n\"It may not, but on the other hand it may. I have a curiosity to lie on\nthat bed and to face that wardrobe in the wall. You must yield to my\nwishes, Sir Henry.\"\n\n\"But how can the knowledge of this arrangement be kept from my wife?\"\n\n\"Easily enough. You will both go to your rooms as usual. You will bid\nher good-night as usual, and after the doors of communication are closed\nI will enter the room and you will go to mine, or to any other that you\nlike to occupy. You say your wife never comes into your room during the\nhours of the night?\"\n\n\"She has never yet done so.\"\n\n\"She will not to-night. Should she by any chance call for assistance, I\nwill immediately summon you.\"\n\nIt was very evident that Sir Henry did not like this arrangement. He\nyielded, however, to my very strong persuasions, which almost took the\nform of commands, for I saw that I could do nothing unless I got\ncomplete mastery over the man.\n\nLady Studley returned from her drive just as our arrangements were fully\nmade. I had not a moment during all the day to examine the interior of\nthe wardrobe. The sick woman's restlessness grew greater as the hours\nadvanced. She did not care to leave her husband's side. She sat with him\nas he examined his books. She followed him from room to room. In the\nafternoon, to the relief of everyone, some fresh guests arrived. In\nconsequence we had a cheerful evening. Lady Studley came down to dinner\nin white from top to toe. Her dress was ethereal in texture and largely\ncomposed of lace. I cannot describe woman's dress, but with her shadowy\nfigure and worn, but still lovely face, she looked spiritual. The gleam\nin her large blue eyes was pathetic. Her love for her husband was\ntouching to behold. How soon, how very soon, they must part from each\nother! Only I as a doctor knew how impossible it was to keep the lamp of\nlife much longer burning in the poor girl's frame.\n\nWe retired as usual to rest. Sir Henry bade me a cheerful good-night.\nLady Studley nodded to me as she left the room.\n\n[Illustration: \"'SLEEP WELL,' SHE SAID, IN A GAY VOICE.\"]\n\n\"Sleep well,\" she said, in a gay voice.\n\nIt was late the next morning when we all met round the breakfast table.\nSir Henry looked better, but Lady Studley many degrees worse, than the\nnight before. I wondered at her courage in retaining her post at the\nhead of her table. The visitors, who came in at intervals and took their\nseats at the table, looked at her with wonder and compassion.\n\n\"Surely my hostess is very ill?\" said a guest who sat next my side.\n\n\"Yes, but take no notice of it,\" I answered.\n\nSoon after breakfast I sought Sir Henry.\n\n\"Well--well?\" he said, as he grasped my hand. \"Halifax, you have seen\nit. I know you have by the expression of your face.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I replied, \"I have.\"\n\n\"How quietly you speak. Has not the horror of the thing seized you?\"\n\n\"No,\" I said, with a brief laugh. \"I told you yesterday that my nerves\nwere in tolerable order. I think my surmise was correct, and that the\napparition has tangible form and can be traced to its foundation.\"\n\nAn unbelieving look swept over Sir Henry's face.\n\n\"Ah,\" he said, \"doctors are very hard to convince. Everything must be\nbrought down to a cold material level to satisfy them; but several\nnights in that room would shatter even your nerves, my friend.\"\n\n\"You are quite right,\" I answered. \"I should be very sorry to spend\nseveral nights in that room. Now I will tell you briefly what occurred.\"\n\nWe were standing in the library. Sir Henry went to the door, locked it,\nand put the key in his pocket.\n\n\"Can I come in?\" said a voice outside.\n\nThe voice was Lady Studley's.\n\n\"In a minute, my darling,\" answered her husband. \"I am engaged with\nHalifax just at present.\"\n\n\"Medically, I suppose?\" she answered.\n\n\"Yes, medically,\" he responded.\n\nShe went away at once, and Sir Henry returned to my side.\n\n\"Now speak,\" he said. \"Be quick. She is sure to return, and I don't like\nher to fancy that we are talking secrets.\"\n\n\"This is my story,\" I said. \"I went into your room, put out all the\nlights, and sat on the edge of the bed.\"\n\n\"You did not get into bed, then?\"\n\n\"No, I preferred to be up and to be ready for immediate action should\nthe apparition, the horror, or whatever you call it, appear.\"\n\n\"Good God, it is a horror, Halifax!\"\n\n\"It is, Sir Henry. A more diabolical contrivance for frightening a man\ninto his grave could scarcely have been contrived. I can comfort you on\none point, however. The terrible thing you saw is not a figment of your\nbrain. There is no likelihood of a lunatic asylum in your case. Someone\nis playing you a trick.\"\n\n\"I cannot agree with you--but proceed,\" said the baronet, impatiently.\n\n\"I sat for about an hour on the edge of the bed,\" I continued. \"When I\nentered the room it was twelve o'clock--one had sounded before there was\nthe least stir or appearance of anything, then the ticking noise you\nhave described was distinctly audible. This was followed by a sudden\nbright light, which seemed to proceed out of the recesses of the\nwardrobe.\"\n\n\"What did you feel when you saw that light?\"\n\n\"Too excited to be nervous,\" I answered, briefly. \"Out of the circle of\nlight the horrible eye looked at me.\"\n\n\"What did you do then? Did you faint?\"\n\n\"No, I went noiselessly across the carpet up to the door of the wardrobe\nand looked in.\"\n\n\"Heavens! you are daring. I wonder you are alive to tell this tale.\"\n\n\"I saw a shadowy form,\" I replied--\"dark and tall--the one brilliant eye\nkept on looking past me, straight into the room. I made a very slight\nnoise; it immediately disappeared. I waited for some time--nothing more\nhappened. I got into your bed, Sir Henry, and slept. I can't say that I\nhad a comfortable night, but I slept, and was not disturbed by anything\nextraordinary for the remaining hours of the night.\"\n\n\"Now what do you mean to do? You say you can trace this thing to its\nfoundation. It seems to me that all you have seen only supports my firm\nbelief that a horrible apparition visits that room.\"\n\n\"A material one,\" I responded. \"The shadowy form had substance, of that\nI am convinced. Sir Henry, I intend to sleep in that room again\nto-night.\"\n\n\"Lady Studley will find out.\"\n\n\"She will not. I sleep in the haunted room again to-night, and during\nthe day you must so contrive matters that I have plenty of time to\nexamine the wardrobe. I did not do so yesterday because I had not an\nopportunity. You must contrive to get Lady Studley out of the way,\neither this morning or afternoon, and so manage matters for me that I\ncan be some little time alone in your room.\"\n\n\"Henry, Henry, how awestruck you look!\" said a gay voice at the window.\nLady Studley had come out, had come round to the library window, and,\nholding up her long, dark-blue velvet dress, was looking at us with a\npeculiar smile.\n\n\"Well, my love,\" replied the baronet. He went to the window and flung it\nopen. \"Lucilla,\" he exclaimed, \"you are mad to stand on the damp grass.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, not mad,\" she answered. \"I have come to that stage when nothing\nmatters. Is not that so, Dr. Halifax?\"\n\n\"You are very imprudent,\" I replied.\n\nShe shook her finger at me playfully, and turned to her husband.\n\n\"Henry,\" she said, \"have you taken my keys? I cannot find them\nanywhere.\"\n\n\"I will go up and look for them,\" said Sir Henry. He left the room, and\nLady Studley entered the library through one of the French windows.\n\n\"What do you think of my husband this morning?\" she asked.\n\n\"He is a little better,\" I replied. \"I am confident that he will soon be\nquite well again.\"\n\nShe gave a deep sigh when I said this, her lips trembled, and she turned\naway. I thought my news would make her happy, and her depression\nsurprised me.\n\nAt this moment Sir Henry came into the room.\n\n\"Here are your keys,\" he said to his wife. He gave her the same bunch he\nhad given me the night before. I hoped she would not notice that the key\nof the wardrobe was missing.\n\n\"And now I want you to come for a drive with me,\" said Sir Henry.\n\nHe did not often accompany her, and the pleasure of this unlooked-for\nindulgence evidently tempted her.\n\n\"Very well,\" she answered. \"Is Dr. Halifax coming?\"\n\n\"No, he wants to have a ride.\"\n\n\"If he rides, can he not follow the carriage?\"\n\n\"Will you do that, Halifax?\" asked my host.\n\n\"No, thank you,\" I answered; \"I must write some letters before I go\nanywhere. I will ride to the nearest town and post them presently, if I\nmay.\" I left the room as I spoke.\n\nShortly afterwards I saw from a window Sir Henry and his wife drive\naway. They drove in a large open landau, and two girls who were staying\nin the house accompanied them. My hour had come, and I went up at once\nto Sir Henry's bedroom. Lady Studley's room opened directly into that of\nher husband, but both rooms had separate entrances.\n\nI locked the two outer doors now, and then began my investigations. I\nhad the key of the wardrobe in my pocket.\n\n[Illustration: \"GOOD HEAVENS! WHAT HAD HAPPENED?\"]\n\nIt was troublesome to unlock, because the key was a little rusty, and it\nwas more than evident that the heavy doors had not been opened for some\ntime. Both these doors were made of glass. When shut, they resembled in\nshape and appearance an ordinary old-fashioned window. The glass was set\nin deep mullions. It was thick, was of a peculiar shade of light blue,\nand was evidently of great antiquity. I opened the doors and went\ninside. The wardrobe was so roomy that I could stand upright with\nperfect comfort. It was empty, and was lined through and through with\nsolid oak. I struck a light and began to examine the interior with care.\nAfter a great deal of patient investigation I came across a notch in the\nwood. I pressed my finger on this, and immediately a little panel slid\nback, which revealed underneath a small button. I turned the button and\na door at the back of the wardrobe flew open. A flood of sunlight poured\nin, and stepping out, I found myself in another room. I looked around me\nin astonishment. This was a lady's chamber. Good heavens! what had\nhappened? I was in Lady Studley's room. Shutting the mysterious door of\nthe wardrobe very carefully, I found that all trace of its existence\nimmediately vanished.\n\nThere was no furniture against this part of the wall. It looked\nabsolutely bare and smooth. No picture ornamented it. The light paper\nwhich covered it gave the appearance of a perfectly unbroken pattern. Of\ncourse, there must be a concealed spring somewhere, and I lost no time\nin feeling for it. I pressed my hand and the tips of my fingers in every\ndirection along the wall. Try as I would, however, I could not find the\nspring, and I had at last to leave Lady Studley's room and go back to\nthe one occupied by her husband, by the ordinary door.\n\nOnce more I re-entered the wardrobe and deliberately broke off the\nbutton which opened the secret door from within. Anyone who now entered\nthe wardrobe by this door, and shut it behind him, would find it\nimpossible to retreat. The apparition, if it had material foundation,\nwould thus find itself trapped in its own net.\n\nWhat could this thing portend?\n\nI had already convinced myself that if Sir Henry were the subject of a\nhallucination, I also shared it. As this was impossible, I felt certain\nthat the apparition had a material foundation. Who was the person who\nglided night after night into Lady Studley's room, who knew the trick of\nthe secret spring in the wall, who entered the old wardrobe, and\nperformed this ghastly, this appalling trick on Sir Henry Studley? I\nresolved that I would say nothing to Sir Henry of my fresh discovery\nuntil after I had spent another night in the haunted room.\n\nAccordingly, I slipped the key of the wardrobe once more into my pocket\nand went downstairs.\n\nI had my way again that night. Once more I found myself the sole\noccupant of the haunted room. I put out the light, sat on the edge of\nthe bed, and waited the issue of events. At first there was silence and\ncomplete darkness, but soon after one o'clock I heard the very slight\nbut unmistakable tick-tick, which told me that the apparition was about\nto appear. The ticking noise resembled the quaint sound made by the\ndeath spider. There was no other noise of any sort, but a quickening of\nmy pulses, a sensation which I could not call fear, but which was\nexciting to the point of pain, braced me up for an unusual and horrible\nsight. The light appeared in the dim recess of the wardrobe. It grew\nclear and steady, and quickly resolved itself into one intensely bright\ncircle. Out of this circle the eye looked at me. The eye was unnaturally\nlarge--it was clear, almost transparent, its expression was full of\nmenace and warning. Into the circle of light presently a shadowy and\nethereal hand intruded itself. The fingers beckoned me to approach,\nwhile the eye looked fixedly at me. I sat motionless on the side of the\nbed. I am stoical by nature and my nerves are well seasoned, but I am\nnot ashamed to say that I should be very sorry to be often subjected to\nthat menace and that invitation. The look in that eye, the beckoning\npower in those long, shadowy fingers would soon work havoc even in the\nstoutest nerves. My heart beat uncomfortably fast, and I had to say over\nand over to myself, \"This is nothing more than a ghastly trick.\" I had\nalso to remind myself that I in my turn had prepared a trap for the\napparition. The time while the eye looked and the hand beckoned might in\nreality have been counted by seconds; to me it seemed like eternity. I\nfelt the cold dew on my forehead before the rapidly waning light assured\nme that the apparition was about to vanish. Making an effort I now left\nthe bed and approached the wardrobe. I listened intently. For a moment\nthere was perfect silence. Then a fumbling noise was distinctly audible.\nIt was followed by a muffled cry, a crash, and a heavy fall. I struck a\nlight instantly, and taking the key of the wardrobe from my pocket,\nopened it. Never shall I forget the sight that met my gaze.\n\nThere, huddled up on the floor, lay the prostrate and unconscious form\nof Lady Studley. A black cloak in which she had wrapped herself partly\ncovered her face, but I knew her by her long, fair hair. I pulled back\nthe cloak, and saw that the unhappy girl had broken a blood-vessel, and\neven as I lifted her up I knew that she was in a dying condition.\n\nI carried her at once into her own room and laid her on the bed. I then\nreturned and shut the wardrobe door, and slipped the key into my pocket.\nMy next deed was to summon Sir Henry.\n\n\"What is it?\" he asked, springing upright in bed.\n\n\"Come at once,\" I said, \"your wife is very ill.\"\n\n\"Dying?\" he asked, in an agonized whisper.\n\nI nodded my head. I could not speak.\n\nMy one effort now was to keep the knowledge of the ghastly discovery I\nhad made from the unhappy husband.\n\nHe followed me to his wife's room. He forgot even to question me about\nthe apparition, so horrified was he at the sight which met his view.\n\nI administered restoratives to the dying woman, and did what I could to\ncheck the haemorrhage. After a time Lady Studley opened her dim eyes.\n\n\"Oh, Henry!\" she said, stretching out a feeble hand to him, \"come with\nme, come with me. I am afraid to go alone.\"\n\n\"My poor Lucilla,\" he said. He smoothed her cold forehead, and tried to\ncomfort her by every means in his power.\n\nAfter a time he left the room. When he did so she beckoned me to\napproach. \"I have failed,\" she said, in the most thrilling voice of\nhorror I have ever listened to. \"I must go alone. He will not come\nwith me.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" I asked.\n\nShe could scarcely speak, but at intervals the following words dropped\nslowly from her lips:--\n\n\"I was the apparition. I did not want my husband to live after me.\nPerhaps I was a little insane. I cannot quite say. When I was told by\nSir Joseph Dunbar that there was no hope of my life, a most appalling\nand frightful jealousy took possession of me. I pictured my husband with\nanother wife. Stoop down.\"\n\nHer voice was very faint. I could scarcely hear her muttered words. Her\neyes were glazing fast, death was claiming her, and yet hatred against\nsome unknown person thrilled in her feeble voice.\n\n\"Before my husband married me, he loved another woman,\" she continued.\n\"That woman is now a widow. I felt certain that immediately after my\ndeath he would seek her out and marry her. I could not bear the\nthought--it possessed me day and night. That, and the terror of dying\nalone, worked such a havoc within me that I believe I was scarcely\nresponsible for my own actions. A mad desire took possession of me to\ntake my husband with me, and so to keep him from her, and also to have\nhis company when I passed the barriers of life. I told you that my\nbrother was a doctor. In his medical-student days the sort of trick I\nhave been playing on Sir Henry was enacted by some of his\nfellow-students for his benefit, and almost scared him into fever. One\nday my brother described the trick to me, and I asked him to show me how\nit was done. I used a small electric lamp and a very strong reflector.\"\n\n\"How did you find out the secret door of the wardrobe?\" I asked.\n\n\"Quite by chance. I was putting some dresses into the wardrobe one day\nand accidentally touched the secret panel. I saw at once that here was\nmy opportunity.\"\n\n\"You must have been alarmed at your success,\" I said, after a pause.\n\"And now I have one more question to ask: Why did you summon me to\nthe Grange?\"\n\nShe made a faint, impatient movement.\n\n\"I wanted to be certain that my husband was really very ill,\" she said.\n\"I wanted you to talk to him--I guessed he would confide in you; I\nthought it most probable that you would tell him that he was a victim of\nbrain hallucinations. This would frighten him and would suit my purpose\nexactly. I also sent for you as a blind. I felt sure that under these\ncircumstances neither you nor my husband could possibly suspect me.\"\n\nShe was silent again, panting from exhaustion.\n\n\"I have failed,\" she said, after a long pause. \"You have discovered the\ntruth. It never occurred to me for a moment that you would go into the\nroom. He will recover now.\"\n\nShe paused; a fresh attack of haemorrhage came on. Her breath came\nquickly. Her end was very near. Her dim eyes could scarcely see.\n\nGroping feebly with her hand she took mine.\n\n\"Dr. Halifax--promise.\"\n\n\"What?\" I asked.\n\n\"I have failed, but let me keep his love, what little love he has for\nme, before he marries that other woman. Promise that you will never\ntell him.\"\n\n\"Rest easy,\" I answered, \"I will never tell him.\"\n\nSir Henry entered the room.\n\nI made way for him to kneel by his wife's side.\n\nAs the grey morning broke Lady Studley died.\n\nBefore my departure from the Grange I avoided Sir Henry as much as\npossible. Once he spoke of the apparition and asked if I had seen it.\n\"Yes,\" I replied.\n\nBefore I could say anything further, he continued:--\n\n\"I know now why it came; it was to warn me of my unhappy wife's death.\"\nHe said no more. I could not enlighten him, and he is unlikely now ever\nto learn the truth.\n\nThe following day I left Studley Grange. I took with me, without asking\nleave of any-one, a certain long black cloak, a small electric lamp,\nand a magnifying glass of considerable power.\n\nIt may be of interest to explain how Lady Studley in her unhealthy\ncondition of mind and body performed the extraordinary trick by which\nshe hoped to undermine her husband's health, and ultimately cause\nhis death.\n\nI experimented with the materials which I carried away with me, and\nsucceeded, so my friends told me, in producing a most ghastly effect.\n\nI did it in this way. I attached the mirror of a laryngoscope to my\nforehead in such a manner as to enable it to throw a strong reflection\ninto one of my eyes. In the centre of the bright side of the\nlaryngoscope a small electric lamp was fitted. This was connected with a\nbattery which I carried in my hand. The battery was similar to those\nused by the ballet girls in Drury Lane Theatre, and could be brought\ninto force by a touch and extinguished by the removal of the pressure.\nThe eye which was thus brilliantly illumined looked through a lens of\nsome power. All the rest of the face and figure was completely covered\nby the black cloak. Thus the brightest possible light was thrown on the\nmagnified eye, while there was corresponding increased gloom around.\n\nWhen last I heard of Studley Grange it was let for a term of years and\nSir Henry had gone abroad. I have not heard that he has married again,\nbut he probably will, sooner or later.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n_The Queen of Holland._\n\nBY MARY SPENCER-WARREN.\n\n\n    Her Majesty the Queen-Regent of Holland has graciously accorded\n    special permission to the writer of the following article to\n    visit the Royal Palaces of Amsterdam and The Hague to obtain\n    photographs for publication in this Magazine: a privilege of\n    the greatest value, which is now accorded for the first time,\n    the palaces never before having been photographed.\n\n\n[Illustration: THE ROYAL PALACE, AMSTERDAM.\n_From a Photo. by Gunn & Stuart, Richmond._]\n\n\"I know a city, whose inhabitants dwell on the tops of trees like\nrooks.\" Thus spake Erasmus; and this literal fact makes Amsterdam a most\ncurious as well as a most interesting place.\n\nWere I writing of any one of Queen Victoria's Palaces, I should have no\nneed to speak of its situation: but, travellers though we are, we do not\nall see these quaint Dutch cities, so a few introductory words may not\ncome amiss.\n\nA walk round the city reminds one of Paris with its Boulevards planted\nwith trees, and Venice with its all-present canals; indeed, it is\nactually divided up into nearly one hundred islands, connected by over\nthree hundred bridges. A curious thing is, that its inhabitants are\nreally living below the level of the sea, which is stoutly dammed out.\nThus, if necessary, water could be made its protection from\nany invasion.\n\nTo go back to the commencement, everything, streets, houses, and bridges\nare all built upon wooden piles driven into the ground. This is\nabsolutely necessary, as the natural soil is such that no permanent\nstructure can be put up otherwise. On how many piles this city stands it\nis impossible to form an accurate idea; one building--the Royal Palace\n(Het Paleis)--resting on some 13,659. This is situated on the Dam, the\nhighest point of the city. It is 282ft. long; the height, with tower,\nbeing 187ft. It was built from 1648-1655 for a town hall, and only\nbecame a Royal Palace in 1808, when Napoleon first abode in it. As such,\nit has a great drawback, the want of a suitable entrance.\n\n[Illustration: THE HALL OR RECEPTION-ROOM.\n_From a Photo. by Gunn & Stuart, Richmond._]\n\nI enter now at the rear of the building, which--situated in the Gedempte\nVoorburgwal--is the entrance used by their Majesties. In spite of its\ncivic associations, when once inside there is much of the state and\ngrandeur inseparable from Royalty, and I soon determine that Holland can\nalmost equal England for its palatial contents and embellishments. The\nstaircases and corridors are severe to simplicity, but when I look round\nthe first apartment I intend inspecting, I am struck with the immensity\nand the exceeding beauty of its appearance. This is known as the Hall or\nReception-Room, and is said to be the finest in Europe. Its proportions\nare certainly magnificent, 125ft. by 55ft.--a special feature being a\nremarkably fine roof, 100ft. in height, with entire absence of columns\nor other support. Roof, walls, and the hall entire are lined with white\nItalian marble, the floor having an inlaid copper centre representative\nof the Firmament. The large flag you see drooping from the roof is\ncommemorative of the siege of Antwerp, being the one used by General\nChasse on that occasion, the various groups of smaller ones being\nreminiscences of the eighty years' Spanish war and of Indian foes. Some\nvery beautiful examples of the sculptor's art are manifest, the\nphotographic work here introduced giving some idea of the exquisite\ndetail and most remarkable execution of Artus Quellin and his able\nassistants.\n\nHere you will observe an allegorical group denoting Plenty, Wisdom, and\nStrength, typical of the City of Amsterdam. We had a little adventure in\nsecuring views of this hall. At one end is a small gallery, used as the\nmainstay for the temporary orchestra, which is erected on festal\noccasions. Thinking our work could be better shown from that point, we\nproceeded to it by a dark and winding staircase in the rear.\n\nAll went well for a time, but during a period of watchful quietude our\nartist was suddenly and unexpectedly confronted with a gathering of rats\nof anything but peaceable aspect. It was too much for him! He made a\nwild rush for the staircase, which, being narrow and treacherous,\nresulted in a too rapid descent, a very forcible alighting at the foot,\nand a much bruised and shaken body.\n\nFor a few minutes we thought our photographic work would be closed for a\nseason; but when spirits and energies revived, we began to think of the\ncamera and the very long exposure plate up at the top; so up we went\nagain with much clattering commotion to warn our enemies of our\napproach, and thus you have a view that one of our party will ever\nregard as dearly obtained.\n\nNote the extremely delicate crystal chandeliers, for these are quite a\nfeature in the Dutch Palaces; so graceful and handsome, and so unlike\nthe generality of heavily-constructed appendages one is accustomed to\nbehold. The other end of the hall has also some choice sculptured\nmarble, but unfortunately part of it is hidden by the before-mentioned\ngallery. Could you obtain a clear view, you would see a figure of\nJustice, with Ignorance and Quarrelsomeness crouched at her feet: on one\nside a skeleton, and on the other Punishment. Above all is the figure of\nAtlas supporting the globe.\n\nHere I am given a full description of the appearance of this hall when\nlaid for the State banquet on the occasion of the somewhat recent visit\nof the German Emperor. Splendid, indeed, must have been the effect of\nthe hundreds of lights gleaming upon the pure marble, the rare exotics,\nthe massive plate, the State dresses, and the rich liveries; and I am\nnot surprised at the enthusiasm of the narrator as he dilates on the\ngrandeur displayed.\n\n[Illustration: THE THRONE ROOM.\n_From a Photo. by Gunn & Stuart, Richmond._]\n\nPassing through the doorway immediately under Atlas, I am at once in the\nThrone Room. This is a fine apartment; its ceiling in alternate painted\npanels and arms in relief, Marble columns stand out from the rich oaken\nwalls, rich draperies giving colour to the whole. I hear of a rare old\npainting and a fine chimney-piece hidden away behind the throne, but\nhave no opportunity of seeing, so perforce turn my attention elsewhere.\nOn either side are some glass fronted cases containing quite a\ncollection of ragged and venerable regimental colours of unmistakable\nSpanish origin. Had I time to linger, I should hear of many fierce\nstruggles and much gallant conduct ere these trophies were taken; but\nall this is of the past, and so I leave them, silent tokens of\nnational pride.\n\n[Illustration: THE QUEEN OF HOLLAND.\n_From a Photo. by W. G. Kuijer, Amsterdam._]\n\nThe chandeliers here are of very unique and costly appearance: Royal\nArms and crowns in ormolu, with pendants of curious device in pure\ncrystal; three hundred and sixty-four lights are here displayed.\n\nWhile I have been looking round, attentive servitors have been busily\nengaged in uncovering the throne and canopy for my inspection, and the\ncrown which surmounts the chair is fetched from its safe keeping place,\nscrewed on, and I am at liberty to thoroughly examine the most important\npiece of furniture in the kingdom.\n\nIt is essentially new looking; and really _is_ so, only having been\nfitted up some three years since, on the death of the late King and the\nconsequent accession of Wilhelmina, the present child-Queen. Virtually\nthis seat is unoccupied, as five years must elapse ere the coming of age\nand coronation of her youthful Majesty. Meanwhile her mother is\nQueen-Regent, governing wisely and well, and endearing herself to the\npeople in every way; but more especially in the care she manifests in\nthe training of their future ruler to the proper regard of the important\nposition she will have to fill, and the faithful observance of duties\nappertaining to such a position.\n\n[Illustration: THE QUEEN-REGENT.\n_From a Photo. by W. G. Kuijer, Amsterdam._]\n\nAccomplishments are imparted as a matter of course, but very much\nattention is given to formation of character, and many stories reached\nme of the wise method displayed, and the already promising result,\ngiving much hope for a bright future. As most of my readers are aware,\nthe Queen Regent and our Duchess of Albany are sisters, and all who know\nanything of the sweet-faced widow of our beloved Queen's youngest son\nwill at once comprehend much of the sister whom she so nearly resembles.\n\nPerhaps you would like a description of the throne. The chair is\nbeautifully burnished, covered with ruby velvet, and edged with ruby and\ngold fringe; the back is surmounted by a crown containing sapphires,\nwith lions in support; another crown and the letter W being wrought on\nthe velvet immediately underneath. In front of the chair is a footstool\nto match. The canopy is curtained in ruby velvet, with lining of cream\nsilk--in token of the youth of its future occupant--with fringe, cord,\nand tassels of gold. It is surmounted by crowns and ostrich plumes, on\nthe inner centre being worked the Royal Arms, with the motto \"Je\nMaintiendrai\" standing out in bold relief. On either side the canopy may\nbe noted the floral wreaths containing the \"Zuid Holland\" and \"Noord\nHolland\" respectively. The room--as are the major part of them--is\nrichly carpeted with hand-made \"Deventers\" of artistic design and\ncolour blend.\n\n[Illustration: THE QUEEN'S SITTING-ROOM.\n_From a Photo. by Gunn & Stewart, Richmond._]\n\nLeaving here, I pass on to a room which is of much importance, namely,\nthe sitting-room of Her Majesty the Queen. In the lifetime of the late\nKing it was his habit to pass very much of his time here; thus, this was\nreally His Majesty's audience chamber. Here he would have his little\ndaughter of whom he was passionately fond--taking a great delight in\nlistening to her merry prattle, and her amusing remarks on whatever\nattracted her attention. The windows of the room look out on to the Dam,\na large square, which is quite the busiest part of the city. The view\nfrom these windows is a never-ending source of interest to the little\nPrincess, and here she is wont to station herself, the inhabitants\ncontinually congregating and greeting her with hearty cheering.\n\nThe room has an artistic ceiling by Holsteyn, and on the walls are some\npaintings rich in detail, and of much historic interest. One of Flinck's\nlargest works--\"Marcus Curius Dentatus\"--is at one end: at the other,\none of Ferdinand Bol's--\"Fabricius in the Camp of Pyrrhus.\" Facing the\nwindows is one by Wappers and Eeckhout: one that irresistibly appeals\nto the hearts of all Hollanders. It is called the \"Self-Sacrifice of Van\nSpeyk,\" and depicts the brave admiral of that name blowing up his vessel\nrather than surrender.\n\nVan Speyk was educated in one of the public schools for which Amsterdam\nis famous. Quite early in life he entered the navy, where his career was\nbrilliant and his promotion rapid, but never did he so gain the devoted\nadmiration of his countrymen as when he had nothing before him but death\nor defeat, and chose the former, calling on his men to jump and swim, if\nthey cared to; if not, to remain and share his fate. Only one jumped:\nthe others stood by their commander, faced death calmly, and won a\nnever-dying renown for their heroism.\n\nThere is a wonderful chandelier from the ceiling centre, made of copper\nand ormolu, burning seventy-two lights, and of such enormous size that\none wonders how many floors it would crash through if it were to give\nway; then I learn that it is supported by concealed cross-beams hidden\naway under the ceiling. After that information, it is a great deal more\ncomfortable to walk about under it than hitherto, as the men in\nuncovering it had moved it, and it was still swinging backwards and\nforwards in anything but a reassuring manner. Some fine marble columns\nand a sculptured chimney-piece are worth attention, as are the costly\nhangings and carpet. Here I may say that the greater part of the\nfurniture in this Palace is \"First Empire\" style, and of the costliest\ndescription.\n\n[Illustration: A CORNER OF THE QUEEN'S SITTING-ROOM.\n_From a Photo. by Gunn & Stuart, Richmond._]\n\nWhat will, no doubt, greatly interest you is the accompanying photograph\nof small furniture specially made for her youthful Majesty, and used\nexclusively by her. The frames are of the finest over-burnish, the plush\nupholstery being decorated with the rarest specimens of art needlework.\nOn one of the little tables you will note a battledore and shuttlecock,\nwith another thrown upon the floor, as though the player had been\nsuddenly interrupted in the midst of her play. Very ordinary make and\nshape are these toys, such as you may see in any middle-class English\nhome, and each of them looking like favourites--judging from the signs\nof much use they present.\n\nPlay-days are not yet over for the Queen, and doubtless she does not\nwish to hasten their departure, for children are children all the world\nover, whether born in palace or cottage. This particular one is not to\nbe envied by those of lower station, who have not the responsibility of\nposition ever looming in front of them--for she is shut away from many\nyouthful pleasures, and denied the constant companionship of those\nsuited to her age.\n\nI heard a story that on one occasion, in playing with her dolls, she was\nthus heard to speak to a supposed refractory one: \"Now, be good and\nquiet, because if you don't I will turn you into a Queen, and then you\nwill not have anyone to play with at all.\" That is sufficiently pathetic\nto speak volumes of what it is to be born in the purple, as was\nWilhelmina of the Netherlands.\n\n[Illustration: PAINTED FRIEZE ON MANTEL-PIECE IN DINING-ROOM.\n_From a Photo. by Gunn & Stuart, Richmond_.]\n\nThe Hall of the Mose is the next place I visit, used as the small dining\nroom of the Royal Family. Unfortunately, this is just undergoing\npartial restoration, so no proper picture or description can be\nobtained. I observe a painted ceiling, some marble columns of the Ionic\norder, blue and gold furniture and hangings; and then some costly and\nrare paintings, three in number.\n\nFacing the windows is a masterpiece of Jakob de Wit, \"Moses Choosing the\nSeventy Elders.\" The figures are life-size, the painting--extending the\nentire length of the room--said to be the largest in Europe. There are\nmarble fireplaces at either end, over one \"Solomon's Prayer,\" by G.\nFlinck, and over the other \"Jethro Counselling Moses to Appoint\nJudges from the People,\" by Bronkhorst. Quite a feature of this room is\nthe wonderful deceptive painting by this master over each door, and on a\ncontinuous frieze. All of this is such an exact representation of\nsculptured relief, that it is almost necessary to touch it ere one can\nbe convinced of its really level surface. I was told that this is the\nonly known example of this truly wonderful work.\n\n[Illustration: THE JUDGMENT OF SOLOMON.\n_From a Photo. by Gunn & Stuart, Richmond_.]\n\nContinuing my way through the aides-de-camps' waiting-room--stopping\nmerely to note one of Jan Livensz' works--I go on to the Vierschaar.\nHere the walls are lined entirely with white marble, and present a fine\nsculptured frieze representing Disgrace and Punishment, with reliefs\nemblematical of Wisdom and Justice. The one here presented is Wisdom, as\nshown in the Judgment of Solomon.\n\nIn the large dining-room may also be seen more of the matchless white\nmarble ornamentation, and I should much like to linger and admire, but\nas Her Majesty the Queen-Regent has graciously promised me the _entree_\nof other of her Royal Palaces, I am obliged rather to curtail my work in\nAmsterdam.\n\nJust now their Majesties are not at this particular Palace, so I see\nnothing of State dinners, receptions, and other functions, but although\nI do not see them, I hear very much; and it would seem that when they\n_are_ here, the Palace is a sort of open house, and festivity is the\norder of the day. To all appearance the etiquette is not quite so rigid\nas at _our_ Court, the Sovereign being more accessible to the people.\nPersons wishing to pay their respects call at the Palace about five days\nprevious, write their name in a book kept for the purpose, then they are\nadmitted on the specified day, provided no good reason exists for their\nexclusion. The people are eminently loyal, and speak of the little Queen\nin tones of warmest affection, an affection which is also extended to\nthe Queen-Regent, who has evidently made herself a firm position in\nthe country.\n\nThe Palace at Den Haag is before me now, but first perhaps you would\nlike to know something of the Palace at the Loo, a place I had the\nprivilege of seeing; though, as their Majesties were actually in\nresidence there, photographic work was not possible.\n\nThe Loo is near Apeldoorn, and some considerable distance from\nAmsterdam. I have only the one day to spare, so am off early in the\nmorning. Steaming out of the Central Station, I soon find myself\nspeeding along in such comfortable, well-warmed carriages as would\nrejoice the unfortunate winter traveller in this country, who is all but\ndependent on his ability to pay for the not very useful foot-warmer.\n\nThe country is pretty but flat, <DW18>s instead of hedges, windmills\nwithout number; hundreds of cows in the fields, very fine cattle, but\nthey _do_ look comical, for the majority of them are wearing coats!\n\nAt frequent intervals along the line are road crossings, each with their\nlittle gatehouse, and each kept by a woman, who turns out as we pass,\ndressed in her long blue coat with scarlet facings, quaint, tall shiny\nhat, and in her hand the signal-flag.\n\nAt length I reach Apeldoorn, and there a difficulty presents itself.\nThat the Palace is some distance away I am aware, but _how_ far I do not\nknow, or in which direction, and while I am parleying and gesticulating\nin a mixture of French, English, and a _few_ words of Dutch, the only\nconveyance obtainable takes itself off, and I am left to tramp through\nthe woods with a jargon of Dutch directions ringing in my ears, and a\nvery faint idea of longitude or latitude in my mind.\n\nThe first part lay through a long, straggling village leading right into\na beautiful forest. Given a fine day, and a certainty of route, it would\nhave been simply grand; but as it soon poured in torrents, my situation\nwas anything but enviable--in fact, I was almost in despair, when a huge\ncart laden with trunks of trees came slowly from a turning near.\n\nMaking the man in charge understand that I wanted the \"Paleis,\" I found\nhe was bound in the same direction. By this time the rutty roads were\nalmost ankle deep in mud, so when I was invited to ride, I gladly\nscrambled to the top of the pile, and so jogged along; my good-natured\nguide trudging at the side, pipe in mouth, regardless of the weather. In\nsuch stately style, then, I at length sighted the Palace, but was\ncareful to make a descent before getting _too_ near, as THE STRAND\nMAGAZINE must make a more dignified appearance at a Royal residence than\na wood-cart and a smock-frocked driver can impart.\n\nFour or five men in State liveries bow profoundly as I enter, one of\nwhom conducts me to an ante-room, and, after a short interval, through\nsome long corridors, up some stairs and into the presence of one of Her\nMajesty's Gentlemen of the Household. A courteous interview with him,\nand I am asked to wait for Her Majesty's Private Secretary, who, out at\npresent, will see me on his return.\n\n[Illustration: THE ROYAL PALACE AT DEN HAAG.\n_From a Photo. by Gunn & Stuart, Richmond_.]\n\nOf course I make the best use of the interval and see all I can of the\nPalace. A fine-looking and imposing building it is, standing back in a\nlarge quadrangle, the latter being gay with flowers. The outer rails are\nliterally on the edge of the wood, and no more secluded spot can be\nimagined than this--the favourite residence of their Majesties. His\nMajesty the late King also preferred this residence to those more\nimmediately near or in towns, and it was here he breathed his last.\n\nWhat I see of the interior is superbly grand, but it is more to the\npurpose that I have the honour of seeing their Majesties during the day,\nand the opportunity of some observation. The youthful Queen seems a most\npleasing and intelligent-looking child, and is eminently child-like and\nunaffected in her manner and movements. Readers may be interested in\nknowing that, in addition to masters provided for Her Majesty's\ntraining, she has an English governess, under whose charge she is more\nimmediately placed.\n\nThe Queen-Regent, as I have already said, much resembles her sister; not\nso tall, rather stouter, but with much the same gentle and rather sad\nexpression of countenance. Strange that these two sisters should both\nbecome widows at an early age. One comfort they have, there is no very\ngreat distance between them; and though, of course, the Queen-Regent\ncannot leave her country much, there is nothing to prevent the Duchess\nof Albany going there; so a suite of apartments is kept for her at\neach Palace.\n\nMy interview with Her Majesty's Private Secretary is of the most\npleasant, and I cannot but record my grateful appreciation of this\ngentleman's kindness and courtesy extended towards me throughout my stay\nin Holland; such courteous attention much facilitating my work.\n\nBack again to Amsterdam; and the next day off in quite an opposite\ndirection to Den Haag, one of the cleanest and most picturesque places I\nhave ever seen.\n\n[Illustration: STATUE OF WILLIAM II, WITH THE CHURCH.\n_From a Photo. by Gunn & Stuart, Richmond_.]\n\nHere the Palace was built by William II. It is in the Grecian style, and\nstands on the site of a former hunting-lodge, dating back to the 9th\ncentury. Facing the principal entrance is an equestrian statue of\nWilliam II., at the back of which you note the church attended by the\nfamily. The entrance hall and staircase are lined with marble, the\nstairs themselves being of the same. Before proceeding up them, however,\nwe go through to the pretty and well-kept garden and take a view from\nthe lawn. In the right wing of the building as it faces you, the Queen's\nprivate apartments are situated, the left wing containing the rooms\noccupied by the Duchess of Albany when at The Hague.\n\nNow we pass up the grand staircase, where I pause to note the Ionic\ncolumns, the ormolu and porcelain candelabra, a Siberian vase from the\nEmperor Nicholas, five immense vases from the Emperor of China, a\npainting of William IV., and one of Maria of Stockholm and family.\n\n[Illustration: THE LATE KING'S RECEPTION-ROOM.\n_From a Photo. by Gunn & Stuart, Richmond_.]\n\nLeaving here, the first room I enter is the King's reception-room. This\nis a very bright looking and expensively fitted apartment, furnished in\nelectric blue and gold, massive gold-framed panels, and a ceiling\ndecorated in relief with arms and mottoes in gold and white. The\nchimney-piece is purest marble, the frescoes showing crowns, arms, etc.\nThe candelabra are over-burnished brass and Dresden china, some\nbeing Japanese.\n\n[Illustration: THE QUEEN'S BALL-ROOM.\n_From a Photo. by Gunn & Stuart, Richmond._]\n\nThe next room is most interesting, for it is a small ball-room, the\nball-room in fact of Her Majesty the Queen. It has a beautiful inlaid\nfloor, a white ceiling worked in relief, crimson and gold curtains, and\nfurniture of the First Empire, some of it upholstered in gold silk, with\na variety of colours intermixed. Here are shown some priceless Sevres\nchina, and a present of vases from the Emperor Napoleon. Also I note a\nfine marble vase from the King's Palace in Luxemburg. On the wall are\nsome handsome gold-framed mirrors, and from the ceiling costly\nchandeliers with two hundred and twenty lights. The mantel is\nexquisitely carved marble, with an ormolu frieze. On one side you will\nnote a small piano; it is a French one, of very clear and fine tone, and\nbeautifully finished in every respect. In this room Her Majesty the\nQueen may be imagined enjoying the balls given to the youthful\naristocracy, something different to the State dances in the larger room;\nand, doubtless, by a long way, much more enjoyable. By the time the\nQueen can command the State balls, she will have commenced to feel the\ncares of her position; and will look back with real regret to the\nassemblies here, when she had merely to enjoy herself, a devoted mother\nobserving the graver duties, her own greatest trouble, perhaps, being\nthe acquirement of the tasks assigned by the governess and masters.\n\n[Illustration: THE LARGE DINING-ROOM.\n_From a Photo by Gunn & Stuart, Richmond._]\n\nThe large dining-room has some fine family portraits on its walls. The\nfirst you will notice is that of William II., on horseback, leading an\nattack; the artist (Keirzer) has produced a first-rate work of both man\nand horse. Underneath this picture stands the favourite horse of William\nII., one which carried him through numerous engagements, and earned from\nhis Royal master a gratitude and affection that caused him to wish for\nhis preservation in a position where he would constantly be reminded of\nhim.\n\n[Illustration: FAVOURITE HORSE OF WILLIAM II.\n_From a Photo. by Gunn & Stuart, Richmond._]\n\nThe ceiling of this room shows some beautiful relief carving of fruit\nand flowers, also some fine fresco work; the chandeliers here are\nmassive, as is the furniture and other appointments. The room is long\nand of not much width, but lofty and well-lighted.\n\nThe buffet adjoining the dining-room has some very costly and, at the\nsame time, some very interesting contents. The Empire furniture is\ndraped in rich crimson silk, the walls being covered with silk brocade\nof the same colour. The chimney-piece of sculptured marble, with an\normolu frieze, holds some choice antique porcelain vases and a valuable\nRoman timepiece. A massive chandelier hangs from the centre of a ceiling\nwrought with the arms of the house--this chandelier being solid silver.\nIt was presented by the inhabitants of Amsterdam, while two silver\nlustres at the sides of the fireplace were presented by Rotterdam. Two\nexquisite statues stand in front of the windows, one of Venus, the other\nDiana, midway between which is an immense porcelain vase on a pedestal.\nThis you will note in the view given of the room. It has special\ninterest just now, as it was given by Marshal MacMahon, whose death\nrecently occurred, and whose funeral--a State military one--I had the\nopportunity of witnessing a few weeks ago in Paris.\n\n[Illustration: THE CRYSTAL ROOM.\n_From a Photo. by Gunn & Stuart, Richmond._]\n\nThe windows are of very fine stained glass, the different panes giving\nportraits of Kings and Princes, under each being depicted battles they\nhad fought. Note this rare Florentine mosaic table with pedestal of\normolu; then we will pass on to the crystal room, an ante-room to the\nball-room. Some immense candelabra of purest crystal at once attracted\nmy attention; not only were they of the largest I had ever seen, but\nthey were absolutely unique in composition: the pedestals in support\nwere ormolu and marble.\n\n[Illustration: SIDEBOARD AND MINIATURES IN SMALL DINING-ROOM.\n_From a Photo by Gunn & Stuart, Richmond._]\n\nThe appointments here are again in the First Empire style. The view here\nshown is looking into the small dining-room, the private dining-room of\ntheir Majesties. In it there is to be seen a costly collection of\nminiatures, nearly a hundred and twenty in number, every one of them\nfrom the hand of Dutch masters. They are all beautifully framed in\ngroups. In the photograph you will observe a finely carved side-board\nwith some of these miniatures showing on either side. Also in this room\nyou will find several specimens of engraving on brass and some Russian\nproductions in malachite.\n\n[Illustration: THE STATE BALL-ROOM.\n_From a Photo by Gunn & Stuart, Richmond._]\n\nNow to the State ball-room--a nobly proportioned room, but of somewhat\nsevere aspect Some good relief carving is shown and a splendid parquetry\nfloor; also some costly furniture, over-burnished and upholstered in\ncrimson with floral devices. No doubt it has a very imposing and gay\nappearance when lighted up and filled with guests. Nearly seven hundred\nlights are displayed, which would naturally cause a most brilliant\neffect. Somehow ball-rooms are never satisfactory when viewed in the\nday-time, unless you have an eye for proportions only; in that case this\none could not fail to please, as it cannot be less than 90ft. long and\nis of magnificent height, added to by a glass concave roof.\n\n[Illustration: THE QUEEN'S RECEPTION-ROOM.\n_From a Photo by Gunn & Stuart, Richmond._]\n\nThe Queen's reception-room is prettily hung in crimson with designs\ndepicting art and music; the furniture bright and handsome in crimson\nand cream. On either side of the fireplace stand some crimson velvet\nscreens in burnished frames, the crown and arms worked on the velvet in\ncharacters of gold. In the accompanying view you will observe a large\nalbum on a stand; this was given to the Queen-Regent by the ladies of\nHolland. It is of leather, with ormolu mounts, on the covers being\npainted panels and flowers worked in silk, these flowers being\nsurrounded with rubies and pearls; and at either corner is a large\nsapphire. The interior shows pages of vellum, with names of subscribers\nbeautifully inscribed.\n\nThis room will, of course, be the one where the young Queen will receive\nwhen she commences to reign.\n\nFrom here I went to view a suite of apartments, formerly the property of\nQueen Sophia, the first Consort of the late King. These rooms are still\nin the same condition as when Her Majesty died; they are very fine\nrooms, and contain a vast number of curios of every description. They\nare lined entirely from floor to ceiling with mahogany; the furniture,\nwhich is massive, antique, and beautifully carved, being also of\nmahogany and tulip wood. I find one of Erard's grand pianos standing in\nthe boudoir, and am told that it was a favourite instrument of the late\nQueen. There are some fine specimens of vases: one an \"Adam and Eve,\"\nsome of Swiss make, and others of Dresden. Also I note an exquisite\nmodel of a ship, an inlaid Empire mirror, and other treasures too\nnumerous to particularize.\n\n[Illustration: OVER-MANTEL IN TEA-ROOM.\n_From a Photo by Gunn & Stuart, Richmond._]\n\nThe tea-room is another that I must make brief mention of. It contains\nsome valuable souvenirs in the form of vases, some from the Emperor\nNapoleon (these are jewelled), some from William IV. of Germany, and\nsome from the Emperor Frederick. Then there are others from Berlin and\nPotsdam, and still others of Sevres. On the marble mantel is a very\nintricate French timepiece, and over it an exquisite silver-framed\nmirror. An inlaid mosaic table is a feature here. The worth of it must\nbe fabulous; the design is marvellously executed. Pope Pius IX. was the\ndonor. This room is really the tea-room for the Royal ladies when in\nresidence. Music is again to the fore, and here Steinway is the\nfavourite, one of his grand pianos occupying the place of honour.\n\nNow I go downstairs for a brief survey of the private apartments of the\nlate King. I shall not attempt to describe them in detail, but content\nmyself with mention of one or two things I specially noticed. I started\nwith the billiard-room, a good-sized room and well fitted; but obscured\nby the covers denoting non-usage. One curious article I must note. It is\na clock and musical-box combined, giving out a variety of twenty-seven\ntunes. The visible part of it is a pure alabaster representation of the\ntomb of our Henry II, supported by lions couchant. Rather a strange\nmodel for a musical-box containing lively airs, is it not?\n\n[Illustration: THE LATE KING'S SITTING-ROOM.\n_From a Photo. by Gunn & Stuart, Richmond._]\n\nThen I pass on through the King's dining-room, a stately and\nrichly-appointed apartment. On through the Ministers' room, and so into\nHis Majesty's private sitting-room. Here I cannot but linger, there are\nso many treasures rich and rare, the chief of which consists in the\nelaborate cabinets and other furniture, all of tortoiseshell and silver,\nquite the best I have seen of its kind. Some of it looks as though\ncrammed with secret drawers, and I stand before it wondering whether\nQueen Wilhelmina will be as anxious to discover and overhaul them as _I_\nshould be.\n\nI could tell you a deal more of what I saw at this Palace at Den Haag,\nbut, doubtless, have said enough to show you something of its wealth of\nappointments and costly treasures. One cannot help thinking what a sum\nall this has cost, and what it must take to keep up so many places; but\nthe Royal Family of the Netherlands have well-lined coffers, as it is\nnot only their own country that owns their supremacy, but they have also\nmany dependencies in the Indies, bringing in enormous revenues.\n\n[Illustration: \"T'HUIS IN'T BOSCH,\" NEAR DEN HAAG.\n_From a Photo. by Gunn & Stuart, Richmond._]\n\nI have mentioned three Palaces; I know of five; but will close with just\na few words respecting a fourth, and a view of the same, which is\ncharmingly pretty. This Palace is called \"T'Huis in't Bosch,\" and is\njust a nice carriage drive from the town of Den Haag. It stands right in\nthe midst of a beautiful park, with herds of deer and hundreds of\ngay-plumaged birds--a park that far and away surpasses even our vaunted\nRichmond Park--magnificent timber, dense undergrowth, wild flowers in\nprofusion, and now and again winding lakes and streams, crossed by\nrustic bridges, and such views over hill and dale as would delight\neither an artist or an admirer of Nature. The above view of the house\nwill give a good idea of its outside appearance. I have no time for\ninteriors, or should be tempted to prolong this indefinitely. We have\nhad a peep at the Palaces of Holland, and many of us will know more of\nthe country and its reigning family for the visit.\n\nHolland, with its youthful Queen, has a future we cannot wot of, but we\nall hope it is a prosperous and bright one, and we all agree in thanking\nHer Majesty the Queen-Regent for the opportunity of gaining this\ninformation, and wish for her daughter all the happiness and wisdom that\nshe--the Royal mother--could desire for her.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n[_The Illustrated Interviews will be continued as usual next month_.]\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n_Zig-Zags at the Zoo._\n\nXIX. ZIG-ZAG BATRACHIAN.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\nThe frog and the toad suffer, in this world of injustice, from a\ndeprival of the respect and esteem that is certainly their due. In the\ncase of the frog this may be due largely to the animal's headlong and\nharlequin-like character, but the toad is a steady personage, whose\nsolemnity of deportment, not to speak of his stoutness, entitles him to\nhigh consideration in a world where grave dulness and personal\ncircumference always attract reverence. The opening lines of a certain\nfamous poem have without a doubt done much to damage the dignity of the\nfrog. \"The frog he would a-wooing go\" is not, perhaps, disrespectful,\nalthough flippant; but \"whether his mother would let him or no\" is a\ngross insult. Of course, it is a matter upon which no self-respecting\nfrog ever consults his mother; but the absurd jingle is immortal, and\nthe frog's dignity suffers by it. Then there is a certain pot-bellied\nsmugness of appearance about the frog that provokes a smile in the\nirreverent. Still, the frog has received some consideration in his time.\nThe great Homer himself did not disdain to sing the mighty battle of the\nfrogs and mice; and Aristophanes gave the frogs a most important chorus\nin one of his comedies; moreover, calling the whole comedy \"The Frogs,\"\nalthough he had his choice of title-names among many very notable\ncharacters--AEschylus, Euripides, Bacchus, Pluto, Proserpine, and other\nleaders of society. Still, in every way the frog and the toad are\nunderesteemed--as though such a thing as a worthy family frog or an\nhonourable toad of business were in Nature impossible. It is not as\nthough they were useless. The frog's hind legs make an excellent dish\nfor those who like it, as well as a joke for those who don't. Powdered\ntoad held in the palm is a fine thing to stop the nose bleeding--or, at\nany rate, it was a couple of hundred years ago, according to a dear old\nalmanac I have. On the same unimpeachable authority I may fearlessly\naffirm a smashed frog--smashed on the proper saint's day--in conjunction\nwith hair taken from a ram's forehead and a nail stolen from a piebald\nmare's shoe, to be a certain remedy for ague, worn in a little leather\nbag. If it fails it will be because the moon was in the wrong quarter,\nor the mare was not sufficiently piebald, or the nail was not stolen\nwith sufficient dishonesty, or some mistake of that sort.\n\n[Illustration: A SMALL LUNCH.]\n\nPersonally, I am rather fond of frogs and toads. This, of course, in a\nstrictly platonic sense, and entirely apart from dinner. A toad I admire\neven more than a frog, because of his gentlemanly calm. He never rushes\nat his food ravenously, as do so many other creatures. Place a worm near\nhim and you will see. He inspects the worm casually, first with one eye\nand then with the other, as who would say: \"Luncheon? Certainly.\nDelighted, I'm sure.\" Then he sits placidly awhile, as though thinking\nof something else altogether. Presently he rises slightly on his feet\nand looks a little--very little--more attentively at the worm. \"Oh,\nyes,\" he is saying--\"luncheon, of course. Whenever you like, you know.\"\nAnd he becomes placid again, as though interested in the general\nconversation. After a little he suddenly straightens his hind legs and\nbends down over the worm, like a man saying, \"Ah, and what have we got\nhere now? Oh, worm--_ver au naturel_--capital, capital!\" After this\nthere is nothing to do but to eat, and this the toad does without the\nsmallest delay. For leisurely indifference, followed by a business-like\ngrab, nothing can beat a toad. Almost before the cover is lifted,\nfiguratively speaking, the worm's head and tail are wriggling, like a\nlively moustache, out of the sides of the toad's mouth. The head and\ntail he gently pats in with his hands, and there is no longer any worm;\nafter which the toad smiles affably and comfortably, possibly meditating\na liqueur. I have an especial regard for the giant toad in one of the\ncases against the inner wall of the reptile-house lobby. There is a\npimpliness of countenance and a comfortable capaciousness of waistcoat\nabout him that always make me wonder what he has done with his\nchurchwarden and pewter. He has a serene, confidential,\nwell-old-pal-how-are-you way of regarding Tyrrell, his keeper. Of late\n(for some few months, that is) the giant toad has been turning something\nover in his mind, as one may perceive from his cogitative demeanour. He\nis thinking, I am convinced, of the new Goliath Beetle. The Goliath\nBeetle, he is thinking, would make rather a fit supper for the Giant\nToad. This because he has never seen the beetle. His mind might be set\nat rest by an introduction to Goliath, but the acquaintanceship would do\nno good to the beetle's morals. At present Goliath is a most exemplary\nvegetarian and tea-drinker, but evil communications with that pimply,\ndissipated toad would wreck his principles.\n\n[Illustration: \"THINK I COULD MANAGE THAT BEETLE, TYRRELL?\"]\n[Illustration: EVIL COMMUNICATIONS.]\n\nWhy one should speak of the Adorned Ceratophrys when the thing might\njust as well be called the Barking Frog, I don't know. Let us compromise\nand call him the Adorned C., in the manner of Mr. Wemmick. I respect the\nAdorned C. almost as much as if he were a toad instead of a frog, but\nchiefly I admire his mouth. A crocodile has a very respectable\nmouth--when it separates its jaws it opens its head. But when the\nAdorned C. smiles he opens out his entire anatomical bag of tricks--\ncomes as near bisecting himself indeed as may be; opens, in short, like\na Gladstone bag. From a fat person, of course, you expect a broad,\ngenial smile; but you are doubly gratified when you find it extending\nall round him. That, you feel, is indeed no end of a smile--and that is\nthe smile of the Adorned C.\n\n[Illustration]\n[Illustration: \"DON'T SQUEEZE SO, TYRRELL!\"]\n[Illustration: \"WANT ME TO BARK?\"]\n[Illustration: \"HE CALLS THIS WINDING ME UP!\"]\n[Illustration: \"SHAN'T BARK--\"]\n[Illustration: \"SO THERE!\"]\n[Illustration: \"STOW THAT, TYRRELL!\"]\n[Illustration: \"HE'S ALWAYS DOING THAT.\"]\n[Illustration: \"I'LL GET SO WILD IN A MINUTE!\"]\n[Illustration: \"GUR-R-R-R-.\"]\n[Illustration: \"WOW, WOW!\"]\n[Illustration: \"SNAP! WOW-WOW!\"]\n[Illustration: \"WHAT, GOT TO GO BACK?\"]\n[Illustration: \"GOOD NIGHT. TYRRELL!\"]\n\nBut, notwithstanding this smile, the Adorned C. is short of temper.\nIndeed, you may only make him bark by practising upon this fact.\nTyrrell's private performance with the Adorned C. is one that\nirresistibly reminds the spectator of Lieutenant Cole's with his\nfigures, and would scarcely be improved by ventriloquism itself. The\nAdorned C. prefers biting to barking, and his bite is worse than his\nbark--bites always are, except in the proverb. This is why Tyrrell holds\nthe Adorned C. pretty tight whenever he touches him. The one aspiration\nof the Adorned C. is for a quiet life, and he defends his aspiration\nwith bites and barks. Tyrrell touches him gently, cautiously, and\nrepeatedly on the back until the annoyance is no longer to be tolerated,\nand then the Adorned C. duly barks like a terrier. Now, the most\ninteresting thing about the Adorned C., after his mouth, is his bark,\nand why he should be reluctant to exhibit it except under pressure of\nirritation--why he should hide his light under a bushel of ill-temper--I\ncan't conceive. It is as though Patti wouldn't sing till her manager\nthrew an egg at her, or as though Sir Frederick Leighton would only\npaint a picture after Mr. Whistler had broken his studio windows with a\nbrick. Even the whistling oyster of London tradition would perform\nwithout requiring a preliminary insult or personal assault. But let us\naccount everything good if possible; perhaps the Adorned C. only suffers\nfrom a modest dislike for vain display; although this is scarcely\nconsistent with the internal exhibition afforded by his smile.\n\n[Illustration]\n[Illustration]\n[Illustration]\n[Illustration]\n[Illustration]\n[Illustration]\n[Illustration]\n[Illustration]\n[Illustration]\n\nWith the distinction of residence in the main court of the reptile-house\nitself, as also with the knowledge of its rarity, the Smooth-clawed\nFrog sets no small value on himself. He lives in water perpetually, and\nis always bobbing mysteriously about in it with his four-fingered hands\nspread out before him. This seems to me to be nothing but a vulgar\nmanifestation of the Smooth-clawed Frog's self-appreciation. He is like\na coster conducting a Dutch auction, except that it is himself that he\nputs up for the bids of admiring visitors. With his double bunch of four\nfingers held eagerly before him he says--or means to say--\"'Ere--eight!\nAin't that cheap enough? Eight! Going at eight. Who says eight? Now\nthen--eight; for a noble frog like me!\" Presently, he wriggles a little\nin the water, as though vexed at the slackness of offers; then he drops\none of the hands and leaves the other outstretched. \"'Ere--four!\nAnythink to do business. Four! Nobody say four? Oh, blow this!\" and with\na jerk of one long paddle he dives among the weeds. \"Them shiny-lookin'\nswells ain't got no money!\" is what I am convinced he reports to\nhis friends.\n\nThe Smooth-clawed Frog has lately begun to breed here, a thing before\nunknown; so that his rarity and value are in danger of depreciation. But\nsuch is his inordinate conceit of himself that I am convinced he will\nalways begin the bidding with eight.\n\n[Illustration]\n[Illustration]\n[Illustration: \"HAPPY?\"]\n[Illustration: \"I AM HAPPY.\"]\n[Illustration: \"WHY SHOULDN'T I BE HAPPY?\"]\n[Illustration: \"THE SOCIETY LODGES ME.\"]\n[Illustration: \"TYRRELL FEEDS ME.\"]\n[Illustration: \"NO EXPENSE TO ME, YOU KNOW.\"]\n[Illustration]\n[Illustration: \"GOOD DAY TO YOU.\"]\n\nIf you rejoice in the sight of a really happy, contented frog, you\nshould stand long before White's Green Frog, and study his smile. No\nother frog has a smile like this; some are wider, perhaps, but that is\nnothing. A frog is ordained by Nature to smile much, but the smile seems\ncommonly one of hunger merely, though often one of stomach-ache. White's\nGreen Frog smiles broad content and placid felicity. Maintained in\ncomfort, with no necessity to earn his living, this is probably natural;\nstill, the bison enjoys the same advantages, although nobody ever saw\nhim smile; but, then, an animal soon to become extinct can scarcely be\nexpected to smile. In the smile of White's Green Frog, however, I fear,\na certain smug, Pecksniffian quality is visible. \"I am a Numble\nindividual, my Christian friends,\" he seems to say, \"and my wants, which\nare few and simple, are providentially supplied. Therefore, I am Truly\nHappy. It is no great merit in my merely batrachian nature that I am\nTruly Happy; a cheerful countenance, my friends, is a duty imposed on me\nby an indulgent Providence.\" White's Green Frog may, however, be in\nreality a frog of excellent moral worth: and I trust that Green's White\nFrog, if ever he is discovered, will be a moral frog too.\n\n[Illustration: \"HERE WE ARE!\"]\n[Illustration: \"HOW DO? I'M OFF.\"]\n[Illustration: \"EH?\"]\n[Illustration: \"WHAT?\"]\n[Illustration: \"WHO'S THAT?\"]\n[Illustration]\n\nBy-the-bye, some green frogs are blue. That is to say, individuals of\nthe green species have been found of the skyey colour and sold at a good\nprice as rarities. When it was not easy to find one already blue, the\nprudent tradesman kept a green frog in a blue glass vase for a few\nweeks, and brought it out as blue as you might wish. The colour stayed\nlong enough, as a rule, to admit of sale at a decent price, but was\nliable to fade after. As I think I have said, the toad is distinguished\nby a placid calm denied to the frog; therefore it is singular that the\nordinary toad's Latin name should be _Bufo vulgaris_--a name suggestive\nof nothing so much as a low--disgracefully low--comedian. _Bufo\nvulgaris_ should be the name of a very inferior, rowdy clown. The frog\nis a much nearer approximation to this character than the toad. The frog\ncomes headlong with a bound, a bunch of legs and arms, with his \"Here we\nare again! Fine day to-morrow, wasn't it?\" and goes off with another\nbound, before the toad, who is gravely analyzing the metaphysical aspect\nof nothing in particular, can open his eyes to look up. The toad has one\ncomic act, however, of infinitely greater humour than the bouncing\nbuffooneries of the frog. When the toad casts his skin he quietly rolls\nit up over his back and head, just as a man skins off a close-fitting\njersey. Once having drawn it well over his nose, however, he immediately\nproceeds to cram it down his throat with both hands, and so it finally\ndisappears. Now, this is a performance of genuine and grotesque humour,\nwhich it is worth keeping a toad to see.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n_The Helmet._\n\nFrom the French by Ferdinand Beissier.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\"But, uncle--I love my cousin!\"\n\n\"Get out!\"\n\n\"Give her to me.\"\n\n\"Don't bother me!\"\n\n\"It will be my death!\"\n\n\"Nonsense! you'll console yourself with some other girl.\"\n\n\"Pray--\"\n\nMy uncle, whose back had been towards me, whirled round, his face red to\nbursting, and brought his closed fist down upon the counter with a\nheavy thump.\n\n\"Never!\" he cried; \"never: Do you hear what I say?\"\n\nAnd as I looked at him beseechingly and with joined hands, he went on:--\n\n\"A pretty husband you look like!--without a sou, and dreaming of going\ninto housekeeping! A nice mess I should make of it, by giving you my\ndaughter! It's no use your insisting. You know that when I have said\n'No,' nothing under the sun can make me say 'Yes'!\"\n\nI ceased to make any further appeal. I knew my uncle--about as\nheadstrong an old fellow as could be found in a day's search. I\ncontented myself with giving vent to a deep sigh, and then went on with\nthe furbishing of a big, double-handed sword, rusty from point to hilt.\n\nThis memorable conversation took place, in fact, in the shop of my\nmaternal uncle, a well-known dealer in antiquities and _objets d'art_,\nNo. 53, Rue des Claquettes, at the sign of the \"Maltese Cross\"--a\nperfect museum of curiosities.\n\nThe walls were hung with Marseilles and old Rouen china, facing ancient\ncuirasses, sabres, and muskets, and picture frames; below these were\nranged old cabinets, coffers of all sorts, and statues of saints,\none-armed or one-legged for the most part and dilapidated as to their\ngilding; then, here and there, in glass cases, hermetically closed and\nlocked, there were knick-knacks in infinite variety--lachrymatories,\ntiny urns, rings, precious stones, fragments of marble, bracelets,\ncrosses, necklaces, medals, and miniature ivory statuettes, the yellow\ntints of which, in the sun, took momentarily a flesh-like transparency.\n\nTime out of mind the shop had belonged to the Cornuberts. It passed\nregularly from father to son, and my uncle--his neighbours said--could\nnot but be the possessor of a nice little fortune. Held in esteem by\nall, a Municipal Councillor, impressed by the importance and gravity of\nhis office, short, fat, highly choleric and headstrong, but at bottom\nnot in the least degree an unkind sort of man--such was my uncle\nCornubert, my only living male relative, who, as soon as I left school,\nhad elevated me to the dignity of chief and only clerk and shopman of\nthe \"Maltese Cross.\"\n\nBut my uncle was not only a dealer in antiquities and a Municipal\nCouncillor, he was yet more, and above all, the father of my cousin\nRose, with whom I was naturally in love.\n\nTo come back to the point at which I digressed.\n\nWithout paying any attention to the sighs which exhaled from my bosom\nwhile scouring the rust from my long, two-handed sword, my uncle,\nmagnifying glass in hand, was engaged in the examination of a lot of\nmedals which he had purchased that morning. Suddenly he raised his head;\nfive o'clock was striking.\n\n\"The Council!\" he cried.\n\nWhen my uncle pronounced that august word, it made a mouthful; for a\npin, he would have saluted it bare-headed. But, this time, after a\nmoment's consideration, he tapped his forehead and added, in a tone of\nsupreme relief:--\n\n\"No, the sitting does not take place before to-morrow--and I am\nforgetting that I have to go to the railway station to get the\nconsignment of which I was advised this morning.\"\n\nRising from his seat, and laying down his glass, he called out:--\n\n\"Rose, give me my cane and hat!\"\n\nThen, turning towards me, he added, in a lowered tone and speaking very\nquickly:--\n\n\"As to you--don't forget our conversation. If you think you can make me\nsay 'yes,' try!--but I don't think you'll succeed. Meanwhile, not a word\nto Rose, or, by Saint Barthelemy, my patron of happy memory, I'll\ninstantly kick you out of doors!\"\n\n[Illustration: \"AT THAT MOMENT ROSE APPEARED.\"]\n\nAt that moment Rose appeared with my uncle's cane and hat, which she\nhanded to him. He kissed her on the forehead; then, giving me a last but\neloquent look, hurried from the shop.\n\nI went on scouring my double-handed sword. Rose came quietly towards me.\n\n\"What is the matter with my father?\" she asked; \"he seems to be angry\nwith you.\"\n\nI looked at her--her eyes were so black, her look so kind, her mouth so\nrosy, and her teeth so white that I told her all--my love, my suit to\nher father, and his rough refusal. I could not help it--after all, it\nwas _his_ fault! He was not there: I determined to brave his anger.\nBesides, there is nobody like timid persons for displaying courage under\ncertain circumstances.\n\nMy cousin said nothing; she only held down her eyes--while her cheeks\nwere as red as those of cherries in May.\n\nI checked myself.\n\n\"Are you angry with me?\" I asked, tremblingly. \"Are you angry with me,\nRose?\"\n\nShe held out to me her hand. On that, my heart seething with audacity,\nmy head on fire, I cried:--\n\n\"Rose--I swear it! I will be your husband!\" And as she shook her head\nand looked at me sadly, I added: \"Oh! I well know that my uncle is\nself-willed, but I will be more self-willed still; and, since he must be\nforced to say 'yes,' I will force him to say it!\"\n\n\"But how?\" asked Rose.\n\nAh! how? That was exactly the difficulty. But, no matter; I would find a\nway to surmount it!\n\nAt that moment a heavy step resounded in the street. Instinctively we\nmoved away from each other; I returned to my double-handed sword, and\nRose, to keep herself in countenance, set to dusting, with a corner of\nher apron, a little statuette in its faded red velvet case.\n\nMy uncle entered. Surprised at finding us together, he stopped short and\nlooked sharply at us, from one to the other.\n\nWe each of us went on rubbing without raising our heads.\n\n\"Here, take this,\" said my uncle, handing me a bulky parcel from under\nhis arm. \"A splendid purchase, you'll see.\"\n\nThe subject did not interest me in the least.\n\nI opened the parcel, and from the enveloping paper emerged a steel\nhelmet--but not an ordinary helmet, oh, no!--a superb, a monumental\nmorion, with gorget and pointed visor of strange form. The visor was\nraised, and I tried to discover what prevented it from being lowered.\n\n\"It will not go down--the hinges have got out of order,\" said my uncle;\n\"but it's a superb piece, and, when it has been thoroughly cleaned and\ntouched up, will look well--that shall be your to-morrow's job.\"\n\n\"Very good, uncle,\" I murmured, not daring to raise my eyes to his.\n\nThat night, on reaching my room, I at once went to bed. I was eager to\nbe alone and able to think at my ease. Night brings counsel, it is said;\nand I had great need that the proverb should prove true. But, after\nlying awake for an hour without receiving any assistance, I fell off to\nsleep, and, till next morning, did nothing but dream the oddest dreams.\nI saw Rose on her way to church in a strange bridal costume, a\n14th-century cap, three feet high, on her head, but looking prettier\nthan ever; then suddenly the scene changed to moonlight, in which\ninnumerable helmets and pieces of old china were dancing a wild\nfarandola, while my uncle, clad in complete armour and with a formidable\nhalberd in his hand, conducted the bewildering whirl.\n\n[Illustration: \"MY UNCLE SAT SMOKING HIS PIPE AND WATCHING ME.\"]\n\nThe next day--ah, the next day!--I was no nearer. In vain, with clenched\nteeth, I scoured the immense helmet brought by my uncle the previous\nevening--scoured it with such fury as almost to break the iron; not an\nidea came to me. The helmet shone like a sun: my uncle sat smoking his\npipe and watching me; but I could think of nothing, of no way of forcing\nhim to give me his daughter.\n\nAt three o'clock Rose went into the country, whence she was not to\nreturn until dinner-time, in the evening. On the threshold she could\nonly make a sign to me with her hand; my uncle had not left us alone for\na single instant. He was not easy in his mind; I could see that by his\nface. No doubt he had not forgotten our conversation of the\nprevious evening.\n\nI went on rubbing at my helmet.\n\n\"You have made it quite bright enough--put it down,\" said my uncle.\n\nI put it down. The storm was gathering: I could not do better than allow\nit to blow over.\n\nBut suddenly, as if overtaken by a strange fancy, my uncle took up the\nenormous morion and turned and examined it on all sides.\n\n\"A handsome piece of armour, there is no doubt about it; but it must\nhave weighed pretty heavily on its wearer's shoulders,\" he muttered;\nand, urged by I know not what demon, he clapped it on his head and\nlatched the gorget-piece about his neck.\n\nStruck almost speechless, I watched what he was doing--thinking only\nhow ugly he looked.\n\nSuddenly there was a sharp sound--as if a spring had\nsnapped--and--crack!--down fell the visor; and there was my uncle, with\nhis head in an iron cage, gesticulating and swearing like a pagan!\n\nI could contain myself no longer, and burst into a roar of laughter; for\nmy uncle, stumpy, fat, and rubicund, presented an irresistibly comic\nappearance.\n\n[Illustration: \"THREATENINGLY HE CAME TOWARDS ME.\"]\n\nThreateningly, he came towards me.\n\n\"The hinges!--the hinges, fool!\" he yelled.\n\nI could not see his face, but I felt that it was red to bursting.\n\n\"When you have done laughing, idiot!\" he cried.\n\nBut the helmet swayed so oddly on his shoulders, his voice came from out\nit in such strange tones, that the more he gesticulated, the more he\nyelled and threatened me, the louder I laughed.\n\nAt that moment the clock of the Hotel-de-Ville, striking five, was\nheard.\n\n\"The Municipal Council!\" murmured my uncle, in a stifled voice. \"Quick!\nhelp me off with this beast of a machine! We'll settle our business\nafterwards!\"\n\nBut, suddenly likewise, an idea--a wild, extraordinary idea--came into\nmy head; but then, whoever is madder than a lover? Besides, I had no\nchoice of means.\n\n\"No!\" I replied.\n\nMy uncle fell back two paces in terror--and again the enormous helmet\nwobbled on his shoulders.\n\n\"No,\" I repeated, firmly, \"I'll not help you out, unless you give me the\nhand of my cousin Rose!\"\n\nFrom the depths of the strangely elongated visor came, not an angry\nexclamation, but a veritable roar. I had \"done it!\"--I had burned\nmy ships!\n\n\"If you do not consent to do what I ask of you,\" I added, \"not only will\nI not help you off with your helmet, but I will call in all your\nneighbours, and then go and find the Municipal Council!\"\n\n\"You'll end your days on the scaffold!\" cried my uncle.\n\n\"The hand of Rose!\" I repeated. \"You told me that it would only be by\nforce that you would be made to say 'yes'--say it, or I will call in the\nneighbours!\"\n\nThe clock was still striking; my uncle raised his arms as if to curse\nme.\n\n\"Decide at once,\" I cried, \"somebody is coming!\"\n\n\"Well, then--yes!\" murmured my uncle. \"But make haste!\"\n\n\"On your word of honour?\"\n\n\"On my word of honour!\"\n\nThe visor gave way, the gorget-piece also, and my uncle's head issued\nfrom durance, red as a poppy.\n\nJust in time. The chemist at the corner, a colleague in the Municipal\nCouncil, entered the shop.\n\n\"Are you coming?\" he asked; \"they will be beginning the business without\nus.\"\n\n\"I'm coming,\" replied my uncle.\n\nAnd without looking at me, he took up his hat and cane and hurried out.\n\nThe next moment all my hopes had vanished. My uncle would surely not\nforgive me.\n\nAt dinner-time I took my place at table on his right hand in low\nspirits, ate little, and said nothing.\n\n\"It will come with the dessert,\" I thought.\n\nRose looked at me, and I avoided meeting her eyes. As I had expected,\nthe dessert over, my uncle lit his pipe, raised his head, and then--\n\n\"Rose--come here!\"\n\nRose went to him.\n\n\"Do you know what that fellow there asked me to do, yesterday?\"\n\nI trembled like a leaf, and Rose did the same.\n\n[Illustration: \"DO YOU LOVE HIM?\"]\n\n\"To give him your hand,\" he added. \"Do you love him?\"\n\nRose cast down her eyes.\n\n\"Very well,\" continued my uncle; \"on this side, the case is complete.\nCome here, you.\"\n\nI approached him.\n\n\"Here I am, uncle,\" and, in a whisper. I added quickly: \"Forgive me!\"\n\nHe burst into a hearty laugh.\n\n\"Marry her, then, donkey--since you love her, and I give her to you!\"\n\n\"Ah!--uncle!\"\n\n\"Ah!--dear papa!\"\n\nAnd Rose and I threw ourselves into his arms.\n\n\"Very good! very good!\" he cried, wiping his eyes. \"Be happy, that's all\nI ask.\"\n\nAnd, in turn, he whispered in my ear:--\n\n\"I should have given her to you all the same, you big goose; but--keep\nthe story of the helmet between us two!\"\n\nI give you my word that I have never told it but to Rose, my dear little\nwife. And, if ever you pass along the Rue des Claquettes, No. 53, at the\nplace of honour in the old shop, I'll show you my uncle's helmet, which\nwe would never sell.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n_The Music of Nature._\n\nBY A. T. CAMDEN PRATT.\n\n\nII.\n\n\nReference was made at the close of the last article to the voice of the\ndog, and his method of making his feelings and desires understood. It\nis, of course, well known that this is an acquired habit, or\naccomplishment. In a state of Nature the dog does not even bark; he has\nacquired the art or knowledge from his companionship with man. Isaiah\ncompares the blind watchman of Israel to dogs, saying, \"They are dumb;\nthey cannot bark.\" Again, to quote the argument of Dr. Gardiner: \"The\ndog indicates his different feelings by different tones.\" The following\nis his yelp when his foot is trod upon.\n\n[Illustration]\n[Illustration: DOG YELPING.]\n\nHaydn introduces the bark of a dog into the scherzo in his 38th\nquartette. Indeed, the tones of the \"voice\" of the dog are so marked,\nthat more than any other of the voices of Nature they have been utilized\nin music. The merest tyro in the study of dog language can readily\ndistinguish between the bark of joy--the \"deep-mouthed welcome as we\ndraw near home,\" as Byron put it--and the angry snarl, the yelp of pain,\nor the accents of fear. Indeed, according to an assertion in the\n\"Library of Entertaining Knowledge,\" the horse knows from the bark of a\ndog when he may expect an attack on his heels. Gardiner suggests that it\nwould be worth while to study the language of the dog. Perhaps Professor\nGarnier, when he has reduced the language of the monkey to \"A, B, C,\"\nmight feel inclined to take up the matter.\n\n[Illustration]\n[Illustration: THE OX.]\n\nNext to the dog there is no animal in which there is more variation of\nsound than in oxen: \"Their lowing, though rough and rude, is music to\nthe farmer's ear save one who moans the loss of her sportive young; with\nwandering eye and anxious look she grieves the livelong day.\" It is\nspecially difficult in the case of oxen to suppose that they have a\nlanguage; but it is impossible to doubt that the variations of their\nlowing are understood of one another, and serve to express their\nfeelings if not their thoughts.\n\n[Illustration]\n[Illustration: COW LOWING.]\n\nIn the matter of exclamations, one knows how readily these may be\nimitated upon the violin, or in the case of the deeper or more guttural\nsounds, on the violoncello. The natural effect is greatly aided by the\nsliding of the finger along the note, especially in the case of the\nlowing of cattle; but there are other exclamations that are readily\nreduced to music. Gardiner gives one or two interesting cases, and the\ncommon salutation, \"How d'ye do?\" may be instanced. It usually starts on\nB natural, and the voice rising to D ends on C; whereas, the reply,\n\"Pretty well, thank you,\" begins on D, and falling to A, ends again on\nD. After a few attempts on the piano, the reader will be able readily to\nform these notes for himself.\n\n[Illustration]\n[Illustration: HORSE NEIGHING.]\n\nThe horse, on the other hand, is rarely heard, and, though having a\npiercing whinny which passes through every semitone of the scale, it is\nscarcely ever varied.\n\n[Illustration: THE CHIRP OF THE GRASSHOPPER.]\n\nThe music of the insects has already been alluded to, and everyone will\nagree with Gilbert White that \"not undelightful is the ceaseless hum, to\nhim who musing walks at noon.\" The entomologist has laboured hard to\nshow us that the insect has no voice, and that the \"drowsy hum\" is made\nby the wings; a fact which, being beyond all cavil, puts to the blush\nthe old-world story of Plutarch, who tells us that when Terpander was\nplaying upon the lyre, at the Olympic games, and had enraptured his\naudience to the highest pitch of enthusiasm a string of his instrument\nbroke, and a _cicada_ or grasshopper perched on the bridge supplied by\nits voice the loss of the string and saved the fame of the musician. To\nthis day in Surinam the Dutch call them lyre-players. If there is any\ntruth in the story, the grasshopper then had powers far in advance of\nhis degenerated descendants; for now the grasshopper--like the\ncricket--has a chirp consisting of three notes in rhythm, always forming\na triplet in the key of B.\n\n[Illustration]\n[Illustration: FLY BUZZING.]\n\n[Illustration]\n[Illustration: DUCK.]\n\nGardiner, on the authority of Dr. Primatt, states that, to produce the\nsound it makes, the house-fly must make 320 vibrations of its wings in\na second; or nearly 20,000 if it continues on the wing a minute. The\nsound is invariably on the note F in the first space. The music of a\nduck's note is given in the annexed score.\n\nIn conclusion, an article on the music of Nature would not be complete\nwithout an allusion to the music of the winds and the storm. Admirers of\nBeethoven will recall numerous passages that would serve as\nillustrations. One particularly might be mentioned--the chorus in\n\"Judah\" (Haydn), \"The Lord devoureth them all,\" which is admirably\nimitative of the reverberations of the cataract and the thundering of\nmighty waters. The sounds at sea, ominous of shipwreck, will also occur\nto the minds of some. At Land's End it is not uncommon for storms to be\nheralded by weird sounds; and in the northern seas sailors, always a\nsuperstitious race of people, used to be much alarmed by a singular\nmusical effect, which is now well known to be caused by nothing more\nfearsome than a whale breathing.\n\nThese instances might be still further multiplied, but enough have,\nperhaps, been given to excite some general interest in \"the _Music\nof Nature_.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n_Portraits of Celebrities at Different Times of Their Lives._\n\n\nSIR HENRY LOCH.\n\nBORN 1827.\n\n\nSir Henry Brougham Loch, G.C.M.G., K.C.B., whose name has recently been\nso prominently before the public in connection with the disturbances in\nMashonaland, is Chief Commissioner at the Cape. In his diplomatic career\nhe was taken prisoner during the war with China; and, with Mr. Boulby,\nthe _Times_ correspondent, was carried about in a cage by his captors,\nand exhibited to the natives. After his liberation he returned to\nEngland, and was appointed Governor of the Isle of Man, and subsequently\nGovernor of Victoria; and, in 1889, was appointed to succeed Sir\nHercules Robinson as Chief Commissioner at the Cape.\n\n[Illustration: AGE 22.\n_From a Painting._]\n\n[Illustration: AGE 39.\n_From a Painting by G.

She sang in London, and\nsuccessive audiences were quick to confirm the judgments of Sir Joseph\nBarnby and certain other critics who had heard her only in private. Her\nadvance to the front rank of English singers was exceedingly rapid, and\nher position amongst us was long since made secure. Madame Cole has\ntaken part in nearly all the great musical events in this country during\nthe past four years. She has sung everywhere in London--with the Royal\nChoral Society at the Albert Hall, at the Handel Festival at the Crystal\nPalace, at the Ballad Concerts, at the Monday Popular Concerts, at Sir\nCharles Halle's Concerts, and at Bristol, Chester, Leeds, Birmingham,\nand other leading towns. As seems to have been the case with most\nwell-dowered musicians, Madame Cole's talent owes something to heredity.\nMusical ability, greater or less, may at all events be traced back in\nher family for a considerable period. Madame Cole's first distinct\nsuccess in public was gained with Mr. Theodore Thomas, during that\ngentleman's first \"grand transcontinental tour from ocean to ocean\"\nin 1883.\n\n[Illustration: AGE 8.\n_From a Photograph._]\n\n[Illustration: AGE 20.\n_From a Photo. by Naegeli, New York._]\n\n[Illustration: PRESENT DAY.\n_From a Photo. by Walery, Regent Street._]\n\n\nTHE LORD BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.\n\nBORN 1843.\n\n\nProfessor the Rev.

It shone through the quaint old windows of a little,\nred-tiled cottage, and on the figure of a girl who stood in the centre\nof the kitchen reading a long, closely written letter. Over the blazing\nfire, where the \"pot au feu\" was simmering, bent an old woman, and the\ngirl's voice came joyously to her as she stirred the savoury mess.\n\n[Illustration: \"MY AUNT, PAUL HAS SENT FOR ME.\"]\n\n\"My aunt, Paul has sent for me. At last he has got permanent work. It is\nnothing very great at present, but it may lead to better things, and the\npay is enough, with what he has saved, to enable him to rent a little\n'appartement.' If I can, he wants me, with our little Pierre, to catch\nthe coach at 'Les Trois Freres' to-morrow. We should then reach Brussels\nby night and spend our New Year together.\"\n\nAs Babette spoke, her cheeks all flushed with hope and joy, the eyes of\nboth the women rested on a cradle that stood in the room. In this, baby\nPierre, only a twelvemonth old, lay sleeping peacefully.\n\nThen said the old woman, sadly, \"I shall miss you, dearest, and the baby\ntoo. Still, it is only right you should go. Perhaps in the summer you\nmay return for a bit. Time passes quickly. A year ago you were weeping\nover Paul's departure; and now, behold, you are going to join him, and\nlay in his arms the son he has never seen.\"\n\nBabette nodded. She was between tears and smiles. There was grief, true\nand deep, at leaving the dear old aunt, who had been so good to her and\nto her child. There was joy at the thought of seeing again the brave\nyoung husband whom she had wedded in the little village church two years\nbefore, and from whom the parting had been so bitter, when he left her,\njust before the birth of their baby boy, to seek work in the\nBelgian capital.\n\nBut there was no time to waste. After the simple mid-day meal there were\nmany things to be done, and all through the short winter day they were\nbusy. There was a bundle of warm wraps to be put together for Babette to\ntake with her. Her little trunk, with Pierre's cradle, and some odds and\nends of furniture, would follow in a few days, when her aunt had\ncollected and packed them all. Her little store of money was counted\nover. Alas! it was very slender. She must travel quickly and cheaply if\nit was to last her till she reached Brussels.\n\n\"Jean's cart will take you as far as 'Les Trois Freres,'\" said the old\nlady, cheerfully, after finding that counting the little heap of francs\nand half-francs over and over did not increase them. \"That will save\nsomething. You can catch the coach that stops there at two, and by six\nyou will be in Brussels. I pray the little one may not take cold.\"\n\nBabette agreed to all her aunt suggested. Jean was a farmer of the\nvillage; well-to-do and good-natured. She knew he would gladly give her\na seat in his waggon, which was going next day to \"Les Trois Freres,\" an\ninn six miles from the village. The coach for Brussels stopped there\ntwice a week, and when once she had taken her place in it, the worst of\nher journey would be over.\n\nThey went to rest early that night, and by eleven next morning the last\ngood-bye had been said. Pretty Babette was seated by the side of Farmer\nJean, with her baby boy, wrapped up in numerous shawls, clasped tightly\nto her, and the great Flemish horses were plodding, slowly but surely,\ntowards \"Les Trois Freres\".\n\nThe day was not as bright as the preceding one. Snow had fallen during\nthe night, and the sky looked heavy, as though there were more to come.\nBabette shivered, in spite of her long, warm cloak. The roads were\nfreezing hard, but they managed to proceed for a mile or two, and then\nsuddenly there came a sway and a lurch, for one of the horses had\nslipped and fallen on the snowy road, and the other was trying to free\nhimself from his struggling companion by frantic kicks and plunges.\n\nFarmer Jean had a man with him, and between them they got the poor\nanimal up, while Babette stood in the cold highway, her baby peeping\nwonderingly from the folds of her cloak.\n\nThe horse was bruised and cut about the knees, but otherwise unhurt, so\nthe men resumed their places; Babette climbed back to hers, and the\nheavy cart went jolting on. The farmer cracked his whip, and whenever\nthe road grew worse he or his man got down and led the horses. In spite\nof this, their progress grew slower and slower.\n\n\"I don't like to say so,\" said the master, \"but we've two more miles to\ngo, and it is past one o'clock now. My girl, if the coach is gone, I'll\nget you back and drive you in again next time it passes.\"\n\nBut Babette would not hear of this. Not to see Paul by nightfall! Not to\nbe clasped in his arms, she and little Pierre together, in one warm\nembrace! Not to spend New Year's Day with him! No! she would not think\nof it. And yet when, more than an hour later, they rolled into the yard\nof \"Les Trois Freres,\" there was no sign of the Brussels coach. It had\nstarted half an hour before. \"Les Trois Freres\" was a quiet, homely inn,\nlittle used excepting when the coach stopped there. Babette, pale and\ntrembling, got down and ran into the bar, where the landlord stood\nsmiling behind a row of bright pewter taps.\n\n\"Am I too late for the coach?\" she cried. \"Has it gone?\" And then, when\nthe man told her she was indeed too late, all strength and energy left\nher, and she sank sobbing on the wooden bench by the door.\n\nThere were two other men in the room, who looked at her curiously; she\nwas such a pretty girl, even in the midst of her grief. One was an old\npedlar, with his well-filled pack on the floor beside him. He had a\npleasant, homely face, and thin, bent figure. The other was a\nmiddle-sized, powerful fellow, clean shaven and beetle-browed, and\ndressed in shabby, ill-fitting garments. It was hard to tell what his\nrank in life might be. He stared once again at Babette, and then handed\nhis glass to the host to be re-filled. The pedlar was the first to break\nthe silence.\n\n[Illustration: \"'CHEER UP, MY LASS', HE SAID KINDLY.\"]\n\n\"Cheer up, my lass,\" he said, kindly; \"I too have missed the coach, and\nI too must reach Brussels to-night. I have two thousand francs in notes\nand gold in my pocketbook, which are the savings of a lifetime, and I am\ngoing to pay them into the bank tomorrow. Then I shall give up my trade\nand start a little shop.\"\n\n\"I would not talk too much about them in the meantime, friend. In some\ncountries it might be dangerous, but we are honest in Belgium.\"\n\nIt was the other man who spoke, and his voice, though rough, was not\nunpleasant. He paid the landlord, caught up his stick, and with a curt\n\"Good-day\" passed out of \"Les Trois Freres.\"\n\n\"He, also, perhaps, is going to Brussels. He means to walk, and if he,\nwhy not I?\" said the pedlar. He had come in cold and tired, and the\nlandlord's good ale had made him slightly loquacious. \"Yes, I shall try\nand walk. The roads are better walking than driving. It is not so very\nmany miles, and most likely I shall be overtaken by some cart going the\nsame way.\" And he rose as he spoke.\n\nBabette rose also and caught him eagerly by the hand. \"I will walk with\nyou,\" she cried. \"I am strong, well shod, and the fastest walker in our\nvillage. We can get to Brussels before dark, in spite of my having my\nboy to carry. Oh! bless you for thinking of it, for now I shall see Paul\nbefore the year is out.\"\n\nNor would she be dissuaded. Farmer Jean came in and said something about\nsnow. \"The sky was darkening for it already.\" But Babette was firm. The\nlandlord's buxom wife came forth from an inner room and offered her a\nlodging for the night, and then, when she could not persuade her, helped\nher to wrap the baby up afresh, and finally made her place in her pocket\na tiny flask of brandy, \"in case,\" she said, \"the snow should\novertake them.\"\n\nSo they started. Babette had spoken the truth when she called herself a\ngood walker. She was but twenty, and was both slight and active. The\npedlar too, in spite of his bent form, got over the ground quickly. They\nhad put four or five good miles between themselves and \"Les Trois\nFreres\" when the snow began to fall. It came down steadily in thick,\nheavy flakes. Babette drew her cloak yet closer round her boy and they\nplodded on, but walking became more and more difficult, and they grew\nboth weary and cold. Suddenly, by the roadside, several yards ahead,\nthey saw a man's figure. He was coming to meet them, and drew near\nrapidly, and then they recognised their friend in the shabby brown\nclothes, who had left the inn so shortly before them.\n\n\"I saw you coming,\" he explained, \"so came to meet you. Madame\"--with a\nbow to Babette, polite for one so uncouth looking--\"can go no further\nto-night; the storm will not pass off yet. I live not far from here with\nmy mother and brothers, and if madame likes, we can all take shelter\nunder my humble roof\n\n### Summary:\n\n"}

The Pursuit of Fire\n\n\n\n\nTHERE'S PIPPINS AND CHEESE TO COME\n\n\n\n\nThere's Pippins and Cheese To Come\n\n\nIn my noonday quest for food, if the day is fine, it is my habit to shun\nthe nearer places of refreshment. I take the air and stretch myself. Like\nEve's serpent I go upright for a bit. Yet if time presses, there may be had\nnext door a not unsavory stowage. A drinking bar is nearest to the street\nwhere its polished brasses catch the eye. It holds a gilded mirror to such\nred-faced nature as consorts within. Yet you pass the bar and come upon a\nrange of tables at the rear.\n\nNow, if you yield to the habits of the place you order a rump of meat.\nGravy lies about it like a moat around a castle, and if there is in you the\nzest for encounter, you attack it above these murky waters. \"This castle\nhath a pleasant seat,\" you cry, and charge upon it with pike advanced. But\nif your appetite is one to peck and mince, the whiffs that breathe upon the\nplace come unwelcome to your nostrils. In no wise are they like the sweet\nSouth upon your senses. There is even a suspicion in you--such is your\ndistemper--that it is too much a witch's cauldron in the kitchen, \"eye of\nnewt, and toe of frog,\" and you spy and poke upon your food. Bus boys bear\noff the crockery as though they were apprenticed to a juggler and were only\nat the beginning of their art. Waiters bawl strange messages to the cook.\nIt's a tongue unguessed by learning, yet sharp and potent. Also, there\ncomes a riot from the kitchen, and steam issues from the door as though the\ndevil himself were a partner and conducted here an upper branch. Like the\nman in the old comedy, your belly may still ring dinner, but the tinkle is\nfaint. Such being your state, you choose a daintier place to eat.\n\nHaving now set upon a longer journey--the day being fine and the sidewalks\nthronged--you pass by a restaurant that is but a few doors up the street.\nA fellow in a white coat flops pancakes in the window. But even though the\npancake does a double somersault and there are twenty curious noses pressed\nagainst the glass, still you keep your course uptown.\n\nNor are you led off because a near-by stairway beckons you to a Chinese\nrestaurant up above. A golden dragon swings over the door. Its race has\nfallen since its fire-breathing grandsire guarded the fruits of the\nHesperides. Are not \"soys\" and \"chou meins\" and other such treasures of the\nEast laid out above? And yet the dragon dozes at its post like a sleepy\ndog. No flame leaps up its gullet. The swish of its tail is stilled. If it\nwag at all, it's but in friendship or because a gust of wind has stirred it\nfrom its dreams.\n\nI have wondered why Chinese restaurants are generally on the second story.\nA casual inquiry attests it. I know of one, it is true, on the ground\nlevel, yet here I suspect a special economy. The place had formerly been a\nGerman restaurant, with Teuton scrolls, \"Ich Dien,\" and heraldries on its\nwalls. A frugal brush changed the decoration. From the heart of a Prussian\nblazonry, there flares on you in Chinese yellow a recommendation to try\n\"Our Chicken Chop Soy.\" The quartering of the House of Hohenzollern wears a\nbaldric in praise of \"Subgum Noodle Warmein,\" which it seems they cook to\nan unusual delicacy. Even a wall painting of Rip Van Winkle bowling at\ntenpins in the mountains is now set off with a pigtail. But the chairs were\nDutch and remain as such. Generally, however, Chinese restaurants are on\nthe second story. Probably there is a ritual from the ancient days of Ming\nTi that Chinamen when they eat shall sit as near as possible to the sacred\nmoon.\n\nBut hold a bit! In your haste up town to find a place to eat, you are\nmissing some of the finer sights upon the way. In these windows that\nyou pass, the merchants have set their choicest wares. If there is any\ncommodity of softer gloss than common, or one shinier to the eye--so\nthat your poverty frets you--it is displayed here. In the window of the\nhaberdasher, shirts--mere torsos with not a leg below or head above--yet\ndisport themselves in gay neckwear. Despite their dismemberment they are\ntricked to the latest turn of fashion. Can vanity survive such general\namputation? Then there is hope for immortality.\n\nBut by what sad chance have these blithe fellows been disjointed? If\na gloomy mood prevails in you--as might come from a bad turn of the\nmarket--you fancy that the evil daughter of Herodias still lives around the\ncorner, and that she has set out her victims to the general view. If there\ncomes a hurdy-gurdy on the street and you cock your ear to the tune of\nit, you may still hear the dancing measure of her wicked feet. Or it is\npossible that these are the kindred of Holofernes and that they have supped\nguiltily in their tents with a sisterhood of Judiths.\n\nOr we may conceive--our thoughts running now to food--that these gamesome\ncreatures of the haberdasher had dressed themselves for a more recent\nbanquet. Their black-tailed coats and glossy shirts attest a rare occasion.\nIt was in holiday mood, when they were fresh-combed and perked in their\nbest, that they were cut off from life. It would appear that Jack Ketch the\nheadsman got them when they were rubbed and shining for the feast. We'll\nnot squint upon his writ. It is enough that they were apprehended for some\nrascality. When he came thumping on his dreadful summons, here they were\nalready set, fopped from shoes to head in the newest whim. Spoon in hand\nand bib across their knees--lest they fleck their careful fronts--they\nwaited for the anchovy to come. And on a sudden they were cut off from\nlife, unfit, unseasoned for the passage. Like the elder Hamlet's brother,\nthey were engaged upon an act that had no relish of salvation in it. You\nmay remember the lamentable child somewhere in Dickens, who because of an\nabrupt and distressing accident, had a sandwich in its hand but no mouth\nto put it in. Or perhaps you recall the cook of the Nancy Bell and his\ngrievous end. The poor fellow was stewed in his own stew-pot. It was the\nElderly Naval Man, you recall--the two of them being the ship's sole\nsurvivors on the deserted island, and both of them lean with hunger--it was\nthe Elderly Naval Man (the villain of the piece) who \"ups with his heels,\nand smothers his squeals in the scum of the boiling broth.\"\n\nAnd yet by looking on these torsos of the haberdasher, one is not brought\nto thoughts of sad mortality. Their joy is so exultant. And all the things\nthat they hold dear--canes, gloves, silk hats, and the newer garments on\nwhich fashion makes its twaddle--are within reach of their armless sleeves.\nHad they fingers they would be smoothing themselves before the glass. Their\nunbodied heads, wherever they may be, are still smiling on the world,\ndespite their divorcement. Their tongues are still ready with a jest, their\nlips still parted for the anchovy to come.\n\nA few days since, as I was thinking--for so I am pleased to call my muddy\nstirrings--what manner of essay I might write and how best to sort and lay\nout the rummage, it happened pat to my needs that I received from a friend\na book entitled \"The Closet of Sir Kenelm Digby Knight Opened.\" Now, before\nit came I had got so far as to select a title. Indeed, I had written the\ntitle on seven different sheets of paper, each time in the hope that by\nthe run of the words I might leap upon some further thought. Seven times I\nfailed and in the end the sheets went into the waste basket, possibly\nto the confusion of Annie our cook, who may have mistaken them for a\nreiterated admonishment towards the governance of her kitchen--at the\nleast, a hint of my desires and appetite for cheese and pippins.\n\n\"The Closet of Sir Kenelm Digby Opened\" is a cook book. It is due you\nto know this at once, otherwise your thoughts--if your nature be\nvagrant--would drift towards family skeletons. Or maybe the domestic traits\nprevail and you would think of dress-clothes hanging in camphorated bags\nand a row of winter boots upon a shelf.\n\nI am disqualified to pass upon the merits of a cook book, for the reason\nthat I have little discrimination in food. It is not that I am totally\nindifferent to what lies on the platter. Indeed, I have more than a tribal\naversion to pork in general, while, on the other hand, I quicken joyfully\nwhen noodles are interspersed with bacon. I have a tooth for sweets, too,\nalthough I hold it unmanly and deny it as I can. I am told also--although\nI resent it--that my eye lights up on the appearance of a tray of French\npastry. I admit gladly, however, my love of onions, whether they come\nhissing from the skillet, or lie in their first tender whiteness. They\nare at their best when they are placed on bread and are eaten largely at\nmidnight after society has done its worst.\n\nA fine dinner is lost within me. A quail is but an inferior chicken--a poor\nrelation outside the exclusive hennery. Terrapin sits low in my regard,\neven though it has wallowed in the most aristocratic marsh. Through such\ndinners I hack and saw my way without even gaining a memory of my progress.\nIf asked the courses, I balk after the recital of the soup. Indeed, I am so\nforgetful of food, even when I dine at home, that I can well believe that\nAdam when he was questioned about the apple was in real confusion. He had\nor he had not. It was mixed with the pomegranate or the quince that Eve had\nsliced and cooked on the day before.\n\nA dinner at its best is brought to a single focus. There is one dish\nto dominate the cloth, a single bulk to which all other dishes are\nsubordinate. If there be turkey, it should mount from a central platter.\nIts protruding legs out-top the candles. All other foods are, as it were,\nprivates in Caesar's army. They do no more than flank the pageant. Nor may\nthe pantry hold too many secrets. Within reason, everything should be\nset out at once, or at least a gossip of its coming should run before.\nOtherwise, if the stew is savory, how shall one reserve a corner for the\ncustard? One must partition himself justly--else, by an over-stowage at the\nend, he list and sink.\n\nI am partial to picnics--the spreading of the cloth in the woods or beside\na stream--although I am not avid for sandwiches unless hunger press me.\nRather, let there be a skillet in the company and let a fire be started!\nNor need a picnic consume the day. In summer it requires but the late\nafternoon, with such borrowing of the night as is necessary for the\njourney home. You leave the street car, clanking with your bundles like an\nitinerant tinman. You follow a stream, which on these lower stretches, it\nis sad to say, is already infected with the vices of the city. Like many a\ncountryman who has come to town, it has fallen to dissipation. It shows the\nmarks of the bottle. Further up, its course is cleaner. You cross it in the\nmud. Was it not Christian who fell into the bog because of the burden on\nhis back? Then you climb a villainously long hill and pop out upon an open\nplatform above the city.\n\nThe height commands a prospect to the west. Below is the smoke of a\nthousand suppers. Up from the city there comes the hum of life, now\nsomewhat fallen with the traffic of the day--as though Nature already\npracticed the tune for sending her creatures off to sleep. You light a\nfire. The baskets disgorge their secrets. Ants and other leviathans think\nevidently that a circus has come or that bears are in the town. The chops\nand bacon achieve their appointed destiny. You throw the last bone across\nyour shoulder. It slips and rattles to the river. The sun sets. Night like\nan ancient dame puts on her jewels:\n\n  And now that I have climbed and won this height,\n  I must tread downward through the sloping shade\n  And travel the bewildered tracks till night.\n  Yet for this hour I still may here be stayed\n  And see the gold air and the silver fade\n  And the last bird fly into the last light.\n\nBy these confessions you will see how unfit I am to comment on the old cook\nbook of Sir Kenelm Digby. Yet it lies before me. It may have escaped your\nmemory in the din of other things, that in the time when Oliver Cromwell\nstill walked the earth, there lived in England a man by the name of Kenelm\nDigby, who was renowned in astrology and alchemy, piracy, wit, philosophy\nand fashion. It appears that wherever learning wagged its bulbous head, Sir\nKenelm was of the company. It appears, also, that wherever the mahogany did\nmost groan, wherever the possets were spiced most delicately to the nose,\nthere too did Sir Kenelm bib and tuck himself. With profundity, as\nthough he sucked wisdom from its lowest depth, he spouted forth on the\ntransmutation of the baser metals or tossed you a phrase from Paracelsus.\nOr with long instructive finger he dissertated on the celestial universe.\nOne would have thought that he had stood by on the making of it and that\nhis judgment had prevailed in the larger problems. Yet he did not neglect\nhis trencher.\n\nAnd now as time went on, the richness of the food did somewhat dominate his\nperson. The girth of his wisdom grew no less, but his body fattened. In\na word, the good gentleman's palate came to vie with his intellect. Less\noften was he engaged upon some dark saying of Isidore of Seville. Rather,\neven if his favorite topic astrology were uppermost about the table, his\neye travelled to the pantry on every change of dishes. His fingers, too,\ncame to curl most delicately on his fork. He used it like an epicure,\npoking his viands apart for sharpest scrutiny. His nod upon a compote was\nmuch esteemed.\n\nNow mark his further decline! On an occasion--surely the old rascal's head\nis turned!--he would be found in private talk with his hostess, the Lady of\nMiddlesex, or with the Countess of Monmouth, not as you might expect, on\nthe properties of fire or on the mortal diseases of man, but--on subjects\nquite removed. Society, we may be sure, began to whisper of these snug\nparleys in the arbor after dinner, these shadowed mumblings on the balcony\nwhen the moon was up--and Lady Digby stiffened into watchfulness. It was\nwhen they took leave that she saw the Countess slip a note into her lord's\nfingers. Her jealousy broke out. \"Viper!\" She spat the words and seized her\nhusband's wrist. Of course the note was read. It proved, however, that Sir\nKenelm was innocent of all mischief. To the disappointment of the gossips,\nwho were tuned to a spicier anticipation, the note was no more than a\nrecipe of the manner that the Countess was used to mix her syllabub, with\ninstruction that it was the \"rosemary a little bruised and the limon-peal\nthat did quicken the taste.\" Advice, also, followed in the postscript on\nthe making of tea, with counsel that \"the boiling water should remain upon\nit just so long as one might say a _miserere_.\" A mutual innocence being\nnow established, the Lady Digby did by way of apology peck the Countess on\nthe cheek.\n\nSir Kenelm died in 1665, full of years. In that day his fame rested chiefly\non his books in physic and chirurgery. His most enduring work was still to\nbe published--\"The Closet Opened.\"\n\nIt was two years after his death that his son came upon a bundle of his\nfather's papers that had hitherto been overlooked. I fancy that he went\nspying in the attic on a rainy day. In the darkest corner, behind the\nrocking horse--if such devices were known in those distant days--he came\nupon a trunk of his father's papers. \"Od's fish,\" said Sir Kenelm's son,\n\"here's a box of manuscripts. It is like that they pertain to alchemy or\nchirurgery.\" He pulled out a bundle and held it to the light--such light as\ncame through the cobwebs of the ancient windows. \"Here be strange matters,\"\nhe exclaimed. Then he read aloud: \"My Lord of Bristol's Scotch collops are\nthus made: Take a leg of fine sweet mutton, that to make it tender, is\nkept as long as possible may be without stinking. In winter seven or eight\ndays\"--\"Ho! Ho!\" cried Sir Kenelm's son. \"This is not alchemy!\" He drew out\nanother parchment and read again: \"My Lord of Carlile's sack posset, how\nit's made: Take a pottle of cream and boil in it a little whole cinnamon\nand three or four flakes of mace. Boil it until it simpreth and bubbleth.\"\n\nBy this time, as you may well imagine, Sir Kenelm's son was wrought to an\nexcitement. It is likely that he inherited his father's palate and that the\njuices of his appetite were stirred. Seizing an armful of the papers, he\nleaped down the attic steps, three at a time. His lady mother thrust a\ncurled and papered head from her door and asked whether the chimney were\nafire, but he did not heed her. The cook was waddling in her pattens. He\ncried to her to throw wood upon the fire.\n\nThat night the Digby household was served a delicacy, red herrings broiled\nin the fashion of my Lord d'Aubigny, \"short and crisp and laid upon a\nsallet.\" Also, there was a wheaten flommery as it was made in the West\nCountry--for the cook chose quite at random--and a slip-coat cheese as\nMaster Phillips proportioned it. Also, against the colic, which was\nravishing the country, the cook prepared a metheglin as Lady Stuart mixed\nit--\"nettles, fennel and grumel seeds, of each two ounces being small-cut\nand mixed with honey and boiled together.\" It is on record that the Lady\nDigby smiled for the first time since her lord had died, and when the\ngrinning cook bore in the platter, she beat upon the table with her spoon.\n\nThe following morning, Sir Kenelm's son posted to London bearing the\nrecipes, with a pistol in the pocket of his great coat against the crossing\nof Hounslow Heath. He went to a printer at the Star in Little Britain whose\nname was H. Brome.\n\nShortly the book appeared. It was the son who wrote the preface: \"There\nneeds no Rhetoricating Floscules to set it off. The Authour, as is well\nknown, having been a Person of Eminency for his Learning, and of Exquisite\nCuriosity in his Researches. Even that Incomparable Sir Kenelme Digbie\nKnight, Fellow of the Royal Society and Chancellour to the Queen Mother,\n(Et omen in Nomine) His name does sufficiently Auspicate the Work.\" The\nsale of the book is not recorded. It is supposed that the Lady Middlesex,\nso many of whose recipes had been used, directed that her chair be carried\nto the shop where the book was for sale and that she bought largely of it.\nThe Countess of Dorset bought a copy and spelled it out word for word to\nher cook. As for the Lady Monmouth, she bought not a single copy, which\nneglect on coming to the Digbys aroused a coolness.\n\nTo this day it is likely that a last auspicated volume still sits on its\nshelf with the spice jars in some English country kitchen and that a worn\nand toothless cook still thumbs its leaves. If the guests about the table\nbe of an antique mind, still will they pledge one another with its honeyed\ndrinks, still will they pipe and whistle of its virtues, still will they--\n\n\"EAT\"--A flaring sign hangs above the sidewalk. By this time, in our\nnoonday search for food, we have come into the thick of the restaurants. In\nthe jungle of the city, here is the feeding place. Here come the growling\nbipeds for such bones and messes as are thrown them.\n\nThe waiter thrusts a card beneath my nose. \"Nice leg of lamb, sir?\" I waved\nhim off. \"Hold a bit!\" I cried. \"You'll fetch me a capon in white broth as\nmy Lady Monmouth broileth hers. Put plentiful sack in it and boil it until\nit simpreth!\" The waiter scratched his head. \"The chicken pie is good,\" he\nsaid. \"It's our Wednesday dish.\" \"Varlet!\" I cried--then softened. \"Let it\nbe the chicken pie! But if the cook knoweth the manner that Lord Carlile\ndoes mix and pepper it, let that manner be followed to the smallest\nfraction of a pinch!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Buying Old Books\n\n\nBy some slim chance, reader, you may be the kind of person who, on a visit\nto a strange city, makes for a bookshop. Of course your slight temporal\nbusiness may detain you in the earlier hours of the day. You sit with\ncommittees and stroke your profound chin, or you spend your talent in the\nmarket, or run to and fro and wag your tongue in persuasion. Or, if you be\non a holiday, you strain yourself on the sights of the city, against being\ncaught in an omission. The bolder features of a cathedral must be grasped\nto satisfy a quizzing neighbor lest he shame you later on your hearth, a\nbuilding must be stuffed inside your memory, or your pilgrim feet must wear\nthe pavement of an ancient shrine. However, these duties being done and the\nafternoon having not yet declined, do you not seek a bookshop to regale\nyourself?\n\nDoubtless, we have met. As you have scrunched against the shelf not to\nblock the passage, but with your head thrown back to see the titles up\nabove, you have noticed at the corner of your eye--unless it was one of\nyour blinder moments when you were fixed wholly on the shelf--a man in\na slightly faded overcoat of mixed black and white, a man just past the\nnimbleness of youth, whose head is plucked of its full commodity of hair.\nIt was myself. I admit the portrait, though modesty has curbed me short of\njustice.\n\nDoubtless, we have met. It was your umbrella--which you held villainously\nbeneath your arm--that took me in the ribs when you lighted on a set of\nFuller's Worthies. You recall my sour looks, but it was because I had\nmyself lingered on the volumes but cooled at the price. How you smoothed\nand fingered them! With what triumph you bore them off! I bid you--for I\nsee you in a slippered state, eased and unbuttoned after dinner--I bid you\nturn the pages with a slow thumb, not to miss the slightest tang of their\nhumor. You will of course go first, because of its broad fame, to the page\non Shakespeare and Ben Jonson and their wet-combats at the Mermaid. But\nbefore the night is too far gone and while yet you can hold yourself from\nnodding, you will please read about Captain John Smith of Virginia and his\n\"strange performances, the scene whereof is laid at such a distance, they\nare cheaper credited than confuted.\"\n\nIn no proper sense am I a buyer of old books. I admit a bookish quirk\nmaybe, a love of the shelf, a weakness for morocco, especially if it is\nstained with age. I will, indeed, shirk a wedding for a bookshop. I'll\ngo in \"just to look about a bit, to see what the fellow has,\" and on an\noccasion I pick up a volume. But I am innocent of first editions. It is\na stiff courtesy, as becomes a democrat, that I bestow on this form\nof primogeniture. Of course, I have nosed my way with pleasure along\naristocratic shelves and flipped out volumes here and there to ask their\nprice, but for the greater part, it is the plainer shops that engage me. If\na rack of books is offered cheap before the door, with a fixed price upon a\ncard, I come at a trot. And if a brown dust lies on them, I bow and sniff\nupon the rack, as though the past like an ancient <DW2> in peruke and buckle\nwere giving me the courtesy of its snuff box. If I take the dust in my\nnostrils and chance to sneeze, it is the fit and intended observance toward\nthe manners of a former century.\n\nI have in mind such a bookshop in Bath, England. It presents to the street\nno more than a decent front, but opens up behind like a swollen bottle.\nThere are twenty rooms at least, piled together with such confusion of\nblack passages and winding steps, that one might think that the owner\nhimself must hold a thread when he visits the remoter rooms. Indeed, such\nare the obscurities and dim turnings of the place, that, were the legend of\nthe Minotaur but English, you might fancy that the creature still lived in\nthis labyrinth, to nip you between his toothless gums--for the beast grows\nold--at some darker corner. There is a story of the place, that once a raw\nclerk having been sent to rummage in the basement, his candle tipped off\nthe shelf. He was left in so complete darkness that his fears overcame his\njudgment and for two hours he roamed and babbled among the barrels. Nor was\nhis absence discovered until the end of the day when, as was the custom,\nthe clerks counted noses at the door. When they found him, he bolted up the\nsteps, nor did he cease his whimper until he had reached the comforting\ntwilight of the outer world. He served thereafter in the shop a full two\nyears and had a beard coming--so the story runs--before he would again\nventure beyond the third turning of the passage; to the stunting of his\nscholarship, for the deeper books lay in the farther windings.\n\nOr it may appear credible that in ages past a jealous builder contrived the\nplace. Having no learning himself and being at odds with those of better\nopportunity, he twisted the pattern of the house. Such was his evil temper,\nthat he set the steps at a dangerous hazard in the dark, in order that\nscholars--whose eyes are bleared at best--might risk their legs to the end\nof time. Those of strict orthodoxy have even suspected the builder to have\nbeen an atheist, for they have observed what double joints and steps and\nturnings confuse the passage to the devouter books--the Early Fathers in\nparticular being up a winding stair where even the soberest reader might\nbreak his neck. Be these things as they may, leather bindings in sets of\n\"grenadier uniformity\" ornament the upper and lighter rooms. Biography\nstraggles down a hallway, with a candle needed at the farther end. A room\nof dingy plays--Wycherley, Congreve and their crew--looks out through an\narea grating. It was through even so foul an eye, that when alive, they\nlooked upon the world. As for theology, except for the before-mentioned\nFathers, it sits in general and dusty convention on the landing to the\nbasement, its snuffy sermons, by a sad misplacement--or is there an\nironical intention?--pointing the way to the eternal abyss below.\n\nIt was in this shop that I inquired whether there was published a book on\npiracy in Cornwall. Now, I had lately come from Tintagel on the Cornish\ncoast, and as I had climbed upon the rocks and looked down upon the sea, I\nhad wondered to myself whether, if the knowledge were put out before me, I\ncould compose a story of Spanish treasure and pirates. For I am a prey to\nsuch giddy ambition. A foul street--if the buildings slant and topple--will\nset me thinking delightfully of murders. A wharf-end with water lapping\nunderneath and bits of rope about will set me itching for a deep-sea plot.\nOr if I go on broader range and see in my fancy a broken castle on a hill,\nI'll clear its moat and sound trumpets on its walls. If there is pepper\nin my mood, I'll storm its dungeon. Or in a softer moment I'll trim its\nunsubstantial towers with pageantry and rest upon my elbow until I fall\nasleep. So being cast upon the rugged Cornish coast whose cliffs are so\nswept with winter winds that the villages sit for comfort in the hollows,\nit was to be expected that my thoughts would run toward pirates.\n\nThere is one rock especially which I had climbed in the rain and fog of\nearly morning. A reckless path goes across its face with a sharp pitch to\nthe ocean. It was so slippery and the wind so tugged and pulled to throw me\noff, that although I endangered my dignity, I played the quadruped on the\nnarrower parts. But once on top in the open blast of the storm and safe\nupon the level, I thumped with desire for a plot. In each inlet from the\nocean I saw a pirate lugger--such is the pleasing word--with a keg of rum\nset up. Each cranny led to a cavern with doubloons piled inside. The\nvery tempest in my ears was compounded out of ships at sea and wreck and\npillage. I needed but a plot, a thread of action to string my villains on.\nIf this were once contrived, I would spice my text with sailors' oaths and\nsuch boasting talk as might lie in my invention. Could I but come upon a\nplot, I might yet proclaim myself an author.\n\nWith this guilty secret in me I blushed as I asked the question. It seemed\nsure that the shopkeeper must guess my purpose. I felt myself suspected as\nthough I were a rascal buying pistols to commit a murder. Indeed, I seem\nto remember having read that even hardened criminals have become confused\nbefore a shopkeeper and betrayed themselves. Of course, Dick Turpin and\nJerry Abershaw could call for pistols in the same easy tone they ordered\nale, but it would take a practiced villainy. But I in my innocence wanted\nnothing but the meager outline of a pirate's life, which I might fatten to\nmy uses.\n\nBut on a less occasion, when there is no plot thumping in me, I still feel\na kind of embarrassment when I ask for a book out of the general demand. I\nfeel so like an odd stick. This embarrassment applies not to the request\nfor other commodities. I will order a collar that is quite outside the\nfashion, in a high-pitched voice so that the whole shop can hear. I could\nbargain for a purple waistcoat--did my taste run so--and though the\nsidewalk listened, it would not draw a blush. I have traded even for\nwomen's garments--though this did strain me--without an outward twitch.\nFinally, to top my valor, I have bought sheet music of the lighter kind and\nhave pronounced the softest titles so that all could hear. But if I desire\nthe poems of Lovelace or the plays of Marlowe, I sidle close up to the\nshopkeeper to get his very ear. If the book is visible, I point my thumb at\nit without a word.\n\nIt was but the other day--in order to fill a gap in a paper I was\nwriting--I desired to know the name of an author who is obscure although\nhis work has been translated into nearly all languages. I wanted to know a\nlittle about the life of the man who wrote _Mary Had a Little Lamb_, which,\nI am told, is known by children over pretty much all the western world. It\nneeded only a trip to the Public Library. Any attendant would direct me to\nthe proper shelf. Yet once in the building, my courage oozed. My question,\nthough serious, seemed too ridiculous to be asked. I would sizzle as I\nmet the attendant's eye. Of a consequence, I fumbled on my own devices,\npossibly to the increase of my general knowledge, but without gaining what\nI sought.\n\nThey had no book in the Bath shop on piracy in Cornwall. I was offered\ninstead a work in two volumes on the notorious highwaymen of history, and\nfor a moment my plot swerved in that direction. But I put it by. To pay the\nfellow for his pains--for he had dug in barrels to his shoulders and had a\nsmudge across his nose--I bought a copy of Thomson's \"Castle of Indolence,\"\nand in my more energetic moods I read it. And so I came away.\n\nOn leaving the shop, lest I should be nipped in a neglect, I visited the\nRoman baths. Then I took the waters in the Assembly Room. It was Sam\nWeller, you may recall, who remarked, when he was entertained by the select\nfootmen, that the waters tasted like warm flat-irons. Finally, I viewed\nthe Crescent around which the shirted Winkle ran with the valorous Dowler\nbreathing on his neck. With such distractions, as you may well imagine,\nCornish pirates became as naught. Such mental vibration as I had was now\ngone toward a tale of fashion in the days when Queen Anne was still alive.\nOf a consequence, I again sought the bookshop and stifling my timidity, I\ndemanded such volumes as might set me most agreeably to my task.\n\nI have in mind also a bookshop of small pretension in a town in Wales. For\npurely secular delight, maybe, it was too largely composed of Methodist\nsermons. Hell fire burned upon its shelves with a warmth to singe so poor a\nworm as I. Yet its signboard popped its welcome when I had walked ten miles\nof sunny road. Possibly it was the chair rather than the divinity that\nkeeps the place in memory. The owner was absent on an errand, and his\ndaughter, who had been clumping about the kitchen on my arrival, was\nuninstructed in the price marks. So I read and fanned myself until his\nreturn.\n\nPerhaps my sluggishness toward first editions--to which I have hinted\nabove--comes in part from the acquaintance with a man who in a linguistic\noutburst as I met him, pronounced himself to be a numismatist and\nphilatelist. One only of these names would have satisfied a man of less\nconceit. It is as though the pteranodon should claim also to be the\nspoon-bill dinosaur. It is against modesty that one man should summon all\nthe letters. No, the numismatist's head is not crammed with the mysteries\nof life and death, nor is a philatelist one who is possessed with the\ndimmer secrets of eternity. Rather, this man who was so swelled with\ntitles, eked a living by selling coins and stamps, and he was on his way\nto Europe to replenish his wares. Inside his waistcoat, just above his\nliver--if he owned so human an appendage--he carried a magnifying glass.\nWith this, when the business fit was on him, he counted the lines and dots\nupon a stamp, the perforations on its edge. He catalogued its volutes, its\nstipples, the frisks and curlings of its pattern. He had numbered the very\nhairs on the head of George Washington, for in such minutiae did the value\nof the stamp reside. Did a single hair spring up above the count, it would\ninvalidate the issue. Such values, got by circumstance or accident--resting\non a flaw--founded on a speck--cause no ferment of my desires.\n\nFor the buying of books, it is the cheaper shops where I most often prowl.\nThere is in London a district around Charing Cross Road where almost every\nshop has books for sale. There is a continuous rack along the sidewalk,\neach title beckoning for your attention. You recall the class of\nstreet-readers of whom Charles Lamb wrote--\"poor gentry, who, not having\nwherewithal to buy or hire a book, filch a little learning at the open\nstalls.\" It was on some such street that these folk practiced their\ninnocent larceny. If one shopkeeper frowned at the diligence with which\nthey read \"Clarissa,\" they would continue her distressing adventures across\nthe way. By a lingering progress up the street, \"Sir Charles Grandison\"\nmight be nibbled down--by such as had the stomach--without the outlay of\na single penny. As for Gibbon and the bulbous historians, though a whole\nperusal would outlast the summer and stretch to the colder months, yet with\npatience they could be got through. However, before the end was come even a\nhasty reader whose eye was nimble on the page would be blowing on his nails\nand pulling his tails between him and the November wind.\n\nBut the habit of reading at the open stalls was not only with the poor. You\nwill remember that Mr. Brownlow was addicted. Really, had not the Artful\nDodger stolen his pocket handkerchief as he was thus engaged upon his book,\nthe whole history of Oliver Twist must have been quite different. And Pepys\nhimself, Samuel Pepys, F.R.S., was guilty. \"To Paul's Church Yard,\" he\nwrites, \"and there looked upon the second part of Hudibras, which I buy\nnot, but borrow to read.\" Such parsimony is the curse of authors. To thumb\na volume cheaply around a neighborhood is what keeps them in their garrets.\nIt is a less offence to steal peanuts from a stand. Also, it is recorded in\nthe life of Beau Nash that the persons of fashion of his time, to pass a\ntedious morning \"did divert themselves with reading in the booksellers'\nshops.\" We may conceive Mr. Fanciful Fopling in the sleepy blink of those\nearly hours before the pleasures of the day have made a start, inquiring\nbetween his yawns what latest novels have come down from London, or whether\na new part of \"Pamela\" is offered yet. If the post be in, he will prop\nhimself against the shelf and--unless he glaze and nod--he will read\ncheaply for an hour. Or my Lady Betty, having taken the waters in the\npump-room and lent her ear to such gossip as is abroad so early, is now\nhanded to her chair and goes round by Gregory's to read a bit. She is\nflounced to the width of the passage. Indeed, until the fashion shall\nabate, those more solid authors that are set up in the rear of the shop,\nmust remain during her visits in general neglect. Though she hold herself\nagainst the shelf and tilt her hoops, it would not be possible to pass. She\nis absorbed in a book of the softer sort, and she flips its pages against\nher lap-dog's nose.\n\nBut now behold the student coming up the street! He is clad in shining\nblack. He is thin of shank as becomes a scholar. He sags with knowledge. He\nhungers after wisdom. He comes opposite the bookshop. It is but coquetry\nthat his eyes seek the window of the tobacconist. His heart, you may be\nsure, looks through the buttons at his back. At last he turns. He pauses on\nthe curb. Now desire has clutched him. He jiggles his trousered shillings.\nHe treads the gutter. He squints upon the rack. He lights upon a treasure.\nHe plucks it forth. He is unresolved whether to buy it or to spend the\nextra shilling on his dinner. Now all you cooks together, to save your\nbusiness, rattle your pans to rouse him! If within these ancient buildings\nthere are onions ready peeled--quick!--throw them in the skillet that the\nwhiff may come beneath his nose! Chance trembles and casts its vote--eenie\nmeenie--down goes the shilling--he has bought the book. Tonight he will\nspread it beneath his candle. Feet may beat a snare of pleasure on the\npavement, glad cries may pipe across the darkness, a fiddle may scratch its\ninvitation--all the rumbling notes of midnight traffic will tap in vain\ntheir summons upon his window.\n\n\n\n\nAny Stick Will Do To Beat A Dog\n\n\nReader, possibly on one of your country walks you have come upon a man with\nhis back against a hedge, tormented by a fiend in the likeness of a dog.\nYou yourself, of course, are not a coward. You possess that cornerstone of\nvirtue, a love for animals. If at your heels a dog sniffs and growls, you\nhumor his mistake, you flick him off and proceed with unbroken serenity. It\nis scarcely an interlude to your speculation on the market. Or if you work\nupon a sonnet and are in the vein, your thoughts, despite the beast, run\nunbroken to a rhyme. But pity this other whose heart is less stoutly\nwrapped! He has gone forth on a holiday to take the country air, to thrust\nhimself into the freer wind, to poke with his stick for such signs of\nSpring as may be hiding in the winter's leaves. Having been grinding in an\noffice he flings himself on the great round world. He has come out to smell\nthe earth. Or maybe he seeks a hilltop for a view of the fields that lie\nbelow patched in many colors, as though nature had been sewing at her\ngarments and had mended the cloth from her bag of scraps.\n\nOn such a journey this fellow is travelling when, at a turn of the road, he\nhears the sound of barking. As yet there is no dog in sight. He pauses. He\nlistens. How shall one know whether the sound comes up a wrathful gullet or\nwhether the dog bays at him impersonally, as at the distant moon? Or maybe\nhe vents himself upon a stubborn cow. Surely it is not an idle tune he\npractices. He holds a victim in his mind. There is sour venom on his\nchurlish tooth. Is it best to go roundabout, or forward with such a nice\ncompound of innocence, boldness and modesty as shall satisfy the beast? If\none engross oneself on something that lies to the lee of danger, it allays\nsuspicion. Or if one absorb oneself upon the flora--a primrose on the\nriver's brim--it shows him clear and stainless. The stupidest dog should\nsee that so close a student can have no evil in him. Perhaps it would be\nbetter to throw away one's stick lest it make a show of violence. Or it may\nbe concealed along the outer leg. Ministers of Grace defend us, what an\nexcitement in the barnyard! Has virtue no reward? Shall innocence perish\noff the earth? Not one dog, but many, come running out. There has gone\na rumor about the barn that there is a stranger to be eaten, and it's\nlikely--if they keep their clamor--there will be a bone for each. Note how\nthe valor oozes from the man of peace! Observe his sidling gait, his skirts\npulled close, his hollowed back, his head bent across his shoulder, his\nstartled eye! Watch him mince his steps, lest a lingering heel be nipped!\nListen to him try the foremost dog with names, to gull him to a belief that\nthey have met before in happier circumstances! He appeals mutely to the\nfarmhouse that a recall be sounded. The windows are tightly curtained. The\nheavens are comfortless.\n\nYou remember the fellow in the play who would have loved war had they not\ndigged villainous saltpetre from the harmless earth. The countryside, too,\nin my opinion, would be more peaceful of a summer afternoon were it not\noverrun with dogs. Let me be plain! I myself like dogs--sleepy dogs\nblinking in the firelight, friendly dogs with wagging tails, young dogs in\ntheir first puppyhood with their teeth scarce sprouted, whose jaws have not\nyet burgeoned into danger, and old dogs, too, who sun themselves and give\nforth hollow, toothless, reassuring sounds. When a dog assumes the cozy\nhabits of the cat without laying off his nobler nature, he is my friend. A\ndog of vegetarian aspect pleases me. Let him bear a mild eye as though he\nwere nourished on the softer foods! I would wish every dog to have a full\ncomplement of tail. It's the sure barometer of his warm regard. There's no\nart to find his mind's construction in the face. And I would have him with\nnot too much curiosity. It's a quality that brings him too often to the\ngate. It makes him prone to sniff when one sits upon a visit. Nor do I like\ndogs addicted to sudden excitement. Lethargy becomes them better. Let them\nbe without the Gallic graces! In general, I like a dog to whom I have been\nproperly introduced, with an exchange of credentials. While the dog is by,\nlet his master take my hand and address me in softest tones, to cement the\nunderstanding! At bench-shows I love the beasts, although I keep to the\nmiddle of the aisle. The streets are all the safer when so many of the\ncreatures are kept within.\n\nFrankly, I would enjoy the country more, if I knew that all the dogs were\naway on visits. Of course, the highroad is quite safe. Its frequent traffic\nis its insurance. Then, too, the barns are at such a distance, it is only a\nmonstrous anger can bring the dog. But if you are in need of direction you\nselect a friendly white house with green shutters. You swing open the gate\nand crunch across the pebbles to the door. To the nearer eye there is a\nlook of \"dog\" about the place. Or maybe you are hot and thirsty, and there\nis a well at the side of the house. Is it better to gird yourself to danger\nor to put off your thirst until the crossroads where pop is sold?\n\nOr a lane leads down to the river. Even at this distance you hear the\nshallow brawl of water on the stones. A path goes off across a hill, with\ntrees beckoning at the top. There is a wind above and a wider sweep of\nclouds. Surely, from the crest of the hill the whole county will lie before\nyou. Such tunes as come up from the world below--a school-bell, a rooster\ncrowing, children laughing on the road, a threshing machine on the lower\nmeadows--such tunes are pitched to a marvellous softness. Shall we follow\nthe hot pavement, or shall we dare those lonely stretches?\n\nThere is a kind of person who is steeped too much in valor. He will cross a\nfield although there is a dog inside the fence. Goodness knows that I would\nrather keep to the highroad with such humility as shall not rouse the\ncreature. Or he will shout and whistle tunes that stir the dogs for miles.\nHe slashes his stick against the weeds as though in challenge. One might\nthink that he went about on unfeeling stalks instead of legs as children\nwalk on stilts, or that a former accident had clipped him off above the\nknees and that he was now jointed out of wood to a point beyond the biting\nlimit. Or perhaps the clothes he wears beneath--the inner mesh and very\nbalbriggan of his attire--is of so hard a texture that it turns a tooth. Be\nthese defenses as they may, note with what bravado he mounts the wall! One\nleg dangles as though it were baited and were angling for a bite.\n\nThere is a French village near Quebec whose population is chiefly dogs.\nIt lies along the river in a single street, not many miles from the point\nwhere Wolfe climbed to the Plains of Abraham. There are a hundred houses\nflat against the roadway and on the steps of each there sits a dog. As I\nwent through on foot, each of these dogs picked me up, examined me nasally\nand passed me on, not generously as though I had stood the test, but rather\nin deep suspicion that I was a queer fellow, not to be penetrated at first,\nbut one who would surely be found out and gobbled before coming to the\nend of the street. As long as I would eventually furnish forth the common\nbanquet, it mattered not which dog took the first nip. Inasmuch as I would\nat last be garnished for the general tooth, it would be better to wait\nuntil all were gathered around the platter. \"Good neighbor dog,\" each\nseemed to say, \"you too sniff upon the rogue! If he be honest, my old nose\nis much at fault.\" Meantime I padded lightly through the village, at first\ncalling on the dogs by English names, but later using such wisps as I had\nof French. \"Aucassin, mon pauvre chien. Voici, Tintagiles, alors donc mon\ncherie. Je suis votre ami,\" but with little effect.\n\nBut the dogs that one meets in the Canadian woods are of the fiercest\nbreed. They border on the wolf. They are called huskies and they are so\nstrong and so fleet of foot that they pull sleds for hours across the\nfrozen lakes at almost the speed of a running horse. It must be confessed\nthat they are handsome and if it happens to be your potato peelings and\ndiscarded fish that they eat, they warm into friendliness. Indeed, on these\noccasions, one can make quite a show of bravery by stroking and dealing\nlightly with them. But once upon a time in an ignorant moment two other\ncampers and myself followed a lonely railroad track and struck off on a\npath through the pines in search of a certain trapper on a fur farm. The\npath went on a broken zigzag avoiding fallen trees and soft hollows,\nconducting itself on the whole with more patience than firmness. We walked\na quarter of a mile, but still we saw no cabin. The line of the railroad\nhad long since disappeared. An eagle wheeled above us and quarrelled at our\nintrusion. Presently to test our course and learn whether we were coming\nnear the cabin, we gave a shout. Immediately out of the deeper woods there\ncame a clamor that froze us. Such sounds, it seemed, could issue only from\nbloody and dripping jaws. In a panic, as by a common impulse we turned and\nran. Yet we did not run frankly as when the circus lion is loose, but in a\nshamefaced manner--an attempt at a retreat in good order--something between\na walk and a run. At the end of a hundred yards we stopped. No dogs had\nfallen on us. Danger had not burst its kennel. We hallooed again, to rouse\nthe trapper. At last, after a minute of suspense, came his answering voice,\nthe sweetest sound to be imagined. Whereupon I came down from my high stump\nwhich I had climbed for a longer view.\n\nI am convinced that I am not alone in my--shall I say diffidence?--toward\ndogs. Indeed, there is evidence from the oldest times that mankind, in its\nmore honest moments, has confessed to a fear of dogs. In recognition of\nthis general fear, the unmuzzled Cerberus was put at the gate of Hades.\nIt was rightly felt that when the unhappy pilgrims got within, his fifty\nsnapping heads were better than a bolt upon the door. It was better for\nthem to endure the ills they had, than be nipped in the upper passage. He,\nalso, who first spoke the ancient proverb, _Let sleeping dogs lie_, did no\nmore than voice the caution of the street. And he, also, who invented the\nsaying that the world is going to the bow-wows, lodged his deplorable\npessimism in fitting words.\n\nIt was Daniel who sat with the lions. But there are degrees of bravery. On\nLong Street, within sight of my window--just where the street gets into its\nmost tangled traffic--there has hung for many years the painted signboard\nof a veterinary surgeon. Its artist was in the first flourish of youth. Old\nage had not yet chilled him when he mixed his gaudy colors. The surgeon's\nname is set up in modest letters, but the horse below flames with color.\nWhat a flaring nostril! What an eager eye! How arched the neck! Here is a\nwrath and speed unknown to the quadrupeds of this present Long Street. Such\nmild-eyed, accumbent, sharp-ribbed horses as now infest the curb--mere\nwhittlings from a larger age--hang their heads at their degeneracy. Indeed,\nthese horses seem to their owners not to be worth the price of a nostrum.\nIf disease settles in them, let them lean against a post until the fit is\npast! And of a consequence, the doctor's work has fallen off. It has\nbecome a rare occasion when it is permitted him to stroke his chin in\ncontemplation of some inner palsy. Therefore to give his wisdom scope,\nthe doctor some time since announced the cellar of the building to be a\nhospital for dogs. Must I press the analogy? I have seen the doctor with\nbowl and spoon in hand take leave of the cheerful world. He opens the\ncellar door. A curdling yelp comes up the stairs. In the abyss below there\nare twenty dogs at least, all of them sick, all dangerous. Not since Orion\nled his hunting pack across the heavens has there been so fierce a sound.\nThe door closes. There is a final yelp, such as greets a bone. Doubtless,\nby this time, they are munching on the doctor. Good sir, had you lived in\npre-apostolic days, your name would have been lined with Daniel's in the\nhymn. I might have spent my earliest treble in your praise.\n\nBut there are other kinds of dogs. Gentlest of readers, have you ever\npassed a few days at Tunbridge Wells? It lies on one of the roads that run\nfrom London to the Channel and for several hundred years persons have gone\nthere to take the waters against the more fashionable ailments. Its chief\nfame was in the days when rich folk, to ward off for the season a touch of\nancestral gout, travelled down from London in their coaches. We may fancy\nLord Thingumdo crossing his sleek legs inside or putting his head to the\nwindow on the change of horses. He has outriders and a horn to sound his\ncoming. His Lordship has a liver that must be mended, but also he has\na weakness for the gaming table. Or Lady Euphemia, wrapped in silks,\nlanguishes mornings in her lodgings with a latest novel, but goes forth at\nnoon upon the Pantilles to shop in the stalls. A box of patches must be\nbought. A lace flounce has caught her eye. Bless her dear eyes, as she\nbends upon her purchase she is fair to look upon. The Grand Rout is set for\ntonight. Who knows but that the Duke will put the tender question and will\nask her to name the happy day?\n\nBut these golden days are past. Tunbridge Wells has sunk from fashion. The\ngaming tables are gone. A band still plays mornings in the Pantilles--or\ndid so before the war--but cheaper gauds are offered in the shops. Emerald\nbrooches are fallen to paste. In all the season there is scarcely a single\ndemand for a diamond garter. If there were now a Rout, the only dancers\nwould be stiff shadows from the past. The healing waters still trickle from\nthe ground and an old woman serves you for a penny, but the miracle has\ngone. The old world is cured and dead.\n\nTunbridge Wells is visited now chiefly by old ladies whose husbands--to\njudge by the black lace caps--have left Lombard Street for heaven. At the\nhotel where I stopped, which was at the top of the Commons outside the\nthicker town, I was the only man in the breakfast room. Two widows, each\nwith a tiny dog on a chair beside her, sat at the next table. This was\ntheir conversation:\n\n\"Did you hear her last night?\"\n\n\"Was it Flossie that I heard?\"\n\n\"Yes. The poor dear was awake all night. She got her feet wet yesterday\nwhen I let her run upon the grass.\"\n\nBut after breakfast--if the day is sunny and the wind sits in a favoring\nquarter--one by one the widows go forth in their chairs. These are wicker\ncontrivances that hang between three wheels. Burros pull them, and men walk\nalongside to hold their bridles. Down comes the widow. Down comes a maid\nwith her wraps. Down comes a maid with Flossie. The wraps are adjusted. The\nwidow is handed in. Her feet are wound around with comforters against a\ndraft. Her salts rest in her lap. Her ample bag of knitting is safe aboard.\nFlossie is placed beside her. Proot! The donkey starts.\n\nAll morning the widow sits in the Pantilles and listens to the band and\nknits. Flossie sits on the flagging at her feet with an intent eye upon the\nball of worsted. Twice in a morning--three times if the gods are kind--the\nball rolls to the pavement. Flossie has been waiting so long for this\nto happen. It is the bright moment of her life--the point and peak of\nhappiness. She darts upon it. She paws it exultantly for a moment. Brief is\nthe rainbow and brief the Borealis. The finger of Time is swift.\n\nThe poppy blooms and fades. The maid captures the ball of worsted and\nrestores it.\n\nIt lies in the widow's lap. The band plays. The needles click to a long\ntune. The healing waters trickle from the ground. The old woman whines\ntheir merits. Flossie sits motionless, her head cocked and her eye upon the\nball. Perhaps the god of puppies will again be good to her.\n\n\n\n\nROADS OF MORNING\n\n\nMy grandfather's farm lay somewhere this side of the sunset, so near that\nits pastures barely missed the splash of color. But from the city it was a\ntwo hours' journey by horse and phaeton. My grandfather drove. I sat next,\nmy feet swinging clear of the lunchbox. My brother had the outside, a place\ndenied to me for fear that I might fall across the wheel. When we were\nall set, my mother made a last dab at my nose--an unheeded smudge having\nescaped my vigilance. Then my grandfather said, \"Get up,\"--twice, for the\nlazy horse chose to regard the first summons as a jest. We start. The great\nwheels turn. My brother leans across the guard to view the miracle. We\ncrunch the gravel. We are alive for excitement. My brother plays we are\na steamboat and toots. I toot in imitation, but higher up as if I were a\nyounger sort of steamboat. We hold our hands on an imaginary wheel and\nsteer. We scorn grocery carts and all such harbor craft. We are on a long\ncruise. Street lights will guide us sailing home.\n\nOf course there were farms to the south of the city and apples may have\nripened there to as fine a flavor, and to the east, also, doubtless there\nwere farms. It would be asking too much that the west should have all the\nhaystacks, cherry trees and cheese houses. If your judgment skimmed upon\nthe surface, you would even have found the advantage with the south. It was\nprettier because more rolling. It was shaggier. The country to the south\ntipped up to the hills, so sharply in places that it might have made its\nliving by collecting nickels for the slide. Indeed, one might think that a\npart of the city had come bouncing down the <DW72>, for now it lay resting\nat the bottom, sprawled somewhat for its ease. Or it might appear--if your\nbelief runs on discarded lines--that the whole flat-bottomed earth had been\nfouled in its celestial course and now lay aslant upon its beam with its\ncargo shifted and spilled about.\n\nThe city streets that led to the south, which in those days ended in lanes,\npopped out of sight abruptly at the top of the first ridge. And when the\nearth caught up again with their level, already it was dim and purple and\ntall trees were no more than a roughened hedge. But what lay beyond that\nrange of hills--what towns and cities--what oceans and forests--how beset\nwith adventure--how fearful after dark--these things you could not see,\neven if you climbed to some high place and strained yourself on tiptoe. And\nif you walked from breakfast to lunch--until you gnawed within and were but\na hollow drum--there would still be a higher range against the sky. There\nare misty kingdoms on this whirling earth, but the ways are long and steep.\n\nThe lake lay to the north with no land beyond, the city to the east. But to\nthe west--\n\nSeveral miles outside the city as it then was, and still beyond its\nclutches, the country was cut by a winding river bottom with sharp edges of\nshale. Down this valley Rocky River came brawling in the spring, over-fed\nand quarrelsome. Later in the year--its youthful appetite having caught an\nindigestion--it shrunk and wasted to a shadow. By August you could cross it\non the stones. The uproar of its former flood was marked upon the shale and\ntrunks of trees here and there were wedged, but now the river plays drowsy\ntunes upon the stones. There is scarcely enough movement of water to flick\nthe sunlight. A leaf on its idle current is a lazy craft whose skipper\nnods. There were hickory trees on the point above. May-apples grew in the\ndeep woods, and blackberries along the fences. And in the season sober\nhorses plowed up and down the fields with nodding heads, affirming their\nbelief in the goodness of the soil and their willingness to help in its\nfruition.\n\nYet the very core of this valley in days past was a certain depth of water\nat a turn of the stream. There was a clay bank above it and on it small\nnaked boys stood and daubed themselves. One of them put a band of clay\nabout himself by way of decoration. Another, by a more general smudge, made\nhimself a Hottentot and thereby gave his manners a wider scope and license.\nBut by daubing yourself entire you became an Indian and might vent yourself\nin hideous yells, for it was amazing how the lungs grew stouter when the\nclay was laid on thick. Then you tapped your flattened palm rapidly against\nyour mouth and released an intermittent uproar in order that the valley\nmight he warned of the deviltry to come. You circled round and round and\nbeat upon the ground in the likeness of a war dance. But at last, sated\nwith scalps, off you dived into the pool and came up a white man. Finally,\nyou stood on one leg and jounced the water from your ear, or pulled a\nbloodsucker from your toes before he sapped your life--for this tiny\ncreature of the rocks was credited with the gift of prodigious inflation,\nand might inhale you, blood, sinews, suspenders and all, if left to his\nugly purpose.\n\nFarms should not be too precisely located; at least this is true of farms\nwhich, like my grandfather's, hang in a mist of memory. I read once of a\nwonderful spot--quite inferior, doubtless, to my grandfather's farm--which\nwas located by evil directions intentionally to throw a seeker off.\nMunchausen, you will recall, in the placing of his magic countries, was not\nabove this agreeable villainy. Robinson Crusoe was loose and vague in the\nplacing of his island. It is said that Izaak Walton waved a hand obscurely\ntoward the stream where he had made a catch, but could not be cornered to a\nnice direction, lest his pool be overrun. In early youth, I myself went, on\na mischievous hint, to explore a remote region which I was told lay in the\ndark behind the kindling pile. But because I moved in a fearful darkness,\nquite beyond the pale light from the furnace room, I lost the path. It did\nnot lead me to the peaks and the roaring waters.\n\nBut the farm was reached by more open methods. Dolly and the phaeton were\nthe chief instruments. First--if you were so sunk in ignorance as not to\nknow the road--you inquired of everybody for the chewing gum factory, to be\nknown by its smell of peppermint. Then you sought the high bridge over the\nrailroad tracks. Beyond was Kamm's Corners. Here, at a turn of the road,\nwas a general store whose shelves sampled the produce of this whole fair\nworld and the factories thereof. One might have thought that the proprietor\nemulated Noah at the flood by bidding two of each created things to find a\nplace inside.\n\nBeyond Kamm's Corners you came to the great valley. When almost down the\nhill you passed a house with broken windows and unkept grass. This house,\nby report, was haunted, but you could laugh at such tales while the morning\nsun was up. At the bottom of the hill a bridge crossed the river, with\nloose planking that rattled as though the man who made nails was dead.\n\nBeyond the bridge, at the first rise of ground, the horse stopped--for I\nassume that you drove a sagacious animal--by way of hint that every one\nof sound limb get out and walk to the top of the hill. A suspicious horse\nturned his head now and again and cast his eye upon the buggy to be sure\nthat no one climbed in again.\n\nPresently you came to the toll-gate at the top and paid its keeper five\ncents, or whatever large sum he demanded. Then your grandfather--if by\nfortunate chance you happened to have one--asked after his wife and\nchildren, and had they missed the croup; then told him his corn was looking\nwell.\n\nMy grandfather--for it is time you knew him--lived with us. Because of a\nrailway accident fifteen years before in which one of his legs was cut off\njust below the knee, he had retired from public office. Several years of\nbroken health had been followed by years that were for the most part free\nfrom suffering. My own first recollection reverts to these better years.\nI recall a tall man--to my eyes a giant, for he was taller even than my\nfather--who came into the nursery as I was being undressed. There was a\nwind in the chimney, and the windows rattled. He put his crutches against\nthe wall. Then taking me in his arms, he swung me aloft to his shoulder\nby a series of somersaults. I cried this first time, but later I came to\ndemand the performance.\n\nOnce, when I was a little older, I came upon one of his discarded wooden\nlegs as I was playing in the garret of the house. It was my first\nacquaintance with such a contrivance. It lay behind a pile of trunks and I\nwas, at the time, on my way to the center of the earth, for the cheerful\npath dove into darkness behind the chimney. You may imagine my surprise. I\napproached it cautiously. I viewed it from all sides by such dusty light as\nfell between the trunks. Not without fear I touched it. It was unmistakably\na leg--but whose? Was it possible that there was a kind of Bluebeard in the\nfamily, who, for his pleasure, lopped off legs? There had been no breath of\nsuch a scandal. Yet, if my reading and studies were correct, such things\nhad happened in other families not very different from ours; not in our own\ntown maybe, but in such near-by places as Kandahar and Serendib--places\nwhich in my warm regard were but as suburbs to our street, to be gained if\nyou persevered for a hundred lamp-posts. Or could the leg belong to Annie\nthe cook? Her nimbleness with griddle-cakes belied the thought: And once,\nwhen the wind had swished her skirts, manifestly she was whole and sound.\nThen all at once I knew it to be my grandfather's. Grown familiar, I pulled\nit to the window. I tried it on, but made bad work of walking.\n\nTo the eye my grandfather had two legs all the way down and, except for\nhis crutches and an occasional squeak, you would not have detected his\ninfirmity. Evidently the maker did no more than imitate nature, although,\nfor myself, I used to wonder at the poverty of his invention. There would\nbe distinction in a leg, which in addition to its usual functions, would\nalso bend forward at the knee, or had a surprising sidewise joint--and\nthere would be profit, too, if one cared to make a show of it. The greatest\nniggard on the street would pay two pins for such a sight.\n\nAs my grandfather was the only old gentleman of my acquaintance, a wooden\nleg seemed the natural and suitable accompaniment of old age. Persons, it\nappeared, in their riper years, cast off a leg, as trees dropped their\nleaves. But my grandmother puzzled me. Undeniably she retained both of\nhers, yet her hair was just as white, and she was almost as old. Evidently\nthis law of nature worked only with men. Ladies, it seemed, were not\ndeciduous. But how the amputation was effected in men--whether by day or\nnight--how the choice fell between the right and left--whether the wooden\nleg came down the chimney (a proper entrance)--how soon my father would go\nthe way of all masculine flesh and cast his off--these matters I could not\nsolve. The Arabian Nights were silent on the subject. Aladdin's uncle,\napparently, had both his legs. He was too brisk in villainy to admit a\nwooden leg. But then, he was only an uncle. If his history ran out to the\nend, doubtless he would go with a limp in his riper days. The story of the\nBible--although it trafficked in such veterans as Methuselah--gave not a\nhint. Abraham died full of years. Here would have been a proper test--but\nthe book was silent.\n\nMy grandfather in those days had much leisure time. He still kept an office\nat the rear of the house, although he had given up the regular practice\nof the law. But a few old clients lingered on, chiefly women who carried\nchildren in their arms and old men without neckties who came to him for\nfree advice. These he guided patiently in their troubles, and he would sit\nan hour to listen to a piteous story. In an extremity he gave them money,\nor took a well-meant but worthless note. Often his callers overran the\ndinner hour and my mother would have to jingle the dinner bell at the door\nto rouse them. Occasionally he would be called on for a public speech, and\nfor several days he would be busy at his desk. Frequently he presided at\ndinners and would tell a story and sing a song, for he had a fine bass\nvoice and was famous for his singing.\n\nHe read much in those last years in science. When he was not reading\nTrowbridge to his grandchildren, it was Huxley to himself. But when his\neyes grew tired, he would on an occasion--if there was canning in the\nhouse--go into the kitchen where my mother and grandmother worked, and help\npare the fruit. Seriously, as though he were engaged upon a game, he would\ncut the skin into thinnest strips, unbroken to the end, and would hold up\nthe coil for us to see. Or if he broke it in the cutting it was a point\nagainst him in the contest.\n\nHis diversion rather than his profit was the care and rental of about\ntwenty small houses, some of which he built to fit his pensioners. My\nbrother and myself often made the rounds with him in the phaeton. At most\nof the houses he was affectionately greeted as \"Jedge\" and was held in long\nconversations across the fence. And to see an Irishman was to see a friend.\nThey all knew him and said, \"Good mornin',\" as we passed. He and they were\ngood Democrats together.\n\nI can see in memory a certain old Irishman in a red flannel shirt, with his\nfoot upon the hub, bending across the wheel and gesticulating in an endless\ndiscussion of politics or crops, while my brother and I were impatient to\nbe off. Dolly was of course patient, for she had long since passed her\nfretful youth. If by any biological chance it had happened that she had\nbeen an old lady instead of a horse, she would have been the kind that\nspent her day in a rocker with her knitting. Any one who gave Dolly an\nexcuse for standing was her friend. There she stood as though she wished\nthe colloquy to last forever.\n\nIt was seldom that Dolly lost her restraint. She would, indeed, when she\ncame near the stable, somewhat hasten her stride; and when we came on our\ndrives to the turning point and at last headed about for home, Dolly would\nknow it and show her knowledge by a quickening of the ears and the quiver\nof a faint excitement. Yet Dolly lost her patience when there were flies.\nThen she threw off all repression and so waved her tail that she regularly\ngot it across the reins. This stirred my grandfather to something not\nfar short of anger. How vigorously would he try to dislodge the reins\nby pulling and jerking! Dolly only clamped down her tail the harder.\nExperience showed that the only way was to go slowly and craftily and\nwithout heat or temper--a slackening of the reins--a distraction of Dolly's\nattention--a leaning across the dashboard--a firm grasping of the tail out\nnear the end--a sudden raising thereof. Ah! It was done. We all settled\nback against the cushions. Or perhaps a friendly fly would come to our\nassistance and Dolly would have to use her tail in another direction.\n\nThe whip was seldom used. Generally it stood in its socket. It was\nornamental like a flagstaff. It forgot its sterner functions. But Dolly\nmust have known the whip in some former life, for even a gesture toward the\nsocket roused her. If it was rattled she mended her pace for a block. But\nif on a rare occasion my grandfather took it in his hand, Dolly lay one ear\nback in our direction, for she knew then he meant business. And what an\nexcitement would arise in the phaeton! We held on tight for fear that she\nmight take it into her mild old head to run away.\n\nBut Dolly had her moments. One sunny summer afternoon while she grazed\npeacefully in the orchard, with her reins wound around the whip handle--the\nappropriate place on these occasions--she was evidently stung by a bee. My\nbrother was at the time regaling himself in a near-by blackberry thicket.\nHe looked up at an unusual sound. Without warning, Dolly had leaped to\naction and was tearing around the orchard dragging the phaeton behind\nher. She wrecked the top on a low hanging branch, then hit another tree,\nsevering thereby all connection between herself and the phaeton, and at\nlast galloped down the lane to the farm house, with the broken shafts and\nharness dangling behind her. Kipling's dun \"with the mouth of a bell and\nthe heart of Hell and the head of the gallows-tree,\" could hardly have\nshown more spirit. It was as though one brief minute of a glorious youth\nhad come back to her. It was a last spurting of an old flame before it sunk\nto ash.\n\nMy grandfather gave his leisure to his grandchildren. He carved for us with\nhis knife, with an especial knack for willow whistles. He showed us the\ncolors that lay upon the world when we looked at it through one of the\nglass pendants of the parlor chandelier. He sat by us when we played\nduck-on-the-rock. He helped us with our kites and gave a superintendence to\nour toys. It is true that he was superficial with tin-tags and did not know\nthe difference in value between a Steam Engine tag--the rarest of them\nall--and a common Climax, but we forgave him as one forgives a friend who\nis ignorant of Persian pottery. He employed us as gardeners and put a\nbounty on weeds. We watered the lawn together, turn by turn. When I was\nno more than four years old, he taught us to play casino with him--and\nafterwards bezique. How he cried out if he got a royal sequence! With what\nexcitement he announced a double bezique! Or if one of us seemed about to\nscore and lacked but a single card, how intently he contended for the last\nfew tricks to thwart our declaration! And if we got it despite his lead\nof aces, how gravely he squinted on the cards against deception, with his\nglasses forward on his nose!\n\nWhen he took his afternoon nap and lay upon his back on the sofa in the\nsitting-room, we made paper pin-wheels to see whether his breath would\nstir them. This trick having come to his notice by a sudden awakening, he\nsometimes thereafter played to be asleep and snored in such a mighty gust\nthat the wheels spun. He was like a Dutch tempest against a windmill.\n\nIf a Dime Museum came to town we made an afternoon of it. He took us to all\nthe circuses and gave us our choice of side-shows. We walked up and\ndown before the stretches of painted canvas, balancing in our desire a\nsword-swallower against an Indian Princess. Most of the fat women and all\nthe dwarfs that I have known came to my acquaintance when in company with\nmy grandfather. As a young man, it was said, he once ran away from home to\njoin a circus as an acrobat, having acquired the trick of leaping upon a\nrunning horse. I fancy that his knack of throwing us to his shoulder by a\ndouble somersault was a recollection of his early days. You may imagine\nwith what awe we looked on him even though he now went on crutches. He was\nthe epitome of adventure, the very salt of excitement. It was better having\nhim than a pirate in the house. When the circus had gone and life was drab,\nhe was our tutor in the art of turning cart-wheels and making hand-stands\nagainst the door.\n\nAnd once, when we were away from him, he walked all morning about the\ngarden and in his loneliness he gathered into piles the pebbles that we had\ndropped.\n\nI was too young to know my grandfather in his active days when he was\nprominent in public matters. His broader abilities are known to others. But\nthough more than twenty years have passed since his death, I remember his\ntone of voice, his walk, his way of handling a crutch, all his tricks of\nspeech and conduct as though he had just left the room. And I can think of\nnothing more beautiful than that a useful man who has faced the world for\nseventy years and has done his part, should come back in his old age to the\nnursery and be the playfellow of his grandchildren.\n\nBut the best holiday was a trip to the farm.\n\nThis farm--to which in our slow trot we have been so long a time in\ncoming--lay for a mile on the upper land, and its grain fields and pastures\nlooked down into the valley. The buildings, however, were set close to the\nroad and fixed their interest on such occasional wagons as creaked by. A\nSwitzer occupied the farm, who owned, in addition to the more immediate\nmembers of his family, a cuckoo clock whose weights hung on long cords\nwhich by Saturday night reached almost to the floor. When I have sat at his\ntable, I have neglected cheese and the lesser foods, when the hour came\nnear, in order not to miss the cuckoo's popping out. And in the duller\nspaces, when the door was shut, I have fancied it sitting in the dark and\ncounting the minutes to itself.\n\nThe Switzer's specialty was the making of a kind of rubber cheese which one\ncould learn to like in time. Of the processes of its composition, I can\nremember nothing except that when it was in the great press the whey ran\nfrom its sides, but this may be common to all cheeses. I was once given a\ncup of this whey to drink and I brightened, for until it was in my mouth,\nI thought it was buttermilk. Beyond was the spring-house with cans of milk\nset in the cool water and with a trickling sound beneath the boards. From\nthe spring-house there started those mysterious cow-paths that led down\ninto the great gorge that cut the farm. Here were places so deep that only\na bit of the sky showed and here the stones were damp. It was a place that\nseemed to lie nearer to the confusion when the world was made, and rocks\nlay piled as though a first purpose had been broken off. And to follow a\ncow-path, regardless of where it led, was, in those days, the essence of\nhazard; though all the while from the pastures up above there came the flat\nsafe tinkling of the bells.\n\nThe apple orchard--where Dolly was stung by the bee--was set on a fine\nbreezy place at the brow of the hill with the valley in full sight. The\ntrees themselves were old and decayed, but they were gnarled and crotched\nfor easy climbing. And the apples--in particular a russet--mounted to a\ndelicacy. On the other side of the valley, a half mile off as a bird would\nfly, were the buildings of a convent, and if you waited you might hear\nthe twilight bell. To this day all distant bells come to my ears with a\npleasing softness, as though they had been cast in a quieter world. Stone\narrow-heads were found in a near-by field as often as the farmer turned up\nthe soil in plowing. And because of this, a long finger of land that put\noff to the valley, was called Indian Point. Here, with an arm for pillow,\none might lie for a long hour on a sunny morning and watch the shadows of\nclouds move across the lowland. A rooster crows somewhere far off--surely\nof all sounds the drowsiest. A horse in a field below lifts up its head and\nneighs. The leaves practice a sleepy tune. If one has the fortune to keep\nawake, here he may lie and think the thoughts that are born of sun and\nwind.\n\nAnd now, although it is not yet noon, hunger rages in us. The pancakes, the\nsyrup, the toast and the other incidents of breakfast have disappeared\nthe way the rabbit vanishes when the magician waves his hand. The horrid\nPolyphemus did not so crave his food. And as yet there is no comforting\nsniff from the kitchen. Scrubbing and other secular matters engage the\nfarmer's wife. There is as yet not a faintest gurgle in the kettle.\n\nTo divert ourselves, we climb three trees and fall out of one. Is twelve\no'clock never to come? Have Time and the Hour grown stagnant? We eat apples\nand throw the cores at the pig to hear him grunt. Is the great round sun\nstuck? Have the days of Joshua come again? We walk a rail fence. Is it not\nyet noon? Shrewsbury clock itself--reputed by scholars the slowest of all\npossible clocks--could not so hold off. I snag myself--but it is nothing\nthat shows when I sit.\n\nAh! At last! My grandfather is calling from the house. We run back and\nfind that the lunch is ready and is laid upon a table with a red oil-cloth\ncover. We apply ourselves. Silence....\n\nThe journey home started about five o'clock. There was one game we always\nplayed. Each of us, having wisely squinted at the sky, made a reckoning and\nguessed where we would be when the sun set. My grandfather might say the\nhigh bridge. I named the Sherman House. But my brother, being precise,\njudged it to a fraction of a telegraph pole. Beyond a certain turn--did we\nremember?--well, it would be exactly sixteen telegraph poles further on.\nWhat an excitement there was when the sun's lower rim was already below the\nhorizon! We stood on our knees and looked through the little window at\nthe back of the phaeton. With what suspicion we regarded my grandfather's\ndriving! Or if Dolly lagged, did it not raise a thought that she, too, was\nin the plot against us? The sun sets. We cry out the victor.\n\nThe sky flames with color. Then deadens in the east. The dusk is falling.\nThe roads grow dark. Where run the roads of night? While there is light,\nyou can see the course they keep across the country--the dust of horses'\nfeet--a bridge--a vagrant winding on a hill beyond. All day long they are\nbusy with the feet of men and women and children shouting. Then twilight\ncomes, and the roads lead home to supper and the curling smoke above the\nroof. But at night where run the roads? It's dark beyond the candle's\nflare--where run the roads of night.\n\nMy brother and I have become sleepy. We lop over against my grandfather--\n\nWe awake with a start. There is a gayly lighted horse-car jingling beside\nus. The street lights show us into harbor. We are home at last.\n\n\n\n\nThe Man Of Grub Street Comes From His Garret\n\n\nI have come to live this winter in New York City and by good fortune I\nhave found rooms on a pleasant park. This park, which is but one block in\nextent, is so set off from the thoroughfares that it bears chiefly the\ntraffic that is proper to the place itself. Grocery carts jog around and\nthrow out their wares. Laundry wagons are astir. A little fat tailor on an\noccasion carries in an armful of newly pressed clothing with suspenders\nhanging. Dogs are taken out to walk but are held in leash, lest a taste of\nliberty spoil them for an indoor life. The center of the park is laid out\nwith grass and trees and pebbled paths, and about it is a high iron fence.\nEach house has a key to the enclosure. Such social infection, therefore, as\ngets inside the gates is of our own breeding. In the sunny hours nurses and\nchildren air themselves in this grass plot. Here a gayly painted wooden\nvelocipede is in fashion. At this minute there are several pairs of fat\nlegs a-straddle this contrivance. It is a velocipede as it was first made,\nwithout pedals. Beau Brummel--for the velocipede dates back to him--may\nhave walked forth to take the waters at Tunbridge Wells on a vehicle not\nfar different, but built to his greater stature. There is also a trickle\nof drays and wagons across the park--a mere leakage from the streets, as\nthough the near-by traffic in the pressure had burst its pipes. But only at\nmorning and night when the city collects or discharges its people, are the\nsidewalks filled. Then for a half hour the nozzle of the city plays a full\nstream on us.\n\nThe park seems to be freer and more natural than the streets outside. A man\ngoes by gesticulating as though he practiced for a speech. A woman adjusts\nher stocking on the coping below the fence with the freedom of a country\nroad. A street sweeper, patched to his office, tunes his slow work to fit\nthe quiet surroundings. Boys skate by or cut swirls upon the pavement in\nthe privilege of a playground.\n\nMy work--if anything so pleasant and unforced can carry the name--is\ndone at a window that overlooks this park. Were it not for several high\nbuildings in my sight I might fancy that I lived in one of the older\nsquares of London. There is a look of Thackeray about the place as though\nthe Osbornes might be my neighbors. A fat man who waddles off his steps\nopposite, if he would submit to a change of coat, might be Jos Sedley\nstarting for his club to eat his chutney. If only there were a crest above\nmy bell-pull I might even expect Becky Sharp in for tea. Or occasionally I\ndivert myself with the fancy that I am of a still older day and that I have\nwalked in from Lichfield--I choose the name at hazard--with a tragedy in my\npocket, to try my fortune. Were it not for the fashion of dress in the park\nbelow and some remnant of reason in myself, I could, in a winking moment,\npersuade myself that my room is a garret and my pen a quill. On such\ndelusion, before I issued on the street to seek my coffee-house, I would\nadjust my wig and dust myself of snuff.\n\nBut for my exercise and recreation--which for a man of Grub Street is\nnecessary in the early hours of afternoon when the morning fires have\nfallen--I go outside the park. I have a wide choice for my wanderings. I\nmay go into the district to the east and watch the children play against\nthe curb. If they pitch pennies on the walk I am careful to go about, for\nfear that I distract the throw. Or if the stones are marked for hop-scotch,\nI squeeze along the wall. It is my intention--from which as yet my\ndiffidence withholds me--to present to the winner of one of these contests\na red apple which I shall select at a corner stand. Or an ice wagon pauses\nin its round, and while the man is gone there is a pleasant thieving of\nbits of ice. Each dirty cheek is stuffed as though a plague of mumps had\nfallen on the street. Or there may be a game of baseball--a scampering\non the bases, a home-run down the gutter--to engage me for an inning.\nOr shinny grips the street. But if a street organ comes--not a mournful\none-legged box eked out with a monkey, but a big machine with an extra man\nto pull--the children leave their games. It was but the other day that I\nsaw six of them together dancing on the pavement to the music, with skirts\nand pigtails flying. There was such gladness in their faces that the\nmusician, although he already had his nickel, gave them an extra tune. It\nwas of such persuasive gayety that the number of dancers at once went up to\nten and others wiggled to the rhythm. And for myself, although I am past my\nsportive days, the sound of a street organ, if any, would inflame me to a\nfox-trot. Even a surly tune--if the handle be quickened--comes from the box\nwith a brisk seduction. If a dirge once got inside, it would fret until it\ncame out a dancing measure.\n\nIn this part of town, on the better streets, I sometimes study the fashions\nas I see them in the shops and I compare them with those of uptown stores.\nNor is there the difference one might suppose. The small round muff that\nsprang up this winter in the smarter shops won by only a week over the\ncheaper stores. Tan gaiters ran a pretty race. And I am now witness to\na dead heat in a certain kind of fluffy rosebud dress. The fabrics are\nprobably different, but no matter how you deny it, they are cut to a common\npattern.\n\nIn a poorer part of the city still nearer to the East River, where\nsmells of garlic and worse issue from cellarways, I came recently on\na considerable park. It was supplied with swings and teeters and drew\nchildren on its four fronts. Of a consequence the children of many races\nplayed together. I caught a Yiddish answer to an Italian question. I fancy\nthat a child here could go forth at breakfast wholly a Hungarian and come\nhome with a smack of Russian or Armenian added. The general games that\nmerged the smaller groups, aided in the fusion. If this park is not already\nnamed--a small chance, for it shows the marks of age--it might properly be\ncalled _The Park of the Thirty Nations_.\n\nOr my inclination may take me to the lower city. Like a poor starveling\nI wander in the haunts of wealth where the buildings are piled to forty\nstories, and I spin out the ciphers in my brain in an endeavor to compute\nthe amount that is laid up inside. Also, lest I become discontented with my\npoverty, I note the strain and worry of the faces that I meet. There is a\nstory of Tolstoi in which a man is whispered by his god that he may possess\nsuch land as he can circle in a day. Until that time he had been living on\na fertile <DW72> of sun and shadow, with fields ample for his needs. But\nwhen the whisper came, at a flash, he pelted off across the hills. He ran\nall morning, but as the day advanced his sordid ambition broadened and he\nturned his course into a wider and still wider circle. Here a pleasant\nvalley tempted him and he bent his path to bring it inside his mark. Here\na fruitful upland led him off. As the day wore on he ran with a greater\nfierceness, because he knew he would lose everything if he did not reach\nhis starting place before the sun went down. The sun was coming near the\nrim of earth when he toiled up the last hill. His feet were cut by stones,\nhis face pinched with agony. He staggered toward the goal and fell across\nit while as yet there was a glint of light. But his effort burst his heart.\nDoes the analogy hold on these narrow streets? To a few who sit in an inner\noffice, Mammon has made a promise of wealth and domination. These few run\nbreathless to gain a mountain. But what have the gods whispered to the ten\nthousand who sit in the outer office, that they bend and blink upon their\nledgers? Have the gods whispered to them the promise of great wealth? Alas,\nbefore them there lies only the dust and heat of a level road, yet they too\nare broken at the sunset.\n\nLess oppressive are the streets where commerce is more apparent. Here,\nunless you would be smirched, it is necessary to walk fast and hold your\ncoat-tails in. Packing cases are going down slides. Bales are coming up in\nhoists. Barrels are rolling out of wagons. Crates are being lifted in. Is\nthe exchange never to stop? Is no warehouse satisfied with what it has?\nEnglish, which until now you judged a soft concordant language, shows here\nits range and mastery of epithet. And all about, moving and jostling the\nboxes, are men with hooks. One might think that in a former day Captain\nCuttle had settled here to live and that his numerous progeny had kept the\nplace.\n\nOften I ride on a bus top like a maharajah on an elephant, up near the\ntusks, as it were, where the view is unbroken. I plan this trip so that I\nmove counter to the procession that goes uptown in the late afternoon. Is\nthere a scene like it in the world? The boulevards of Paris in times of\npeace are hardly so gay. Fifth Avenue is blocked with motor cars. Fashion\nhas gone forth to select a feather. A ringlet has gone awry and must be\nmended. The Pomeranian's health is served by sunlight. The Spitz must have\nan airing. Fashion has wagged its head upon a Chinese vase--has indeed\nsquinted at it through a lorgnette against a fleck--and now lolls home to\ndinner. Or style has veered an inch, and it has been a day of fitting. At\nrestaurant windows one may see the feeding of the over-fed. Men sit in club\nwindows and still wear their silk hats as though there was no glass between\nthem and the windy world. Footmen in boots and breeches sit as stiffly as\nthough they were toys grown large and had metal spikes below to hold them\nto their boxes. They look like the iron firemen that ride on nursery\nfire-engines. For all these sights the bus top is the best place.\n\nAnd although we sit on a modest roof, the shopkeepers cater to us. For in\nmany of the stores, is there not an upper tier of windows for our use? The\ncommodities of this second story are quite as fine as those below. And the\nwaxen beauties who display the frocks greet us in true democracy with as\nsweet a simper.\n\nMy friend G---- while riding recently on a bus top met with an experience\nfor which he still blushes.\n\nThere was a young woman sitting directly in front of him, and when he came\nto leave, a sudden lurch threw him against her. When he recovered his\nfooting, which was a business of some difficulty, for the bus pitched upon\na broken pavement, what was his chagrin to find that a front button of\nhis coat had hooked in her back hair! Luckily G---- was not seized with a\npanic. Rather, he labored cautiously--but without result. Nor could\nshe help in the disentanglement. Their embarrassment might have been\nindefinitely prolonged--indeed, G---- was several blocks already down the\nstreet--when he bethought him of his knife and so cut off the button. As he\npleasantly expressed it to the young woman, he would give her the choice of\nthe button or the coat entire.\n\nReader, are you inclined toward ferry boats? I cannot include those persons\nwho journey on them night and morning perfunctorily. These persons keep\ntheir noses in their papers or sit snugly in the cabin. If the market is\nup, they can hardly be conscious even that they are crossing a river.\nNor do I entirely blame them. If one kept shop on a breezy tip of the\nDelectable Mountains with all the regions of the world laid out below,\nhe could not be expected to climb up for the hundredth time with a first\nexhilaration, or to swing his alpenstock as though he were on a rare\nholiday. If one had business across the Styx too often--although the\nscenery on its banks is reputed to be unusual--he might in time sit below\nand take to yawning. Father Charon might have to jog his shoulder to rouse\nhim when the boat came between the further piers.\n\nBut are you one of those persons who, not being under a daily compulsion,\nrides upon a ferry boat for the love of the trip? Being in this class\nmyself, I laid my case the other night before the gateman, and asked\nhis advice regarding routes. He at once entered sympathetically into my\ndistemper and gave me a plan whereby with but a single change of piers\nI might at an expense of fourteen cents cross the river four times at\ndifferent angles.\n\nIt was at the end of day and a light fog rested on the water. Nothing was\nentirely lost, yet a gray mystery wrapped the ships and buildings. If New\nJersey still existed it was dim and shadowy as though its real life had\ngone and but a ghost remained. Ferry boats were lighted in defiance of the\nmurk, and darted here and there at reckless angles. An ocean liner was\nputting out, and several tugs had rammed their noses against her sides.\nThere is something engaging about a tug. It snorts with eagerness. It kicks\nand splashes. It bursts itself to lend a hand. And how it butts with its\nnose! Surely its forward cartilages are of triple strength, else in its\nzest it would jam its nasal passages.\n\nPresently we came opposite lower New York. Although the fog concealed the\noutlines of the buildings, their lights showed through. This first hour of\ndark is best, before the day's work is done and while as yet all of the\nwindows are lighted. The Woolworth Tower was suffused in a soft and shadowy\nlight. The other buildings showed like mountains of magic pin-pricks. It\nwas as though all the constellations of heaven on a general bidding had met\nfor conference.\n\nThe man of Grub Street, having by this time somewhat dispelled the fumes of\ndullness from his head, descends from his ferry boat and walks to his quiet\npark. There is a dull roar from the elevated railway on Third Avenue where\nthe last of the day's crowd goes home. The sidewalks are becoming empty.\nThere is a sheen of water on the pavement. In the winter murk there is a\nlook of Thackeray about the place as though the Sedleys or the Osbornes\nmight be his neighbors. If there were a crest above his bell-pull he might\neven expect Becky Sharp in for tea.\n\n\n\n\nNow that Spring is here\n\n\nWhen the sun set last night it was still winter. The persons who passed\nnorthward in the dusk from the city's tumult thrust their hands deep into\ntheir pockets and walked to a sharp measure. But a change came in the\nnight. The north wind fell off and a breeze blew up from the south. Such\nstars as were abroad at dawn left off their shrill winter piping--if it be\ntrue that stars really sing in their courses--and pitched their voices to\nApril tunes. One star in particular that hung low in the west until the day\nwas up, knew surely that the Spring had come and sang in concert with the\nearliest birds. There is a dull belief that these early birds shake off\ntheir sleep to get the worm. Rather, they come forth at this hour to cock\ntheir ears upon the general heavens for such new tunes as the unfaded\nstars still sing. If an ear is turned down to the rummage of worms in the\nearth--for to the superficial, so does the attitude attest--it is only that\nthe other ear may be turned upward to catch the celestial harmonies; for\nbirds know that if there is an untried melody in heaven it will sound first\nacross the clear pastures of the dawn. All the chirping and whistling\nfrom the fields and trees are then but the practice of the hour. When the\nmeadowlark sings on a fence-rail she but cons her lesson from the stars.\n\nIt is on such a bright Spring morning that the housewife, duster in hand,\nthrows open her parlor window and looks upon the street. A pleasant park is\nbelow, of the size of a city square, and already it stirs with the day's\nactivity. The housewife beats her cloth upon the sill and as the dust flies\noff, she hears the cries and noises of the place. In a clear tenor she\nis admonished that there is an expert hereabouts to grind her knives. A\nswarthy baritone on a wagon lifts up his voice in praise of radishes and\ncarrots. His eye roves along the windows. The crook of a hungry finger will\nbring him to a stand. Or a junkman is below upon his business. Yesterday\nthe bells upon his cart would have sounded sour, but this morning they\nrattle agreeably, as though a brisker cow than common, springtime in her\nhoofs, were jangling to her pasture. At the sound--if you are of country\ntraining--you see yourself, somewhat misty through the years, barefoot in a\ngrassy lane, with stick in hand, urging the gentle beast. There is a subtle\npersuasion in the junkman's call. In these tones did the magician, bawling\nfor old lamps, beguile Aladdin. If there were this morning in my lodging an\nunrubbed lamp, I would toss it from the window for such magic as he might\nextract from it. And if a fair Princess should be missing at the noon and\nher palace be skipped from sight, it will follow on the rubbing of it.\n\nThe call of red cherries in the park--as you might guess from its Italian\nsource--is set to an amorous tune. What lady, smocked in morning cambric,\nwould not be wooed by such a voice? The gay fellow tempts her to a\npurchase. It is but a decent caution--now that Spring is here--that the\nrascal does not call his wares by moonlight. As for early peas this\nmorning, it is Pan himself who peddles them--disguised and smirched lest\nhe be caught in the deception--Pan who stamps his foot and shakes the\nthicket--whose habit is to sing with reedy voice of the green willows that\ndip in sunny waters. Although he now clatters his tins and baskets and\ncries out like a merchant, his thoughts run to the black earth and the\nshady hollows and the sound of little streams.\n\nI have wondered as I have observed the housewives lingering at their\nwindows--for my window also looks upon the park--I have wondered that these\nmelodious street cries are not used generally for calling the wares of\nwider sale. If a radish can be so proclaimed, there might be a lilt devised\nin praise of other pleasing merceries--a tripping pizzicato for laces and\nfrippery--a brave trumpeting for some newest cereal. And should not the\nlatest book--if it be a tale of love, for these I am told are best offered\nto the public in the Spring (sad tales are best for winter)--should not a\ntale of love be heralded through the city by the singing of a ballad, with\na melting tenor in the part? In old days a gaudy rogue cried out upon the\nbroader streets that jugglers had stretched their rope in the market-place,\nbut when the bears came to town, the news was piped even to the narrowest\nlanes that house-folk might bring their pennies.\n\nWith my thoughts set on the Spring I chanced to walk recently where the\ntheatres are thickest. It was on a Saturday afternoon and the walk was\ncrowded with amusement seekers. Presently in the press I observed a queer\nold fellow carrying on his back a monstrous pack of umbrellas. He rang\na bell monotonously and professed himself a mender of umbrellas. He can\nhardly have expected to find a customer in the crowd. Even a blinking\neye--and these street merchants are shrewd in these matters--must have told\nhim that in all this hurrying mass of people, the thoughts of no one ran\ntoward umbrellas. Rather, I think that he was taking an hour from the\nroutine of the day. He had trod the profitable side streets until truantry\nhad taken him. But he still made a pretext of working at his job and called\nhis wares to ease his conscience from idleness. Once when an unusually\nbright beam of sunlight fell from between the clouds, he tilted up his hat\nto get the warmth and I thought him guilty of a skip and syncopation in the\nringing of his bell, as if he too twitched pleasantly with the Spring and\nhis old sap was stirred.\n\nI like these persons who ply their trades upon the sidewalk. My hatter--the\nfellow who cleans my straw hat each Spring--is a partner of a bootblack.\nOver his head as he putters with his soap and brushes, there hangs a rusty\nsign proclaiming that he is famous for his cleaning all round the world. He\nis so modest in his looks that I have wondered whether he really can read\nthe sign. Or perhaps like a true merchant, he is not squeamish at the\npraise. As I have not previously been aware that any of his profession ever\ncame to general fame except the Mad Hatter of Wonderland, I have squinted\nsharply at him to see if by chance it might be he, but there are no marks\neven of a distant kinship. He does, however, bring my hat to a marvellous\nwhiteness and it may be true that he has really tended heads that are now\ngone beyond Constantinople.\n\nBootblacks have a sense of rhythm unparalleled. Of this the long rag is\ntheir instrument. They draw it once or twice across the shoe to set the key\nand then they go into a swift and pattering melody. If there is an unusual\ngenius in the bootblack--some remnant of ancient Greece--he plays such a\nlively tune that one's shoulders jig to it. If there were a dryad or other\nsuch nimble creature on the street, she would come leaping as though\nOrpheus strummed a tune, but the dance is too fast for our languid northern\nfeet.\n\nNowhere are apples redder than on a cart. Our hearts go out to Adam in the\nhour of his temptation. I know one lady of otherwise careful appetite who\neven leans toward dates if she may buy them from a cart. \"Those dear dirty\ndates,\" she calls them, but I cannot share her liking for them. Although\nthe cart is a beguiling market, dates so bought are too dusty to be eaten.\nThey rank with the apple-john. The apple-john is that mysterious leathery\nfruit, sold more often from a stand than from a cart, which leans at the\nrear of the shelf against the peppermint jars. For myself, although I do\nnot eat apple-johns, I like to look at them. They are so shrivelled and so\nflat, as though a banana had caught a consumption. Or rather, in the older\nworld was there not a custom at a death of sending fruits to support the\nlonesome journey? If so, the apple-john came untasted to the end. Indeed,\nthere is a look of old Egypt about the fruit. Whether my fondness for\ngazing at apple-johns springs from a distant occasion when as a child I\nonce bought and ate one, or whether it arises from the fact that Falstaff\ncalled Prince Hal a dried apple-john, is an unsolved question, but I like\nto linger before a particularly shrivelled one and wonder what its youth\nwas like. Perhaps like many of its betters, it remained unheralded and\nunknown all through its fresher years and not until the coming of its\nwrinkled age was it at last put up to the common view. The apple-john sets\nup kinship with an author.\n\nThe day of all fools is wisely put in April. The jest of the day resides in\nthe success with which credulity is imposed upon, and April is the month of\neasiest credulity. Let bragging travellers come in April and hold us with\ntales of the Anthropopagi! If their heads are said to grow beneath their\nshoulders, still we will turn a credent ear. Indeed, it is all but sure\nthat Baron Munchausen came back from his travels in the Spring. When\nelse could he have got an ear? What man can look upon the wonders of the\nreturning year--the first blue skies, the soft rains, the tender sproutings\nof green stalks without feeling that there is nothing beyond belief? If\nsuch miracles can happen before his eyes, shall not the extreme range even\nof travel or metaphysics be allowed? What man who has smelled the first\nfragrance of the earth, has heard the birds on their northern flight and\nhas seen an April brook upon its course, will withhold his credence even\nthough the jest be plain?\n\nI beg, therefore, that when you walk upon the street on the next day of\nApril fool, that you yield to the occasion. If an urchin points his finger\nat your hat, humor him by removing it! Look sharply at it for a supposed\ndefect! His glad shout will be your reward. Or if you are begged piteously\nto lift a stand-pipe wrapped to the likeness of a bundle, even though you\nsniff the imposture, seize upon it with a will! It is thus, beneath these\nApril skies, that you play your part in the pageantry that marks the day.\n\n\n\n\nThe Friendly Genii\n\n\nDo you not confess yourself to be several years past that time of greenest\nyouth when burnt cork holds its greatest charm? Although not fallen to a\ncrippled state, are you not now too advanced to smudge your upper lip and\nstalk agreeably as a villain? Surely you can no longer frisk lightly in\na comedy. If you should wheeze and limp in an old man's part, with back\nhumped in mimicry, would you not fear that it bordered on the truth? But\ndoubtless there was a time when you ranged upon these heights--when Kazrac\nthe magician was not too heavy for your art. In those soaring days, let us\nhope that you played the villain with a swagger, or being cast in a softer\nrole, that you won a pink and fluffy princess before the play was done.\nYour earliest practice, it may be, was in rigging the parlor hangings as a\ncurtain with brown string from the pantry and safety pins. Although you had\nno show to offer, you said \"ding\" three times--as is the ancient custom of\nthe stage when the actors are ready--and drew them wide apart. The cat\nwas the audience, who dozed with an ear twitching toward your activity. A\ncomplaint that springs up in youth and is known as \"snuffles\" had kept you\nout of school. It had gripped you hard at breakfast, when you were sunk in\nfear of your lessons, but had abated at nine o'clock. Whether the cure came\nwith a proper healing of the nasal glands or followed merely on the ringing\nof the school bell, must be left to a cool judgment.\n\nYour theatre filled the morning. When Annie came on her quest for dust, you\ntooted once upon your nose, just to show that a remnant of your infirmity\npersisted, then put your golden convalescence on the making of your\ncurtain.\n\nBut in the early hours of afternoon when the children are once more upon\nthe street, you regret your illness. Here they come trooping by threes and\nfours, carrying their books tied up in straps. One would think that they\nwere in fear lest some impish fact might get outside the covers to spoil\nthe afternoon. Until the morrow let two and two think themselves five at\nleast! And let Ohio be bounded as it will! Some few children skip ropes, or\nstep carefully across the cracks of the sidewalk for fear they spoil their\nsuppers. Ah!--a bat goes by--a glove--a ball! And now from a vacant lot\nthere comes the clamor of choosing sides. Is no mention to be made of\nyou--you, \"molasses fingers\"--the star left fielder--the timely batter?\nWhat would you not give now for a clean bill of health? You rub your\noffending nose upon the glass. What matters it with what deep rascality in\nblack mustachios you once strutted upon your boards? What is Hecuba to you?\n\nMy own first theatre was in the attic, a place of squeaks and shadows\nto all except the valiant. In it were low, dark corners where the night\ncrawled in and slept. But in the open part where the roof was highest,\nthere was the theatre. Its walls were made of a red cambric of a flowered\npattern that still lingers with me, and was bought with a clatter of\npennies on the counter, together with nickels that had escaped my\nextravagance at the soda fountain.\n\nA cousin and I were joint proprietors. In the making of it, the hammer and\nnails were mine by right of sex, while she stitched in womanish fashion on\nthe fabrics. She was leading woman and I was either the hero or the villain\nas fitted to my mood. My younger cousin--although we scorned her for her\nyouth--was admitted to the slighter parts. She might daub herself with\ncork, but it must be only when we were done. Nor did we allow her to carry\nthe paper knife--shaped like a dagger--which figured hugely in our plots.\nIf we gave her any word to speak, it was as taffy to keep her silent about\nsome iniquity that we had worked against her. In general, we judged her to\nbe too green and giddy for the heavy parts. At the most, she might take\npins at the door--for at such a trifle we displayed our talents--or play\nupon the comb as orchestra before the rising of the curtain.\n\nThe usual approach to this theatre was the kitchen door, and those who came\nto enjoy the drama sniffed at their very entrance the new-baked bread. A\npan of cookies was set upon a shelf and a row of apples was ranged along\nthe window sill. Of the ice-box around the corner, not a word, lest hunger\nlead you off! As for the cook, although her tongue was tart upon a just\noccasion and although she shooed the children with her apron, secretly she\nliked to have them crowding through her kitchen.\n\nNow if you, reader--for I assume you to be one of the gathering\naudience--were of the kind careful on scrubbing days to scrape your feet\nupon the iron outside and to cross the kitchen on the unwashed parts, then\nit is likely that you stood in the good graces of the cook. Mark your\nreward! As you journeyed upward, you munched upon a cookie and bit scallops\nin its edge. Or if a ravenous haste was in you--as commonly comes up in the\nmiddle afternoon--you waived this slower method and crammed yourself with\na recklessness that bestrewed the purlieus of your mouth. If your ears lay\nbeyond the muss, the stowage was deemed decent and in order.\n\nIs there not a story in which children are tracked by an ogre through the\nperilous wood by the crumbs they dropped? Then let us hope there is no ogre\nlurking on these back stairs, for the trail is plain. It would be near the\ntop, farthest from the friendly kitchen, that the attack might come, for\nthere the stairs yielded to the darkness of the attic. There it was best\nto look sharp and to turn the corners wide. A brave whistling kept out the\nother noises.\n\nIt was after Aladdin had been in town that the fires burned hottest in us.\nMy grandfather and I went together to the matinee, his great thumb within\nmy fist. We were frequent companions. Together we had sat on benches in the\npark and poked the gravel into patterns. We went to Dime Museums. Although\nhis eyes had looked longer on the world than mine, we seemed of an equal\nage.\n\nThe theatre was empty as we entered. We carried a bag of candy against a\nsudden appetite--colt's foot, a penny to the stick. Here and there ushers\nwere clapping down the seats, sounds to my fancy not unlike the first corn\nwithin a popper. Somewhere aloft there must have been a roof, else the day\nwould have spied in on us, yet it was lost in the gloom. It was as though\na thrifty owner had borrowed the dusky fabrics of the night to make his\ncover. The curtain was indistinct, but we knew it to be the Stratford\nChurch and we dimly saw its spire.\n\nNow, on the opening of a door to the upper gallery, there was a scampering\nto get seats in front, speed being whetted by a long half hour of waiting\non the stairs. Ghostly, unbodied heads, like the luminous souls of lost\nmountaineers--for this was the kind of fiction, got out of the Public\nLibrary, that had come last beneath my thumb--ghostly heads looked down\nupon us across the gallery rail.\n\nAnd now, if you will tip back your head like a paper-hanger--whose Adam's\napple would seem to attest a life of sidereal contemplation--you will see\nin the center of the murk above you a single point of light. It is the\nspark that will ignite the great gas chandelier. I strain my neck to the\npoint of breaking. My grandfather strains his too, for it is a game between\nus which shall announce the first spurting of the light. At last! We cry\nout together. The spark catches the vent next to it. It runs around the\ncircle of glass pendants. The whole blazes up. The mountaineers come to\nlife. They lean forward on their elbows.\n\nFrom the wings comes the tuning of the violins. A flute ripples up and down\nin a care-free manner as though the villain Kazrac were already dead and\nvirtue had come into its own. The orchestra emerges from below. Their\ncalmness is but a pretense. Having looked on such sights as lie behind the\ncurtain, having trod such ways, they should be bubbling with excitement.\nYet observe the bass viol! How sodden is his eye! How sunken is his gaze!\nWith what dull routine he draws his bow, as though he knew naught but\nsleepy tunes! If there be any genie in the place, as the program says, let\nhim first stir this sad fellow from his melancholy!\n\nWe consult our programs. The first scene is the magician's cave where he\nplans his evil schemes. The second is the Chinese city where he pretends to\nbe Aladdin's uncle. And for myself, did a friendly old gentleman offer me\nlollypops and all-day-suckers--for so did the glittering baubles present\nthemselves across the footlights--like Aladdin I, too, would not have\nsquinted too closely on his claim. Gladly I would have gone off with him on\nan all-day picnic toward the Chinese mountains.\n\nWe see a lonely pass in the hills, the cave of jewels (splendid to the eye\nof childhood) where the slave of the lamp first appears, and finally the\nthrone-room with Aladdin seated safely beside his princess.\n\nWho knows how to dip a pen within the twilight? Who shall trace the figures\nof the mist? The play is done. We come out in silence. Our candy is but a\nremnant. Darkness has fallen. The pavements are wet and shining, so that\nthe night might see his face, if by chance the old fellow looked our way.\n\nAll about there are persons hurrying home with dinner-pails, who, by their\ndull eyes, seem never to have heard what wonders follow on the rubbing of a\nlamp.\n\nBut how the fires leaped up--how ambition beat within us--how our attic\ntheatre was wrought to perfection--how the play came off and wracked the\nneighborhood of its pins--with what grace I myself acted Aladdin--these\nthings must be written by a vain and braggart pen.\n\n\n\n\nMr. Pepys Sits in the Pit\n\n\nWhen it happens that a man has risen to be a member of Parliament, the\nSecretary of the British Navy and the President of the Royal Society, when\nhe has become the adviser of the King and is moreover the one really bright\nspot in that King's reign, it is amazing that considerably more than one\nhundred years after his death, when the navy that he nurtured dominates the\nseven seas, that he himself on a sudden should be known, not for his larger\naccomplishments, but as a kind of tavern crony and pot-companion. When he\nshould be standing with fame secure in a solemn though dusty niche in the\nTemple of Time, it is amazing that he should be remembered chiefly for\ncertain quarrels with his wife and as a frequenter of plays and summer\ngardens.\n\nYet this is the fate of Samuel Pepys. Before the return of the Stuarts he\nheld a poor clerkship in the Navy Office and cut his quill obscurely at\nthe common desk. At the Restoration, partly by the boost of influence, but\nchiefly by his substantial merit, he mounted to several successively higher\nposts. The Prince of Wales became his friend and patron and when he became\nLord High Admiral he took Pepys with him in his advancement. Thus in 1684,\nPepys became Secretary of the Navy. When later the Prince of Wales became\nKing James II, Pepys, although his office remained the same, came to quite\na pinnacle of administrative power. He was shrewd and capable in the\nconduct of his position and brought method to the Navy Office. He was a\nprime factor in the first development of the British Navy. Later victories\nthat were to sweep the seas may be traced in part to him. Nelson rides upon\nhis shoulders. These achievements should have made his fame secure. But\non a sudden he gained for posterity a less dignified although a more\ninteresting and enduring renown.\n\nIn life, Samuel Pepys walked gravely in majestical robe with full-bottomed\nwig and with ceremonial lace flapping at his wrists. Every step, if his\nportrait is to be believed, was a bit of pageantry. Such was his fame, that\nif his sword but clacked a warning on the pavement, it must have brought\nthe apprentices to the windows. Tradesmen laid down their wares to get a\nlook at him. Fat men puffed and strained to gain the advantage of a sill.\nFashionable ladies peeped from brocaded curtains and ogled for his regard.\nOr if he went by chair, the carriers held their noses up as though offended\nby the common air. When he spoke before the Commons, the galleries were\nhushed. He gave his days to the signing of stiff parchments--Admiralty\nOrders or what not. He checked the King himself at the council table. In\nshort, he was not only a great personage, but also he was quite well aware\nof the fact and held himself accordingly.\n\nBut now many years have passed, and Time, that has so long been at bowls\nwith reputations, has acquired a moderate skill in knocking them down. Let\nus see how it fares with Pepys! Some men who have been roguish in their\nlives have been remembered by their higher accomplishments. A string\nof sonnets or a novel or two, if it catches the fancy, has wiped out a\ntap-room record. The winning of a battle has obliterated a meanly spent\nyouth. It is true that for a while an old housewife who once lived on the\nhero's street will shake a dubious finger on his early pranks. Stolen\napples or cigarettes behind the barn cram her recollection. But even a\nvillage reputation fades. In time the sonnets and glorious battle have the\nupper place. But things went the other way with Pepys. Rather, his fate\nis like that of Zeus, who--if legend is to be trusted--was in his life a\nperson of some importance whose nod stirred society on Olympus, but who is\nnow remembered largely for his flirtations and his braggart conduct. A not\nunlike evil has fallen on the magnificent Mr. Pepys.\n\nThis fate came to him because--as the world knows--it happened that for\na period of ten years in comparative youth, he wrote an interesting and\nhonest diary. He began this diary in 1659, while he was still a poor clerk\nliving with his wife in a garret, and ended it in 1669, when, although he\nhad emerged from obscurity, his greater honors had not yet been set on him.\nAll the facts of his life during this period are put down, whether good or\nbad, small or large, generous or mean. He writes of his mornings spent in\nwork at his office, of his consultations with higher officials. There\nis much running to and fro of business. The Dutch war bulks to a proper\nlength. Parliament sits through a page at a stretch. Pepys goes upon the\nstreets in the days of the plague and writes the horror of it--the houses\nmarked with red crosses and with prayers scratched beneath--the stench and\nthe carrying of dead bodies. He sees the great fire of London from his\nwindow on the night it starts; afterwards St. Paul's with its roofs fallen.\nHe is on the fleet that brings Charles home from his long travels, and\nafterwards when Charles is crowned, he records the processions and the\ncrowds. But also Pepys quarrels with his wife and writes it out on paper.\nHe debauches a servant and makes a note of it. He describes a supper at an\nale-house, and how he plays on the flute. He sings \"Beauty Retire,\" a song\nof his own making, and tells how his listeners \"cried it up.\"\n\nIn consequence of this, Samuel Pepys is now known chiefly for his\nattentions to the pretty actresses of Drury Lane, for kissing Nell Gwynne\nin her tiring-room, for his suppers with \"the jade\" Mrs. Knipp, for his\nlove of a tune upon the fiddle, for coming home from Vauxhall by wherry\nlate at night, \"singing merrily\" down the river. Or perhaps we recall him\nbest for burying his wine and Parmazan cheese in his garden at the time\nof the Fire, or for standing to the measure of Mr. Pin the tailor for a\n\"camlett cloak with gold buttons,\" or for sitting for his portrait in an\nIndian gown which he \"hired to be drawn in.\" Who shall say that this is not\nthe very portrait by which we have fancied him stalking off to Commons?\nCould the apprentices have known in what a borrowed majesty he walked,\nwould they not have tossed their caps in mirth and pointed their dusky\nfingers at him?\n\nOr we remember that he once lived in a garret, and that his wife, \"poor\nwretch,\" was used to make the fire while Samuel lay abed, and that she\nwashed his \"foul clothes\"--that by degrees he came to be wealthy and\nrode in his own yellow coach--that his wife went abroad in society \"in\na flowered tabby gown\"--that Pepys forsook his habits of poverty and\nexchanged his twelve-penny seat in the theatre gallery for a place in the\npit--and that on a rare occasion (doubtless when he was alone and there was\nbut one seat to buy) he arose to the extravagance of a four-shilling box.\n\nConsequently, despite the weightier parts of the diary, we know Pepys\nchiefly in his hours of ease. Sittings and consultations are so dry. If\nonly the world would run itself decently and in silence! Even a meeting of\nthe Committee for Tangier--when the Prince of Wales was present and such\nsmaller fry as Chancellors--is dull and is matter for a skipping eye.\n\nIf a session of Parliament bulks to a fat paragraph and it happens that\nthere is a bit of deviltry just below at the bottom of the page--maybe no\nmore than a clinking of glasses (or perhaps Nell Gwynne's name pops in\nsight)--bless us how the eye will hurry to turn the leaf on the chance\nof roguery to come! Who would read through a long discourse on Admiralty\nbusiness, if it be known before that Pepys is engaged with the pretty Mrs.\nKnipp for a trip to Bartholomew Fair to view the dancing horse, and that\nthe start is to be made on the turning of the page? Or a piece of scandal\nabout Lady Castlemaine, how her nose fell out of joint when Mrs. Stuart\ncame to court--such things tease one from the sterner business.\n\nAnd for these reasons, we have been inclined to underestimate the\nimportance of Pepys' diary. Francis Jeffrey, who wrote long ago about\nPepys, evidently thought that he was an idle and unprofitable fellow and\nthat the diary was too much given to mean and petty things. But in reality\nthe diary is an historical mine. Even when Pepys plays upon the surface,\nhe throws out facts that can be had nowhere else. No one would venture to\nwrite of Restoration life without digging through his pages. Pepys wrote in\na confused shorthand, maybe against the eye of his wife, from whom he had\nreason to conceal his offenses. The papers lay undeciphered until 1825,\nwhen a partial publication was made. There were additions by subsequent\neditors until now it appears that the Wheatley text of 1893-1899 is final.\nBut ever since 1825, the diary has been judged to be of high importance in\nthe understanding of the first decade of the Restoration.\n\nIf some of the weightier parts are somewhat dry, there are places in which\na lighter show of personality is coincident with real historical data.\nForemost are the pages where Pepys goes to the theatre.\n\nMore than Charles II was restored in 1660. Among many things of more\nimportance than this worthless King, the theatre was restored. Since the\nclose of Elizabethan times it had been out of business. More than thirty\nyears before, Puritanism had snuffed out its candles and driven its\nfiddlers to the streets. But Puritanism, in its turn, fell with the return\nof the Stuarts. Pepys is a chief witness as to what kind of theatre it was\nthat was set up in London about the year 1660. It was far different from\nthe Elizabethan theatre. It came in from the Bankside and the fields to the\nnorth of the city and lodged itself on the better streets and squares. It\nno longer patterned itself on the inn-yard, but was roofed against the\nrain. The time had been when the theatre was cousin to the bear-pit. They\nwere ranged together on the Bankside and they sweat and smelled like\ncongenial neighbors. But these days are past. Let Bartholomew Fair be as\nrowdy as it pleases, let acrobats and such loose fellows keep to Southwark,\nthe theatre has risen in the world! It has put on a wig, as it were, it has\ntied a ribbon to itself and has become fashionable. And although it has\ntaken on a few extra dissolute habits, they are of the genteelest kind and\nwill make it feel at home in the upper circles.\n\nBut also the theatre introduced movable scenery. There is an attempt toward\nelaboration of stage effect. \"To the King's playhouse--\" says Pepys, \"a\ngood scene of a town on fire.\" Women take parts. An avalanche of new plays\ndescends on it. Even the old plays that have survived are garbled to suit a\nchange of taste.\n\nBut if you would really know what kind of theatre it was that sprang up\nwith the Stuarts and what the audiences looked like and how they behaved,\nyou must read Pepys. With but a moderate use of fancy, you can set out with\nhim in his yellow coach for the King's house in Drury Lane. Perhaps hunger\nnips you at the start. If so, you stop, as Pepys pleasantly puts it, for a\n\"barrel of oysters.\" Then, having dusted yourself of crumbs, you take the\nroad again. Presently you come to Drury Lane. Other yellow coaches are\nbefore you. There is a show of foppery on the curb and an odor of smoking\nlinks. A powdered beauty minces to the door. Once past the doorkeeper, you\nhear the cries of the orange women going up and down the aisles. There is a\nshuffling of apprentices in the gallery. A dandy who lolls in a box with a\nsilken leg across the rail, scrawls a message to an actress and sends it\noff by Orange Moll. Presently Castlemaine enters the royal box with the\nKing. There is a craning of necks, for with her the King openly \"do\ndiscover a great deal of familiarity.\" In other boxes are other fine ladies\nwearing vizards to hold their modesty if the comedy is free. A board breaks\nin the ceiling of the gallery and dust falls in the men's hair and the\nladies' necks, which, writes Pepys, \"made good sport.\" Or again, \"A\ngentleman of good habit, sitting just before us, eating of some fruit in\nthe midst of the play, did drop down as dead; being choked, but with much\nado Orange Moll did thrust her finger down his throat and brought him to\nlife again.\" Or perhaps, \"I sitting behind in a dark place, a lady spit\nbackward upon me by a mistake, not seeing me, but after seeing her to be a\nvery pretty lady, I was not troubled at it at all.\"\n\nAt a change of scenes, Mrs. Knipp spies Pepys and comes to the pit door. He\ngoes with her to the tiring-room. \"To the women's shift,\" he writes,\n\"where Nell was dressing herself, and was all unready, and is very pretty,\nprettier than I thought.... But to see how Nell cursed for having so few\npeople in the pit, was pretty.\"--\"But Lord! their confidence! and how\nmany men do hover about them as soon as they come off the stage, and how\nconfident they are in their talk!\" Or he is whispered a bit of gossip, how\nCastlemaine is much in love with Hart, an actor of the house. Then Pepys\ngoes back into the pit and lays out a sixpence for an orange. As the play\nnears its end, footmen crowd forward at the doors. The epilogue is spoken.\nThe fiddles squeak their last. There is a bawling outside for coaches.\n\n\"Would it fit your humor,\" asks Mr. Pepys, when we have been handed to our\nseats, \"would it fit your humor, if we go around to the Rose Tavern for\nsome burnt wine and a breast of mutton off the spit? It's sure that some\nbrave company will fall in, and we can have a tune. We'll not heed the\nbellman. We'll sit late, for it will be a fine light moonshine morning.\"\n\n\n\n\nTo an Unknown Reader\n\n\nOnce in a while I dream that I come upon a person who is reading a book\nthat I have written. In my pleasant dreams these persons do not nod\nsleepily upon my pages, and sometimes I fall in talk with them. Although\nthey do not know who I am, they praise the book and name me warmly among\nmy betters. In such circumstance my happy nightmare mounts until I ride\nforemost with the giants. If I could think that this disturbance of my\nsleep came from my diet and that these agreeable persons arose from a\nlobster or a pie, nightly at supper I would ply my fork recklessly among\nthe platters.\n\nBut in a waking state these meetings never come. If an article of mine is\never read at all, it is read in secret like the Bible. Once, indeed, in a\nfriend's house I saw my book upon the table, but I suspect that it had been\ndusted and laid out for my coming. I request my hostess that next time, for\nmy vanity, she lay the book face down upon a chair, as though the grocer's\nknock intruded. Or perhaps a huckster's cart broke upon her enjoyment.\nLet it be thought that a rare bargain--tender asparagus or the first\nstrawberries of the summer--tempted her off my pages! Or maybe there was\nred rhubarb in the cart and the jolly farmer, as he journeyed up the\nstreet, pitched it to a pleasing melody. Dear lady, I forgive you. But let\nus hope no laundryman led you off! Such discord would have marred my book.\n\nI saw once in a public library, as I went along the shelves, a volume of\nmine which gave evidence to have been really read. The record in front\nshowed that it had been withdrawn one time only. The card was blank\nbelow--but once certainly it had been read. I hope that the book went out\non a Saturday noon when the spirits rise for the holiday to come, and that\na rainy Sunday followed, so that my single reader was kept before his fire.\nA dull patter on the window--if one sits unbuttoned on the hearth--gives\na zest to a languid chapter. The rattle of a storm--if only the room be\nsnug--fixes the attention fast. Therefore, let the rain descend as though\nthe heavens rehearsed for a flood! Let a tempest come out of the west! Let\nthe chimney roar as it were a lion! And if there must be a clearing, let\nit hold off until the late afternoon, lest it sow too early a distaste for\nindoors and reading! There is scarcely a bookworm who will not slip his\nglasses off his nose, if the clouds break at the hour of sunset when the\nearth and sky are filled with a green and golden light. I took the book off\nthe library shelf and timidly glancing across my shoulder for fear that\nsome one might catch me, I looked along the pages. There was a thumb mark\nin a margin, and presently appeared a kindly stickiness on the paper as\nthough an orange had squirted on it. Surely there had been a human being\nhereabouts. It was as certain as when Crusoe found the footprints in the\nsand. Ah, I thought, this fellow who sits in the firelight has caught an\nappetite. Perhaps he bit a hole and sucked the fruit, and the skin has\nburst behind. Or I wave the theory and now conceive that the volume was\nread at breakfast. If so, it is my comfort that in those dim hours it stood\npropped against his coffee cup.\n\nBut the trail ended with the turning of the page. There were, indeed,\nfurther on, pencil checks against one of the paragraphs as if here the book\nhad raised a faint excitement, but I could not tell whether they sprang\nup in derision or in approval. Toward the end there were uncut leaves, as\nthough even my single reader had failed in his persistence.\n\nBeing swept once beyond a usual caution, I lamented to my friend F---- of\nthe neglect in which readers held me, to which the above experience in\na library was a rare exception. F---- offered me such consolation as he\ncould, deplored the general taste and the decadence of the times, and said\nthat as praise was sweet to everyone, he, as far as he himself was able,\noffered it anonymously to those who merited it. He was standing recently\nin a picture gallery, when a long-haired man who stood before one of the\npictures was pointed out to him as the artist who had painted it. At once\nF---- saw his opportunity to confer a pleasure, but as there is a touch of\nhumor in him, he first played off a jest. Lounging forward, he dropped his\nhead to one side as artistic folk do when they look at color. He made a\nknot-hole of his fingers and squinted through. Next he retreated across the\nroom and stood with his legs apart in the very attitude of wisdom. He cast\na stern eye upon the picture and gravely tapped his chin. At last when the\nartist was fretted to an extremity, F---- came forward and so cordially\npraised the picture that the artist, being now warmed and comforted,\npresently excused himself in a high excitement and rushed away to start\nanother picture while the pleasant spell was on him.\n\nHad I been the artist, I would have run from either F----'s praise or\ndisapproval. As an instance, I saw a friend on a late occasion coming from\na bookstore with a volume of suspicious color beneath his arm. I had been\navoiding that particular bookstore for a week because my book lay for sale\non a forward table. And now when my friend appeared, a sudden panic seized\nme and I plunged into the first doorway to escape. I found myself facing a\nsoda fountain. For a moment, in my blur, I could not account for the\nsoda fountain, or know quite how it had come into my life. Presently an\ninterne--for he was jacketted as if he walked a hospital--asked me what I'd\nhave.\n\nStill somewhat dazed, in my discomposure, having no answer ready, my\nstartled fancy ran among the signs and labels of the counter until I\nrecalled that a bearded man once, unblushing in my presence, had ordered\na banana flip. I got the fellow's ear and named it softly. Whereupon he\nplaced a dead-looking banana across a mound of ice-cream, poured on \njuices as though to mark the fatal wound and offered it to me. I ate a few\nbites of the sickish mixture until the streets were safe.\n\nI do not know to what I can attribute my timidity. Possibly it arises from\nthe fact that until recently my writing met with uniform rejection and\nfailure. For years I wrote secretly in order that few persons might know\nhow miserably I failed. I answered upon a question that I had given up the\npractice, that I now had no time for it, that I scribbled now and then\nbut always burned it. All that while I gave my rare leisure and my stolen\nafternoons--the hours that other men give to golf and sleep and sitting\ntogether--these hours I gave to writing. On a holiday I was at it early. On\nSaturday when other folks were abroad, I sat at my desk. It was my grief\nthat I was so poor a borrower of the night that I blinked stupidly on my\npapers if I sat beyond the usual hour. Writing was my obsession. I need no\npity for my failures, for although I tossed my cap upon a rare acceptance,\nmy deeper joy was in the writing. That joy repeated failures could not\nblunt.\n\nThere are paragraphs that now lie yellow in my desk with their former\nmeaning faded, that still recall as I think of them the first exaltation\nwhen I wrote them--feverishly in a hot emotion. In those days I thought\nthat I had caught the sunlight on my pen, and the wind and the moon and the\nspinning earth. I thought that the valleys and the mountains arose from the\nmist obedient to me. If I splashed my pen, in my warm regard it was the\nroar and fury of the sea. It was really no more than my youth crying out.\nAnd, alas, my thoughts and my feelings escaped me when I tried to put them\ndown on paper, although I did not know it then. Perhaps they were too\nvagrant to be held. And yet these paragraphs that might be mournful records\nof failure, fill me with no more than a tender recollection for the boy\nwho wrote them. The worn phrases now beg their way with broken steps. Like\nshrill and piping minstrels they whine and crack a melody that I still\nremember in its freshness.\n\nBut perhaps, reader, we are brothers in these regards. Perhaps you, too,\nhave faded papers. Or possibly, even on a recent date, you sighed your soul\ninto an essay or a sonnet, and\n\n### Summary:\n\n"}

But for him the National Game\nwould have been syndicated and controlled by elements whose interests\nwere purely selfish and personal.\n\nThe book is a veritable repository of information concerning players,\nclubs and personalities connected with the game in its early days, and\nis written in a most interesting style, interspersed with enlivening\nanecdotes and accounts of events that have not heretofore been\npublished.\n\nThe response on the part of the press and the public to Mr. Spalding's\nefforts to perpetuate the early history of the National Game has been\nvery encouraging and he is in receipt of hundreds of letters and\nnotices, a few of which are here given.\n\nROBERT ADAMSON, New York, writing from the office of Mayor Gaynor,\nsays:--\"Seeing the Giants play is my principal recreation and I am\ninterested in reading everything I can find about the game. I especially\nenjoy what you [Mr. Spalding] have written, because you stand as the\nhighest living authority on the game.\"\n\nBARNEY DREYFUSS, owner of the Pittsburg National League club:--\"It does\nhonor to author as well as the game. I have enjoyed reading it very\nmuch.\"\n\nWALTER CAMP, well known foot ball expert and athlete, says:--\"It is\nindeed a remarkable work and one that I have read with a great deal of\ninterest.\"\n\nJOHN B. DAY, formerly President of the New York Nationals:--\"Your\nwonderful work will outlast all of us.\"\n\nW. IRVING SNYDER, formerly of the house of Peck & Snyder:--\"I have read\nthe book from cover to cover with great interest.\"\n\nANDREW PECK, formerly of the celebrated firm of Peck & Snyder:--\"All\nbase ball fans should read and see how the game was conducted in early\nyears.\"\n\nMELVILLE E. STONE, New York, General Manager Associated Press:--\"I find\nit full of valuable information and very interesting. I prize it very\nhighly.\"\n\nGEORGE BARNARD, Chicago:--\"Words fail to express my appreciation of the\nbook. It carries me back to the early days of base ball and makes me\nfeel like a young man again.\"\n\nCHARLES W. MURPHY, President Chicago National League club:--\"The book is\na very valuable work and will become a part of every base ball library\nin the country.\"\n\nJOHN F. MORILL, Boston, Mass., old time base ball star.--\"I did not\nthink it possible for one to become so interested in a book on base\nball. I do not find anything in it which I can criticise.\"\n\nRALPH D. PAINE, popular magazine writer and a leading authority on\ncollege sport:--\"I have been reading the book with a great deal of\ninterest.

FRED FUNSTON, hero of the Philippine war:--\"I read the book with a\ngreat deal of pleasure and was much interested in seeing the account of\nbase ball among the Asiatic whalers, which I had written for Harper's\nRound Table so many years ago.\"\n\nDEWOLF HOPPER, celebrated operatic artist and comedian:--\"Apart from the\nsplendid history of the evolution of the game, it perpetuates the\nmemories of the many men who so gloriously sustained it. It should be\nread by every lover of the sport.\"\n\nHUGH NICOL, Director of Athletics, Purdue University, Lafayette,\nInd.:--\"No one that has read this book has appreciated it more than I.\nEver since I have been big enough, I have been in professional base\nball, and you can imagine how interesting the book is to me.\"\n\nMRS. BRITTON, owner of the St. Louis Nationals, through her treasurer,\nH.D. Seekamp, writes:--\"Mrs. Britton has been very much interested in\nthe volume and has read with pleasure a number of chapters, gaining\nvaluable information as to the history of the game.\"\n\nREV. CHARLES H. PARKHURST, D.D., New York:--\"Although I am not very much\nof a'sport,' I nevertheless believe in sports, and just at the present\ntime in base ball particularly. Perhaps if all the Giants had an\nopportunity to read the volume before the recent game (with the\nAthletics) they might not have been so grievously outdone.\"\n\nBRUCE CARTWRIGHT, son of Alexander J.

FROST, San Diego, Calif.:--\"You and 'Jim' White, George\nWright, Barnes, McVey, O'Rourke, etc., were little gods to us back there\nin Boston in those days of '74 and '75, and I recall how indignant we\nwere when you 'threw us down' for the Chicago contract.

GULICK, Russell Sage Foundation:--\"Mr. Spalding has been\nthe largest factor in guiding the development of the game and thus\ndeserves to rank with other great men of the country who have\ncontributed to its success.

Price 10\ncents.\n\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n\nIn preparing this issue of SPALDING'S OFFICIAL BASE BALL GUIDE for the\nseason of 1913, it has occurred to the Editor that the season of 1912,\nand the period which followed its completion, have been filled, with a\ngreat deal of unusual and uncommon vicissitude.\n\nIn the first place the personnel of the National League, the oldest Base\nBall organization in the world, has been greatly changed by reason of\ndeath and purchase of one franchise. New owners have brought new faces\ninto the game, and when the National League starts on this year's\ncampaign there will be some younger but equally as ambitious men at the\nheads of some of the clubs.\n\nThe players have effected an organization. That, too, is an incident of\ninterest, for it is well within the memory of the Base Ball \"fans\" of\nthis day what happened when another organization was perfected in the\npast. For this organization it may be said that the members promise that\nit will be their object to bring about better deportment on the part of\ntheir own associates and that they will work their best for the\nadvancement of Base Ball from a professional standpoint. If they do this\nthey will be of benefit to the sport. If they work from selfish motives\nit is inevitable that eventually there will be a clash, as there was in\nthe past.\n\nThe last world's series which was played was the greatest special series\nof games which has been played in the history of the national pastime.\nThere may have been single games and there may have been series which\nhave attracted their full measure of interest from the Base Ball \"fans,\"\nbut there never has been a special series so filled with thrills and\nexcitement as that between the New York and Boston clubs. The GUIDE this\nyear enters into the subject thoroughly with photographs and a story of\nthe games and feels that the readers will enjoy the account of the\ncontests.\n\nSome innovations have been attempted in this number of the GUIDE which\nshould interest Base Ball readers. Attention is called to the symposium\nby prominent Base Ball writers which brings up a subject of interest in\nregard to future world's series. There are other special articles,\nincluding something about the Base Ball writers of the South, who have\ndecided to organize a chapter of their own.\n\nThe year 1912 was one of progress and advancement on the part of Base\nBall throughout the world. To-day it not only is stronger than ever as\nAmerica's national game but it is making fast progress in other\ncountries because of the attractiveness of the pastime.\n\nThe Editor of the GUIDE wishes its thousands of readers an even more\nenjoyable Base Ball year in 1913 than they had in 1912. This publication\nis now one of worldwide circulation, and carries the gospel of Base\nBall, not only across the Atlantic ocean, but across the Pacific ocean\nas well. One of these days it may be its province to report a series for\nthe international championship, and then Base Ball will have become the\nuniversal game of the world, a place toward which it is rapidly tending.\n\nTHE EDITOR.\n\n\n\n\nEDITORIAL COMMENT\n\nBY JOHN B. FOSTER.\n\n\nPROGRESS OF AMERICA'S NATIONAL GAME\n\nTwo more nations have been conquered by the national game of the United\nStates; a whole race has succumbed to the fascinations of the greatest\nof all outdoor sports. Both France and Sweden have announced their\nintention of organizing Base Ball leagues. That of Sweden is well under\nway. Indeed, they have a club in Stockholm and there are more to follow,\nwhile the French, who have gradually been awakening to the joys of\nathletic pastime in which they have hitherto chosen to participate in\nother ways, hope to have a new league by the expiration of the present\nsummer.\n\nThere is no doubt as to their intention to play Base Ball. They are\nmaking efforts to procure suitable players from the United States to\ncoach them and the French promoters of the sport are determined that\ntheir young men shall be given every opportunity to take advantage of\nthe game of which they have heard so much, and have seen so little.\n\nLast year in the GUIDE it was the pleasure of the editor to call\nattention to the fact that the Japanese had so thoroughly grasped Base\nBall that they were bent on some day playing an American team for the\ninternational championship. It is not probable that such a series will\ntake place within the next five years, but not improbable that it will\ntake place within the next decade. When the Japanese learn to bat\nbetter, and with more effect, they will become more dangerous rivals to\nthe peace of mind of the American players. They have grasped the general\ntheory of the game amazingly well, and they field well, but they have\nyet to develop some of those good old fashioned \"clean up\" hitters in\nwhich the \"fans\" of the United States revel.\n\nThis season it comes to the attention of the editor of the GUIDE that\nmore progress has been made in China in regard to Base Ball than in any\nfifty years preceding. True, there was not much Base Ball in the fifty\nyears preceding, but now there is. There is a league at Hong Kong. There\nare Base Ball teams at Shanghai and other cities.\n\nDr. Eliot, former president of Harvard, who recently returned from a\ntrip around the world, holds that Base Ball has done more to humanize\nand civilize the Chinese than any influence which has been introduced by\nforeigners, basing his statement on the fact that the introduction of\nthe sport among the younger Chinese has exerted a tremendous restraint\nupon their gambling propensities.\n\nIt is a rather queer fact that where the civilizations are older in the\ncountries of the Occident there is a greater tendency to gamble,\nespecially among the young, than there is in the newer America.\nDoubtless this is largely due to the lack of athletic pastime. The young\nof those countries know little or nothing about simple amusements which\nare so popular in the United States, and acquire from their elders their\nknowledge of betting and taking part in games of chance, two evils which\nunquestionably have done much to degrade the race as a whole.\n\nBase Ball has caught the fancy of the younger generation and the boys.\nOnce they get a ball and a bat in their hands they are better satisfied\nwith them than with all the gambling devices which have been bequeathed\nto them by a long and eminent line of forefathers.\n\nSo it would appear that the introduction of the national game of the\nUnited States into China is likely to exert a humanizing influence which\nshall go further than legislation or sword, and if only the missionaries\nhad grasped earlier the wishes and the tendency of the younger element\nof the Chinese population, the country might be further along than it is\nwith its progressive movement.\n\nIn the Philippine Islands the younger generation simply has gone wild\nover Base Ball. Progress has been noted in the GUIDE from time to time\nof the increase of interest but it is now at such a pitch that the boys\nof the islands, wherever Base Ball has been introduced, simply have\ndeserted everything for it. They will play nothing else. The cockfights\nand the gambling games, which were also a part of the amusement of the\nyounger men, have been given up. The little fellows who wear not much\nmore than a breechclout play Base Ball. They have picked up many of the\nAmerican terms and one of the most amusing of experiences is to stand\noutside the walls of old Manila and hear the little brown boys call:\n\"Shoot it over. Line it out,\" and the like, returning to their native\nlanguage, and jabbering excitedly in Filipino whenever they arrive at\nsome point of play in which their command of English fails them.\n\nTwenty years from now a league including cities of the Philippines,\nChina and Japan, is by no means out of the question, and it may be that\nthe introduction of Base Ball into all three countries will result in a\nbetter understanding between the peoples and perhaps bring all three\nraces to a better frame of mind as relates to their personal ambitions\nand rivalries.\n\nIn connection with the widespread influence which Base Ball is having on\nboth sides of the world, on the shores of the Pacific Ocean and on those\nof the Atlantic Ocean the editor would like to call attention to the\ntheory which has been advanced by Mr. A.G. Spalding, the founder of the\nGUIDE, as to the efficacy of Base Ball for the purpose of training\nathletes, that has a worldwide application.\n\nMr. Spalding contends that Base Ball has lent no small assistance to the\nathletes of the United States in helping them to win premier honors at\nthe Olympic Games since their reintroduction. Mr. Spalding was the first\nAmerican Commissioner to the Olympic Games appointed to that post, the\nhonor being conferred upon him in 1900, when the late President McKinley\ngave him his commission to represent the United States at Paris in 1900.\nMr. Spalding, with his analytical mind has reasoned out a theory which\nis undoubtedly of great accuracy, and which is further corroborated by\nan interview given out in London--strangely enough on the same day that\nMr. Spalding gave utterance to his ideas in Los Angeles--by Mr. J.E.\nSullivan, American Commissioner to the Olympic Games at Stockholm last\nyear, while returning to the United States after witnessing the triumphs\nof the Americans. Mr. Spalding said:\n\n\"I cannot say that I am at all surprised at the result at Stockholm.\nHistory has been repeating itself in this way ever since the celebration\nof the Olympic games was inaugurated at Athens. America won the victory\nthere in 1896; she triumphed again at Paris in 1900; our athletes\ndefeated the contestants at St. Louis in 1904; the victory was ours at\nLondon in 1908, and it was a foregone conclusion that we would win at\nStockholm.\n\n\"But there is food for thought in this uninterrupted succession of\ntriumphs. Why do our athletes always win? All other things being equal,\nthe contestants in the country holding the event should naturally come\nto the front. Their numbers are always greater than those from any other\ncountry and the home grounds influence is strong. However, that\nadvantage has not in any case prevented American success.\n\n\"Therefore there must be a cause. What is it? Measured by scale and\ntape, our athlete's are not so much superior as a class. The theory of\n'more beef' must be discarded. We may not lay claim to having all the\nbest trainers of the world. We must look to some other source for\nAmerican prowess.\n\n\"I may be a prejudiced judge, but I believe the whole secret of these\ncontinued successes is to be found to the kind of training that comes\nwith the playing of America's national game, and our competitors in\nother lands may never hope to reach the standard of American athletes\nuntil they learn this lesson and adopt our pastime.\n\n\"The question, 'When should the training of a child begin?' has been\nwisely answered by the statement that it should antedate his birth. The\ntraining of Base Ball may not go back quite that far, but it approaches\nthe time as nearly as practicable, for America starts training of future\nOlympian winners very early in life. Youngsters not yet big enough to\nattend school begin quickening their eyesight and sharpening their wits\nand strengthening their hands and arms and legs by playing on base ball\nfields ready at hand in the meadows of farms, the commons of villages\nand the parks of cities all over the land. Base ball combines running,\njumping, throwing and everything that constitutes the athletic events of\nthe Olympian games. But above all, it imparts to the player that degree\nof confidence in competition, that indefinable something that enables\none athlete to win over another who may be his physical equal but who is\nlacking the American spirit begotten of base ball.\n\n\"An analysis of the 1912 Olympian games shows that the American showed\nto best advantage in contests where the stress of competition was\nhardest. In the dashes they were supreme; in the hurdles they were in a\nclass by themselves, and in the high jump and pole vault there was no\none worthy of their steel. Whenever quick thinking and acting was\nrequired, an American was in front. Does not this fact prove that the\nAmerican game of base ball enables the player to determine in the\nfraction of a second what to do to defeat his contestant?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWHAT A SEASON OF BASE BALL COSTS\n\nIt may not be out of place to say a few words in regard to the greatly\nincreased cost of Base Ball. There are some sensational writers whose\nhobby is to inform the public about the great receipts in Base Ball.\nUsually they exaggerate from twenty-five to thirty-five per cent.\n\nNow as to the expense of Base Ball. Figures at an approximate for the\nNational League will be offered. Railroad expenses for mileage alone\n$300,000, including spring training trips. Hotel bills $65,000. Sleeping\ncars and meals en route, $80,000. Salaries to players, $480,000. Total,\n$875,000. Add to this $30,000 for the salaries of umpires and their\ntraveling expenses. That makes $905,000.\n\nNow not a penny has been appropriated thus far for the salaries of the\npresident of the National League, the secretary and expenditures of the\noffice nor for the salaries of the business departments of the various\nclubs, nor for ground rents, taxes and a dozen and one other things, to\nsay nothing of that well-known old item \"wear and tear.\"\n\nThe receipts of Base Ball barely cover these expenditures. The alleged\nprofits of Base Ball mostly are fanciful dreams of those who know\nnothing of the practical side of the sport and are stunned when they are\nmade acquainted with the real financial problems which confront club\nowners.\n\nBut the money that is contributed to the support of the game almost\nimmediately finds its way back into public channels. Less than thirty\nper cent. of Base Ball clubs realize what a business man would call a\nfair return on the amount invested.\n\nA well-known writer on economic topics interviewed owners of Base Ball\nclubs as to their income and outgo. One of the best known of the\nNational League men took the writer into his office and spread the cash\nbook of the club's business before him.\n\n\"You may go through it if you wish,\" said the owner, \"but here is the\nbalance for the last day of the year.\"\n\nIt read as follows: Receipts, $250,505; expenditures, $246,447.\n\n\"That's answer enough for me,\" said the writer. \"I am through with any\nmore essays on the affluence of Base Ball'magnates.' I think it would\nbe better to extend them the hand of charity than the mailed fist.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTHE NEW ORGANIZATION OF PLAYERS\n\nThe formation of an organization on the part of the major league ball\nplayers during the closing days of the season of 1912 was looked upon\nwith some misgivings by those who remember only too well what happened\nwhen a prior organization of ball players was formed.\n\nIn the present instance those foremost in perfecting the organization\nhave also been foremost in asserting that the players' organization's\nprincipal aim is to co-operate with the club owners.\n\nIf this object is followed with fidelity and to its ultimate conclusion\nthere is no necessity to fear any grave disturbances, but there is a\ndread--that dread which is the fear of the child that has had its hands\nburned by the flame, that a selfish coterie of players might obtain\ncontrol of the organization, set up a policy of unscrupulous defiance\nand destructive opposition and <DW44> for a moment the higher\ndevelopment of the game.\n\nThere is no organization, either of unscrupulous Base Ball players or\nunscrupulous club owners, which will ever find it possible to destroy\norganized Base Ball. The results that organized Base Ball have brought\nabout will never be annihilated although grave injury could be\ntemporarily wrought by a force defiant to tie unusual demands made by\nthe sport to perpetuate itself successfully.\n\nIt is simply out of the question to control Base Ball as one would\ncontrol the affairs of a department store. Base Ball has its commercial\nside, but its commercial side cannot maintain it with success. There\nmust be a predominant factor based upon the encouragement that brings\nforth admiration for a high class sport. This factor can only be\nfostered by the ability to maintain not one, but a group of high class\nteams.\n\nAny ball player imbued with the idea that the \"stars\" should be grouped\ntogether in the city best able to pay the highest salaries simply is an\nenemy to his career and to those of his fellow players.\n\nWithout some handicap to assist in the equalizing of the strength of\nBase Ball nines of the professional leagues there will be no prosperity\nfor the leagues or the clubs individually. No better evidence may be\ncited to prove this than the fact, repeatedly demonstrated that in the\nsmaller leagues Base Ball enthusiasts in the city best able to pay the\nlargest salaries frequently withdraw their support of the team because\n\"it wins all the time.\"\n\nTo-day Base Ball, in its professional atmosphere, is nearer an ideal\nsport, a better managed sport, and a more fairly and equitably adjusted\nsport, than it ever has been, which is manifest proof of its superior\nevolution. Had results been otherwise it would have retrograded and\npossibly passed out of existence. Carefully comparing its management\nwith that of all other sports in history the Editor of the GUIDE\nbelieves that it is the best managed sport in the world.\n\nIt is true that improvements can be made. It is evident that there are\nstill commercialized owners not over capitalized with a spirit of sport.\nIt is undeniable that there are ball players not imbued with a high tone\nof the obligations, which they owe to their employers and to the public,\nbut it is as certain as the existence of the game that progress has been\nmade, and that it has not ceased to move forward.\n\nFor that reason players and owners must be guided by a sense of lofty\nideals and not be led astray by foolish outbursts over trivial\ndifferences of opinion, easily to be adjusted by the exercise of a\nlittle common sense.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBASE BALL PLAYED IN SWEDEN\n\nIn connection with the subject of \"Base Ball For All the World,\" for\nwhich the GUIDE expounds and spreads the gospel, the Editor would submit\na very interesting letter received by him from Sweden. it reads as\nfollows:\n\nWesteras, Sweden, Sept. 14, 1912.\n\nTo the Editor of the GUIDE:\n\nWe hereby have the pleasure of sending you two copies of the rules,\ntranslated and issued by the Westeras Base Ball Club, into Swedish from\nthe Spalding Base Ball Guide.\n\nThe work of getting the book out has been somewhat slow on account of\nthat the work of translating, proofreading, etc., all had to be done on\nour spare time, but it is done now, and I think we have succeeded pretty\nwell, everything considered. The books will be distributed by a\nwell-known book firm, Bjork & Boyeson, Stockholm, and will soon be\navailable in all the bookstores in Sweden.\n\nWe got some advance copies out just in time for the Olympic Games, and I\nhad the pleasure of presenting some copies to Commissioner Col.\nThompson, Manager Halpin and others of the American Olympic Committee.\n\nAs you know, so did we have a game of Base Ball at Stockholm with one of\nthe Finland teams, and as it may be of some interest to you to know the\npreliminaries to the game, I am writing to relate how it happened.\n\nIn trying to arrange for some amusements in the evenings at the Stadium,\nthe Olympic Committee wrote us if we would be willing to take part in a\ngame of Base Ball at Stadium some evening during the Stadium week. As\nour club this year was in poor condition, on account of some of our best\nplayers being out on military duties, we hesitated at first, but then\ndecided to risk it, knowing very well that whoever we would play\nagainst, they would not rub in to us too hard. We pointed out to the\nOlympic Committee that it would not be very hard to get a team of Base\nBall players picked out from the American athletes taking part in the\ncontests, but as they would not be prepared for Base Ball, suits and\nother needed articles had to be provided for. We were then told to get\nnecessary things ordered, and so we did. We ordered suits from a tailor\nin this town, after a pattern that I got from Spalding's this spring.\nThe suits were of gray flannel, with blue trimmings for our team and red\ntrimmings for the American. I also ordered bats and gloves, and with the\nthings our club already had, we were very well equipped.\n\nThe Olympic Committee, Stockholm, then received a letter from the\nOlympic Committee, New York, saying that if a game of Base Ball could be\narranged for during the Olympian Games, they would bring two teams along\non the Finland. The Olympic Committee cabled to come along, and sent us\na copy of Mr. Sullivan's letter. I knew, of course, that if the game\ncould be played by two American teams, it would be a much better game\nthan if our team took part, and told the Olympic Committee, and wanted\nto withdraw, but as they did not know for sure how it would be, told us\nto go ahead with the arrangements just the same, and so we did, and by\nthe time the Finland arrived, everything had been arranged for.\n\nThe Olympic Committee has selected the evening, 7 P.M., of the 10th of\nJuly, for the game, and thought that this would be suitable to the\nAmericans, but as some of the players had to take part in the contests,\nMr. Halpin would not risk them then, so it was finally decided that a\ngame should be played the 15th, the Americans to play six innings\nbetween themselves and then six innings against us.\n\nWell, we had a game at the training grounds. We played six innings, and\nMr. Halpin was kind enough to let us have a pitcher and catcher from his\nmen. The score was 9 to 3, and it could just as well been 9 to 0,\nperhaps. Well, at any rate, it was the first Base Ball game, as far as I\nknow, that ever took place in Europe between an American team and a\nEuropean team, with England possibly excepted.\n\nMr. Halpin said that the Americans were going to play a game the next\nmorning between themselves, but that game did not come off. There was\nprobably no time for it, as the Finland left Stockholm the same day.\nVery likely the American boys were somewhat disappointed in not being\nable to play between themselves, as anticipated, and perhaps I should\nnot have pushed our game ahead, but as long as there was a Base Ball\nteam in Sweden, it would have been strange if it had not played, and it\ngave our boys a chance to see how the game should be played, and they\ncertainly did take it in. Had the game been played as it was intended\nand advertised, on the 10th in the Stadium, there would very likely have\nbeen a bigger crowd present, and the game would also have been more\ntalked about in the papers, but then we will have to be satisfied as it\nis.\n\nOur club has been practicing all summer, twice a week, and on the 24th\nof August we gave an exhibition game here at Westeras, between two teams\nfrom our club, the suits made for the Olympic Games coming in very\nhandy. I send you herewith a clipping from a local paper describing the\ngame, and also a picture of the two teams with myself and the umpire\nincluded.\n\nAt our game here we distributed the \"Description of Base Ball,\" written\nby you and translated into Swedish, and it came of good use. Next year\nwe intend to have our teams appear in the nearby cities around here, so\nas to give people a chance to see the game, and it will not be long\nbefore they will start it in Stockholm, so I think the game is bound to\nbe popular here also,\n\nMr. George Wright, of Boston, was the umpire at the Stockholm games, and\nas he was very kind to us, we would like to send him the picture of the\nclub, and hope that you will forward us his address.\n\nI am, for Westeras Base Ball Club,\n\nYours truly,\n\nEDWIN JOHNSON,\n\nElectrical Engineer.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTHE NEW NATIONAL AGREEMENT\n\nUnlimited satisfaction must be had by all who are connected with Base\nBall over the greatly improved conditions by which the season of 1913 is\nbegun under the new National Agreement. While it perhaps might be\nexaggerated boastfulness to affirm that Base Ball, as a professionally\norganized sport, has attained perfection, it is not out of reason--\nindeed, quite within reason--to observe that Base Ball never had such a\nwell balanced and perfect organization as that by which it is regulated\nat the present time.\n\nThe principal fact of congratulation lies in the safeguards and\nprovisions which have been thrown around the players of the minor\nleagues and in the equitable and just measures which have been agreed\nupon to provide for their future.\n\nAs a general rule it may be taken for granted that the players of the\nmajor leagues can take care of themselves. That is to say, their\npositions, if they are expert in their calling, and conscientious in\ntheir deportment, really take care of them.\n\nNo club owner, unless he is maliciously or foolishly inclined, will\njeopardize the interests of his team by acting in a wilfully unjust\nmanner toward a player who is cheerfully and uprightly offering his\nservices. We may hear of occasional exceptions to this condition of\nthings, but if these occasional exceptions chance to arise, it is\ninevitably certain that the owner in the long run will suffer to a\ngreater degree than the player with whom he deals unfairly.\n\nIt is the history of Base Ball that more inequitable treatment has\narisen by fifty per cent in the minor leagues than has had its origin in\nthe major leagues. The reason for this existed almost wholly in the\ninability of Base Ball as a whole to bring the minor league owners to a\nrealization of the injury that they might be doing and to extend such\npunishment and insist upon such regulation as were necessary to change\nthis undesirable condition.\n\nBy the organization of the National Association of Base Ball clubs the\nminor leagues, for the first time in their history, placed themselves in\na position where they could demand proper enforcement of regulations for\nthe government of the sport, and by their alliance with the major league\nclubs, under the articles of the National Agreement, a general working\nbasis was effected whereby compliance with rules could be insisted upon.\n\nThe result of this admirable condition of affairs is that wisdom and\nequity now rule where there once existed chaos and at times something\nakin to anarchy in sport.\n\nAt no time in the history of the game, which is so dear to the hearts of\nthe American people, has the general legislative and executive body been\nso well equipped by the adoption of pertinent and virile laws to insist\nupon justice to all concerned as at the present moment.\n\nThe new National Agreement is an improvement upon the old and the old\nwas a long, long step in advance of anything which had preceded it. The\nmere fact that club owners and leagues were so willing to adopt a system\nbetter than its predecessor wholly confutes the absurd assertions of the\nradical element that there is no consideration shown for the player.\n\nTo the contrary, every consideration has been shown to the player, but\nthe latter must not confound with the consideration shown to him the\nidea that his interests are the only interests at stake in Base Ball.\nThe man who is willing to furnish the sinews of war has as good standing\nin court as the player who furnishes the base hits and the phenomenal\ncatches.\n\nSo perfect is the system which is being attempted to be set in force by\nthe new National Agreement that the young man who now essays to play\nprofessional Base Ball may be assured of steady advancement in this\nprofession and a generally improving condition if he will be as honest\nby his employer as he expects his employer to be honest by him.\n\nThe graduated system of assisting players, step by step, from the least\nimportant leagues to the most important is the most perfect plan of its\nkind that has ever been devised. There may be flaws in it, but if there\nare they will be remedied, and if modifications are necessary to make it\nmore perfect there is no doubt that such modifications will be agreed\nupon.\n\nAs proof of what the new National Agreement may do, although it has\nbarely had time to be considered, the editor of the GUIDE would submit\nthe following for consideration:\n\nEver since the National Agreement was organized the members have always\nstriven to aid the players in their efforts to gain the top rank in the\ngreat national game. They have had a hard proposition in handling all of\nthe cases that have been brought to their attention, but their decisions\nin all cases were absolutely fair and impartial. Then the matter of the\nnew agreement occasioned many hours of laborious work on the part of the\nmembers of the Commission, and when the instrument was finally announced\nit meant that all of the parties to such an agreement were satisfied and\nthat there could be no improvement. There was one detail that covered a\nwide field, and that was in the matter of players; drafted by the two\nbig leagues and later sent back to the minors. Under the old National\nAgreement it was possible to pick up a player by means of the annual\ndraft from one of the Class C leagues and just before the opening of the\nseason send him back to the club from whence he came without ever having\ngiven him a chance to land with a club in some higher organization.\n\nRealizing that such players were not given a chance to advance in the\nBase Ball profession, this matter was thoroughly thrashed out and the\nnew ruling under which all of the National Agreement clubs operate was\nadopted. Now it is possible for a player in any of the smaller leagues\nto be drafted by a major league club, and when the latter party does not\ncare to retain possession of such a player he is first offered to the\nClass AA clubs. All of these clubs must waive on him before he can be\ndropped farther down in the list, and if such should be the case he\nwould then be offered to the Class A clubs. In that way the player,\nalthough he is not fast enough to remain in the two major leagues, is\nalways given a chance to advance, for if any of the clubs in those\nclasses higher than that from which he came had grabbed him he was bound\nto receive an increase in salary. That meant that he had his chance to\nadvance, and that was the sole purpose of the National Agreement in\ndrafting such a rule.\n\nDuring the past drafting season there were sixty-nine players drafted by\nthe two major league clubs, and of that number twenty-seven have already\nbeen sent back to the minor leagues. The Class AA and A clubs claimed\nall of these twenty-seven, and it is more than likely that there will\nalso be many more who will be given trials by the big league clubs\nduring the spring training season and who may later be turned back to\nthe minors. Of the twenty-seven players thus far sent back seventeen of\nthem advanced in their profession, a tribute to the sagacity, wisdom and\nimpartiality of the members of the National Commission. The decision, as\nannounced by Chairman Herrmann of the National Commission pertaining to\nthis return of drafted players, is as follows:\n\n------------|-----------------|----------|-----------|--------------\n   Clubs.   |   League.       | Players. |  Drafted  |  Drafted By\n            |                 |          |   From    |\n------------|-----------------|----------|-----------|--------------\nLouisville  |American Asso.   |Stansbury |Louisville |St. Louis N.L.\nChattanooga |Southern Asso.   |Balenti   |Chattanooga|St. Louis A.L.\nSacramento  |Pacific Coast    |Berghammer|Lincoln    |Chicago N.L.\nSacramento  |Pacific Coast    |Orr       |Sacramento |Phila.

The\ncontention was that playing off a tie game on the ground where the game\nhad been scheduled might work some inconvenience to \"fans\" and result in\nan inequitable allotment of dates, simply to conform to custom.\n\nIt was asserted that the importance of the series demanded that it be a\nhome-and-home affair, dates to alternate regularly, regardless of all\nties or drawn games. To obtain opinion that is sound and practical the\nEditor of the GUIDE sent forth the following letter:\n\n\nNEW YORK, January 31, 1913.\n\nDuring the recent world's series it so happened that a tie was played in\none of the cities, which compelled both teams to remain in that city for\nanother date. Before the series was over this arrangement resulted in\none club having five games on its home grounds and the other club having\nbut three games on its home grounds.\n\nIt has seemed to some that it is unjust. It is also contended that it is\nunfair to the patrons of the game to schedule a contest and then not\nplay in the city specified after some had traveled many miles to see it.\n\nWill you please give the GUIDE your opinion as to whether a change would\nbe advisable?\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nJOHN B. FOSTER,\n_Editor Spalding's Official Base Ball Guide._\n\n\nAnswers were received to the request for a \"symposium of opinion\" as\nfollows:\n\n\n\"So far as having any effect on the chances of the two teams is\nconcerned, I don't think having to play more games on one ground than on\nthe other makes any material difference. Where cities are sufficiently\nnear each other for games to be alternated daily, it would perhaps be\nfairer to spectators to do so, irrespective of ties; yet it seems to me\nthat a tie on one grounds should be played off the next day in the same\ncity.\"\n\nW.B. HANNA,\n_New York Sun._\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"In my opinion the arrangement on tie games in the post-season contests\nis a poor one. I saw the result of it in the series between the Cubs and\nWhite Sox last fall. Two tie games were played and the confusion and\ninconvenience it caused the fans was deplorable. It is unjust to the\nfollowers who support Base Ball. It is also unjust, in a small way, to\nthe club which has to play two or more games on its opponent's field.\nPlayers when away from their home grounds, in a fall series, are more or\nless under a nervous strain. If there was confusion, inconvenience and\ndifficulty in a local series as a result of a tie game, the folly of the\narrangement must appear more absurd when towns like New York and Boston\nare involved.

A condition which allows five games to be played in one city\nand only three in another is scarcely fair to the two teams.

There are times when they apparently work\na hardship to one team or the followers of one club, but, after all,\nthey help to throw the necessary safeguards around the contests. As for\nthe argument for not playing off a tie game on the same grounds, thus\ndisarranging the dates and inconveniencing the fans, patrons of the\nworld's series games are accustomed to this, since bad weather\nfrequently cuts into the event and causes postponements.\n\n\"In a way it does not appear fair that one club should have the\nprivilege of playing five games at home to three games at home for its\nopponents. The rule of playing off a tie game on the same grounds is a\nfixture in Base Ball. As to the other game, this was a question of the\nluck of the toss of the coin.\n\n\"The fans have to trust to luck as to the number of games they will see\nin a world's series, this depending upon the number of games played and\npossibly upon the toss for a seventh battle. In 1905 the fans of\nPhiladelphia saw only two games in a world's series with New York. In\n1910 only two games were played here in the series with Chicago.\n\n\"Any time a club has three games on its own grounds in a series where\nfour victories decide the issue either it or its followers have not much\nchance to raise an objection.\"\n\nWILLIAM G. WEART,\n_The Evening Telegraph._\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"It was, of course, to the disadvantage of the Giants to be obliged to\nplay five of the eight games in the post-season series last fall on the\ngrounds of their opponents, but this came as a result of one tie game on\nthe Boston grounds and being outlucked on the toss to determine where\nthe deciding game should be played. This tie game unquestionably caused\nmuch inconvenience to patrons because of the change in the schedule made\nnecessary because of it.\n\n\"It is not clear to me, however, just now these things can be remedied\nwithout disturbing the balance of an even break for both teams more\nviolently than was the case last fall.\n\n\"I do not believe there will be another series just like the one of\n1912, and so, in my opinion, an immediate change in the conditions\ngoverning these series would not be advisable. It is not clear to me\njust what changes could be made. One club or the other is bound to have\nthe advantage of an extra game on its own grounds, providing seven games\nare necessary. The championship in nine out of ten contests will be\ndecided in seven games or less.\n\n\"Then, as to having the games played according to an arbitrarily fixed\nschedule, so as not to inconvenience patrons--that would be out of the\nquestion, being open to the objection that it would then be possible to\nhave every game that figures in the result of the series played on the\nhome grounds of one of the contestants. For instance, tie games or\nunfavorable weather which would prevent a game being played in one city,\nwould throw all the games to the other city where there might be no tie\ngames nor unfavorable weather. That would mean four straight, if it so\nhappened that the home team won the games, and the loser would never\nhave gotten action on its own grounds. That would be considerably worse\nthan five to three.\n\n\"So it looks to me as if the patrons would have to take their chances in\nthe future as they have in the past.\"\n\nJAMES C. O'LEABT,\n_Boston Globe._\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"It seems to me that it would be better to alternate (in case of a tie),\nas a team able to tie its opponent on a hostile field would be entitled\nto consideration for this performance. I am very certain, however, that\nthe players of both clubs in the recent world's series were satisfied\nwith an arrangement which minimized the amount of traveling they were\ncalled upon to do.\n\n\"Persons who had seen a five-inning tie game terminated by rain would\nhardly be satisfied. It seems to me that the rule as to alternating ball\nparks should be applied strictly, but only in case the tie game involved\nwent nine innings or more.\"\n\nFRANCIS EATON,\n_Sports Editor Boston Journal._\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"To me the feasible thing to do appears to be to insert a clause in\nstipulations covering all short series of a special character, such as\nintercity, inter-league and world's series, making it compulsory for the\nteams to alternate between the cities or grounds of the competing\nclubs.\"\n\nPURVES T. KNOX,\n_New York Evening Telegram._\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Why wouldn't it be a good scheme to toss up for the deciding game only\nin cases where an equal number of games had been played in each city,\nand, in cases where one city had seen more games than the other, to play\nthe deciding game in the city which had seen the fewer games?\n\n\"I do not believe it advisable to change the commission's rule regarding\npostponed games. The rule now provides that, in case of a postponement,\nthe clubs shall remain in the city in which the game was scheduled until\nit is possible to play. If this rule were changed and there happened to\nbe a week of bad weather, as in 1911, the teams and many fans might be\nforced to travel back and forth from one town to another for a week\nwithout participating in or seeing a single game; and it might happen\nsome time that the jump would be between St. Louis and Boston.\"\n\nR. W. LARDNER,\n_Chicago Examiner._\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"A change in the rule governing the playing-off of tie games in the\nworld's series should be made. The teams ought to appear in each city on\nthe dates named in the schedule drawn up before the series starts,\nunless the weather interferes.\"\n\nWILLIAM H. WRIGHT,\n_New York Tribune._\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Drawn games are as unavoidable as rainy days in world's series, but not\nas frequent. They operate the same in their effect on the contest for\nthe world's pennant and in causing confusion among the patrons by\ndisarranging the schedule. It would be manifestly unjust if, after a\nrain postponement, the competing teams did not remain and play the game\noff before playing elsewhere. That might result in playing all of the\ngames in one city. Since drawn games are treated like postponed games in\nthe regular season, and are of infrequent occurrence in world's series,\nany other arrangement than the present does not seem advisable. The\npatrons, who should be considered always, would be among the first to\nobject if each team did not have an equal show to win. In the last\nseries only four games that counted were played in Boston and three in\nNew York and if New York had won the toss for the deciding game the\nsituation would have been reversed. It would be manifestly fairer to\nplay the seventh game if necessary in some neutral city.\"\n\nL. E. SANBORN,\n_Chicago Tribune._\n\n\n\n\nNEW FACES IN THE OLD LEAGUE\n\nBY JOHN B. FOSTER.\n\n\nNot for some time has there been such a turning over of the leaves of\nhistory in the National League as during 1912-13, and because of this\nthere are many new faces peering out of the album. There have also been\nchanges in the minor circuits and one prominent change in the American\nLeague.\n\nThe death of John T. Brush removed from Base Ball a dean of the National\nLeague. Wise in the lore of the game, a man more of the future than of\nthe present, as he always foresaw that which some of his contemporaries\nwere less alert in perceiving, it meant no easy task to be his\nsuccessor.\n\nPrior to the death of Mr. Brush there was a great deal of curious and\nsome idle speculation as to his ultimate successor in case of decease,\nor, in the event of his retirement because of bodily weariness. One or\ntwo went so far as to say that upon his death Andrew Freedman would\nreturn to prominence in Base Ball, because he was the real owner of the\nNew York club. Once and for all the writer would like to put the\npersonal stamp of absolute denial on the repeated statements made by\ncertain individuals in New York and Chicago that Andrew Freedman\nretained the control of the New York club after John T. Brush was\nreported to have purchased it.\n\nMr. Freedman retained nothing of the kind. Not that Mr. Brush objected\nto him as a partner, but when Mr. Brush purchased the stock he purchased\nthe control outright, although he did request Mr. Freedman to hold a few\nshares and not give up his personal interest in Base Ball, for Mr.\nFreedman had a great liking for the game in spite of his stormy career.\nThe assertions that Mr. Freedman was the real owner and Mr. Brush the\nnominal owner were made with malicious intent, of which the writer has\nproof, and through a desire, if possible, to combat the popularity and\nthe success of the Giants.\n\nThis digression has been made to call attention to the fact that while\nrumor was plentiful as to the future control of the Giants Mr. Brush was\ncarefully \"grooming\" a young man--his son-in-law, Mr. H. Hempstead--to\ntake his place.\n\nTo a few it was known that Mr. Hempstead was acquiring such experience\nand information as would be necessary to assume the control of an\nundertaking which has grown so big as the organization of the Giants in\nNew York. The business details of the club have quadrupled and the cares\nand anxieties of the man at the head have increased in proportion.\n\nThe Giants, as successful as they have been under the control of John T.\nBrush and John J. McGraw, the men who have been the executive heads in\nboth the business and the playing departments of the game, are as\nsusceptible to reverses as if they were the lowliest club in the\norganization. It is only by constant and severe application that the\nclub's affairs may be kept at the best pitch.\n\nMr. Hempstead brings to Base Ball the advantage of youth, a keen\nbusiness sagacity developed beyond his years, coolness, a disposition\nthat is sunny and not easily ruffled, and a reputation for unvarying\nfairness and the highest type of business and sport ideals. Quite a list\nof qualities, but they are there.\n\nIf characteristics of that description fail to maintain the high\nstandard of the New York club, then it will be due to the fact that our\nstandards of business deportment have turned topsy-turvy.\n\nWilliam H. Locke is the new president and part owner of the Philadelphia\nclub. He and Mr. Hempstead are the \"junior\" presidents of the league.\nThere is no necessity for the Editor of the GUIDE to enter into any long\nand fulsome praise as to William H. Locke.\n\nHis career speaks for itself and he speaks for himself. A young man of\nthe finest attributes, he has brought nothing to the mill of Base Ball\nto grind except that which was the finest and the cleanest grain.\n\nThe writer has known Mr. Locke almost, it seems, from boyhood and\nesteems him for his worth, not only as one who has administered the\naffairs of Base Ball with skill and intelligence, but as one who wrote\nof Base Ball with understanding and excellent taste, for it must not be\nforgotten that Mr. Locke is a newspaper graduate into the ranks of the\ngreat sport the affairs of which fill a little corner of the hearts of\nso many of America's citizens.\n\nPerhaps no young man ever left a newspaper office to become a Base Ball\npresident with more good wishes behind him than William H. Locke. He\nserved his apprenticeship as secretary of the Pittsburgh club and he\nserved it well. He is a high class, delightful young man, every inch of\nhim, and Philadelphia will soon become as proud of him as Pittsburgh is\nnow.\n\nStill another newspaper writer has been claimed from the desk by the\nNational League. He is Herman Nickerson, formerly sporting editor of the\nBoston Journal, who is now the secretary of the Boston National League\nclub.\n\n\"Nick\" is known from one end of the National League circuit to the other\nas one of the most solid and substantial of the writing force, and also\nas one of the most demure and modest. In addition to his great fund of\ninformation on Base Ball topics he is an author, and \"The Sword of\nBussy,\" a book which was published during the winter, is even more\nclever than some of the author's best Base Ball yarns, and that is\nsaying a great deal in behalf of a man wedded to Base Ball.\n\nAnother change in the National League was the selection of Frank M.\nStevens of New York, as one of the Board of Directors of the New York\nNational League club.\n\nThis brings into Base Ball one of New York's cleverest and brightest\nyoung business men, one who is forging so rapidly to the front in\nbusiness circles in the big metropolis that many an older head goes to\nhim for advice. Mr. Stevens knows a lot about Base Ball, which is of\neven greater importance in the game, and is not afraid to swing any\nventure that will put with fairness a championship team into the big\ncity. He is a son of Harry M. Stevens, whom everybody knows, rich and\npoor alike.\n\nIn the American League the death of Mr. Thomas D. Noyes, president of\nthe Washington club, a young man who left behind naught but friends,\nleft a vacancy in the organization which was filled by the selection of\nMr. Benjamin S. Minor.\n\nThe new president of the club has had practical experience in Base Ball\nand perhaps plenty of it, as almost everybody has had in Washington, but\nhe is a wideawake, progressive and ambitious man, who is of just the\ntype to keep Base Ball going, now that it has struck its gait in the\nnational capital, and the future of the sport looks all the brighter for\nhis connection with it.\n\n\n\n\nTHE UMPIRES\n\n\nThe umpires are always with us, and the umpire problem has been a\nvexation of Base Ball since the beginning of Base Ball time, yet neither\nthe umpires, the public, the club owners nor the league officials need\nbe discouraged, for it was fully proved in 1912 that umpiring, as a fine\nart, has advanced a step nearer perfection. We may well doubt that\nperfection in its every quality shall ever be achieved, but we may all\nfeel sanguine that it is possible to realize better results.\n\nIt is true that some men make better umpires than others, exactly as\nsome men make better ball players than others, but it is also true that\nif the men who find it the hardest task to become the most expert\numpires would be given a little more encouragement they might be a\nlittle more successful.\n\nTo the staff of umpires of the National League and the American League\nit is but fair to render a compliment for their work of last season.\nSome of them made mistakes but the general average of work on the part\nof the judges of play was excellent.\n\nThere was less tendency on the part of the umpires to render their\ndecisions without being in a position to follow the play correctly. They\nwere occasionally willing to concede that they might have been wrong\nwhen an analysis of the play was brought to their attention and they\nwere firm in asserting discipline without becoming overheated on their\nown account.\n\nTo the mind of the Editor of the GUIDE, in the general light of\nobservation, the most serious blunders committed by the umpires in 1912\nwere in making decisions before the play took place. This did happen and\nmore than once. To illustrate, by an example, the Editor of the GUIDE\nhad exhibited to him some photographs taken during 1912 in which a\nplayer had been \"waved out\" before he actually had arrived at the base.\nGranting the desire of the umpires to be alert and ready to render\ndecisions promptly, it is equally apparent that giving decisions in\nadvance of the completion of plays is likely to imbue the spectators\nwith an idea that the umpire is either partisan or incompetent.\n\nYoung umpires, in their haste to \"make good\" in the major leagues, are\napt to overdo rather than fail to be on time.\n\nWhile it is not a pleasant subject to discuss, it is a fact that some\numpires had been accustomed to use the very language to players on the\nfield that they were presumed in their official capacity as umpires to\ncorrect. The writer knows of instances where this took place.\n\nIt has ever been the policy of the GUIDE to stand for clean and high\nclass Base Ball. Twenty per cent. more women attend ball games now than\ndid ten years ago. Eighty per cent. more women spectators are likely to\nattend five years from now. To encourage their attendance every effort\nshould be made to eliminate all disgraceful conversation on the field.\nWherever it may be ascertained that an umpire has used profane or vulgar\nlanguage on the field the editor of the GUIDE believes that he should be\nfined and punished as sternly as an offending player.\n\nIt is contended that the position of the umpire has been rendered more\narduous by reason of the world's series. The argument is advanced that\nthe players are more intractable, by reason of their eagerness to play\nin the post-season games. That argument would be stronger were it not\nfor the fact that some of the worst disturbances emanate from the\nplayers of the clubs that have no chance to play in the world's series.\n\nAs a general rule two good reasons may be advanced for disputes on the\npart of players.\n\nFirst: Desire to \"cover up\" the player's own blunder.\n\nSecond: General \"cussedness.\"\n\nThere are players who make honest objection on the excitement of the\nmoment from sheer desire to win, but their lapses from Base Ball\netiquette are so few and far between that their transgressions usually\nmay be forgiven with some grace.\n\nThe Editor of the GUIDE would offer one suggestion to league presidents\nand umpires; it is this: whenever two possible plays occur in\nconjunction, instruct the chief umpire always to turn to the spectators\nand inform them which player is out.\n\nFor instance, if a player is at bat and another on the bases and two are\nout and an attempt is made to steal second, as the chief umpire calls\nthe batter out on strikes the public should be clearly informed that the\nbatter is out. If the play looks close at second base the crowd\nfrequently believes the runner has been called out and resents it\naccordingly. In line with the same play, when the runner is called out\nand the fourth ball at the same time is called on the batter, the chief\numpire should turn to the spectators and to the press box and make it\nclearly understood that the batter has been given a base on balls. It\nsaves a great deal of annoyance and fault finding.\n\nBy the way, although it has been said elsewhere, the Editor of the GUIDE\nwould beg the indulgence of repetition by stating that the work of the\numpires during the world's series of 1912 was one of the finest\nexhibitions of its kind ever seen on a ball field, and somehow it seemed\nas if the players, would they but deport themselves during all series as\nthey did during the world's series might find that there are more good\numpires in the world after all than bad ones.\n\n\n\n\nBASE BALL WRITERS OF THE SOUTH\n\n\nWhile the Base Ball writers of the cities which comprise the Southern\nAssociation have no organized membership similar to the Base Ball\nWriters' Association of the major leagues and the organizations which\nare best known as the class AA leagues, they are a clever, hard-working\ngroup of young men, who have labored in season and out of season, not\nonly to build up Base Ball but to build it up on the right lines.\n\nExperience of more than a quarter of a century has most abundantly\nproved that the standard of Base Ball has steadily been elevated. It\nneeds no compilation of fact nor any dogmatic assertion on the part of\nthe Editor of the GUIDE to attest that fact. It is a present condition\nwhich speaks for itself. The general tone of the players is far higher\nthan it was and there has come into evidence a marked improvement in the\nspirit of the men who own Base Ball clubs. In the earlier history of the\nsport there was a tendency to win by any means that did not actually\ncross the line of dishonesty. Later there came a season when the\ncommercial end of the game tended to encroach upon the limits of the\npastime. This has been repressed in the last two seasons and to-day the\nmorale of Base Ball is of a higher type than it ever has been in the\nhistory of the pastime.\n\nIt is a high class sport in the main, managed by high class, men for\nhigh class purposes.\n\nGoing through the early stages of building up a successful league,\nwhich, by the way, is the severest of all tasks, and even now at\nintervals confronted with changes in the league circuit, the Southern\nwriters have steadily been sowing the seeds of high class Base Ball and\nthey have seen results prior to this date, for Base Ball has become\npopular and has been handsomely and loyally supported in sections in\nwhich fifteen years ago it would have been considered impossible to\nachieve such results.\n\nIt is true that business reverses and adverse conditions have had at\ntimes their effect upon Base Ball in the South and possibly may produce\nsimilar results again, but the admirable offset to this fact is that\nnone of these conditions at any time has daunted the spirit and the\nresolution of the young men who have zealously been preaching the cause\nof clean and healthy Base Ball.\n\nVery likely to their zeal, their courage, their tact and their ability\nit is possible to ascribe the increase in good ball players which is\nmaking itself manifest in the South. More high class and attractive\nathletes are coming from the Southern states in these days than ever was\nthe case before. Base Ball is very glad to have them. When a\nrepresentative major league team is made up of players who represent\nevery section in the Union, engaged for their skill, it seems as if Base\nBall has become nearer an ideal and a national pastime than ever before\nin the history of the sport.\n\nTo the Southern writers the members of the Base Ball Writers Association\nand those of the organizations patterned on like lines send greeting.\n\n\n\n\nBASE BALL WORTH WHILE?\n\n\nOne of the foremost divines in the East who has a deep concern in Base\nBall and Base Ball players is Rev. Dr. Reisner, pastor of the Grace\nMethodist Episcopal Church, of New York City. Throughout the season he\nattends the games and is greatly interested in the work of the players.\nHe knows Base Ball well, and in addition to that he knows the\nenvironment of Base Ball players and their character and endeavor as\nwell as any person in the United States.\n\nIt is Dr. Reisner's custom each year to preach a sermon to the Base Ball\nplayers and their friends in his church in New York, and the building\nalways is filled to listen to his discourse. In view of the interest\nwhich he takes in the national game and because of his excellent\nknowledge as to the general details of the sport, the Editor of the\nGUIDE asked him to say a few words to the ball players of the United\nStates through the medium of this publication, and he has graciously\nconsented to do so in the following pithy and straightforward talks:\n\nBY THE REV. CHRISTIAN F. REISNER, NEW YORK.\n\nThe Bible is the Spalding book of rules for the game of life. James B.\nSullivan, beloved by all athletes, gave me these rules for athletes:\n\"Don't drink, use tobacco or dissipate. Go to bed early and eat\nwholesome food!\" The boozer gets out of the game as certainly as the\nbonehead.\n\nI have interviewed scores of the most noted players. Every one had a\nreligious training. Many are church members. All avoid old-time\ndrinking, as our fathers did smallpox.\n\nMathewson belongs to the high type now being generally duplicated. He is\na modern masculine Christian. Base Ball demands brains as well as brawn.\nMinds muddled by licentiousness and liquor are too \"leady\" for leaders.\nHotheadedness topples capable players.\n\nI am proud to style scores of Base Ball players, I know, as gentlemen.\nThey are optimists. Defect is unrecognized. Team work makes them\nbrotherly. Bickerings break a Baseballist. Every member of the team\ngives himself wholly to the game. Jeers are as harmless as cheers.\n\nEvery minute he does his best. He sleeps only at night. To do these\nthings the player must follow Bible rules. If he keeps it up life's\nsuccess is certain. Governor Tener and Senator Gorman proved it. No\nwonder \"Billy\" Sunday wrote me \"I would not take a million dollars for\nmy experience on the ball field.\"\n\nIt taught him how to knock the Devil out of the box.\n\nBase Ball is invaluable to America. It thrills and so rests tired\nnerves. It brings the \"shut-in\" man into God's healing out-o'-doors.\nWhile yelling he swallows great draughts of lung-expanding, purifying\nair and forgets the fear of \"taking cold.\"\n\nHe is pulled out of self-centeredness, while shouting for another. He\nstands crowd jostling good-naturedly or gets his cussedness squeezed\nout. He chums up with any one with easy comments and so gets out of his\nshell and melts again into a real human.\n\nBase Ball absolutely pulls the brain away from business. It emphasizes\nthe value of decency and gives healthy and high toned recreation to\nmillions. If kept clean its good-doing cannot be measured. Nothing is\nworth while that does not do that.\n\n\n\n\nTHE SPALDING BASE BALL HALL OF FAME\n\n\n(From Spalding's Official Base Ball Record.)\n\nNew faces enter into the Spalding Base Ball \"Hall of Fame\" this year.\nThe object of this \"Hall of Fame\" is not necessarily to portray the very\ntop men of each department of the national game, for it frequently\nhappens in these days, when players take part in only a few innings now\nand then, that they become entitled to mention in the records, although\nthey do not bear the real brunt of the work.\n\nIn the \"Hall of Fame\" will be found the men who might well be termed the\n\"regulars.\" Day in and day out they were on the diamond, or ready to\ntake their place on the diamond, if they were not injured.\n\nNATIONAL LEAGUE.\n\nFirst of all, Daubert has earned his place at first base for the season\nof 1912. Threatening in other years to become one of the group of\nleading players, he performed so well in the season past that there is\nno doubt as to his right.\n\nThere is a new player at second base. The regularity with which Egan of\nCincinnati performed for the Reds earned him a place as the banner\nsecond baseman.\n\nAt third base the honor goes to J.R. Lobert, the third baseman of the\nPhiladelphia club. In this particular instance Lobert was crowded, not\nfor efficiency, but in the number of games played by Byrne, third\nbaseman of Pittsburgh, and Herzog, third baseman of New York. In the\nmatter of chances undertaken on the field, Herzog surpassed both Lobert\nand Byrne, but, in justice to Lobert, the honor seems to be fairly\ndeserved by him.\n\nJohn H. Wagner, the brilliant veteran of the Pittsburgh club, fought his\nway to the position of shortstop in 1912. His fielding was better than\nthat of his rivals and at times he played the position as only a man of\nhis sterling worth can play.\n\nOwing to the fact that the able secretary of the National League, John\nA. Heydler, has compiled two methods of comparing pitchers, the \"Hall of\nFame\" in the National League this year will include two faces. They are\nthose of Hendrix of the Pittsburgh club and Tesreau of the New York\nclub. The former won the greater percentage of games under the old rule\nin vogue of allotting percentage upon victories. Tesreau, however, under\na new rule which classifies pitchers by earned runs, easily led the\nleague. The editor of the RECORD is very much inclined toward Mr.\nHeydler's earned run record; in fact, has suggested a record based upon\nthe construction of making every pitcher responsible for runs and\ncomputing his average upon the percentage of runs for which he is\nresponsible. That places Tesreau in the front row, with Mathewson\nsecond.\n\nThere are two catchers who run a close race for the \"Hall of Fame\" in\n1912. They are Meyers of New York and Gibson of Pittsburgh. Meyers\ncaught by far the larger number of games, and, basing the work of\ncatcher upon the average chances per game, seems to lead his Pittsburgh\nrival. Both men are sterling performers, and Meyers is an instance of\nthe greatest improvement on the part of a catcher of any member of the\nmajor leagues.\n\nFor the position of leading outfielder, all things considered, Carey of\nPittsburgh is selected for the \"Hall of Fame.\" Not only did he play in\nthe greatest number of games of any outfielder, but his general work in\nthe outfield was sensational.\n\nFor the position of leading batsman the \"Hall of Fame\" honors Zimmerman,\nthe powerful batter of the Chicago club. His work with the bat in 1912\napproached in many ways that of the high class and powerful batters of\nold. He batted steadily, with the exception of one very slight slump,\nand his work as batter undoubtedly was of tremendous assistance to\nChicago. Zimmerman did not shine alone as the best batter, as he was\nalso the leading maker of home runs and the best two-base hitter of the\nseason. That gives him a triple honor.\n\nThe best three-base hitter of the league was the quiet Wilson of\nPittsburgh. Though not so high in rank as a batsman as some of his\ncontemporaries, there was none in the organization who could equal his\nability to get to third base on long hits.\n\nBescher, as in 1911, earned in 1912 the position of leading base runner\nin the National League. He stole more bases than any other player of the\nleague, and was also the best run getter--that is to say, scored more\nruns than any other player.\n\nAMERICAN LEAGUE.\n\nFirst of all comes Gandil for first base. His greater number of games\nplayed and his steady work at first almost all of the season, as he did\nnot join the Washingtons at the beginning of the season, places him in\nthe \"Hall of Fame\" at first base.\n\nRath is a newcomer to the Chicago club, but by all around good work he\nearned the place at second base. Not so heavy a batter as some of his\nrivals, he covered a great amount of ground for the Chicagos and\nsteadied the infield throughout the year.\n\nFor the position of shortstop, McBride of Washington is the logical\nselection. Day in and day out he was one of the most reliable shortstops\nin the American League.\n\nAt third base John Turner of the Cleveland club retains the honor which\nhe earned for himself in 1911, and he is one of the few players who is a\nmember of the \"Hall of Fame\" two years in succession.\n\nIn the outfield, for all around work, the place of honor goes to Amos\nStrunk, the young player of the Philadelphia club. He was in center\nfield and in left field, and he was a busy young man for most of the\nyear.\n\nPitching at a standard higher than the American League had seen for\nyears, Wood of Boston is given the \"Hall of Fame\" honor as pitcher. His\naverage of winning games was very high, and he was compelled to fight\nhard for many of his victories.\n\nThe man who caught him seems entitled to be considered the leading\ncatcher. He is Cady of Boston, although for hard work Carrigan, also of\nBoston, gives him a close race.\n\nOnce more Cobb is the leading batsman of the American League. There was\nnone to dispute his right to the title. He was also leading batsman in\n1911 and is another American League player who holds a position in the\n\"Hall\" two years in succession.\n\nThe leading home run batter of the American League was Baker of\nPhiladelphia. He earned the same title in 1911.

FOSTER.\n\n\nJohn Tomlinson Brush was born in Clintonville, N.Y., on June 15, 1845.\nHe died November 26, 1912, near St. Charles, Mo., on his way to\nCalifornia from New York, for his health. Left an orphan at the age of\nfour years, he went to live at the home of his grandfather, in\nHopkinton, where he remained until he was seventeen years old. At this\nage he left school and went to Boston, where he obtained a position in a\nclothing establishment, a business with which he was identified up to\nhis death. He worked as a clerk in several cities in the East, and\nfinally went to Indianapolis in 1875 to open a clothing store. The store\nstill occupies the same building, and Mr. Brush continued at the head of\nthe business until his death. It was in the early '80s that he first\nbecame interested in Base Ball in Indianapolis, and he made himself both\nwealthy and famous as a promoter.\n\nIn 1863 Mr. Brush enlisted in the First New York Artillery, and served\nas a member of this body until it was discharged, at the close of the\ncivil war. He was a charter member of George H. Thomas Post, G.A.R.; a\nthirty-third degree Scottish Rite Mason, and was also prominently\nidentified with several social and commercial organizations of\nIndianapolis, notably the Columbia Club, Commercial Club, Board of\nTrade, and the Mannerchor Society. In New York Mr. Brush took up\nmembership in the Lambs' Club and the Larchmont Club. For several years\nhe made his headquarters at the Lambs' Club.\n\nMr. Brush is survived by his widow, Mrs. Elsie Lombard Brush, and two\ndaughters, Miss Natalie Brush and Mrs. Harry N. Hempstead. His first\nwife, Mrs. Agnes Ewart Brush, died in 1888.\n\nMr. Brush's career in Base Ball, a sport to which he was devotedly\nattached, and for which he had the highest ideals and aims, began with\nthe Indianapolis club of the National League.\n\nIt has been somewhat inaccurately stated that he entered Base Ball by\nchance. This was not, strictly speaking, the case. Prior to his first\nimmediate association with the national game he was an ardent admirer of\nthe sport, although not connected with it in any capacity as owner. He\nwas what might be called, with accurate description, a Base Ball \"fan\"\nin the earlier stages of development.\n\nAn opportunity presented itself by which it was possible to procure for\nthe city of Indianapolis a franchise in the National League. Mr. Brush\nwas quick to perceive the advantages which this might have in an\nadvertising way for the city with which he had cast his lot and\nsubscribed to the stock.\n\nLike many such adventures in the early history of the sport there came a\ntime when the cares and the duties of the club had to be assumed by a\nsingle individual and it was then that he became actively identified as\na managing owner, as the duty of caring for the club fell upon his\nshoulders.\n\nFrom that date, until the date of his death, he was actively interested\nin every detail relating to Base Ball which might pertain to the\nadvancement of the sport, and his principal effort in his future\nparticipation in the game was to see that it advanced on the lines of\nthe strictest integrity and in such a manner that its foundation should\nbe laid in the rock of permanent success.\n\nNaturally this was bound to bring him into conflict with some who looked\nupon Base Ball as an idle pastime, in which only the present moment was\nto be consulted.\n\nThe earliest environment of Base Ball was not wholly of a substantial\nnature. It was a game, intrinsically good of itself, in which the\nhazards had always been against the weak. There was not that\nconsideration of equity which would have been for its best interests,\nbut this was not entirely the fault of the separate members of the Base\nBall body, but the result of conditions, in which those whose thought\nwas only for the moment, overshadowed the best interests of the pastime.\n\nThere was an inequity in regulations governing the sport by which the\nclubs in the smaller cities were forced, against the will of their\nowners, to be the weaker organizations, and possibly this was less due\nto a desire upon the more fortunate and larger clubs to maintain such a\nstate of affairs, than to the fact that the organization generally had\nexpanded upon lines with little regard to the future.\n\nThe first general complaint arose from the players who composed the\nmembership of the smaller clubs. They demurred at the fact that they\nwere asked to perform equally as well as the players of the clubs in the\nlarger cities at smaller salaries. Not that they did not try to do their\nbest, for this they stoutly attempted under all conditions. It was the\neffect of a discrimination which was the result of the imperfect\nregulations that existed relative to the management of the game.\n\nThis attitude of the players resulted at length in the formation of a\nbody known as the Brotherhood. To offset not the Brotherhood, but the\ncause which led to its formation, Mr. Brush devised the famous\nclassification plan. Imperfectly understood in what it intended to do\nfor the players, it was seized upon as a reason for the revolt of the\nplayers and the organization of the Brotherhood League.\n\nAt heart it was the idea of Mr. Brush so to equalize salaries that the\nplayers of all clubs should be reimbursed in an equitable manner. As\nalways had been the case, and probably always is likely to be, the\nplayers who received the larger salaries were in no mood to share with\ntheir weaker brothers any excess margin of pay which they thought that\nthey had justly earned, and it was not a difficult matter for them to\nobtain the consent of players who might really have benefited by the\nplan to co-operate with them on the basis of comradeship.\n\nThe motives of Mr. Brush were thoroughly misconstrued by some, and, if\ngrasped by others, they were disregarded, because they conflicted with\ntheir immediate temporary prosperity.\n\nThe dead Base Ball organizer had looked further ahead than his time. His\nplan was born under the best of intentions, but it unfortunately\ndevolved upon the theory that players would be willing to share alike\nfor their common good. Later in life, through another and unquestionably\neven better method, he succeeded in bringing forth a plan which attained\nthe very end for which he sought in the '80s, but in the second resort,\nby a far more efficacious method.\n\nThe Brotherhood League came into existence and rivaled the National\nLeague. The players of the National League and the American Association\ndeserted to join the Brotherhood League, upon a platform that promised\nUtopia in Base Ball. Unquestionably it was the idea of the general\nBrotherhood organization that the National League would abandon the\nfight and succumb, but the National League owners were built of sterner\nstuff.\n\nThey fought back resolutely and hard and while for a time they were\ncombated by a fickle opinion, based upon sentiment, it developed within\ntwo months that the public had learned thoroughly the reasons for the\norganization of the new league and declined to lend it that support\nwhich had been predicted and expected.\n\nMeanwhile, Base Ball had received a setback greater than any which had\nbefallen the sport in an organized sense from a professional standpoint.\n\nThe Brotherhood League was a pronounced and emphatic failure. This is\nnot the verdict of personal opinion, but a record which is indelibly\nimpressed upon Base Ball history.\n\nIt was the theory of the Brotherhood League that it, in part, should be\ngoverned by representative players, but the players would not be\ngoverned by players. Discipline relaxed, teams did pretty much as they\npleased, and the public remained away from the games. It may be added\nwith truth that the National League games were not much better\npatronized, but that was due to the prevalent apathy in Base Ball\naffairs throughout the United States.\n\nWhen the Brotherhood League was formed and withdrew so many players from\nthe National League the latter organization undertook to strengthen\nitself where it could and when Brooklyn and Cincinnati applied for\nmembership in the circuit both were admitted.\n\nThe New York National League club had lost many of its players and, upon\nthe substitution of Cincinnati for Indianapolis in the National League\ncircuit, procured from Mr. Brush many players of note, among them Rusie,\nGlasscock, Buckley, Bassett and Denny.\n\nRelative to the withdrawal of Indianapolis from the circuit it may be\nsaid that Mr. Brush flatly refused to give up his club, asserting\nstoutly that he was perfectly able to continue the fight, but when he\nfelt that the exigencies of the occasion demanded that Cincinnati become\na member, he agreed to give up the franchise, providing that he be\npermitted to retain his membership in the National League, and transfer\nsuch of his players as New York desired to the latter city. It has been\nalleged that he demanded an exorbitant price from New York for the\ntransfer of the players.\n\nThis is untrue. He asked the price of his franchise, the value of his\nplayers, and the worth of giving up a Base Ball year in a city in which\nthere was to be no conflicting club and, as he had expressed full\nconfidence in his ability to make a winning fight for the National\nLeague, it was agreed that his rights to be considered could not be\noverlooked. To retain his National League membership he accepted stock\nin the New York club.\n\nToward the close of the Base Ball season the Brotherhood League dealt\nwhat it believed to be a death blow to the National League by the\npurchase of the Cincinnati franchise. It proved to be a boomerang, for\nbefore the first day of January, 1891, the Brotherhood League had passed\nout of existence. The backers of the organization, tired of the general\nconduct of the sport, were only too willing to come to an acceptable\nagreement and retire.\n\nA.G. Spalding, John T. Brush, Frank De Hass Robison, Charles H. Byrne\nand A.H. Soden were prominent members of the National League to bringing\nthis result about. Of these, Mr. Spalding and Mr. Soden survive, but\nhave retired from active participation in Base Ball affairs.\n\nIt was through this settlement, resulting upon the Base Ball war, that\nMr. Brush's activities were turned toward Cincinnati. The National\nLeague had a franchise in that city, but no one to operate it. Mr. Brush\nagreed to take up the franchise and attempt to operate and rebuild that\nclub. That, however, is a detail which relates purely to the continuance\nof a major league circuit.\n\nThe next most noticeable achievement in Mr. Brush's Base Ball career\nand, to the mind of more than one, the greatest successful undertaking\nin the history of the game, was a complete revolution in the\ndistribution of financial returns. By his success in effecting this Mr.\nBrush brought about the very purpose which he had sought to attain by\nhis classification plan.\n\nBut the method was better, for the instruments of this readjustment of\nconditions were the owners and not the players. Briefly, it was the\nfollowing:\n\nThere was still war in Base Ball between the American Association and\nthe National League. Recognizing that the best method to bring about a\ncessation of this war was to effect an amalgamation of the conflicting\nforces Mr. Brush sought, with the assistance of others, to weld both\nleagues into one. He was aided in this task, though indirectly, because\nA.G. Spalding was actively out of Base Ball, by that gentleman, Frank De\nHass Robison, Christopher Von der Abe, and Francis C. Richter, editor of\n\"Sporting Life\" of Philadelphia. The writer also essayed in the task in\nan advisory capacity.\n\nThe amalgamation was brought about, though not without some opposition;\nindeed, much opposition. It was conceded at that time that a twelve-club\nleague, which was the object sought, was cumbersome and unwieldy, but\nthere was no other plan of possible accomplishment which suggested\nitself.\n\nBut the principal consideration and the result accomplished in this\nconsolidation of leagues was that all gate receipts should be divided,\nshare and share alike, so far as general admissions were concerned.\n\nThat was the greatest and most far-reaching achievement in the history\nof Base Ball. Prior to that time the principle of a fixed guarantee for\neach game played had given each home club a stupendous bulk of the sums\npaid by the public toward the maintenance of the sport. The inevitable\noutcome of such an arrangement was that the clubs in the larger cities\ncompletely overshadowed the clubs in the smaller cities.\n\nThe teams in the cities of less population were expected to try to place\nrival organizations on the field that would equal in playing strength\nthose of New York, Boston and Chicago, but they were unable to do so\nunless their owners were willing to go on year after year with large\ndeficits staring them in the face.\n\nWhen Mr. Brush and his associates succeeded in placing Base Ball upon a\nplane of absolute fairness, so far as the proper distribution of the\nreturns of the sport could be made between clubs, Base Ball began to\nprosper, and, for the first time in all its history, the owners of\nso-called smaller clubs felt that they could go forward and try to rival\ntheir bigger fellows with equally strong combinations.\n\nMore than that, and which to the ball player is most important of all,\nit \"jumped\" the salaries of the players in the smaller clubs until they\nwere on equal terms with their fellow players in the larger clubs, so\nthat Mr. Brush helped to accomplish by this plan the very aim which he\nhad at heart when he proposed the classification plan--a just, impartial\nand equal reimbursement to every player in the game, so far as the\nfinances of each club would permit--and without that bane to all\nplayers, a salary limit.\n\nThus, while it is always probable that some players may receive more\nthan others, based upon their preponderance of skill, it is now a fact\nthat two-thirds of the major league ball players of the present day owe\ntheir handsome salaries to the system which John T. Brush so earnestly\nurged and for which he fought against odds which would have daunted a\nman with less fixity of purpose.\n\nHaving brought forth this new condition in Base Ball, which was so just\nthat its results almost immediately began to make themselves manifest,\nthe owner of the Cincinnati club devoted his time and his energies to\nthe endeavor to place a championship club in Cincinnati. He never was\nsuccessful in that purpose, although his ill fortune was no greater than\nthat of his predecessors.\n\nThe time came that Mr. Brush learned that the New York Base Ball Club\ncould be purchased. He obtained the stock necessary to make him owner of\nthe New York organization from Mr. Andrew Freedman, but before he did so\nanother Base Ball war had begun between the National League and the\nAmerican League, a disagreement starting from the simplest of causes,\nbut which, like many another such disagreement, resulted in the most\ndamaging of conditions to the prosperity of the pastime.\n\nAs had been the case in the prior war brought about by the organization\nof the Brotherhood League, Mr. Brush fought staunchly for his rights.\nProminent National League players were taken by the American League\nclubs, and this brought retaliation.\n\nAt length the National League opened negotiations to obtain certain\nAmerican League players and succeeded in doing so. Among these were the\nmanager of the Baltimore club, John J. McGraw, who felt that he was\nacting perfectly within his rights in joining the New York National\nLeague club. Directly upon his acceptance of the management of the New\nYork club Mr. Brush became its owner and the era of prosperity was\ninaugurated in New York, which was soon enjoyed by every club throughout\nthe United States.\n\nIn its first year under the new management the team was not in condition\nto make a good fight, but the next year it was ready and since then has\nwon four National League championships and one World's Championship.\n\nIn the spring of 1911, at the very dawn of the National League season,\nthe grand stand of the New York National League club burned to the\nground. A man less determined would have been overcome by such a blow.\nNothing daunted and while the flames were not yet quenched, Mr. Brush\nsent for engineers to devise plans for the magnificent stadium which\nbears his name and which, on the Polo Grounds in New York, is one of the\ngreatest and the most massive monument to professional Base Ball in the\nworld.\n\nIn connection with this wonderful new edifice of steel and stone, which\nis one of the wonders of the new world, it is appropriate to add that\ntwo world's series have been played on the field of the Polo Grounds\nsince it has been erected.\n\nThe rules for these world's series were formulated and adopted upon the\nsuggestion and by the advice of Mr. Brush and since a regular world's\nseries season has been a feature of Base Ball the national game has\nprogressed with even greater strides than was the case in the past.\n\nAt a meeting of the National League the following resolutions were\nadopted:\n\n  _Whereas_, The death of Mr. John T. Brush, president of the New York\n  National League Base Ball Club, comes as a sad blow to organized\n  professional Base Ball and particularly to us, his associates in the\n  National League.\n\n  As the dean of organized professional Base Ball, his wise counsel, his\n  unerring judgment, his fighting qualities and withal his eminent\n  fairness and integrity in all matters pertaining to the welfare of the\n  national game will be surely missed.\n\n  He was a citizen of sterling worth, of high moral standards and of\n  correct business principles, and his death is not only a grievous loss\n  to us, but to the community at large as well. Be it, therefore,\n\n  _Resolved_, That the members of the National League of Professional\n  Base Ball Clubs, in session to-day, express their profound grief at\n  the loss of their friend, associate and counsellor and extend to the\n  members of his bereaved family their sincere sympathy in the great\n  loss which they have sustained by his death. Be it further\n\n  _Resolved_, That a copy of these resolutions be spread on the records\n  of the league.\n\nIn connection with the death of Mr. Brush, Ben Johnson, president of the\nAmerican League, said: \"Mr. Brush was a power in Base Ball. He will be\nmissed as much in the American League as in the National League.\"\n\nMore than three hundred friends, relatives, business acquaintances,\nlodge brothers and Base Ball associates attended the funeral of Mr.\nBrush, on Friday, November 29, at St. Paul's Episcopal Church,\nIndianapolis. Fifty or more of Mr. Brush's Base Ball associates and\nacquaintances, principally from the East, were present.\n\nThe service was conducted by the Rev. Lewis Brown, rector of St. Paul's,\nand was followed by a Scottish Rite ceremony in charge of William Geake,\nSr., of Fort Wayne, acting thrice potent master, and official head of\nthe thirty-third degree in Indiana. The Scottish Rite delegation\nnumbered more than 150. There were also in attendance fifty Knights\nTemplars of Rapier Commandery, under the leadership of Eminent Commander\nE.J. Scoonover.\n\nThe Grand Army of the Republic, the Indianapolis Commercial Club and a\nnumber of local and out-of-town clubs and social organizations of which\nMr. Brush was a member also were represented.\n\nThe Episcopal service was given impressively. The Rev. Dr. Brown, in\nreviewing the life of Mr. Brush, spoke of him as one of the remarkable\nmen of America, who, in his youth, gave no promise of being in later\nlife a national figure. In the course of his remarks Dr. Brown said:\n\n\"The death of John Tomlinson Brush removes from our midst one of the\nmost remarkable men of our generation. His life was that of a typical\nAmerican. He began in the most unpretentious manner and died a figure of\nnational importance.\n\n\"He went through the Civil War so quietly that the fact was unknown to\nsome of his most intimate friends. He was mustered out with honor and\nentered the business world in Indianapolis. His labors here put him at\nthe forefront for sagacity, squareness, honorable treatment and\ngenerosity.\n\n\"His love of sport made him a patron of the national game. In a\nperfectly natural way, he went from manager of the local team to\nproprietor of the New York Giants. He was a Bismarck in plan and a\nNapoleon in execution. His aim was pre-eminence and he won place by the\nconsent of all. The recent spectacular outpouring of people and colossal\nfinancial exhibit in the struggle for the pennant between New York and\nBoston were but the legitimate outcome of his marvelous skill.\n\n\"He was an early member of the Masonic fraternity. He took his Blue\nLodge degree in his native town and to demonstrate his attachment he\nnever removed his membership. Where he had been raised to the sublime\ndegree of a master there he wished to keep his affiliation always.\n\n\"He became a Knight Templar in Rapier Commandery and was one of its past\neminent commanders. He was a member of the Scottish Rite bodies in the\nValley of Indianapolis in the early days and performed his work with a\nritual perfection unsurpassed. He received the thirty-third and last\ndegree as a merited honor for proficiency and zeal.\n\n\"The conspicuous feature of his life was its indomitable purpose.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE WORLD'S SERIES OF 1912\n\nBY JOHN B. FOSTER.\n\n\nNo individual, whether player, manager, owner, critic or spectator, who\nwent through the world's series of 1912 ever will forget it. There never\nwas another like it. Years may elapse before there shall be a similar\nseries and it may be that the next to come will be equally sensational,\nperhaps more so.\n\nViewed from the very strict standpoint that all Base Ball games should\nbe played without mistake or blunder this world's series may be said to\nhave been inartistic, but it is only the hypercritical theorist who\nwould take such a cold-blooded view of the series.\n\nFrom the lofty perch of the \"bleacherite\" it was a series crammed with\nthrills and gulps, cheers and gasps, pity and hysteria, dejection and\nwild exultation, recrimination and adoration, excuse and condemnation,\nand therefore it was what may cheerfully be called \"ripping good\" Base\nBall.\n\nThere were plays on the field which simply lifted the spectators out of\ntheir seats in frenzy. There were others which caused them to wish to\nsink through the hard floor of the stand in humiliation. There were\nstops in which fielders seemed to stretch like india rubber and others\nin which they shriveled like parchment which has been dried. There were\ncatches of fly balls which were superhuman and muffs of fly balls which\nwere \"superawful.\"\n\nThere were beautiful long hits, which threatened to change the outcome\nof games and some of them did. There were opportunities for other\nbeautiful long hits which were not made.\n\nNo ingenuity of stage preparation, no prearranged plot of man, no\ncunningly devised theory of a world's series could have originated a\nfinale equal to that of the eighth and decisive contest. Apparently on\nthe verge of losing the series after the Saturday game in Boston the\nGiants had gamely fought their way to a tie with Boston, and it was one\nof the pluckiest and gamest fights ever seen in a similar series, and\njust as the golden apple seemed about to drop into the hands of the New\nYork players they missed it because Dame Fortune rudely jostled them\naside.\n\nAs a matter of fact the New York players were champions of the world for\nnine and one half innings, for they led Boston when the first half of\nthe extra inning of the final game was played. Within the next six\nminutes they had lost all the advantage which they had gained.\n\nIt was a combination of bad fielding and lack of fielding which cost the\nNew York team its title. And if only Mathewson had not given Yerkes a\nbase on balls in the tenth inning the game might not have been won, even\nwith the fielding blunders, but Mathewson was pitching with all the\ndesperation and the cunning which he could muster to fool the batter and\nfailed to do so.\n\nSuch sudden and complete reversal on the part of the mental demeanor of\nspectators was never before seen on a ball field in a world's series.\nThe Boston enthusiasts had given up and were willing to concede the\nchampionship to New York. In the twinkling of an eye there was a muffed\nfly, a wonderful catch by the same player who muffed the\nball--Snodgrass--a base on balls to Yerkes, a missed chance to retire\nSpeaker easily on a foul fly, then a base hit by Speaker to right field,\non which Engel scored, another base on balls to Lewis and then the long\nsacrifice fly to right field by Gardner, which sent Yerkes over the\nplate with the winning run.\n\nBefore entering upon a description of the games it is appropriate to say\nthat the umpiring in this series was as near perfection as it could be.\nIt was by far the best of any since the series had been inaugurated. The\numpires were William Klem and Charles Rigler of the National League and\nFrank O'Loughlin and William Evans of the American League.\n\nFIRST GAME\nNew York, Oct. 8, 1912.\nBoston 4, New York 3.\nHits--Off Wood 8; off Tesreau 5; Crandall 1.\nStruck out--Wood 11; Tesreau 4; Crandall 2.\nBases on balls--Wood 2; Tesreau 4.\nAttendance 35,722.\n\nIn the description of the games of the world's series only those innings\nwill be touched upon in which there were men on bases. Tesreau pitched\nthe opening game for New York and the first man to bat for Boston was\nHooper. Tesreau gave him a base on balls. The next three batters were\nretired in succession. Devore and Doyle, the first two batters for New\nYork, were retired and Snodgrass hit cleanly to center field, the first\nbase hit in the series. Murray was given a base on balls, but Merkle\nflied to short. In the second inning the Bostons started as bravely as\nthey had in the first, as Gardner, the first batter, was safe on\nFletcher's fumble. Stahl batted to Tesreau and Gardner was forced out.\nWagner was given a base on balls, after Stahl had been thrown out trying\nto steal second, and Cady flied to Murray.\n\nThe Bostons started with a man on base in the third. Wood was given a\nbase on balls by Tesreau and Hooper sacrificed. Doyle threw Yerkes out\nand Speaker was given a base on balls, but Lewis died easily on a weak\nfly to short.\n\nIn New York's half of this inning the Giants scored twice. Tesreau,\nfirst at bat, struck out. Devore was given a base on balls and Doyle\nbatted wickedly to left field for two bases. Snodgrass was fooled into\nstriking out, but Murray smashed the ball to center field for a single,\nand sent two men over the rubber, Murray was caught at second trying to\nget around the bases while Doyle was going home.\n\nWith one out Herzog hit safely in the fourth inning, but did not score.\nIn the fifth, with two out, Doyle batted safely, but failed to score. In\nthe sixth the Bostons made their first runs on Speaker's triple to left\nfield and Lewis' out. If Snodgrass, in making a desperate effort to\ncatch the fly, had permitted the ball to go to Devore the chances are\nthat Speaker's hit would have resulted in an out, so that New York lost\non the play.\n\nSnodgrass was safe in the sixth on Wagner's fumble, but was doubled off\nfirst when Murray drove a line hit straight to Stahl. The seventh was\nthe undoing of the Giants. With one out Wagner batted safely to center\nfield. Cady followed with another hit to the same place. Wood batted to\nDoyle, who made a beautiful stop, but with a double play in hand, was\noverbalanced and unable to complete it. That cost New York three runs,\nalthough it was unavoidable. Cady was forced out, but Hooper hit to\nright field for two bases sending Wagner and Wood home. Yerkes followed\nwith a clean hit to left field for a base and won the first game for\nBoston with that hit.\n\nIn New York's half of the inning, with one out, Meyers was hit by a\npitched ball, but no damage was done other than to Meyers' feelings. In\nthe ninth Wagner batted Crandall for a two-base hit, Crandall having\nbeen substituted for Tesreau in the eighth inning, as McCormick had\nbatted for Tesreau in the seventh. Cady made a sacrifice, but the next\ntwo batters were easily retired.\n\nThen began the exciting finish, and if the Giants had made but a single\nmore they probably would have begun the series with a victory instead of\na defeat. With one out Merkle batted the ball over second base for a\nsingle and the spectators, who had started toward the exits, halted.\nHerzog followed with a slow low fly to right field, which fell safely.\nMeyers crashed into the ball for a two-bagger that struck the wall in\nright field and the crowd began to believe that Wood had gone up in\n\"smoke.\"\n\nThe Boston players encouraged him with all their best vocal efforts, and\nwhen Fletcher came to the plate Wood was using all the speed with which\nhe was possessed. It was evident that Fletcher's sole desire was to bat\nthe ball safely to right field, for if he did so, both of the runners\ncould cross the plate and the Giants would win. Twice he met the ball,\nand both times it sailed in the right direction, but with no result, as\nit was foul. Then he struck out. Crandall, perhaps one of the best pinch\nhitters in the major leagues, also struck out, and the Boston\nenthusiasts who were present fell back in their chairs from sheer\nexhaustion, but when they had recovered, with their band leading them,\nmarched across the field and cheered Mayor Fitzgerald of Boston, who was\npresent as a spectator of the contest in company with Mayor Gaynor of\nNew York. Governor Foss of Massachusetts was also present at the opening\nof the game. Klem umpired behind the bat in this game.\n\nSECOND GAME\nBoston, Oct. 9, 1912.\nNew York 6. Boston 6 (eleven innings).\nHits--Off Collins 9, off Hall 2; Mathewson 10.\nStruck out--Collins 5, Bedient 1; Mathewson 4\nBases on balls--Hall 4, Bedient 1.\nAttendance 30,148.\n\nIn the second game of the series, which was played October 9 at Boston,\nMathewson pitched for the New York team and Collins, Hall and Bedient\nfor Boston. The game resulted in a tie, 6 to 6, at the end of the\neleventh inning, being called on account of darkness by Umpire\nO'Loughlin, who was acting behind the plate. This contest was remarkable\nmore for the misplays of the New York players, which gave the Bostons a\nchance to save themselves from defeat, than for any undue familiarity\nwith the pitching of Mathewson. It was the universal opinion of\npartisans of both teams that Mathewson deserved to win because he\noutpitched his opponents. The weather was fair and the ground in\nexcellent condition. In the first inning Snodgrass began with a clean\ntwo-base hit into the left field seats but neither Doyle, Becker nor\nMurray was able to help him across the plate. A run scored in that\ninning, with such a fine start, would probably have won the game for the\nGiants.\n\nIn Boston's half Hooper hit safely to center field and stole second\nbase. Yerkes batted a line drive to Fletcher, and had the New York\nshortstop held the ball, which was not difficult to catch, Hooper could\neasily have been doubled at second, but Fletcher muffed it. Speaker hit\nsafely toward third base, filling the bases. Lewis batted to Herzog, who\nmade a fine play on the ball and caught Hooper at the plate. This should\nhave been the third out and would have retired Boston without a run.\nGardner was put out by a combination play on the part of Mathewson,\nDoyle and Merkle, scoring Yerkes, and Stahl came through with a hard\nline hit for a base, which scored Speaker and Lewis. The inning netted\nBoston three runs, which were not earned.\n\nWith one out in the second inning Herzog batted for three bases to\ncenter field and scored on Meyers' single. Fletcher flied out and\nMathewson forced Meyers out. Hooper got a two-base hit in the same\ninning, but two were out at the time and Fletcher easily threw out\nYerkes, who was the next batter.\n\nIn the fourth inning Murray began with a clean three-base hit to center\nfield. Merkle fouled out to the third baseman, but Herzog's long fly to\nSpeaker was an excellent sacrifice and Murray scored. Meyers again hit\nfor a single, but was left on the bases. The Bostons got this run back\nin the last half of the fifth. With one out Hooper hit to center field\nfor a base, his third hit in succession against Mathewson. Yerkes batted\na three-bagger out of the reach of Snodgrass and Hooper scored. Murray\nbatted safely in the sixth, with one out, but died trying to steal\nsecond, Carrigan catching for Boston. In the Boston's half of the sixth\nLewis began with a single and got as far as third base, but could not\nscore.\n\nThe Giants started bravely in the seventh when Herzog hit the ball for a\nbase and stole second. There were three chances to get him home, but\nMeyers, who had been hitting Collins hard, failed to make a single and\nFletcher and Mathewson were both retired.\n\nIn the eighth the New York players made one of the game rallies for\nwhich they became famed all through the series and went ahead of their\nrivals. Snodgrass was the first batter and lifted an easy fly to Lewis.\nThe Boston player got directly under the ball and made a square muff of\nit. Doyle followed along with a sharp hit to center field for a base and\nalthough he was forced out by Becker, the latter drove the ball hard.\nMurray came through with a long two-bagger to left center and Snodgrass\nand Becker scored. That tied the score and also put an end to Collins'\nwork in the box; Stahl took him out and substituted Hall. Merkle fouled\nweakly to the catcher, but Herzog caught the ball on the nose and hit\nsharp and clean to center field for two bases, sending Murray home with\nthe run which put the Giants in the lead. Another base hit would have\nwon for New York, but Meyers perished on a hard hit to Wagner, which was\nfielded to first ahead of the batter.\n\nUnfortunately for New York, with two out in the last half of the inning\nLewis batted the ball to left field for two bases. Murray made a\ndesperate effort to get it. He tumbled backward over the fence into the\nbleachers and for a few moments there were some who thought that he had\nbeen seriously injured. Gardner followed with a single to center and\nStahl hit to right for a base, but Wagner struck out and the Bostons\nwere down with only a run.\n\nIn the ninth Hall gave a remarkable exhibition. Fletcher and Mathewson\nwere retired in succession. Then Snodgrass, Doyle and Becker were given\nbases on balls, filling the bags. It seemed certain that a run might\nscore, and perhaps one would have scored had it not been for an\nexcellent stop by Wagner. Murray hit the ball at him like a shot, but he\ngot it and retired Becker at second.\n\nThe Giants took the lead in the tenth and once more it appeared as if\nthe game would be theirs. Merkle began with a long three-base hit to\ncenter field. Herzog batted to Wagner and Merkle played safe, refusing\nto try to score while the batter was being put out at first. Meyers was\ngiven a base on balls and Shafer ran for him. Fletcher lifted a long fly\nto left field and Merkle scored from third. Mathewson could not advance\nthe runners and died on an infield fly. Yerkes was the first batter for\nthe Bostons and was retired at first base. Speaker hit to deep center\nfield. There were some scorers who gave the batter but three bases on\nthe hit, insisting that Wilson, who was then catching for New York,\nshould have got the throw to the plate and retired the batter. In any\nevent Wilson missed the ball and Speaker scored. Lewis followed with a\ntwo-bagger, which would have scored Speaker if the latter had not tried\nto run home, so Wilson's failure to retrieve the throw became more\nconspicuous. Other scorers gave Speaker a clean home run and it is not\nfar out of the way to say that he deserved the benefit of the doubt.\n\nNeither team scored in the eleventh inning, although Snodgrass was hit\nby a pitched ball. He was the first batter. He tried to steal second,\nbut failed to make it.\n\nThis contest was conspicuous because of the wonderfully good fielding of\nDoyle and Wagner. The former made two stops along the right field line\nwhich seemed to be not far from superhuman. Wagner killed at least two\nsafe hits over second base for New York and both of the plays were of\nthe greatest benefit to the Boston team.\n\nTHIRD GAME.\nBoston, Oct. 10, 1912.\nNew York 2; Boston 1.\nHits--Off Marquard 7; O'Brien 6, Bedient 1.\nStruck out--Marquard 6, O'Brien 3.\nBases on balls--Marquard 1; O'Brien 3.\nAttendance 34,624.\n\nBecause of the tie game the teams remained over in Boston and played on\nthe following day, October 10. The pitchers were Marquard for New York\nand O'Brien and Bedient for Boston. Marquard pitched one of the best\ngames of his career and not a run was made against him until the ninth\ninning. By far the most notable play of the game on the field was made\nby Devore in the ninth inning, when he ran for more than thirty feet and\ncaught an almost impossible fly ball which had been batted by Cady. Had\nhe missed it the Bostons might have scored two runs and won. Devore\nbegan the first inning with a base hit, but was out trying to steal\nsecond. The next two batters were retired. In the second inning Murray\nbatted the ball to center field for two bases. Merkle's clever sacrifice\nput him on third and Herzog's sacrifice fly sent him over the rubber.\nLewis began the inning for Boston with a safe hit, but could not advance\nfurther than second.\n\nIn the third Fletcher started with a base on balls and was sacrificed to\nsecond, but was unable to score. In the fourth, with one out, Speaker\nbatted safely, but was forced out at second. Gardner flied to Murray.\n\nIn the fifth Herzog began with a two-base hit to left field. Meyers died\nat first, but Fletcher hit safely to right field and Herzog scored.\nFletcher stole second and Marquard was given a base on balls. Devore\nforced him out and stole second and Doyle followed with another base on\nballs. A long hit would have made the game easy for New York and\nSnodgrass tried to get the ball into the bleachers, but Lewis caught it.\nStahl began the Bostons' half of the fifth with a hit, but was out by\nten feet trying to steal second.\n\nIn the sixth, with two out, Yerkes hit safely, but Speaker fouled out.\nIn the seventh, with two out, Stahl batted the ball to left field for\ntwo bases, but Wagner flied to Devore.\n\nIn the eighth the Giants looked dangerous again. Devore began with a\nbase-hit to left field. Doyle flied to Lewis. Snodgrass hit safely to\nleft field and Murray flied to Lewis. Merkle batted the ball very hard,\nbut Wagner made a good stop and caught Snodgrass at second. With two out\nHooper got a base on balls for Boston, but it did Boston no good.\n\nIn the ninth Herzog was hit by a pitched ball and Meyers swung solidly\nto center for a single, after Herzog had died trying to steal. Fletcher\nlined to Speaker and Meyers was doubled. In Boston's half, with one out,\nLewis batted to right field for a base. Gardner hit to the same place\nfor two bases and Lewis scored Boston's only run. Stahl rapped a\ngrounder to Marquard, who threw Gardner out at third. Wagner should have\nbeen an easy out, and the game would have been over if Merkle had not\ndropped a throw to first base. Wagner stole second, no attention being\npaid to him, and then Devore made his wonderfully good catch of Cady's\nhard drive and the Giants had won their first game in the series.\n\nMarquard outpitched both of his Boston rivals and in only two innings\nwere the Bostons able to get the first man on the bases.\n\nFOURTH GAME.\nNew York, Oct. 11, 1912.\nBoston 3, New York 1.\nHits--Off Wood 9; off Tesreau 5, Ames 3.\nStruck out--Wood 8; Tesreau 5.\nBases on balls--Ames 1, Tesreau 2.\nAttendance 36,502.\n\nThe fourth game of the series was played in New York on the following\nday. For most of the forenoon it looked as if there would be no game\nbecause of rain. Toward noon it cleared up slightly and although the\nground was a little soft it was decided to play, in view of the fact\nthat so many spectators had come a long distance to witness the contest.\nThe soft ground was in favor of the Boston players, for the ball was\nbatted very hard by New York most of the afternoon, but the diamond held\nand the infielders were able to get a good grasp on grounders which\nwould ordinarily have been very difficult to handle. Tesreau pitched for\nNew York and Wood for Boston, as was the case in the opening game of the\nseries. Hooper, who batted with much success on the Polo Grounds, began\nwith a single to center and although Yerkes was safe on Meyers' wild\nthrow the Giants got out of a bad predicament handily because of the\nexcellent stops which were made by Fletcher of hits by Speaker and\nLewis. With one out in New York's half of the inning Doyle batted\nsafely, but Snodgrass forced him out.\n\nGardner began the second inning with a three-base hit to right field and\nscored on a wild pitch. The next three batters were retired in order.\nWith one out for New York, Merkle singled and stole second, but was not\nhelped to get home.\n\nThe third was started by a single by Wood and Hooper was given a base on\nballs. Yerkes bunted and Tesreau whipped the ball to third base ahead of\nWood. Doyle and Fletcher made two fine stops and Speaker and Lewis were\nretired.\n\nBoston added another run in the fourth inning, being assisted by\nTesreau's wildness. Gardner, who batted first, was given a base on\nballs. Stahl forced him out at second. Then Stahl stole second, to the\nimmediate surprise of the Boston players and the chagrin of the New York\ncatcher. Wagner's out at first helped him along and when Cady pushed a\nweak single to center field, just out of the reach of the players, Stahl\nscored. Wood was retired by Murray.\n\nWith one out in the fifth Yerkes batted for a base, but was thrown out\nat second on Speaker's grounder and Speaker died trying to steal. New\nYork had one out in the same inning, when Herzog hit safely, but neither\nMeyers nor Fletcher could help him.\n\nIn the sixth the New York players began with a rush. Tesreau, the first\nbatter, hit for a base. Devore followed with another single. Doyle with\na \"clean up\" could have won for the Giants, but he lifted a high fly to\nYerkes. Snodgrass batted to Yerkes, who made an extraordinarily good\nstop and threw Devore out at second. Murray forced Snodgrass at second\nand all. New York's early advantage went for naught.\n\nIn the seventh the Giants scored their only run. After Merkle had struck\nout, Herzog batted for a base. Meyers lifted a terrific line drive to\ncenter field, but Speaker got under the ball. Fletcher hit hard and safe\nto right field for two bases and Herzog scored. McCormick batted for a\nbase, but Fletcher, trying to score on the ball, was thrown out at the\nplate by Yerkes.\n\nIn the eighth, with two out, Snodgrass was safe on Wagner's fumble.\nMurray rapped a single to left field but Merkle struck out. With two out\nfor Boston Speaker batted a double to left field and was left. Ames\npitched in the eighth for New York. In the ninth the Giants were scored\nupon again when Gardner hit for a single to center field. Stahl\nsacrificed, Wagner was given a base on balls and Cady forced Wagner,\nwhile Gardner was scoring.\n\nFIFTH GAME.\nBoston, Oct. 12. 1912.\nBoston 2; New York 1.\nHits--Off Mathewson 5; Bedient 3.\nStruck out--Mathewson 2; Bedient 4.\nBases on balls--Bedient 3.\nAttendance 34,683.\n\nThe game was played on Saturday with Mathewson in the box for New York\nand Bedient for Boston. As was the case in the former game pitched by\nMathewson in Boston, the verdict was general that perfect support would\nhave won the contest for him, even though the score was but 2 to 1 in\nfavor of Boston. Devore received a base on balls in the first inning and\nafter Doyle was out on a long fly to right was forced out by Snodgrass\nin a double play. By the way this game was played under very adverse\nconditions so far as the weather was concerned. It was cold and gloomy.\nHooper, the first Boston batter, as usual, began with his single to\ncenter field. Yerkes flied out to shortstop. Speaker hit safely and\nLewis batted to Herzog, who made a beautiful stop on third, and touched\nthe base ahead of Hooper. Gardner struck out.\n\nIn the second inning Murray started off with a base on balls and the\nnext three batters were retired in succession. With one out for Boston,\nWagner batted safely to right field. The next two men were retired\nwithout reaching first.\n\nWith one out in the third, Mathewson batted a single to center field and\nDevore followed with a base on balls, but Bedient got the next two\nbatters.\n\nThe third was the inning which broke the backs of the Giants. Hooper\nbatted the ball to left center for three bases. Yerkes followed with a\ntriple to center and Hooper scored. Speaker contributed with a ground\nhit, which Doyle should have got, but fumbled. Had he recovered the ball\nBoston would have made but one run in the inning. As it was, Yerkes\nscored on the misplay and that run lost the game for the Giants. The\nnext two batters were retired and for the remainder of the contest\nBoston never had a man on first base, Mathewson pitching marvelous ball,\nby far the best game of the series, as it should easily have been a one\nrun contest with not a base on balls nor a wild pitch.\n\nIn the seventh inning Merkle began with a two-base hit to left field\nHerzog flied out to Wagner. Meyers flied out, but McCormick who batted\nfor Fletcher, made a hit and Merkle scored. That spurt gave the Giants\ntheir sole run and they returned to New York that night with the series\nthree to one against them.\n\nSIXTH GAME.\nNew York, Oct. 14, 1912\nNew York 5; Boston 2.\nHits--Off Marquard 7; O'Brien 6, Collins 5.\nStruck out--Marquard 3; O'Brien 1, Collins 1.\nBases on balls--Marquard 1.\nAttendance 30,622.\n\nWith a Sunday in which to rest the series was resumed in New York on\nMonday, October 14. Marquard pitched for the Giants and O'Brien for the\nBostons. Rest seemed to have recuperated the New York players more than\ntheir opponents. In the first inning of the game the Giants scored five\nruns and the contest was never in doubt after that. O'Brien made a\ncostly balk in the first inning and the Boston players generally seemed\nto be less energetic and less confident than would have been expected\nfrom a team which had but one game to win to make the championship\nassured.\n\nThe first inning really settled the outcome of the contest. After the\nGiants had made five runs Boston played through the other eight innings\nperfunctorily. The crowd of Boston enthusiasts, which had come to New\nYork to see the finishing touches put on the Giants, was bitterly\ndisappointed, while the New York enthusiasts, not over hopeful on\naccount of the disposition of the Giants to blunder badly at vital\nmoments, were at least in a much better frame of mind because of the\nrally by their team.\n\nHooper was first at bat and as usual hit for a base. He was caught\nnapping off first. Yerkes was easily retired. Speaker was given a base\non balls and Lewis flied out.\n\nIn New York's half Devore was retired at first. Doyle hit safely to\ncenter field. He stole second after Snodgrass struck out. Murray batted\na single to left field and Doyle went to third. O'Brien made a palpable\nbalk and Doyle scored from third, Murray going to second. Merkle banged\na hard double to right field, Herzog followed with a double to left\nfield, Meyers singled to left field, and actually stole second under the\nnoses of the Boston players. Fletcher singled to right field and Meyers\nscored the fifth run of the inning; the other men who had crossed the\nplate being Doyle, Murray, Merkle and Herzog.\n\nIn Boston's half of the second inning the Boston players scored twice\nand that was all they made in the game. Gardner was safe at first on\nMarquard's wild throw; Stahl singled to center. The next two batters\nwere easily retired, but Engle, who batted for O'Brien, hit to left\nfield for two bases, Devore missing the ball by pushing it away from him\nas he was running into it, and Gardner and Stahl scored.\n\nBoston began the third inning and the fourth inning with singles, but\nthe runners failed to get around. In the eighth, with one out, Yerkes\nmade a single, but was unable to score.\n\nWith one out in the third for New York,\n\n### Summary:\n\n"}

Project)\n\nPARADISO\n\n\n\nParadiso: Canto I\n\n\nThe glory of Him who moveth everything\n  Doth penetrate the universe, and shine\n  In one part more and in another less.\n\nWithin that heaven which most his light receives\n  Was I, and things beheld which to repeat\n  Nor knows, nor can, who from above descends;\n\nBecause in drawing near to its desire\n  Our intellect ingulphs itself so far,\n  That after it the memory cannot go.\n\nTruly whatever of the holy realm\n  I had the power to treasure in my mind\n  Shall now become the subject of my song.\n\nO good Apollo, for this last emprise\n  Make of me such a vessel of thy power\n  As giving the beloved laurel asks!\n\nOne summit of Parnassus hitherto\n  Has been enough for me, but now with both\n  I needs must enter the arena left.\n\nEnter into my bosom, thou, and breathe\n  As at the time when Marsyas thou didst draw\n  Out of the scabbard of those limbs of his.\n\nO power divine, lend'st thou thyself to me\n  So that the shadow of the blessed realm\n  Stamped in my brain I can make manifest,\n\nThou'lt see me come unto thy darling tree,\n  And crown myself thereafter with those leaves\n  Of which the theme and thou shall make me worthy.\n\nSo seldom, Father, do we gather them\n  For triumph or of Caesar or of Poet,\n  (The fault and shame of human inclinations,)\n\nThat the Peneian foliage should bring forth\n  Joy to the joyous Delphic deity,\n  When any one it makes to thirst for it.\n\nA little spark is followed by great flame;\n  Perchance with better voices after me\n  Shall prayer be made that Cyrrha may respond!\n\nTo mortal men by passages diverse\n  Uprises the world's lamp; but by that one\n  Which circles four uniteth with three crosses,\n\nWith better course and with a better star\n  Conjoined it issues, and the mundane wax\n  Tempers and stamps more after its own fashion.\n\nAlmost that passage had made morning there\n  And evening here, and there was wholly white\n  That hemisphere, and black the other part,\n\nWhen Beatrice towards the left-hand side\n  I saw turned round, and gazing at the sun;\n  Never did eagle fasten so upon it!\n\nAnd even as a second ray is wont\n  To issue from the first and reascend,\n  Like to a pilgrim who would fain return,\n\nThus of her action, through the eyes infused\n  In my imagination, mine I made,\n  And sunward fixed mine eyes beyond our wont.\n\nThere much is lawful which is here unlawful\n  Unto our powers, by virtue of the place\n  Made for the human species as its own.\n\nNot long I bore it, nor so little while\n  But I beheld it sparkle round about\n  Like iron that comes molten from the fire;\n\nAnd suddenly it seemed that day to day\n  Was added, as if He who has the power\n  Had with another sun the heaven adorned.\n\nWith eyes upon the everlasting wheels\n  Stood Beatrice all intent, and I, on her\n  Fixing my vision from above removed,\n\nSuch at her aspect inwardly became\n  As Glaucus, tasting of the herb that made him\n  Peer of the other gods beneath the sea.\n\nTo represent transhumanise in words\n  Impossible were; the example, then, suffice\n  Him for whom Grace the experience reserves.\n\nIf I was merely what of me thou newly\n  Createdst, Love who governest the heaven,\n  Thou knowest, who didst lift me with thy light!\n\nWhen now the wheel, which thou dost make eternal\n  Desiring thee, made me attentive to it\n  By harmony thou dost modulate and measure,\n\nThen seemed to me so much of heaven enkindled\n  By the sun's flame, that neither rain nor river\n  E'er made a lake so widely spread abroad.\n\nThe newness of the sound and the great light\n  Kindled in me a longing for their cause,\n  Never before with such acuteness felt;\n\nWhence she, who saw me as I saw myself,\n  To quiet in me my perturbed mind,\n  Opened her mouth, ere I did mine to ask,\n\nAnd she began: \"Thou makest thyself so dull\n  With false imagining, that thou seest not\n  What thou wouldst see if thou hadst shaken it off.\n\nThou art not upon earth, as thou believest;\n  But lightning, fleeing its appropriate site,\n  Ne'er ran as thou, who thitherward returnest.\"\n\nIf of my former doubt I was divested\n  By these brief little words more smiled than spoken,\n  I in a new one was the more ensnared;\n\nAnd said: \"Already did I rest content\n  From great amazement; but am now amazed\n  In what way I transcend these bodies light.\"\n\nWhereupon she, after a pitying sigh,\n  Her eyes directed tow'rds me with that look\n  A mother casts on a delirious child;\n\nAnd she began: \"All things whate'er they be\n  Have order among themselves, and this is form,\n  That makes the universe resemble God.\n\nHere do the higher creatures see the footprints\n  Of the Eternal Power, which is the end\n  Whereto is made the law already mentioned.\n\nIn the order that I speak of are inclined\n  All natures, by their destinies diverse,\n  More or less near unto their origin;\n\nHence they move onward unto ports diverse\n  O'er the great sea of being; and each one\n  With instinct given it which bears it on.\n\nThis bears away the fire towards the moon;\n  This is in mortal hearts the motive power\n  This binds together and unites the earth.\n\nNor only the created things that are\n  Without intelligence this bow shoots forth,\n  But those that have both intellect and love.\n\nThe Providence that regulates all this\n  Makes with its light the heaven forever quiet,\n  Wherein that turns which has the greatest haste.\n\nAnd thither now, as to a site decreed,\n  Bears us away the virtue of that cord\n  Which aims its arrows at a joyous mark.\n\nTrue is it, that as oftentimes the form\n  Accords not with the intention of the art,\n  Because in answering is matter deaf,\n\nSo likewise from this course doth deviate\n  Sometimes the creature, who the power possesses,\n  Though thus impelled, to swerve some other way,\n\n(In the same wise as one may see the fire\n  Fall from a cloud,) if the first impetus\n  Earthward is wrested by some false delight.\n\nThou shouldst not wonder more, if well I judge,\n  At thine ascent, than at a rivulet\n  From some high mount descending to the lowland.\n\nMarvel it would be in thee, if deprived\n  Of hindrance, thou wert seated down below,\n  As if on earth the living fire were quiet.\"\n\nThereat she heavenward turned again her face.\n\n\n\nParadiso: Canto II\n\n\nO Ye, who in some pretty little boat,\n  Eager to listen, have been following\n  Behind my ship, that singing sails along,\n\nTurn back to look again upon your shores;\n  Do not put out to sea, lest peradventure,\n  In losing me, you might yourselves be lost.\n\nThe sea I sail has never yet been passed;\n  Minerva breathes, and pilots me Apollo,\n  And Muses nine point out to me the Bears.\n\nYe other few who have the neck uplifted\n  Betimes to th' bread of Angels upon which\n  One liveth here and grows not sated by it,\n\nWell may you launch upon the deep salt-sea\n  Your vessel, keeping still my wake before you\n  Upon the water that grows smooth again.\n\nThose glorious ones who unto Colchos passed\n  Were not so wonder-struck as you shall be,\n  When Jason they beheld a ploughman made!\n\nThe con-created and perpetual thirst\n  For the realm deiform did bear us on,\n  As swift almost as ye the heavens behold.\n\nUpward gazed Beatrice, and I at her;\n  And in such space perchance as strikes a bolt\n  And flies, and from the notch unlocks itself,\n\nArrived I saw me where a wondrous thing\n  Drew to itself my sight; and therefore she\n  From whom no care of mine could be concealed,\n\nTowards me turning, blithe as beautiful,\n  Said unto me: \"Fix gratefully thy mind\n  On God, who unto the first star has brought us.\"\n\nIt seemed to me a cloud encompassed us,\n  Luminous, dense, consolidate and bright\n  As adamant on which the sun is striking.\n\nInto itself did the eternal pearl\n  Receive us, even as water doth receive\n  A ray of light, remaining still unbroken.\n\nIf I was body, (and we here conceive not\n  How one dimension tolerates another,\n  Which needs must be if body enter body,)\n\nMore the desire should be enkindled in us\n  That essence to behold, wherein is seen\n  How God and our own nature were united.\n\nThere will be seen what we receive by faith,\n  Not demonstrated, but self-evident\n  In guise of the first truth that man believes.\n\nI made reply: \"Madonna, as devoutly\n  As most I can do I give thanks to Him\n  Who has removed me from the mortal world.\n\nBut tell me what the dusky spots may be\n  Upon this body, which below on earth\n  Make people tell that fabulous tale of Cain?\"\n\nSomewhat she smiled; and then, \"If the opinion\n  Of mortals be erroneous,\" she said,\n  \"Where'er the key of sense doth not unlock,\n\nCertes, the shafts of wonder should not pierce thee\n  Now, forasmuch as, following the senses,\n  Thou seest that the reason has short wings.\n\nBut tell me what thou think'st of it thyself.\"\n  And I: \"What seems to us up here diverse,\n  Is caused, I think, by bodies rare and dense.\"\n\nAnd she: \"Right truly shalt thou see immersed\n  In error thy belief, if well thou hearest\n  The argument that I shall make against it.\n\nLights many the eighth sphere displays to you\n  Which in their quality and quantity\n  May noted be of aspects different.\n\nIf this were caused by rare and dense alone,\n  One only virtue would there be in all\n  Or more or less diffused, or equally.\n\nVirtues diverse must be perforce the fruits\n  Of formal principles; and these, save one,\n  Of course would by thy reasoning be destroyed.\n\nBesides, if rarity were of this dimness\n  The cause thou askest, either through and through\n  This planet thus attenuate were of matter,\n\nOr else, as in a body is apportioned\n  The fat and lean, so in like manner this\n  Would in its volume interchange the leaves.\n\nWere it the former, in the sun's eclipse\n  It would be manifest by the shining through\n  Of light, as through aught tenuous interfused.\n\nThis is not so; hence we must scan the other,\n  And if it chance the other I demolish,\n  Then falsified will thy opinion be.\n\nBut if this rarity go not through and through,\n  There needs must be a limit, beyond which\n  Its contrary prevents the further passing,\n\nAnd thence the foreign radiance is reflected,\n  Even as a colour cometh back from glass,\n  The which behind itself concealeth lead.\n\nNow thou wilt say the sunbeam shows itself\n  More dimly there than in the other parts,\n  By being there reflected farther back.\n\nFrom this reply experiment will free thee\n  If e'er thou try it, which is wont to be\n  The fountain to the rivers of your arts.\n\nThree mirrors shalt thou take, and two remove\n  Alike from thee, the other more remote\n  Between the former two shall meet thine eyes.\n\nTurned towards these, cause that behind thy back\n  Be placed a light, illuming the three mirrors\n  And coming back to thee by all reflected.\n\nThough in its quantity be not so ample\n  The image most remote, there shalt thou see\n  How it perforce is equally resplendent.\n\nNow, as beneath the touches of warm rays\n  Naked the subject of the snow remains\n  Both of its former colour and its cold,\n\nThee thus remaining in thy intellect,\n  Will I inform with such a living light,\n  That it shall tremble in its aspect to thee.\n\nWithin the heaven of the divine repose\n  Revolves a body, in whose virtue lies\n  The being of whatever it contains.\n\nThe following heaven, that has so many eyes,\n  Divides this being by essences diverse,\n  Distinguished from it, and by it contained.\n\nThe other spheres, by various differences,\n  All the distinctions which they have within them\n  Dispose unto their ends and their effects.\n\nThus do these organs of the world proceed,\n  As thou perceivest now, from grade to grade;\n  Since from above they take, and act beneath.\n\nObserve me well, how through this place I come\n  Unto the truth thou wishest, that hereafter\n  Thou mayst alone know how to keep the ford\n\nThe power and motion of the holy spheres,\n  As from the artisan the hammer's craft,\n  Forth from the blessed motors must proceed.\n\nThe heaven, which lights so manifold make fair,\n  From the Intelligence profound, which turns it,\n  The image takes, and makes of it a seal.\n\nAnd even as the soul within your dust\n  Through members different and accommodated\n  To faculties diverse expands itself,\n\nSo likewise this Intelligence diffuses\n  Its virtue multiplied among the stars.\n  Itself revolving on its unity.\n\nVirtue diverse doth a diverse alloyage\n  Make with the precious body that it quickens,\n  In which, as life in you, it is combined.\n\nFrom the glad nature whence it is derived,\n  The mingled virtue through the body shines,\n  Even as gladness through the living pupil.\n\nFrom this proceeds whate'er from light to light\n  Appeareth different, not from dense and rare:\n  This is the formal principle that produces,\n\nAccording to its goodness, dark and bright.\"\n\n\n\nParadiso: Canto III\n\n\nThat Sun, which erst with love my bosom warmed,\n  Of beauteous truth had unto me discovered,\n  By proving and reproving, the sweet aspect.\n\nAnd, that I might confess myself convinced\n  And confident, so far as was befitting,\n  I lifted more erect my head to speak.\n\nBut there appeared a vision, which withdrew me\n  So close to it, in order to be seen,\n  That my confession I remembered not.\n\nSuch as through polished and transparent glass,\n  Or waters crystalline and undisturbed,\n  But not so deep as that their bed be lost,\n\nCome back again the outlines of our faces\n  So feeble, that a pearl on forehead white\n  Comes not less speedily unto our eyes;\n\nSuch saw I many faces prompt to speak,\n  So that I ran in error opposite\n  To that which kindled love 'twixt man and fountain.\n\nAs soon as I became aware of them,\n  Esteeming them as mirrored semblances,\n  To see of whom they were, mine eyes I turned,\n\nAnd nothing saw, and once more turned them forward\n  Direct into the light of my sweet Guide,\n  Who smiling kindled in her holy eyes.\n\n\"Marvel thou not,\" she said to me, \"because\n  I smile at this thy puerile conceit,\n  Since on the truth it trusts not yet its foot,\n\nBut turns thee, as 'tis wont, on emptiness.\n  True substances are these which thou beholdest,\n  Here relegate for breaking of some vow.\n\nTherefore speak with them, listen and believe;\n  For the true light, which giveth peace to them,\n  Permits them not to turn from it their feet.\"\n\nAnd I unto the shade that seemed most wishful\n  To speak directed me, and I began,\n  As one whom too great eagerness bewilders:\n\n\"O well-created spirit, who in the rays\n  Of life eternal dost the sweetness taste\n  Which being untasted ne'er is comprehended,\n\nGrateful 'twill be to me, if thou content me\n  Both with thy name and with your destiny.\"\n  Whereat she promptly and with laughing eyes:\n\n\"Our charity doth never shut the doors\n  Against a just desire, except as one\n  Who wills that all her court be like herself.\n\nI was a virgin sister in the world;\n  And if thy mind doth contemplate me well,\n  The being more fair will not conceal me from thee,\n\nBut thou shalt recognise I am Piccarda,\n  Who, stationed here among these other blessed,\n  Myself am blessed in the slowest sphere.\n\nAll our affections, that alone inflamed\n  Are in the pleasure of the Holy Ghost,\n  Rejoice at being of his order formed;\n\nAnd this allotment, which appears so low,\n  Therefore is given us, because our vows\n  Have been neglected and in some part void.\"\n\nWhence I to her: \"In your miraculous aspects\n  There shines I know not what of the divine,\n  Which doth transform you from our first conceptions.\n\nTherefore I was not swift in my remembrance;\n  But what thou tellest me now aids me so,\n  That the refiguring is easier to me.\n\nBut tell me, ye who in this place are happy,\n  Are you desirous of a higher place,\n  To see more or to make yourselves more friends?\"\n\nFirst with those other shades she smiled a little;\n  Thereafter answered me so full of gladness,\n  She seemed to burn in the first fire of love:\n\n\"Brother, our will is quieted by virtue\n  Of charity, that makes us wish alone\n  For what we have, nor gives us thirst for more.\n\nIf to be more exalted we aspired,\n  Discordant would our aspirations be\n  Unto the will of Him who here secludes us;\n\nWhich thou shalt see finds no place in these circles,\n  If being in charity is needful here,\n  And if thou lookest well into its nature;\n\nNay, 'tis essential to this blest existence\n  To keep itself within the will divine,\n  Whereby our very wishes are made one;\n\nSo that, as we are station above station\n  Throughout this realm, to all the realm 'tis pleasing,\n  As to the King, who makes his will our will.\n\nAnd his will is our peace; this is the sea\n  To which is moving onward whatsoever\n  It doth create, and all that nature makes.\"\n\nThen it was clear to me how everywhere\n  In heaven is Paradise, although the grace\n  Of good supreme there rain not in one measure.\n\nBut as it comes to pass, if one food sates,\n  And for another still remains the longing,\n  We ask for this, and that decline with thanks,\n\nE'en thus did I; with gesture and with word,\n  To learn from her what was the web wherein\n  She did not ply the shuttle to the end.\n\n\"A perfect life and merit high in-heaven\n  A lady o'er us,\" said she, \"by whose rule\n  Down in your world they vest and veil themselves,\n\nThat until death they may both watch and sleep\n  Beside that Spouse who every vow accepts\n  Which charity conformeth to his pleasure.\n\nTo follow her, in girlhood from the world\n  I fled, and in her habit shut myself,\n  And pledged me to the pathway of her sect.\n\nThen men accustomed unto evil more\n  Than unto good, from the sweet cloister tore me;\n  God knows what afterward my life became.\n\nThis other splendour, which to thee reveals\n  Itself on my right side, and is enkindled\n  With all the illumination of our sphere,\n\nWhat of myself I say applies to her;\n  A nun was she, and likewise from her head\n  Was ta'en the shadow of the sacred wimple.\n\nBut when she too was to the world returned\n  Against her wishes and against good usage,\n  Of the heart's veil she never was divested.\n\nOf great Costanza this is the effulgence,\n  Who from the second wind of Suabia\n  Brought forth the third and latest puissance.\"\n\nThus unto me she spake, and then began\n  \"Ave Maria\" singing, and in singing\n  Vanished, as through deep water something heavy.\n\nMy sight, that followed her as long a time\n  As it was possible, when it had lost her\n  Turned round unto the mark of more desire,\n\nAnd wholly unto Beatrice reverted;\n  But she such lightnings flashed into mine eyes,\n  That at the first my sight endured it not;\n\nAnd this in questioning more backward made me.\n\n\n\nParadiso: Canto IV\n\n\nBetween two viands, equally removed\n  And tempting, a free man would die of hunger\n  Ere either he could bring unto his teeth.\n\nSo would a lamb between the ravenings\n  Of two fierce wolves stand fearing both alike;\n  And so would stand a dog between two does.\n\nHence, if I held my peace, myself I blame not,\n  Impelled in equal measure by my doubts,\n  Since it must be so, nor do I commend.\n\nI held my peace; but my desire was painted\n  Upon my face, and questioning with that\n  More fervent far than by articulate speech.\n\nBeatrice did as Daniel had done\n  Relieving Nebuchadnezzar from the wrath\n  Which rendered him unjustly merciless,\n\nAnd said: \"Well see I how attracteth thee\n  One and the other wish, so that thy care\n  Binds itself so that forth it does not breathe.\n\nThou arguest, if good will be permanent,\n  The violence of others, for what reason\n  Doth it decrease the measure of my merit?\n\nAgain for doubting furnish thee occasion\n  Souls seeming to return unto the stars,\n  According to the sentiment of Plato.\n\nThese are the questions which upon thy wish\n  Are thrusting equally; and therefore first\n  Will I treat that which hath the most of gall.\n\nHe of the Seraphim most absorbed in God,\n  Moses, and Samuel, and whichever John\n  Thou mayst select, I say, and even Mary,\n\nHave not in any other heaven their seats,\n  Than have those spirits that just appeared to thee,\n  Nor of existence more or fewer years;\n\nBut all make beautiful the primal circle,\n  And have sweet life in different degrees,\n  By feeling more or less the eternal breath.\n\nThey showed themselves here, not because allotted\n  This sphere has been to them, but to give sign\n  Of the celestial which is least exalted.\n\nTo speak thus is adapted to your mind,\n  Since only through the sense it apprehendeth\n  What then it worthy makes of intellect.\n\nOn this account the Scripture condescends\n  Unto your faculties, and feet and hands\n  To God attributes, and means something else;\n\nAnd Holy Church under an aspect human\n  Gabriel and Michael represent to you,\n  And him who made Tobias whole again.\n\nThat which Timaeus argues of the soul\n  Doth not resemble that which here is seen,\n  Because it seems that as he speaks he thinks.\n\nHe says the soul unto its star returns,\n  Believing it to have been severed thence\n  Whenever nature gave it as a form.\n\nPerhaps his doctrine is of other guise\n  Than the words sound, and possibly may be\n  With meaning that is not to be derided.\n\nIf he doth mean that to these wheels return\n  The honour of their influence and the blame,\n  Perhaps his bow doth hit upon some truth.\n\nThis principle ill understood once warped\n  The whole world nearly, till it went astray\n  Invoking Jove and Mercury and Mars.\n\nThe other doubt which doth disquiet thee\n  Less venom has, for its malevolence\n  Could never lead thee otherwhere from me.\n\nThat as unjust our justice should appear\n  In eyes of mortals, is an argument\n  Of faith, and not of sin heretical.\n\nBut still, that your perception may be able\n  To thoroughly penetrate this verity,\n  As thou desirest, I will satisfy thee.\n\nIf it be violence when he who suffers\n  Co-operates not with him who uses force,\n  These souls were not on that account excused;\n\nFor will is never quenched unless it will,\n  But operates as nature doth in fire\n  If violence a thousand times distort it.\n\nHence, if it yieldeth more or less, it seconds\n  The force; and these have done so, having power\n  Of turning back unto the holy place.\n\nIf their will had been perfect, like to that\n  Which Lawrence fast upon his gridiron held,\n  And Mutius made severe to his own hand,\n\nIt would have urged them back along the road\n  Whence they were dragged, as soon as they were free;\n  But such a solid will is all too rare.\n\nAnd by these words, if thou hast gathered them\n  As thou shouldst do, the argument is refuted\n  That would have still annoyed thee many times.\n\nBut now another passage runs across\n  Before thine eyes, and such that by thyself\n  Thou couldst not thread it ere thou wouldst be weary.\n\nI have for certain put into thy mind\n  That soul beatified could never lie,\n  For it is near the primal Truth,\n\nAnd then thou from Piccarda might'st have heard\n  Costanza kept affection for the veil,\n  So that she seemeth here to contradict me.\n\nMany times, brother, has it come to pass,\n  That, to escape from peril, with reluctance\n  That has been done it was not right to do,\n\nE'en as Alcmaeon (who, being by his father\n  Thereto entreated, his own mother slew)\n  Not to lose pity pitiless became.\n\nAt this point I desire thee to remember\n  That force with will commingles, and they cause\n  That the offences cannot be excused.\n\nWill absolute consenteth not to evil;\n  But in so far consenteth as it fears,\n  If it refrain, to fall into more harm.\n\nHence when Piccarda uses this expression,\n  She meaneth the will absolute, and I\n  The other, so that both of us speak truth.\"\n\nSuch was the flowing of the holy river\n  That issued from the fount whence springs all truth;\n  This put to rest my wishes one and all.\n\n\"O love of the first lover, O divine,\"\n  Said I forthwith, \"whose speech inundates me\n  And warms me so, it more and more revives me,\n\nMy own affection is not so profound\n  As to suffice in rendering grace for grace;\n  Let Him, who sees and can, thereto respond.\n\nWell I perceive that never sated is\n  Our intellect unless the Truth illume it,\n  Beyond which nothing true expands itself.\n\nIt rests therein, as wild beast in his lair,\n  When it attains it; and it can attain it;\n  If not, then each desire would frustrate be.\n\nTherefore springs up, in fashion of a shoot,\n  Doubt at the foot of truth; and this is nature,\n  Which to the top from height to height impels us.\n\nThis doth invite me, this assurance give me\n  With reverence, Lady, to inquire of you\n  Another truth, which is obscure to me.\n\nI wish to know if man can satisfy you\n  For broken vows with other good deeds, so\n  That in your balance they will not be light.\"\n\nBeatrice gazed upon me with her eyes\n  Full of the sparks of love, and so divine,\n  That, overcome my power, I turned my back\n\nAnd almost lost myself with eyes downcast.\n\n\n\nParadiso: Canto V\n\n\n\"If in the heat of love I flame upon thee\n  Beyond the measure that on earth is seen,\n  So that the valour of thine eyes I vanquish,\n\nMarvel thou not thereat; for this proceeds\n  From perfect sight, which as it apprehends\n  To the good apprehended moves its feet.\n\nWell I perceive how is already shining\n  Into thine intellect the eternal light,\n  That only seen enkindles always love;\n\nAnd if some other thing your love seduce,\n  'Tis nothing but a vestige of the same,\n  Ill understood, which there is shining through.\n\nThou fain wouldst know if with another service\n  For broken vow can such return be made\n  As to secure the soul from further claim.\"\n\nThis Canto thus did Beatrice begin;\n  And, as a man who breaks not off his speech,\n  Continued thus her holy argument:\n\n\"The greatest gift that in his largess God\n  Creating made, and unto his own goodness\n  Nearest conformed, and that which he doth prize\n\nMost highly, is the freedom of the will,\n  Wherewith the creatures of intelligence\n  Both all and only were and are endowed.\n\nNow wilt thou see, if thence thou reasonest,\n  The high worth of a vow, if it he made\n  So that when thou consentest God consents:\n\nFor, closing between God and man the compact,\n  A sacrifice is of this treasure made,\n  Such as I say, and made by its own act.\n\nWhat can be rendered then as compensation?\n  Think'st thou to make good use of what thou'st offered,\n  With gains ill gotten thou wouldst do good deed.\n\nNow art thou certain of the greater point;\n  But because Holy Church in this dispenses,\n  Which seems against the truth which I have shown thee,\n\nBehoves thee still to sit awhile at table,\n  Because the solid food which thou hast taken\n  Requireth further aid for thy digestion.\n\nOpen thy mind to that which I reveal,\n  And fix it there within; for 'tis not knowledge,\n  The having heard without retaining it.\n\nIn the essence of this sacrifice two things\n  Convene together; and the one is that\n  Of which 'tis made, the other is the agreement.\n\nThis last for evermore is cancelled not\n  Unless complied with, and concerning this\n  With such precision has above been spoken.\n\nTherefore it was enjoined upon the Hebrews\n  To offer still, though sometimes what was offered\n  Might be commuted, as thou ought'st to know.\n\nThe other, which is known to thee as matter,\n  May well indeed be such that one errs not\n  If it for other matter be exchanged.\n\nBut let none shift the burden on his shoulder\n  At his arbitrament, without the turning\n  Both of the white and of the yellow key;\n\nAnd every permutation deem as foolish,\n  If in the substitute the thing relinquished,\n  As the four is in six, be not contained.\n\nTherefore whatever thing has so great weight\n  In value that it drags down every balance,\n  Cannot be satisfied with other spending.\n\nLet mortals never take a vow in jest;\n  Be faithful and not blind in doing that,\n  As Jephthah was in his first offering,\n\nWhom more beseemed to say, 'I have done wrong,\n  Than to do worse by keeping; and as foolish\n  Thou the great leader of the Greeks wilt find,\n\nWhence wept Iphigenia her fair face,\n  And made for her both wise and simple weep,\n  Who heard such kind of worship spoken of.'\n\nChristians, be ye more serious in your movements;\n  Be ye not like a feather at each wind,\n  And think not every water washes you.\n\nYe have the Old and the New Testament,\n  And the Pastor of the Church who guideth you\n  Let this suffice you unto your salvation.\n\nIf evil appetite cry aught else to you,\n  Be ye as men, and not as silly sheep,\n  So that the Jew among you may not mock you.\n\nBe ye not as the lamb that doth abandon\n  Its mother's milk, and frolicsome and simple\n  Combats at its own pleasure with itself.\"\n\nThus Beatrice to me even as I write it;\n  Then all desireful turned herself again\n  To that part where the world is most alive.\n\nHer silence and her change of countenance\n  Silence imposed upon my eager mind,\n  That had already in advance new questions;\n\nAnd as an arrow that upon the mark\n  Strikes ere the bowstring quiet hath become,\n  So did we speed into the second realm.\n\nMy Lady there so joyful I beheld,\n  As into the brightness of that heaven she entered,\n  More luminous thereat the planet grew;\n\nAnd if the star itself was changed and smiled,\n  What became I, who by my nature am\n  Exceeding mutable in every guise!\n\nAs, in a fish-pond which is pure and tranquil,\n  The fishes draw to that which from without\n  Comes in such fashion that their food they deem it;\n\nSo I beheld more than a thousand splendours\n  Drawing towards us, and in each was heard:\n  \"Lo, this is she who shall increase our love.\"\n\nAnd as each one was coming unto us,\n  Full of beatitude the shade was seen,\n  By the effulgence clear that issued from it.\n\nThink, Reader, if what here is just beginning\n  No farther should proceed, how thou wouldst have\n  An agonizing need of knowing more;\n\nAnd of thyself thou'lt see how I from these\n  Was in desire of hearing their conditions,\n  As they unto mine eyes were manifest.\n\n\"O thou well-born, unto whom Grace concedes\n  To see the thrones of the eternal triumph,\n  Or ever yet the warfare be abandoned\n\nWith light that through the whole of heaven is spread\n  Kindled are we, and hence if thou desirest\n  To know of us, at thine own pleasure sate thee.\"\n\nThus by some one among those holy spirits\n  Was spoken, and by Beatrice: \"Speak, speak\n  Securely, and believe them even as Gods.\"\n\n\"Well I perceive how thou dost nest thyself\n  In thine own light, and drawest it from thine eyes,\n  Because they coruscate when thou dost smile,\n\nBut know not who thou art, nor why thou hast,\n  Spirit august, thy station in the sphere\n  That veils itself to men in alien rays.\"\n\nThis said I in direction of the light\n  Which first had spoken to me; whence it became\n  By far more lucent than it was before.\n\nEven as the sun, that doth conceal himself\n  By too much light, when heat has worn away\n  The tempering influence of the vapours dense,\n\nBy greater rapture thus concealed itself\n  In its own radiance the figure saintly,\n  And thus close, close enfolded answered me\n\nIn fashion as the following Canto sings.\n\n\n\nParadiso: Canto VI\n\n\n\"After that Constantine the eagle turned\n  Against the course of heaven, which it had followed\n  Behind the ancient who Lavinia took,\n\nTwo hundred years and more the bird of God\n  In the extreme of Europe held itself,\n  Near to the mountains whence it issued first;\n\nAnd under shadow of the sacred plumes\n  It governed there the world from hand to hand,\n  And, changing thus, upon mine own alighted.\n\nCaesar I was, and am Justinian,\n  Who, by the will of primal Love I feel,\n  Took from the laws the useless and redundant;\n\nAnd ere unto the work I was attent,\n  One nature to exist in Christ, not more,\n  Believed, and with such faith was I contented.\n\nBut blessed Agapetus, he who was\n  The supreme pastor, to the faith sincere\n  Pointed me out the way by words of his.\n\nHim I believed, and what was his assertion\n  I now see clearly, even as thou seest\n  Each contradiction to be false and true.\n\nAs soon as with the Church I moved my feet,\n  God in his grace it pleased with this high task\n  To inspire me, and I gave me wholly to it,\n\nAnd to my Belisarius I commended\n  The arms, to which was heaven's right hand so joined\n  It was a signal that I should repose.\n\nNow here to the first question terminates\n  My answer; but the character thereof\n  Constrains me to continue with a sequel,\n\nIn order that thou see with how great reason\n  Men move against the standard sacrosanct,\n  Both who appropriate and who oppose it.\n\nBehold how great a power has made it worthy\n  Of reverence, beginning from the hour\n  When Pallas died to give it sovereignty.\n\nThou knowest it made in Alba its abode\n  Three hundred years and upward, till at last\n  The three to three fought for it yet again.\n\nThou knowest what it achieved from Sabine wrong\n  Down to Lucretia's sorrow, in seven kings\n  O'ercoming round about the neighboring nations;\n\nThou knowest what it achieved, borne by the Romans\n  Illustrious against Brennus, against Pyrrhus,\n  Against the other princes and confederates.\n\nTorquatus thence and Quinctius, who from locks\n  Unkempt was named, Decii and Fabii,\n  Received the fame I willingly embalm;\n\nIt struck to earth the pride of the Arabians,\n  Who, following Hannibal, had passed across\n  The Alpine ridges, Po, from which thou glidest;\n\nBeneath it triumphed while they yet were young\n  Pompey and Scipio, and to the hill\n  Beneath which thou wast born it bitter seemed;\n\nThen, near unto the time when heaven had willed\n  To bring the whole world to its mood serene,\n  Did Caesar by the will of Rome assume it.\n\nWhat it achieved from Var unto the Rhine,\n  Isere beheld and Saone, beheld the Seine,\n  And every valley whence the Rhone is filled;\n\nWhat it achieved when it had left Ravenna,\n  And leaped the Rubicon, was such a flight\n  That neither tongue nor pen could follow it.\n\nRound towards Spain it wheeled its legions; then\n  Towards Durazzo, and Pharsalia smote\n  That to the calid Nile was felt the pain.\n\nAntandros and the Simois, whence it started,\n  It saw again, and there where Hector lies,\n  And ill for Ptolemy then roused itself.\n\nFrom thence it came like lightning upon Juba;\n  Then wheeled itself again into your West,\n  Where the Pompeian clarion it heard.\n\nFrom what it wrought with the next standard-bearer\n  Brutus and Cassius howl in Hell together,\n  And Modena and Perugia dolent were;\n\nStill doth the mournful Cleopatra weep\n  Because thereof, who, fleeing from before it,\n  Took from the adder sudden and black death.\n\nWith him it ran even to the Red Sea shore;\n  With him it placed the world in so great peace,\n  That unto Janus was his temple closed.\n\nBut what the standard that has made me speak\n  Achieved before, and after should achieve\n  Throughout the mortal realm that lies beneath it,\n\nBecometh in appearance mean and dim,\n  If in the hand of the third Caesar seen\n  With eye unclouded and affection pure,\n\nBecause the living Justice that inspires me\n  Granted it, in the hand of him I speak of,\n  The glory of doing vengeance for its wrath.\n\nNow here attend to what I answer thee;\n  Later it ran with Titus to do vengeance\n  Upon the vengeance of the ancient sin.\n\nAnd when the tooth of Lombardy had bitten\n  The Holy Church, then underneath its wings\n  Did Charlemagne victorious succor her.\n\nNow hast thou power to judge of such as those\n  Whom I accused above, and of their crimes,\n  Which are the cause of all your miseries.\n\nTo the public standard one the yellow lilies\n  Opposes, the other claims it for a party,\n  So that 'tis hard to see which sins the most.\n\nLet, let the Ghibellines ply their handicraft\n  Beneath some other standard; for this ever\n  Ill follows he who it and justice parts.\n\nAnd let not this new Charles e'er strike it down,\n  He and his Guelfs, but let him fear the talons\n  That from a nobler lion stripped the fell.\n\nAlready oftentimes the sons have wept\n  The father's crime; and let him not believe\n  That God will change His scutcheon for the lilies.\n\nThis little planet doth adorn itself\n  With the good spirits that have active been,\n  That fame and honour might come after them;\n\nAnd whensoever the desires mount thither,\n  Thus deviating, must perforce the rays\n  Of the true love less vividly mount upward.\n\nBut in commensuration of our wages\n  With our desert is portion of our joy,\n  Because we see them neither less nor greater.\n\nHerein doth living Justice sweeten so\n  Affection in us, that for evermore\n  It cannot warp to any iniquity.\n\nVoices diverse make up sweet melodies;\n  So in this life of ours the seats diverse\n  Render sweet harmony among these spheres;\n\nAnd in the compass of this present pearl\n  Shineth the sheen of Romeo, of whom\n  The grand and beauteous work was ill rewarded.\n\nBut the Provencals who against him wrought,\n  They have not laughed, and therefore ill goes he\n  Who makes his hurt of the good deeds of others.\n\nFour daughters, and each one of them a queen,\n  Had Raymond Berenger, and this for him\n  Did Romeo, a poor man and a pilgrim;\n\nAnd then malicious words incited him\n  To summon to a reckoning this just man,\n  Who rendered to him seven and five for ten.\n\nThen he departed poor and stricken in years,\n  And if the world could know the heart he had,\n  In begging bit by bit his livelihood,\n\nThough much it laud him, it would laud him more.\"\n\n\n\nParadiso: Canto VII\n\n\n\"Osanna sanctus Deus Sabaoth,\n  Superillustrans claritate tua\n  Felices ignes horum malahoth!\"\n\nIn this wise, to his melody returning,\n  This substance, upon which a double light\n  Doubles itself, was seen by me to sing,\n\nAnd to their dance this and the others moved,\n  And in the manner of swift-hurrying sparks\n  Veiled themselves from me with a sudden distance.\n\nDoubting was I, and saying, \"Tell her, tell her,\"\n  Within me, \"tell her,\" saying, \"tell my Lady,\"\n  Who slakes my thirst with her sweet effluences;\n\nAnd yet that reverence which doth lord it over\n  The whole of me only by B and ICE,\n  Bowed me again like unto one who drowses.\n\nShort while did Beatrice endure me thus;\n  And she began, lighting me with a smile\n  Such as would make one happy in the fire:\n\n\"According to infallible advisement,\n  After what manner a just vengeance justly\n  Could be avenged has put thee upon thinking,\n\nBut I will speedily thy mind unloose;\n  And do thou listen, for these words of mine\n  Of a great doctrine will a present make thee.\n\nBy not enduring on the power that wills\n  Curb for his good, that man who ne'er was born,\n  Damning himself damned all his progeny;\n\nWhereby the human species down below\n  Lay sick for many centuries in great error,\n  Till to descend it pleased the Word of God\n\nTo where the nature, which from its own Maker\n  Estranged itself, he joined to him in person\n  By the sole act of his eternal love.\n\nNow unto what is said direct thy sight;\n  This nature when united to its Maker,\n  Such as created, was sincere and good;\n\nBut by itself alone was banished forth\n  From Paradise, because it turned aside\n  Out of the way of truth and of its life.\n\nTherefore the penalty the cross held out,\n  If measured by the nature thus assumed,\n  None ever yet with so great justice stung,\n\nAnd none was ever of so great injustice,\n  Considering who the Person was that suffered,\n  Within whom such a nature was contracted.\n\nFrom one act therefore issued things diverse;\n  To God and to the Jews one death was pleasing;\n  Earth trembled at it and the Heaven was opened.\n\nIt should no longer now seem difficult\n  To thee, when it is said that a just vengeance\n  By a just court was afterward avenged.\n\nBut now do I behold thy mind entangled\n  From thought to thought within a knot, from which\n  With great desire it waits to free itself.\n\nThou sayest, 'Well discern I what I hear;\n  But it is hidden from me why God willed\n  For our redemption only this one mode.'\n\nBuried remaineth, brother, this decree\n  Unto the eyes of every one whose nature\n  Is in the flame of love not yet adult.\n\nVerily, inasmuch as at this mark\n  One gazes long and little is discerned,\n  Wherefore this mode was worthiest will I say.\n\nGoodness Divine, which from itself doth spurn\n  All envy, burning in itself so sparkles\n  That the eternal beauties it unfolds.\n\nWhate'er from this immediately distils\n  Has afterwards no end, for ne'er removed\n  Is its impression when it sets its seal.\n\nWhate'er from this immediately rains down\n  Is wholly free, because it is not subject\n  Unto the influences of novel things.\n\nThe more conformed thereto, the more it pleases;\n  For the blest ardour that irradiates all things\n  In that most like itself is most vivacious.\n\nWith all of these things has advantaged been\n  The human creature; and if one be wanting,\n  From his nobility he needs must fall.\n\n'Tis sin alone which doth disfranchise him,\n  And render him unlike the Good Supreme,\n  So that he little with its light is blanched,\n\nAnd to his dignity no more returns,\n  Unless he fill up where transgression empties\n  With righteous pains for criminal delights.\n\nYour nature when it sinned so utterly\n  In its own seed, out of these dignities\n  Even as out of Paradise was driven,\n\nNor could itself recover, if thou notest\n  With nicest subtilty, by any way,\n  Except by passing one of these two fords:\n\nEither that God through clemency alone\n  Had pardon granted, or that man himself\n  Had satisfaction for his folly made.\n\nFix now thine eye deep into the abyss\n  Of the eternal counsel, to my speech\n  As far as may be fastened steadfastly!\n\nMan in his limitations had not power\n  To satisfy, not having power to sink\n  In his humility obeying then,\n\nFar as he disobeying thought to rise;\n  And for this reason man has been from power\n  Of satisfying by himself excluded.\n\nTherefore it God behoved in his own ways\n  Man to restore unto his perfect life,\n  I say in one, or else in both of them.\n\nBut since the action of the doer is\n  So much more grateful, as it more presents\n  The goodness of the heart from which it issues,\n\nGoodness Divine, that doth imprint the world,\n  Has been contented to proceed by each\n  And all its ways to lift you up again;\n\nNor 'twixt the first day and the final night\n  Such high and such magnificent proceeding\n  By one or by the other was or shall be;\n\nFor God more bounteous was himself to give\n  To make man able to uplift himself,\n  Than if he only of himself had pardoned;\n\nAnd all the other modes were insufficient\n  For justice, were it not the Son of God\n  Himself had humbled to become incarnate.\n\nNow, to fill fully each desire of thine,\n  Return I to elucidate one place,\n  In order that thou there mayst see as I do.\n\nThou sayst: 'I see the air, I see the fire,\n  The water, and the earth, and all their mixtures\n  Come to corruption, and short while endure;\n\nAnd these things notwithstanding were created;'\n  Therefore if that which I have said were true,\n  They should have been secure against corruption.\n\nThe Angels, brother, and the land sincere\n  In which thou art, created may be called\n  Just as they are in their entire existence;\n\nBut all the elements which thou hast named,\n  And all those things which out of them are made,\n  By a created virtue are informed.\n\nCreated was the matter which they have;\n  Created was the informing influence\n  Within these stars that round about them go.\n\nThe soul of every brute and of the plants\n  By its potential temperament attracts\n  The ray and motion of the holy lights;\n\nBut your own life immediately inspires\n  Supreme Beneficence, and enamours it\n  So with herself, it evermore desires her.\n\nAnd thou from this mayst argue furthermore\n  Your resurrection, if thou think again\n  How human flesh was fashioned at that time\n\nWhen the first parents both of them were made.\"\n\n\n\nParadiso: Canto VIII\n\n\nThe world used in its peril to believe\n  That the fair Cypria delirious love\n  Rayed out, in the third epicycle turning;\n\nWherefore not only unto her paid honour\n  Of sacrifices and of votive cry\n  The ancient nations in the ancient error,\n\nBut both Dione honoured they and Cupid,\n  That as her mother, this one as her son,\n  And said that he had sat in Dido's lap;\n\nAnd they from her, whence I beginning take,\n  Took the denomination of the star\n  That woos the sun, now following, now in front.\n\nI was not ware of our ascending to it;\n  But of our being in it gave full faith\n  My Lady whom I saw more beauteous grow.\n\nAnd as within a flame a spark is seen,\n  And as within a voice a voice discerned,\n  When one is steadfast, and one comes and goes,\n\nWithin that light beheld I other lamps\n  Move in a circle, speeding more and less,\n  Methinks in measure of their inward vision.\n\nFrom a cold cloud descended never winds,\n  Or visible or not, so rapidly\n  They would not laggard and impeded seem\n\nTo any one who had those lights divine\n  Seen come towards us, leaving the gyration\n  Begun at first in the high Seraphim.\n\nAnd behind those that most in front appeared\n  Sounded \"Osanna!\" so that never since\n  To hear again was I without desire.\n\nThen unto us more nearly one approached,\n  And it alone began: \"We all are ready\n  Unto thy pleasure, that thou joy in us.\n\nWe turn around with the celestial Princes,\n  One gyre and one gyration and one thirst,\n  To whom thou in the world of old didst say,\n\n'Ye who, intelligent, the third heaven are moving;'\n  And are so full of love, to pleasure thee\n  A little quiet will not be less sweet.\"\n\nAfter these eyes of mine themselves had offered\n  Unto my Lady reverently, and she\n  Content and certain of herself had made them,\n\nBack to the light they turned, which so great promise\n  Made of itself, and \"Say, who art thou?\" was\n  My voice, imprinted with a great affection.\n\nO how and how much I beheld it grow\n  With the new joy that superadded was\n  Unto its joys, as soon as I had spoken!\n\nThus changed, it said to me: \"The world possessed me\n  Short time below; and, if it had been more,\n  Much evil will be which would not have been.\n\nMy gladness keepeth me concealed from thee,\n  Which rayeth round about me, and doth hide me\n  Like as a creature swathed in its own silk.\n\nMuch didst thou love me, and thou hadst good reason;\n  For had I been below, I should have shown thee\n  Somewhat beyond the foliage of my love.\n\nThat left-hand margin, which doth bathe itself\n  In Rhone, when it is mingled with the Sorgue,\n  Me for its lord awaited in due time,\n\nAnd that horn of Ausonia, which is towned\n  With Bari, with Gaeta and Catona,\n  Whence Tronto and Verde in the sea disgorge.\n\nAlready flashed upon my brow the crown\n  Of that dominion which the Danube waters\n  After the German borders it abandons;\n\nAnd beautiful Trinacria, that is murky\n  'Twixt Pachino and Peloro, (on the gulf\n  Which greatest scath from Eurus doth receive,)\n\nNot through Typhoeus, but through nascent sulphur,\n  Would have awaited her own monarchs still,\n  Through me from Charles descended and from Rudolph,\n\nIf evil lordship, that exasperates ever\n  The subject populations, had not moved\n  Palermo to the outcry of 'Death! death!'\n\nAnd if my brother could but this foresee,\n  The greedy poverty of Catalonia\n  Straight would he flee, that it might not molest him;\n\nFor verily 'tis needful to provide,\n  Through him or other, so that on his bark\n  Already freighted no more freight be placed.\n\nHis nature, which from liberal covetous\n  Descended, such a soldiery would need\n  As should not care for hoarding in a chest.\"\n\n\"Because I do believe the lofty joy\n  Thy speech infuses into me, my Lord,\n  Where every good thing doth begin and end\n\nThou seest as I see it, the more grateful\n  Is it to me; and this too hold I dear,\n  That gazing upon God thou dost discern it.\n\nGlad hast thou made me; so make clear to me,\n  Since speaking thou hast stirred me up to doubt,\n  How from sweet seed can bitter issue forth.\"\n\nThis I to him; and he to me: \"If I\n  Can show to thee a truth, to what thou askest\n  Thy face thou'lt hold as thou dost hold thy back.\n\nThe Good which all the realm thou art ascending\n  Turns and contents, maketh its providence\n  To be a power within these bodies vast;\n\nAnd not alone the natures are foreseen\n  Within the mind that in itself is perfect,\n  But they together with their preservation.\n\nFor whatsoever thing this bow shoots forth\n  Falls foreordained unto an end foreseen,\n  Even as a shaft directed to its mark.\n\nIf that were not, the heaven which thou dost walk\n  Would in such manner its effects produce,\n  That they no longer would be arts, but ruins.\n\nThis cannot be, if the Intelligences\n  That keep these stars in motion are not maimed,\n  And maimed the First that has not made them perfect.\n\nWilt thou this truth have clearer made to thee?\"\n  And I: \"Not so; for 'tis impossible\n  That nature tire, I see, in what is needful.\"\n\nWhence he again: \"Now say, would it be worse\n  For men on earth were they not citizens?\"\n  \"Yes,\" I replied; \"and here I ask no reason.\"\n\n\"And can they be so, if below they live not\n  Diversely unto offices diverse?\n  No, if your master writeth well for you.\"\n\nSo came he with deductions to this point;\n  Then he concluded: \"Therefore it behoves\n  The roots of your effects to be diverse.\n\nHence one is Solon born, another Xerxes,\n  Another Melchisedec, and another he\n  Who, flying through the air, his son did lose.\n\nRevolving Nature, which a signet is\n  To mortal wax, doth practise well her art,\n  But not one inn distinguish from another;\n\nThence happens it that Esau differeth\n  In seed from Jacob; and Quirinus comes\n  From sire so vile that he is given to Mars.\n\nA generated nature its own way\n  Would always make like its progenitors,\n  If Providence divine were not triumphant.\n\nNow that which was behind thee is before thee;\n  But that thou know that I with thee am pleased,\n  With a corollary will I mantle thee.\n\nEvermore nature, if it fortune find\n  Discordant to it, like each other seed\n  Out of its region, maketh evil thrift;\n\nAnd if the world below would fix its mind\n  On the foundation which is laid by nature,\n  Pursuing that, 'twould have the people good.\n\nBut you unto religion wrench aside\n  Him who was born to gird him with the sword,\n  And make a king of him who is for sermons;\n\nTherefore your footsteps wander from the road.\"\n\n\n\nParadiso: Canto IX\n\n\nBeautiful Clemence, after that thy Charles\n  Had me enlightened, he narrated to me\n  The treacheries his seed should undergo;\n\nBut said: \"Be still and let the years roll round;\"\n  So I can only say, that lamentation\n  Legitimate shall follow on your wrongs.\n\nAnd of that holy light the life already\n  Had to the Sun which fills it turned again,\n  As to that good which for each thing sufficeth.\n\nAh, souls deceived, and creatures impious,\n  Who from such good do turn away your hearts,\n  Directing upon vanity your foreheads!\n\nAnd now, behold, another of those splendours\n  Approached me, and its will to pleasure me\n  It signified by brightening outwardly.\n\nThe eyes of Beatrice, that fastened were\n  Upon me, as before, of dear assent\n  To my desire assurance gave to me.\n\n\"Ah, bring swift compensation to my wish,\n  Thou blessed spirit,\" I said, \"and give me proof\n  That what I think in thee I can reflect!\"\n\nWhereat the light, that still was new to me,\n  Out of its depths, whence it before was singing,\n  As one delighted to do good, continued:\n\n\"Within that region of the land depraved\n  Of Italy, that lies between Rialto\n  And fountain-heads of Brenta and of Piava,\n\nRises a hill, and mounts not very high,\n  Wherefrom descended formerly a torch\n  That made upon that region great assault.\n\nOut of one root were born both I and it;\n  Cunizza was I called, and here I shine\n  Because the splendour of this star o'ercame me.\n\nBut gladly to myself the cause I pardon\n  Of my allotment, and it does not grieve me;\n  Which would perhaps seem strong unto your vulgar.\n\nOf this so luculent and precious jewel,\n  Which of our heaven is nearest unto me,\n  Great fame remained; and ere it die away\n\nThis hundredth year shall yet quintupled be.\n  See if man ought to make him excellent,\n  So that another life the first may leave!\n\nAnd thus thinks not the present multitude\n  Shut in by Adige and Tagliamento,\n  Nor yet for being scourged is penitent.\n\nBut soon 'twill be that Padua in the marsh\n  Will change the water that Vicenza bathes,\n  Because the folk are stubborn against duty;\n\nAnd where the Sile and Cagnano join\n  One lordeth it, and goes with lofty head,\n  For catching whom e'en now the net is making.\n\nFeltro moreover of her impious pastor\n  Shall weep the crime, which shall so monstrous be\n  That for the like none ever entered Malta.\n\nAmple exceedingly would be the vat\n  That of the Ferrarese could hold the blood,\n  And weary who should weigh it ounce by ounce,\n\nOf which this courteous priest shall make a gift\n  To show himself a partisan; and such gifts\n  Will to the living of the land conform.\n\nAbove us there are mirrors, Thrones you call them,\n  From which shines out on us God Judicant,\n  So that this utterance seems good to us.\"\n\nHere it was silent, and it had the semblance\n  Of being turned elsewhither, by the wheel\n  On which it entered as it was before.\n\nThe other joy, already known to me,\n  Became a thing transplendent in my sight,\n  As a fine ruby smitten by the sun.\n\nThrough joy effulgence is acquired above,\n  As here a smile; but down below, the shade\n  Outwardly darkens, as the mind is sad.\n\n\"God seeth all things, and in Him, blest spirit,\n  Thy sight is,\" said I, \"so that never will\n  Of his can possibly from thee be hidden;\n\nThy voice, then, that for ever makes the heavens\n  Glad, with the singing of those holy fires\n  Which of their six wings make themselves a cowl,\n\nWherefore does it not satisfy my longings?\n  Indeed, I would not wait thy questioning\n  If I in thee were as thou art in me.\"\n\n\"The greatest of the valleys where the water\n  Expands itself,\" forthwith its words began,\n  \"That sea excepted which the earth engarlands,\n\nBetween discordant shores against the sun\n  Extends so far, that it meridian makes\n  Where it was wont before to make the horizon.\n\nI was a dweller on that valley's shore\n  'Twixt Ebro and Magra that with journey short\n  Doth from the Tuscan part the Genoese.\n\nWith the same sunset and same sunrise nearly\n  Sit Buggia and the city whence I was,\n  That with its blood once made the harbour hot.\n\nFolco that people called me unto whom\n  My name was known; and now with me this heaven\n  Imprints itself, as I did once with it;\n\nFor more the daughter of Belus never burned,\n  Offending both Sichaeus and Creusa,\n  Than I, so long as it became my locks,\n\nNor yet that Rodophean, who deluded\n  was by Demophoon, nor yet Alcides,\n  When Iole he in his heart had locked.\n\nYet here is no repenting, but we smile,\n  Not at the fault, which comes not back to mind,\n  But at the power which ordered and foresaw.\n\nHere we behold the art that doth adorn\n  With such affection, and the good discover\n  Whereby the world above turns that below.\n\nBut that thou wholly satisfied mayst bear\n  Thy wishes hence which in this sphere are born,\n  Still farther to proceed behoveth me.\n\nThou fain wouldst know who is within this light\n  That here beside me thus is scintillating,\n  Even as a sunbeam in the limpid water.\n\nThen know thou, that within there is at rest\n  Rahab, and being to our order joined,\n  With her in its supremest grade 'tis sealed.\n\nInto this heaven, where ends the shadowy cone\n  Cast by your world, before all other souls\n  First of Christ's triumph was she taken up.\n\nFull meet it was to leave her in some heaven,\n  Even as a palm of the high victory\n  Which he acquired with one palm and the other,\n\nBecause she favoured the first glorious deed\n  Of Joshua upon the Holy Land,\n  That little stirs the memory of the Pope.\n\nThy city, which an offshoot is of him\n  Who first upon his Maker turned his back,\n  And whose ambition is so sorely wept,\n\nBrings forth and scatters the accursed flower\n  Which both the sheep and lambs hath led astray\n  Since it has turned the shepherd to a wolf.\n\nFor this the Evangel and the mighty Doctors\n  Are derelict, and only the Decretals\n  So studied that it shows upon their margins.\n\nOn this are Pope and Cardinals intent;\n  Their meditations reach not Nazareth,\n  There where his pinions Gabriel unfolded;\n\nBut Vatican and the other parts elect\n  Of Rome, which have a cemetery been\n  Unto the soldiery that followed Peter\n\nShall soon be free from this adultery.\"\n\n\n\nParadiso: Canto X\n\n\nLooking into his Son with all the Love\n  Which each of them eternally breathes forth,\n  The Primal and unutterable Power\n\nWhate'er before the mind or eye revolves\n  With so much order made, there can be none\n  Who this beholds without enjoying Him.\n\nLift up then, Reader, to the lofty wheels\n  With me thy vision straight unto that part\n  Where the one motion on the other strikes,\n\nAnd there begin to contemplate with joy\n  That Master's art, who in himself so loves it\n  That never doth his eye depart therefrom.\n\nBehold how from that point goes branching off\n  The oblique circle, which conveys the planets,\n  To satisfy the world that calls upon them;\n\nAnd if their pathway were not thus inflected,\n  Much virtue in the heavens would be in vain,\n  And almost every power below here dead.\n\nIf from the straight line distant more or less\n  Were the departure, much would wanting be\n  Above and underneath of mundane order.\n\nRemain now, Reader, still upon thy bench,\n  In thought pursuing that which is foretasted,\n  If thou wouldst jocund be instead of weary.\n\nI've set before thee; henceforth feed thyself,\n  For to itself diverteth all my care\n  That theme whereof I have been made the scribe.\n\nThe greatest of the ministers of nature,\n  Who with the power of heaven the world imprints\n  And measures with his light the time for us,\n\nWith that part which above is called to mind\n  Conjoined, along the spirals was revolving,\n  Where each time earlier he presents himself;\n\nAnd I was with him; but of the ascending\n  I was not conscious, saving as a man\n  Of a first thought is conscious ere it come;\n\nAnd Beatrice, she who is seen to pass\n  From good to better, and so suddenly\n  That not by time her action is expressed,\n\nHow lucent in herself must she have been!\n  And what was in the sun, wherein I entered,\n  Apparent not by colour but by light,\n\nI, though I call on genius, art, and practice,\n  Cannot so tell that it could be imagined;\n  Believe one can, and let him long to see it.\n\nAnd if our fantasies too lowly are\n  For altitude so great, it is no marvel,\n  Since o'er the sun was never eye could go.\n\nSuch in this place was the fourth family\n  Of the high Father, who forever sates it,\n  Showing how he breathes forth and how begets.\n\nAnd Beatrice began: \"Give thanks, give thanks\n  Unto the Sun of Angels, who to this\n  Sensible one has raised thee by his grace!\"\n\nNever was heart of mortal so disposed\n  To worship, nor to give itself to God\n  With all its gratitude was it so ready,\n\nAs at those words did I myself become;\n  And all my love was so absorbed in Him,\n  That in oblivion Beatrice was eclipsed.\n\nNor this displeased her; but she smiled at it\n  So that the splendour of her laughing eyes\n  My single mind on many things divided.\n\nLights many saw I, vivid and triumphant,\n  Make us a centre and themselves a circle,\n  More sweet in voice than luminous in aspect.\n\nThus girt about the daughter of Latona\n  We sometimes see, when pregnant is the air,\n  So that it holds the thread which makes her zone.\n\nWithin the court of Heaven, whence I return,\n  Are many jewels found, so fair and precious\n  They cannot be transported from the realm;\n\nAnd of them was the singing of those lights.\n  Who takes not wings that he may fly up thither,\n  The tidings thence may from the dumb await!\n\nAs soon as singing thus those burning suns\n  Had round about us whirled themselves three times,\n  Like unto stars neighbouring the steadfast poles,\n\nLadies they seemed, not from the dance released,\n  But who stop short, in silence listening\n  Till they have gathered the new melody.\n\nAnd within one I heard beginning: \"When\n  The radiance of grace, by which is kindled\n  True love, and which thereafter grows by loving,\n\nWithin thee multiplied is so resplendent\n  That it conducts thee upward by that stair,\n  Where without reascending none descends,\n\nWho should deny the wine out of his vial\n  Unto thy thirst, in liberty were not\n  Except as water which descends not seaward.\n\nFain wouldst thou know with what plants is enflowered\n  This garland that encircles with delight\n  The Lady fair who makes thee strong for heaven.\n\nOf the lambs was I of the holy flock\n  Which Dominic conducteth by a road\n  Where well one fattens if he strayeth not.\n\nHe who is nearest to me on the right\n  My brother and master was; and he Albertus\n  Is of Cologne, I Thomas of Aquinum.\n\nIf thou of all the others wouldst be certain,\n  Follow behind my speaking with thy sight\n  Upward along the blessed garland turning.\n\nThat next effulgence issues from the smile\n  Of Gratian, who assisted both the courts\n  In such wise that it pleased in Paradise.\n\nThe other which near by adorns our choir\n  That Peter was who, e'en as the poor widow,\n  Offered his treasure unto Holy Church.\n\nThe fifth light, that among us is the fairest,\n  Breathes forth from such a love, that all the world\n  Below is greedy to learn tidings of it.\n\nWithin it is the lofty mind, where knowledge\n  So deep was put, that, if the true be true,\n  To see so much there never rose a second.\n\nThou seest next the lustre of that taper,\n  Which in the flesh below looked most within\n  The angelic nature and its ministry.\n\nWithin that other little light is smiling\n  The advocate of the Christian centuries,\n  Out of whose rhetoric Augustine was furnished.\n\nNow if thou trainest thy mind's eye along\n  From light to light pursuant of my praise,\n  With thirst already of the eighth thou waitest.\n\nBy seeing every good therein exults\n  The sainted soul, which the fallacious world\n  Makes manifest to him who listeneth well;\n\nThe body whence 'twas hunted forth is lying\n  Down in Cieldauro, and from martyrdom\n  And banishment it came unto this peace.\n\nSee farther onward flame the burning breath\n  Of Isidore, of Beda, and of Richard\n  Who was in contemplation more than man.\n\nThis, whence to me returneth thy regard,\n  The light is of a spirit unto whom\n  In his grave meditations death seemed slow.\n\nIt is the light eternal of Sigier,\n  Who, reading lectures in the Street of Straw,\n  Did syllogize invidious verities.\"\n\nThen, as a horologe that calleth us\n  What time the Bride of God is rising up\n  With matins to her Spouse that he may love her,\n\nWherein one part the other draws and urges,\n  Ting! ting! resounding with so sweet a note,\n  That swells with love the spirit well disposed,\n\nThus I beheld the glorious wheel move round,\n  And render voice to voice, in modulation\n  And sweetness that can not be comprehended,\n\nExcepting there where joy is made eternal.\n\n\n\nParadiso: Canto XI\n\n\nO Thou insensate care of mortal men,\n  How inconclusive are the syllogisms\n  That make thee beat thy wings in downward flight!\n\nOne after laws and one to aphorisms\n  Was going, and one following the priesthood,\n  And one to reign by force or sophistry,\n\nAnd one in theft, and one in state affairs,\n  One in the pleasures of the flesh involved\n  Wearied himself, one gave himself to ease;\n\nWhen I, from all these things emancipate,\n  With Beatrice above there in the Heavens\n  With such exceeding glory was received!\n\nWhen each one had returned unto that point\n  Within the circle where it was before,\n  It stood as in a candlestick a candle;\n\nAnd from within the effulgence which at first\n  Had spoken unto me, I heard begin\n  Smiling while it more luminous became:\n\n\"Even as I am kindled in its ray,\n  So, looking into the Eternal Light,\n  The occasion of thy thoughts I apprehend.\n\nThou doubtest, and wouldst have me to resift\n  In language so extended and so open\n  My speech, that to thy sense it may be plain,\n\nWhere just before I said, 'where well one fattens,'\n  And where I said, 'there never rose a second;'\n  And here 'tis needful we distinguish well.\n\nThe Providence, which governeth the world\n  With counsel, wherein all created vision\n  Is vanquished ere it reach unto the bottom,\n\n(So that towards her own Beloved might go\n  The bride of Him who, uttering a loud cry,\n  Espoused her with his consecrated blood,\n\nSelf-confident and unto Him more faithful,)\n  Two Princes did ordain in her behoof,\n  Which on this side and that might be her guide.\n\nThe one was all seraphical in ardour;\n  The other by his wisdom upon earth\n  A splendour was of light cherubical.\n\nOne will I speak of, for of both is spoken\n  In praising one, whichever may be taken,\n  Because unto one end their labours were.\n\nBetween Tupino and the stream that falls\n  Down from the hill elect of blessed Ubald,\n  A fertile <DW72> of lofty mountain hangs,\n\nFrom which Perugia feels the cold and heat\n  Through Porta Sole, and behind it weep\n  Gualdo and Nocera their grievous yoke.\n\nFrom out that <DW72>, there where it breaketh most\n  Its steepness, rose upon the world a sun\n  As this one does sometimes from out the Ganges;\n\nTherefore let him who speaketh of that place,\n  Say not Ascesi, for he would say little,\n  But Orient, if he properly would speak.\n\nHe was not yet far distant from his rising\n  Before he had begun to make the earth\n  Some comfort from his mighty virtue feel.\n\nFor he in youth his father's wrath incurred\n  For certain Dame, to whom, as unto death,\n  The gate of pleasure no one doth unlock;\n\nAnd was before his spiritual court\n  'Et coram patre' unto her united;\n  Then day by day more fervently he loved her.\n\nShe, reft of her first husband, scorned, obscure,\n  One thousand and one hundred years and more,\n  Waited without a suitor till he came.\n\nNaught it availed to hear, that with Amyclas\n  Found her unmoved at sounding of his voice\n  He who struck terror into all the world;\n\nNaught it availed being constant and undaunted,\n  So that, when Mary still remained below,\n  She mounted up with Christ upon the cross.\n\nBut that too darkly I may not proceed,\n  Francis and Poverty for these two lovers\n  Take thou henceforward in my speech diffuse.\n\nTheir concord and their joyous semblances,\n  The love, the wonder, and the sweet regard,\n  They made to be the cause of holy thoughts;\n\nSo much so that the venerable Bernard\n  First bared his feet, and after so great peace\n  Ran, and, in running, thought himself too slow.\n\nO wealth unknown!  O veritable good!\n  Giles bares his feet, and bares his feet Sylvester\n  Behind the bridegroom, so doth please the bride!\n\nThen goes his way that father and that master,\n  He and his Lady and that family\n  Which now was girding on the humble cord;\n\nNor cowardice of heart weighed down his brow\n  At being son of Peter Bernardone,\n  Nor for appearing marvellously scorned;\n\nBut regally his hard determination\n  To Innocent he opened, and from him\n  Received the primal seal upon his Order.\n\nAfter the people mendicant increased\n  Behind this man, whose admirable life\n  Better in glory of the heavens were sung,\n\nIncoronated with a second crown\n  Was through Honorius by the Eternal Spirit\n  The holy purpose of this Archimandrite.\n\nAnd when he had, through thirst of martyrdom,\n  In the proud presence of the Sultan preached\n  Christ and the others who came after him,\n\nAnd, finding for conversion too unripe\n  The folk, and not to tarry there in vain,\n  Returned to fruit of the Italic grass,\n\nOn the rude rock 'twixt Tiber and the Arno\n  From Christ did he receive the final seal,\n  Which during two whole years his members bore.\n\nWhen He, who chose him unto so much good,\n  Was pleased to draw him up to the reward\n  That he had merited by being lowly,\n\nUnto his friars, as to the rightful heirs,\n  His most dear Lady did he recommend,\n  And bade that they should love her faithfully;\n\nAnd from her bosom the illustrious soul\n  Wished to depart, returning to its realm,\n  And for its body wished no other bier.\n\nThink now what man was he, who was a fit\n  Companion over the high seas to keep\n  The bark of Peter to its proper bearings.\n\nAnd this man was our Patriarch; hence whoever\n  Doth follow him as he commands can see\n  That he is laden with good merchandise.\n\nBut for new pasturage his flock has grown\n  So greedy, that it is impossible\n  They be not scattered over fields diverse;\n\nAnd in proportion as his sheep remote\n  And vagabond go farther off from him,\n  More void of milk return they to the fold.\n\nVerily some there are that fear a hurt,\n  And keep close to the shepherd; but so few,\n  That little cloth doth furnish forth their hoods.\n\nNow if my utterance be not indistinct,\n  If thine own hearing hath attentive been,\n  If thou recall to mind what I have said,\n\nIn part contented shall thy wishes be;\n  For thou shalt see the plant that's chipped away,\n  And the rebuke that lieth in the words,\n\n'Where well one fattens, if he strayeth not.'\"\n\n\n\nParadiso: Canto XII\n\n\nSoon as the blessed flame had taken up\n  The final word to give it utterance,\n  Began the holy millstone to revolve,\n\nAnd in its gyre had not turned wholly round,\n  Before another in a ring enclosed it,\n  And motion joined to motion, song to song;\n\nSong that as greatly doth transcend our Muses,\n  Our Sirens, in those dulcet clarions,\n  As primal splendour that which is reflected.\n\nAnd as are spanned athwart a tender cloud\n  Two rainbows parallel and like in colour,\n  When Juno to her handmaid gives command,\n\n(The one without born of the one within,\n  Like to the speaking of that vagrant one\n  Whom love consumed as doth the sun the vapours,)\n\nAnd make the people here, through covenant\n  God set with Noah, presageful of the world\n  That shall no more be covered with a flood,\n\nIn such wise of those sempiternal roses\n  The garlands twain encompassed us about,\n  And thus the outer to the inner answered.\n\nAfter the dance, and other grand rejoicings,\n  Both of the singing, and the flaming forth\n  Effulgence with effulgence blithe and tender,\n\nTogether, at once, with one accord had stopped,\n  (Even as the eyes, that, as volition moves them,\n  Must needs together shut and lift themselves,)\n\nOut of the heart of one of the new lights\n  There came a voice, that needle to the star\n  Made me appear in turning thitherward.\n\nAnd it began: \"The love that makes me fair\n  Draws me to speak about the other leader,\n  By whom so well is spoken here of mine.\n\n'Tis right, where one is, to bring in the other,\n  That, as they were united in their warfare,\n  Together likewise may their glory shine.\n\nThe soldiery of Christ, which it had cost\n  So dear to arm again, behind the standard\n  Moved slow and doubtful and in numbers few,\n\nWhen the Emperor who reigneth evermore\n  Provided for the host that was in peril,\n  Through grace alone and not that it was worthy;\n\nAnd, as was said, he to his Bride brought succour\n  With champions twain, at whose deed, at whose word\n  The straggling people were together drawn.\n\nWithin that region where the sweet west wind\n  Rises to open the new leaves, wherewith\n  Europe is seen to clothe herself afresh,\n\nNot far off from the beating of the waves,\n  Behind which in his long career the sun\n  Sometimes conceals himself from every man,\n\nIs situate the fortunate Calahorra,\n  Under protection of the mighty shield\n  In which the Lion subject is and sovereign.\n\nTherein was born the amorous paramour\n  Of Christian Faith, the athlete consecrate,\n  Kind to his own and cruel to his foes;\n\nAnd when it was created was his mind\n  Replete with such a living energy,\n  That in his mother her it made prophetic.\n\nAs soon as the espousals were complete\n  Between him and the Faith at holy font,\n  Where they with mutual safety dowered each other,\n\nThe woman, who for him had given assent,\n  Saw in a dream the admirable fruit\n  That issue would from him and from his heirs;\n\nAnd that he might be construed as he was,\n  A spirit from this place went forth to name him\n  With His possessive whose he wholly was.\n\nDominic was he called; and him I speak of\n  Even as of the husbandman whom Christ\n  Elected to his garden to assist him.\n\nEnvoy and servant sooth he seemed of Christ,\n  For the first love made manifest in him\n  Was the first counsel that was given by Christ.\n\nSilent and wakeful many a time was he\n  Discovered by his nurse upon the ground,\n  As if he would have said, 'For this I came.'\n\nO thou his father, Felix verily!\n  O thou his mother, verily Joanna,\n  If this, interpreted, means as is said!\n\nNot for the world which people toil for now\n  In following Ostiense and Taddeo,\n  But through his longing after the true manna,\n\nHe in short time became so great a teacher,\n  That he began to go about the vineyard,\n  Which fadeth soon, if faithless be the dresser;\n\nAnd of the See, (that once was more benignant\n  Unto the righteous poor, not through itself,\n  But him who sits there and degenerates,)\n\nNot to dispense or two or three for six,\n  Not any fortune of first vacancy,\n  'Non decimas quae sunt pauperum Dei,'\n\nHe asked for, but against the errant world\n  Permission to do battle for the seed,\n  Of which these four and twenty plants surround thee.\n\nThen with the doctrine and the will together,\n  With office apostolical he moved,\n  Like torrent which some lofty vein out-presses;\n\nAnd in among the shoots heretical\n  His impetus with greater fury smote,\n  Wherever the resistance was the greatest.\n\nOf him were made thereafter divers runnels,\n  Whereby the garden catholic is watered,\n  So that more living its plantations stand.\n\nIf such the one wheel of the Biga was,\n  In which the Holy Church itself defended\n  And in the field its civic battle won,\n\nTruly full manifest should be to thee\n  The excellence of the other, unto whom\n  Thomas so courteous was before my coming.\n\nBut still the orbit, which the highest part\n  Of its circumference made, is derelict,\n  So that the mould is where was once the crust.\n\nHis family, that had straight forward moved\n  With feet upon his footprints, are turned round\n  So that they set the point upon the heel.\n\nAnd soon aware they will be of the harvest\n  Of this bad husbandry, when shall the tares\n  Complain the granary is taken from them.\n\nYet say I, he who searcheth leaf by leaf\n  Our volume through, would still some page discover\n  Where he could read, 'I am as I am wont.'\n\n'Twill not be from Casal nor Acquasparta,\n  From whence come such unto the written word\n  That one avoids it, and the other narrows.\n\nBonaventura of Bagnoregio's life\n  Am I, who always in great offices\n  Postponed considerations sinister.\n\nHere are Illuminato and Agostino,\n  Who of the first barefooted beggars were\n  That with the cord the friends of God became.\n\nHugh of Saint Victor is among them here,\n  And Peter Mangiador, and Peter of Spain,\n  Who down below in volumes twelve is shining;\n\nNathan the seer, and metropolitan\n  Chrysostom, and Anselmus, and Donatus\n  Who deigned to lay his hand to the first art;\n\nHere is Rabanus, and beside me here\n  Shines the Calabrian Abbot Joachim,\n  He with the spirit of prophecy endowed.\n\nTo celebrate so great a paladin\n  Have moved me the impassioned courtesy\n  And the discreet discourses of Friar Thomas,\n\nAnd with me they have moved this company.\"\n\n\n\nParadiso: Canto XIII\n\n\nLet him imagine, who would well conceive\n  What now I saw, and let him while I speak\n  Retain the image as a steadfast rock,\n\nThe fifteen stars, that in their divers regions\n  The sky enliven with a light so great\n  That it transcends all clusters of the air;\n\nLet him the Wain imagine unto which\n  Our vault of heaven sufficeth night and day,\n  So that in turning of its pole it fails not;\n\nLet him the mouth imagine of the horn\n  That in the point beginneth of the axis\n  Round about which the primal wheel revolves,--\n\nTo have fashioned of themselves two signs in heaven,\n  Like unto that which Minos' daughter made,\n  The moment when she felt the frost of death;\n\nAnd one to have its rays within the other,\n  And both to whirl themselves in such a manner\n  That one should forward go, the other backward;\n\nAnd he will have some shadowing forth of that\n  True constellation and the double dance\n  That circled round the point at which I was;\n\nBecause it is as much beyond our wont,\n  As swifter than the motion of the Chiana\n  Moveth the heaven that all the rest outspeeds.\n\nThere sang they neither Bacchus, nor Apollo,\n  But in the divine nature Persons three,\n  And in one person the divine and human.\n\nThe singing and the dance fulfilled their measure,\n  And unto us those holy lights gave need,\n  Growing in happiness from care to care.\n\nThen broke the silence of those saints concordant\n  The light in which the admirable life\n  Of God's own mendicant was told to me,\n\nAnd said: \"Now that one straw is trodden out\n  Now that its seed is garnered up already,\n  Sweet love invites me to thresh out the other.\n\nInto that bosom, thou believest, whence\n  Was drawn the rib to form the beauteous cheek\n  Whose taste to all the world is costing dear,\n\nAnd into that which, by the lance transfixed,\n  Before and since, such satisfaction made\n  That it weighs down the balance of all sin,\n\nWhate'er of light it has to human nature\n  Been lawful to possess was all infused\n  By the same power that both of them created;\n\nAnd hence at what I said above dost wonder,\n  When I narrated that no second had\n  The good which in the fifth light is enclosed.\n\nNow ope thine eyes to what I answer thee,\n  And thou shalt see thy creed and my discourse\n  Fit in the truth as centre in a circle.\n\nThat which can die, and that which dieth not,\n  Are nothing but the splendour of the idea\n  Which by his love our Lord brings into being;\n\nBecause that living Light, which from its fount\n  Effulgent flows, so that it disunites not\n  From Him nor from the Love in them intrined,\n\nThrough its own goodness reunites its rays\n  In nine subsistences, as in a mirror,\n  Itself eternally remaining One.\n\nThence it descends to the last potencies,\n  Downward from act to act becoming such\n  That only brief contingencies it makes;\n\nAnd these contingencies I hold to be\n  Things generated, which the heaven produces\n  By its own motion, with seed and without.\n\nNeither their wax, nor that which tempers it,\n  Remains immutable, and hence beneath\n  The ideal signet more and less shines through;\n\nTherefore it happens, that the selfsame tree\n  After its kind bears worse and better fruit,\n  And ye are born with characters diverse.\n\nIf in perfection tempered were the wax,\n  And were the heaven in its supremest virtue,\n  The brilliance of the seal would all appear;\n\nBut nature gives it evermore deficient,\n  In the like manner working as the artist,\n  Who has the skill of art and hand that trembles.\n\nIf then the fervent Love, the Vision clear,\n  Of primal Virtue do dispose and seal,\n  Perfection absolute is there acquired.\n\nThus was of old the earth created worthy\n  Of all and every animal perfection;\n  And thus the Virgin was impregnate made;\n\nSo that thine own opinion I commend,\n  That human nature never yet has been,\n  Nor will be, what it was in those two persons.\n\nNow if no farther forth I should proceed,\n  'Then in what way was he without a peer?'\n  Would be the first beginning of thy words.\n\nBut, that may well appear what now appears not,\n  Think who he was, and what occasion moved him\n  To make request, when it was told him, 'Ask.'\n\nI've not so spoken that thou canst not see\n  Clearly he was a king who asked for wisdom,\n  That he might be sufficiently a king;\n\n'Twas not to know the number in which are\n  The motors here above, or if 'necesse'\n  With a contingent e'er 'necesse' make,\n\n'Non si est dare primum motum esse,'\n  Or if in semicircle can be made\n  Triangle so that it have no right angle.\n\nWhence, if thou notest this and what I said,\n  A regal prudence is that peerless seeing\n  In which the shaft of my intention strikes.\n\nAnd if on 'rose' thou turnest thy clear eyes,\n  Thou'lt see that it has reference alone\n  To kings who're many, and the good are rare.\n\nWith this distinction take thou what I said,\n  And thus it can consist with thy belief\n  Of the first father and of our Delight.\n\nAnd lead shall this be always to thy feet,\n  To make thee, like a weary man, move slowly\n  Both to the Yes and No thou seest not;\n\nFor very low among the fools is he\n  Who affirms without distinction, or denies,\n  As well in one as in the other case;\n\nBecause it happens that full often bends\n  Current opinion in the false direction,\n  And then the feelings bind the intellect.\n\nFar more than uselessly he leaves the shore,\n  (Since he returneth not the same he went,)\n  Who fishes for the truth, and has no skill;\n\nAnd in the world proofs manifest thereof\n  Parmenides, Melissus, Brissus are,\n  And many who went on and knew not whither;\n\nThus did Sabellius, Arius, and those fools\n  Who have been even as swords unto the Scriptures\n  In rendering distorted their straight faces.\n\nNor yet shall people be too confident\n  In judging, even as he is who doth count\n  The corn in field or ever it be ripe.\n\nFor I have seen all winter long the thorn\n  First show itself intractable and fierce,\n  And after bear the rose upon its top;\n\nAnd I have seen a ship direct and swift\n  Run o'er the sea throughout its course entire,\n  To perish at the harbour's mouth at last.\n\nLet not Dame Bertha nor Ser Martin think,\n  Seeing one steal, another offering make,\n  To see them in the arbitrament divine;\n\nFor one may rise, and fall the other may.\"\n\n\n\nParadiso: Canto XIV\n\n\nFrom centre unto rim, from rim to centre,\n  In a round vase the water moves itself,\n  As from without 'tis struck or from within.\n\nInto my mind upon a sudden dropped\n  What I am saying, at the moment when\n  Silent became the glorious life of Thomas,\n\nBecause of the resemblance that was born\n  Of his discourse and that of Beatrice,\n  Whom, after him, it pleased thus to begin:\n\n\"This man has need (and does not tell you so,\n  Nor with the voice, nor even in his thought)\n  Of going to the root of one truth more.\n\nDeclare unto him if the light wherewith\n  Blossoms your substance shall remain with you\n  Eternally the same that it is now;\n\nAnd if it do remain, say in what manner,\n  After ye are again made visible,\n  It can be that it injure not your sight.\"\n\nAs by a greater gladness urged and drawn\n  They who are dancing in a ring sometimes\n  Uplift their voices and their motions quicken;\n\nSo, at that orison devout and prompt,\n  The holy circles a new joy displayed\n  In their revolving and their wondrous song.\n\nWhoso lamenteth him that here we die\n  That we may live above, has never there\n  Seen the refreshment of the eternal rain.\n\nThe One and Two and Three who ever liveth,\n  And reigneth ever in Three and Two and One,\n  Not circumscribed and all things circumscribing,\n\nThree several times was chanted by each one\n  Among those spirits, with such melody\n  That for all merit it were just reward;\n\nAnd, in the lustre most divine of all\n  The lesser ring, I heard a modest voice,\n  Such as perhaps the Angel's was to Mary,\n\nAnswer: \"As long as the festivity\n  Of Paradise shall be, so long our love\n  Shall radiate round about us such a vesture.\n\nIts brightness is proportioned to the ardour,\n  The ardour to the vision; and the vision\n  Equals what grace it has above its worth.\n\nWhen, glorious and sanctified, our flesh\n  Is reassumed, then shall our persons be\n  More pleasing by their being all complete;\n\nFor will increase whate'er bestows on us\n  Of light gratuitous the Good Supreme,\n  Light which enables us to look on Him;\n\nTherefore the vision must perforce increase,\n  Increase the ardour which from that is kindled,\n  Increase the radiance which from this proceeds.\n\nBut even as a coal that sends forth flame,\n  And by its vivid whiteness overpowers it\n  So that its own appearance it maintains,\n\nThus the effulgence that surrounds us now\n  Shall be o'erpowered in aspect by the flesh,\n  Which still to-day the earth doth cover up;\n\nNor can so great a splendour weary us,\n  For strong will be the organs of the body\n  To everything which hath the power to please us.\"\n\nSo sudden and alert appeared to me\n  Both one and the other choir to say Amen,\n  That well they showed desire for their dead bodies;\n\nNor sole for them perhaps, but for the mothers,\n  The fathers, and the rest who had been dear\n  Or ever they became eternal flames.\n\nAnd lo! all round about of equal brightness\n  Arose a lustre over what was there,\n  Like an horizon that is clearing up.\n\nAnd as at rise of early eve begin\n  Along the welkin new appearances,\n  So that the sight seems real and unreal,\n\nIt seemed to me that new subsistences\n  Began there to be seen, and make a circle\n  Outside the other two circumferences.\n\nO very sparkling of the Holy Spirit,\n  How sudden and incandescent it became\n  Unto mine eyes, that vanquished bore it not!\n\nBut Beatrice so beautiful and smiling\n  Appeared to me, that with the other sights\n  That followed not my memory I must leave her.\n\nThen to uplift themselves mine eyes resumed\n  The power, and I beheld myself translated\n  To higher salvation with my Lady only.\n\nWell was I ware that I was more uplifted\n  By the enkindled smiling of the star,\n  That seemed to me more ruddy than its wont.\n\nWith all my heart, and in that dialect\n  Which is the same in all, such holocaust\n  To God I made as the new grace beseemed;\n\nAnd not yet from my bosom was exhausted\n  The ardour of sacrifice, before I knew\n  This offering was accepted and auspicious;\n\nFor with so great a lustre and so red\n  Splendours appeared to me in twofold rays,\n  I said: \"O Helios who dost so adorn them!\"\n\nEven as distinct with less and greater lights\n  Glimmers between the two poles of the world\n  The Galaxy that maketh wise men doubt,\n\nThus constellated in the depths of Mars,\n  Those rays described the venerable sign\n  That quadrants joining in a circle make.\n\nHere doth my memory overcome my genius;\n  For on that cross as levin gleamed forth Christ,\n  So that I cannot find ensample worthy;\n\nBut he who takes his cross and follows Christ\n  Again will pardon me what I omit,\n  Seeing in that aurora lighten Christ.\n\nFrom horn to horn, and 'twixt the top and base,\n  Lights were in motion, brightly scintillating\n  As they together met and passed each other;\n\nThus level and aslant and swift and slow\n  We here behold, renewing still the sight,\n  The particles of bodies long and short,\n\nAcross the sunbeam move, wherewith is listed\n  Sometimes the shade, which for their own defence\n  People with cunning and with art contrive.\n\nAnd as a lute and harp, accordant strung\n  With many strings, a dulcet tinkling make\n  To him by whom the notes are not distinguished,\n\nSo from the lights that there to me appeared\n  Upgathered through the cross a melody,\n  Which rapt me, not distinguishing the hymn.\n\nWell was I ware it was of lofty laud,\n  Because there came to me, \"Arise and conquer!\"\n  As unto him who hears and comprehends not.\n\nSo much enamoured I became therewith,\n  That until then there was not anything\n  That e'er had fettered me with such sweet bonds.\n\nPerhaps my word appears somewhat too bold,\n  Postponing the delight of those fair eyes,\n  Into which gazing my desire has rest;\n\nBut who bethinks him that the living seals\n  Of every beauty grow in power ascending,\n  And that I there had not turned round to those,\n\nCan me excuse, if I myself accuse\n  To excuse myself, and see that I speak truly:\n  For here the holy joy is not disclosed,\n\nBecause ascending it becomes more pure.\n\n\n\nParadiso: Canto XV\n\n\nA will benign, in which reveals itself\n  Ever the love that righteously inspires,\n  As in the iniquitous, cupidity,\n\nSilence imposed upon that dulcet lyre,\n  And quieted the consecrated chords,\n  That Heaven's right hand doth tighten and relax.\n\nHow unto just entreaties shall be deaf\n  Those substances, which, to give me desire\n  Of praying them, with one accord grew silent?\n\n'Tis well that without end he should lament,\n  Who for the love of thing that doth not last\n  Eternally despoils him of that love!\n\nAs through the pure and tranquil evening air\n  There shoots from time to time a sudden fire,\n  Moving the eyes that steadfast were before,\n\nAnd seems to be a star that changeth place,\n  Except that in the part where it is kindled\n  Nothing is missed, and this endureth little;\n\nSo from the horn that to the right extends\n  Unto that cross's foot there ran a star\n  Out of the constellation shining there;\n\nNor was the gem dissevered from its ribbon,\n  But down the radiant fillet ran along,\n  So that fire seemed it behind alabaster.\n\nThus piteous did Anchises' shade reach forward,\n  If any faith our greatest Muse deserve,\n  When in Elysium he his son perceived.\n\n\"O sanguis meus, O superinfusa\n  Gratia Dei, sicut tibi, cui\n  Bis unquam Coeli janua reclusa?\"\n\nThus that effulgence; whence I gave it heed;\n  Then round unto my Lady turned my sight,\n  And on this side and that was stupefied;\n\nFor in her eyes was burning such a smile\n  That with mine own methought I touched the bottom\n  Both of my grace and of my Paradise!\n\nThen, pleasant to the hearing and the sight,\n  The spirit joined to its beginning things\n  I understood not, so profound it spake;\n\nNor did it hide itself from me by choice,\n  But by necessity; for its conception\n  Above the mark of mortals set itself.\n\nAnd when the bow of burning sympathy\n  Was so far slackened, that its speech descended\n  Towards the mark of our intelligence,\n\nThe first thing that was understood by me\n  Was \"Benedight be Thou, O Trine and One,\n  Who hast unto my seed so courteous been!\"\n\nAnd it continued: \"Hunger long and grateful,\n  Drawn from the reading of the mighty volume\n  Wherein is never changed the white nor dark,\n\nThou hast appeased, my son, within this light\n  In which I speak to thee, by grace of her\n  Who to this lofty flight with plumage clothed thee.\n\nThou thinkest that to me thy thought doth pass\n  From Him who is the first, as from the unit,\n  If that be known, ray out the five and six;\n\nAnd therefore who I am thou askest not,\n  And why I seem more joyous unto thee\n  Than any other of this gladsome crowd.\n\nThou think'st the truth; because the small and great\n  Of this existence look into the mirror\n  Wherein, before thou think'st, thy thought thou showest.\n\nBut that the sacred love, in which I watch\n  With sight perpetual, and which makes me thirst\n  With sweet desire, may better be fulfilled,\n\nNow let thy voice secure and frank and glad\n  Proclaim the wishes, the desire proclaim,\n  To which my answer is decreed already.\"\n\nTo Beatrice I turned me, and she heard\n  Before I spake, and smiled to me a sign,\n  That made the wings of my desire increase;\n\nThen in this wise began I: \"Love and knowledge,\n  When on you dawned the first Equality,\n  Of the same weight for each of you became;\n\nFor in the Sun, which lighted you and burned\n  With heat and radiance, they so equal are,\n  That all similitudes are insufficient.\n\nBut among mortals will and argument,\n  For reason that to you is manifest,\n  Diversely feathered in their pinions are.\n\nWhence I, who mortal am, feel in myself\n  This inequality; so give not thanks,\n  Save in my heart, for this paternal welcome.\n\nTruly do I entreat thee, living topaz!\n  Set in this precious jewel as a gem,\n  That thou wilt satisfy me with thy name.\"\n\n\"O leaf of mine, in whom I pleasure took\n  E'en while awaiting, I was thine own root!\"\n  Such a beginning he in answer made me.\n\nThen said to me: \"That one from whom is named\n  Thy race, and who a hundred years and more\n  Has circled round the mount on the first cornice,\n\nA son of mine and thy great-grandsire was;\n  Well it behoves thee that the long fatigue\n  Thou shouldst for him make shorter with thy works.\n\nFlorence, within the ancient boundary\n  From which she taketh still her tierce and nones,\n  Abode in quiet, temperate and chaste.\n\nNo golden chain she had, nor coronal,\n  Nor ladies shod with sandal shoon, nor girdle\n  That caught the eye more than the person did.\n\nNot yet the daughter at her birth struck fear\n  Into the father, for the time and dower\n  Did not o'errun this side or that the measure.\n\nNo houses had she void of families,\n  Not yet had thither come Sardanapalus\n  To show what in a chamber can be done;\n\nNot yet surpassed had Montemalo been\n  By your Uccellatojo, which surpassed\n  Shall in its downfall be as in its rise.\n\nBellincion Berti saw I go begirt\n  With leather and with bone, and from the mirror\n  His dame depart without a painted face;\n\nAnd him of Nerli saw, and him of Vecchio,\n  Contented with their simple suits of buff\n  And with the spindle and the flax their dames.\n\nO fortunate women! and each one was certain\n  Of her own burial-place, and none as yet\n  For sake of France was in her bed deserted.\n\nOne o'er the cradle kept her studious watch,\n  And in her lullaby the language used\n  That first delights the fathers and the mothers;\n\nAnother, drawing tresses from her distaff,\n  Told o'er among her family the tales\n  Of Trojans and of Fesole and Rome.\n\nAs great a marvel then would have been held\n  A Lapo Salterello, a Cianghella,\n  As Cincinnatus or Cornelia now.\n\nTo such a quiet, such a beautiful\n  Life of the citizen, to such a safe\n  Community, and to so sweet an inn,\n\nDid Mary give me, with loud cries invoked,\n  And in your ancient Baptistery at once\n  Christian and Cacciaguida I became.\n\nMoronto was my brother, and Eliseo;\n  From Val di Pado came to me my wife,\n  And from that place thy surname was derived.\n\nI followed afterward the Emperor Conrad,\n  And he begirt me of his chivalry,\n  So much I pleased him with my noble deeds.\n\nI followed in his train against that law's\n  Iniquity, whose people doth usurp\n  Your just possession, through your Pastor's fault.\n\nThere by that execrable race was I\n  Released from bonds of the fallacious world,\n  The love of which defileth many souls,\n\nAnd came from martyrdom unto this peace.\"\n\n\n\nParadiso: Canto XVI\n\n\nO thou our poor nobility of blood,\n  If thou dost make the people glory in thee\n  Down here where our affection languishes,\n\nA marvellous thing it ne'er will be to me;\n  For there where appetite is not perverted,\n  I say in Heaven, of thee I made a boast!\n\nTruly thou art a cloak that quickly shortens,\n  So that unless we piece thee day by day\n  Time goeth round about thee with his shears!\n\nWith 'You,' which Rome was first to tolerate,\n  (Wherein her family less perseveres,)\n  Yet once again my words beginning made;\n\nWhence Beatrice, who stood somewhat apart,\n  Smiling, appeared like unto her who coughed\n  At the first failing writ of Guenever.\n\nAnd I began: \"You are my ancestor,\n  You give to me all hardihood to speak,\n  You lift me so that I am more than I.\n\nSo many rivulets with gladness fill\n  My mind, that of itself it makes a joy\n  Because it can endure this and not burst.\n\nThen tell me, my beloved root ancestral,\n  Who were your ancestors, and what the years\n  That in your boyhood chronicled themselves?\n\nTell me about the sheepfold of Saint John,\n  How large it was, and who the people were\n  Within it worthy of the highest seats.\"\n\nAs at the blowing of the winds a coal\n  Quickens to flame, so I beheld that light\n  Become resplendent at my blandishments.\n\nAnd as unto mine eyes it grew more fair,\n  With voice more sweet and tender, but not in\n  This modern dialect, it said to me:\n\n\"From uttering of the 'Ave,' till the birth\n  In which my mother, who is now a saint,\n  Of me was lightened who had been her burden,\n\nUnto its Lion had this fire returned\n  Five hundred fifty times and thirty more,\n  To reinflame itself beneath his paw.\n\nMy ancestors and I our birthplace had\n  Where first is found the last ward of the city\n  By him who runneth in your annual game.\n\nSuffice it of my elders to hear this;\n  But who they were, and whence they thither came,\n  Silence is more considerate than speech.\n\nAll those who at that time were there between\n  Mars and the Baptist, fit for bearing arms,\n  Were a fifth part of those who now are living;\n\nBut the community, that now is mixed\n  With Campi and Certaldo and Figghine,\n  Pure in the lowest artisan was seen.\n\nO how much better 'twere to have as neighbours\n  The folk of whom I speak, and at Galluzzo\n  And at Trespiano have your boundary,\n\nThan have them in the town, and bear the stench\n  Of Aguglione's churl, and him of Signa\n  Who has sharp eyes for trickery already.\n\nHad not the folk, which most of all the world\n  Degenerates, been a step-dame unto Caesar,\n  But as a mother to her son benignant,\n\nSome who turn Florentines, and trade and discount,\n  Would have gone back again to Simifonte\n  There where their grandsires went about as beggars.\n\nAt Montemurlo still would be the Counts,\n  The Cerchi in the parish of Acone,\n  Perhaps in Valdigrieve the Buondelmonti.\n\nEver the intermingling of the people\n  Has been the source of malady in cities,\n  As in the body food it surfeits on;\n\nAnd a blind bull more headlong plunges down\n  Than a blind lamb; and very often cuts\n  Better and more a single sword than five.\n\nIf Luni thou regard, and Urbisaglia,\n  How they have passed away, and how are passing\n  Chiusi and Sinigaglia after them,\n\nTo hear how races waste themselves away,\n  Will seem to thee no novel thing nor hard,\n  Seeing that even cities have an end.\n\nAll things of yours have their mortality,\n  Even as yourselves; but it is hidden in some\n  That a long while endure, and lives are short;\n\nAnd as the turning of the lunar heaven\n  Covers and bares the shores without a pause,\n  In the like manner fortune does with Florence.\n\nTherefore should not appear a marvellous thing\n  What I shall say of the great Florentines\n  Of whom the fame is hidden in the Past.\n\nI saw the Ughi, saw the Catellini,\n  Filippi, Greci, Ormanni, and Alberichi,\n  Even in their fall illustrious citizens;\n\nAnd saw, as mighty as they ancient were,\n  With him of La Sannella him of Arca,\n  And Soldanier, Ardinghi, and Bostichi.\n\nNear to the gate that is at present laden\n  With a new felony of so much weight\n  That soon it shall be jetsam from the bark,\n\nThe Ravignani were, from whom descended\n  The County Guido, and whoe'er the name\n  Of the great Bellincione since hath taken.\n\nHe of La Pressa knew the art of ruling\n  Already, and already Galigajo\n  Had hilt and pommel gilded in his house.\n\nMighty already was the Column Vair,\n  Sacchetti, Giuochi, Fifant, and Barucci,\n  And Galli, and they who for the bushel blush.\n\nThe stock from which were the Calfucci born\n  Was great already, and already chosen\n  To curule chairs the Sizii and Arrigucci.\n\nO how beheld I those who are undone\n  By their own pride! and how the Balls of Gold\n  Florence enflowered in all their mighty deeds!\n\nSo likewise did the ancestors of those\n  Who evermore, when vacant is your church,\n  Fatten by staying in consistory.\n\nThe insolent race, that like a dragon follows\n  Whoever flees, and unto him that shows\n  His teeth or purse is gentle as a lamb,\n\nAlready rising was, but from low people;\n  So that it pleased not Ubertin Donato\n  That his wife's father should make him their kin.\n\nAlready had Caponsacco to the Market\n  From Fesole descended, and already\n  Giuda and Infangato were good burghers.\n\nI'll tell a thing incredible, but true;\n  One entered the small circuit by a gate\n  Which from the Della Pera took its name!\n\nEach one that bears the beautiful escutcheon\n  Of the great baron whose renown and name\n  The festival of Thomas keepeth fresh,\n\nKnighthood and privilege from him received;\n  Though with the populace unites himself\n  To-day the man who binds it with a border.\n\nAlready were Gualterotti and Importuni;\n  And still more quiet would the Borgo be\n  If with new neighbours it remained unfed.\n\nThe house from which is born your lamentation,\n  Through just disdain that death among you brought\n  And put an end unto your joyous life,\n\nWas honoured in itself and its companions.\n  O Buondelmonte, how in evil hour\n  Thou fled'st the bridal at another's promptings!\n\nMany would be rejoicing who are sad,\n  If God had thee surrendered to the Ema\n  The first time that thou camest to the city.\n\nBut it behoved the mutilated stone\n  Which guards the bridge, that Florence should provide\n  A victim in her latest hour of peace.\n\nWith all these families, and others with them,\n  Florence beheld I in so great repose,\n  That no occasion had she whence to weep;\n\nWith all these families beheld so just\n  And glorious her people, that the lily\n  Never upon the spear was placed reversed,\n\nNor by division was vermilion made.\"\n\n\n\nParadiso: Canto XVII\n\n\nAs came to Clymene, to be made certain\n  Of that which he had heard against himself,\n  He who makes fathers chary still to children,\n\nEven such was I, and such was I perceived\n  By Beatrice and by the holy light\n  That first on my account had changed its place.\n\nTherefore my Lady said to me: \"Send forth\n  The flame of thy desire, so that it issue\n  Imprinted well with the internal stamp;\n\nNot that our knowledge may be greater made\n  By speech of thine, but to accustom thee\n  To tell thy thirst, that we may give thee drink.\"\n\n\"O my beloved tree, (that so dost lift thee,\n  That even as minds terrestrial perceive\n  No triangle containeth two obtuse,\n\nSo thou beholdest the contingent things\n  Ere in themselves they are, fixing thine eyes\n  Upon the point in which all times are present,)\n\nWhile I was with Virgilius conjoined\n  Upon the mountain that the souls doth heal,\n  And when descending into the dead world,\n\nWere spoken to me of my future life\n  Some grievous words; although I feel myself\n  In sooth foursquare against the blows of chance.\n\nOn this account my wish would be content\n  To hear what fortune is approaching me,\n  Because foreseen an arrow comes more slowly.\"\n\nThus did I say unto that selfsame light\n  That unto me had spoken before; and even\n  As Beatrice willed was my own will confessed.\n\nNot in vague phrase, in which the foolish folk\n  Ensnared themselves of old, ere yet was slain\n  The Lamb of God who taketh sins away,\n\nBut with clear words and unambiguous\n  Language responded that paternal love,\n  Hid and revealed by its own proper smile:\n\n\"Contingency, that outside of the volume\n  Of your materiality extends not,\n  Is all depicted in the eternal aspect.\n\nNecessity however thence it takes not,\n  Except as from the eye, in which 'tis mirrored,\n  A ship that with the current down descends.\n\nFrom thence, e'en as there cometh to the ear\n  Sweet harmony from an organ, comes in sight\n  To me the time that is preparing for thee.\n\nAs forth from Athens went Hippolytus,\n  By reason of his step-dame false and cruel,\n  So thou from Florence must perforce depart.\n\nAlready this is willed, and this is sought for;\n  And soon it shall be done by him who thinks it,\n  Where every day the Christ is bought and sold.\n\nThe blame shall follow the offended party\n  In outcry as is usual; but the vengeance\n  Shall witness to the truth that doth dispense it.\n\nThou shalt abandon everything beloved\n  Most tenderly, and this the arrow is\n  Which first the bow of banishment shoots forth.\n\nThou shalt have proof how savoureth of salt\n  The bread of others, and how hard a road\n  The going down and up another's stairs.\n\nAnd that which most shall weigh upon thy shoulders\n  Will be the bad and foolish company\n  With which into this valley thou shalt fall;\n\nFor all ingrate, all mad and impious\n  Will they become against thee; but soon after\n  They, and not thou, shall have the forehead scarlet.\n\nOf their bestiality their own proceedings\n  Shall furnish proof; so 'twill be well for thee\n  A party to have made thee by thyself.\n\nThine earliest refuge and thine earliest inn\n  Shall be the mighty Lombard's courtesy,\n  Who on the Ladder bears the holy bird,\n\nWho such benign regard shall have for thee\n  That 'twixt you twain, in doing and in asking,\n  That shall be first which is with others last.\n\nWith him shalt thou see one who at his birth\n  Has by this star of strength been so impressed,\n  That notable shall his achievements be.\n\nNot yet the people are aware of him\n  Through his young age, since only nine years yet\n  Around about him have these wheels revolved.\n\nBut ere the Gascon cheat the noble Henry,\n  Some sparkles of his virtue shall appear\n  In caring not for silver nor for toil.\n\nSo recognized shall his magnificence\n  Become hereafter, that his enemies\n  Will not have power to keep mute tongues about it.\n\nOn him rely, and on his benefits;\n  By him shall many people be transformed,\n  Changing condition rich and mendicant;\n\nAnd written in thy mind thou hence shalt bear\n  Of him, but shalt not say it\"--and things said he\n  Incredible to those who shall be present.\n\nThen added: \"Son, these are the commentaries\n  On what was said to thee; behold the snares\n  That are concealed behind few revolutions;\n\nYet would I not thy neighbours thou shouldst envy,\n  Because thy life into the future reaches\n  Beyond the punishment of their perfidies.\"\n\nWhen by its silence showed that sainted soul\n  That it had finished putting in the woof\n  Into that web which I had given it warped,\n\nBegan I, even as he who yearneth after,\n  Being in doubt, some counsel from a person\n  Who seeth, and uprightly wills, and loves:\n\n\"Well see I, father mine, how spurreth on\n  The time towards me such a blow to deal me\n  As heaviest is to him who most gives way.\n\nTherefore with foresight it is well I arm me,\n  That, if the dearest place be taken from me,\n  I may not lose the others by my songs.\n\nDown through the world of infinite bitterness,\n  And o'er the mountain, from whose beauteous summit\n  The eyes of my own Lady lifted me,\n\nAnd afterward through heaven from light to light,\n  I have learned that which, if I tell again,\n  Will be a savour of strong herbs to many.\n\nAnd if I am a timid friend to truth,\n  I fear lest I may lose my life with those\n  Who will hereafter call this time the olden.\"\n\nThe light in which was smiling my own treasure\n  Which there I had discovered, flashed at first\n  As in the sunshine doth a golden mirror;\n\nThen made reply: \"A conscience overcast\n  Or with its own or with another's shame,\n  Will taste forsooth the tartness of thy word;\n\nBut ne'ertheless, all falsehood laid aside,\n  Make manifest thy vision utterly,\n  And let them scratch wherever is the itch;\n\nFor if thine utterance shall offensive be\n  At the first taste, a vital nutriment\n  'Twill leave thereafter, when it is digested.\n\nThis cry of thine shall do as doth the wind,\n  Which smiteth most the most exalted summits,\n  And that is no slight argument of honour.\n\nTherefore are shown to thee within these wheels,\n  Upon the mount and in the dolorous valley,\n  Only the souls that unto fame are known;\n\nBecause the spirit of the hearer rests not,\n  Nor doth confirm its faith by an example\n  Which has the root of it unknown and hidden,\n\nOr other reason that is not apparent.\"\n\n\n\nParadiso: Canto XVIII\n\n\nNow was alone rejoicing in its word\n  That soul beatified, and I was tasting\n  My own, the bitter tempering with the sweet,\n\nAnd the Lady who to God was leading me\n  Said: \"Change thy thought; consider that I am\n  Near unto Him who every wrong disburdens.\"\n\nUnto the loving accents of my comfort\n  I turned me round, and then what love I saw\n  Within those holy eyes I here relinquish;\n\nNot only that my language I distrust,\n  But that my mind cannot return so far\n  Above itself, unless another guide it.\n\nThus much upon that point can I repeat,\n  That, her again beholding, my affection\n  From every other longing was released.\n\nWhile the eternal pleasure, which direct\n  Rayed upon Beatrice, from her fair face\n  Contented me with its reflected aspect,\n\nConquering me with the radiance of a smile,\n  She said to me, \"Turn thee about and listen;\n  Not in mine eyes alone is Paradise.\"\n\nEven as sometimes here do we behold\n  The affection in the look, if it be such\n  That all the soul is wrapt away by it,\n\nSo, by the flaming of the effulgence holy\n  To which I turned, I recognized therein\n  The wish of speaking to me somewhat farther.\n\nAnd it began: \"In this fifth resting-place\n  Upon the tree that liveth by its summit,\n  And aye bears fruit, and never loses leaf,\n\nAre blessed spirits that below, ere yet\n  They came to Heaven, were of such great renown\n  That every Muse therewith would affluent be.\n\nTherefore look thou upon the cross's horns;\n  He whom I now shall name will there enact\n  What doth within a cloud its own swift fire.\"\n\nI saw athwart the Cross a splendour drawn\n  By naming Joshua, (even as he did it,)\n  Nor noted I the word before the deed;\n\nAnd at the name of the great Maccabee\n  I saw another move itself revolving,\n  And gladness was the whip unto that top.\n\nLikewise for Charlemagne and for Orlando,\n  Two of them my regard attentive followed\n  As followeth the eye its falcon flying.\n\nWilliam thereafterward, and Renouard,\n  And the Duke Godfrey, did attract my sight\n  Along upon that Cross, and Robert Guiscard.\n\nThen, moved and mingled with the other lights,\n  The soul that had addressed me showed how great\n  An artist 'twas among the heavenly singers.\n\nTo my right side I turned myself around,\n  My duty to behold in Beatrice\n  Either by words or gesture signified;\n\nAnd so translucent I beheld her eyes,\n  So full of pleasure, that her countenance\n  Surpassed its other and its latest wont.\n\nAnd as, by feeling greater delectation,\n  A man in doing good from day to day\n  Becomes aware his virtue is increasing,\n\nSo I became aware that my gyration\n  With heaven together had increased its arc,\n  That miracle beholding more adorned.\n\nAnd such as is the change, in little lapse\n  Of time, in a pale woman, when her face\n  Is from the load of bashfulness unladen,\n\nSuch was it in mine eyes, when I had turned,\n  Caused by the whiteness of the temperate star,\n  The sixth, which to itself had gathered me.\n\nWithin that Jovial torch did I behold\n  The sparkling of the love which was therein\n  Delineate our language to mine eyes.\n\nAnd even as birds uprisen from the shore,\n  As in congratulation o'er their food,\n  Make squadrons of themselves, now round, now long,\n\nSo from within those lights the holy creatures\n  Sang flying to and fro, and in their figures\n  Made of themselves now D, now I, now L.\n\nFirst singing they to their own music moved;\n  Then one becoming of these characters,\n  A little while they rested and were silent.\n\nO divine Pegasea, thou who genius\n  Dost glorious make, and render it long-lived,\n  And this through thee the cities and the kingdoms,\n\nIllume me with thyself, that I may bring\n  Their figures out as I have them conceived!\n  Apparent be thy power in these brief verses!\n\nThemselves then they displayed in five times seven\n  Vowels and consonants; and I observed\n  The parts as they seemed spoken unto me.\n\n'Diligite justitiam,' these were\n  First verb and noun of all that was depicted;\n  'Qui judicatis terram' were the last.\n\nThereafter in the M of the fifth word\n  Remained they so arranged, that Jupiter\n  Seemed to be silver there with gold inlaid.\n\nAnd other lights I saw descend where was\n  The summit of the M, and pause there singing\n  The good, I think, that draws them to itself.\n\nThen, as in striking upon burning logs\n  Upward there fly innumerable sparks,\n  Whence fools are wont to look for auguries,\n\nMore than a thousand lights seemed thence to rise,\n  And to ascend, some more, and others less,\n  Even as the Sun that lights them had allotted;\n\nAnd, each one being quiet in its place,\n  The head and neck beheld I of an eagle\n  Delineated by that inlaid fire.\n\nHe who there paints has none to be his guide;\n  But Himself guides; and is from Him remembered\n  That virtue which is form unto the nest.\n\nThe other beatitude, that contented seemed\n  At first to bloom a lily on the M,\n  By a slight motion followed out the imprint.\n\nO gentle star! what and how many gems\n  Did demonstrate to me, that all our justice\n  Effect is of that heaven which thou ingemmest!\n\nWherefore I pray the Mind, in which begin\n  Thy motion and thy virtue, to regard\n  Whence comes the smoke that vitiates thy rays;\n\nSo that a second time it now be wroth\n  With buying and with selling in the temple\n  Whose walls were built with signs and martyrdoms!\n\nO soldiery of heaven, whom I contemplate,\n  Implore for those who are upon the earth\n  All gone astray after the bad example!\n\nOnce 'twas the custom to make war with swords;\n  But now 'tis made by taking here and there\n  The bread the pitying Father shuts from none.\n\nYet thou, who writest but to cancel, think\n  That Peter and that Paul, who for this vineyard\n  Which thou art spoiling died, are still alive!\n\nWell canst thou say: \"So steadfast my desire\n  Is unto him who willed to live alone,\n  And for a dance was led to martyrdom,\n\nThat I know not the Fisherman nor Paul.\"\n\n\n\nParadiso: Canto XIX\n\n\nAppeared before me with its wings outspread\n  The beautiful image that in sweet fruition\n  Made jubilant the interwoven souls;\n\nAppeared a little ruby each, wherein\n  Ray of the sun was burning so enkindled\n  That each into mine eyes refracted it.\n\nAnd what it now behoves me to retrace\n  Nor voice has e'er reported, nor ink written,\n  Nor was by fantasy e'er comprehended;\n\nFor speak I saw, and likewise heard, the beak,\n  And utter with its voice both 'I' and 'My,'\n  When in conception it was 'We' and 'Our.'\n\nAnd it began: \"Being just and merciful\n  Am I exalted here unto that glory\n  Which cannot be exceeded by desire;\n\nAnd upon earth I left my memory\n  Such, that the evil-minded people there\n  Commend it, but continue not the story.\"\n\nSo doth a single heat from many embers\n  Make itself felt, even as from many loves\n  Issued a single sound from out that image.\n\nWhence I thereafter: \"O perpetual flowers\n  Of the eternal joy, that only one\n  Make me perceive your odours manifold,\n\nExhaling, break within me the great fast\n  Which a long season has in hunger held me,\n  Not finding for it any food on earth.\n\nWell do I know, that if in heaven its mirror\n  Justice Divine another realm doth make,\n  Yours apprehends it not through any veil.\n\nYou know how I attentively address me\n  To listen; and you know what is the doubt\n  That is in me so very old a fast.\"\n\nEven as a falcon, issuing from his hood,\n  Doth move his head, and with his wings applaud him,\n  Showing desire, and making himself fine,\n\nSaw I become that standard, which of lauds\n  Was interwoven of the grace divine,\n  With such songs as he knows who there rejoices.\n\nThen it began: \"He who a compass turned\n  On the world's outer verge, and who within it\n  Devised so much occult and manifest,\n\nCould not the impress of his power so make\n  On all the universe, as that his Word\n  Should not remain in infinite excess.\n\nAnd this makes certain that the first proud being,\n  Who was the paragon of every creature,\n  By not awaiting light fell immature.\n\nAnd hence appears it, that each minor nature\n  Is scant receptacle unto that good\n  Which has no end, and by itself is measured.\n\nIn consequence our vision, which perforce\n  Must be some ray of that intelligence\n  With which all things whatever are replete,\n\nCannot in its own nature be so potent,\n  That it shall not its origin discern\n  Far beyond that which is apparent to it.\n\nTherefore into the justice sempiternal\n  The power of vision that your world receives,\n  As eye into the ocean, penetrates;\n\nWhich, though it see the bottom near the shore,\n  Upon the deep perceives it not, and yet\n  'Tis there, but it is hidden by the depth.\n\nThere is no light but comes from the serene\n  That never is o'ercast, nay, it is darkness\n  Or shadow of the flesh, or else its poison.\n\nAmply to thee is opened now the cavern\n  Which has concealed from thee the living justice\n  Of which thou mad'st such frequent questioning.\n\nFor saidst thou: 'Born a man is on the shore\n  Of Indus, and is none who there can speak\n  Of Christ, nor who can read, nor who can write;\n\nAnd all his inclinations and his actions\n  Are good, so far as human reason sees,\n  Without a sin in life or in discourse:\n\nHe dieth unbaptised and without faith;\n  Where is this justice that condemneth him?\n  Where is his fault, if he do not believe?'\n\nNow who art thou, that on the bench wouldst sit\n  In judgment at a thousand miles away,\n  With the short vision of a single span?\n\nTruly to him who with me subtilizes,\n  If so the Scripture were not over you,\n  For doubting there were marvellous occasion.\n\nO animals terrene, O stolid minds,\n  The primal will, that in itself is good,\n  Ne'er from itself, the Good Supreme, has moved.\n\nSo much is just as is accordant with it;\n  No good created draws it to itself,\n  But it, by raying forth, occasions that.\"\n\nEven as above her nest goes circling round\n  The stork when she has fed her little ones,\n  And he who has been fed looks up at her,\n\nSo lifted I my brows, and even such\n  Became the blessed image, which its wings\n  Was moving, by so many counsels urged.\n\nCircling around it sang, and said: \"As are\n  My notes to thee, who dost not comprehend them,\n  Such is the eternal judgment to you mortals.\"\n\nThose lucent splendours of the Holy Spirit\n  Grew quiet then, but still within the

The word and place that has startled the civilized world is\nto-day a series of thriving mining camps on the Yukon River and its\ntributaries in the Canadian Northwest Territories.\n\nPrior to August 24, 1896, this section of the country had never been\nheard of. It was on this day that a man named Henderson discovered the\nfirst gold.\n\nOn the first day of the following month the writer commenced erecting\nthe first house in this region and called the place Dawson City, now the\ncentral point of the mining camps.\n\nDawson City is now the most important point in the new mining regions.\nIts population in June, 1897; exceeded 4,000; by June next it cannot be\nless than 25,000. It has a saw-mill, stores, churches, of the\nPresbyterian, Baptist, Methodist and Roman Catholic denominations. It is\nthe headquarters of the Canadian Northwest Mounted Police, _and perfect\nlaw and order is maintained_.\n\nIt is at Dawson City that the prospector files his claims with the\nGovernment Gold Commissioner, in the recording offices.\n\nDawson City faces on one of the banks of the Yukon River, and now\noccupies about a mile of the bank. It is at the junction of the Klondyke\nRiver with the Yukon River. It is here where the most valuable mining\nclaims are being operated on a scale of profit that the world has\nhitherto never known. The entire country surrounding is teeming with\nmineral wealth.\n\nCopper, silver and coal can be found in large quantities, but little or\nno attention is now being paid to these valuable minerals, as every one\nis engaged in gold-hunting and working the extraordinary placer mining\nclaims already located.\n\nThe entire section is given up to placer mining. Very few claims had\nbeen filed for quartz mining. The fields of gold will not be exhausted\nin the near future. No man can tell what the end will be. From January\nto April, 1897, about $4,000,000 were taken out of the few placer claims\nthen being worked. This was done in a territory not exceeding forty\nsquare miles. All these claims are located on Klondyke River and the\nlittle tributaries emptying into it, and the districts are known as Big\nBonanza, Gold Bottom and Honker.\n\nI have asked old and experienced miners at Dawson City who mined\nthrough California in Bonanza days, and some who mined in Australia,\nwhat they thought of the Klondyke region, and their reply has\ninvariably been, \"The world never saw so vast and rich a find of gold as\nwe are working now.\"\n\nDawson City is destined to be the greatest mining camp in the history of\nmining operations.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\n\nKLONDYKE FACTS.\n\nThere is a great popular error in reference to the climate of the gold\nregions. Many reports have appeared in the newspapers which are\nmisleading. It has been even stated that the cold is excessive almost\nthroughout the year. This is entirely a mis-statement.\n\nI have found I have suffered more from winter cold in Northern New York\nthan I ever did in Alaska or the Canadian Northwest.\n\nI have chopped wood in my shirt-sleeves in front of my door at Dawson\nCity when the thermometer was 70 degrees below zero, and I suffered no\ninconvenience. We account for this from the fact that the air is very\ndry. It is a fact that you do not feel this low temperature as much as\nyou would 15 below zero in the East.\n\nWe usually have about three feet of snow in winter and it is as dry as\nsawdust.\n\nAs we have no winter thaws no crust forms on the snow, therefore we\ntravel from the various points that may be necessary with snowshoes.\nThese may be purchased from the Indians in the vicinity of Dawson City\nat from $5.00 to $10.00 per pair according to the quality.\n\nThe winter days are very short. In this region there are only two hours\nfrom sunrise to sunset. The sun rises and sets away in the south but\nthere is no pitch darkness.\n\nThe twilight lasts all night and the Northern Lights are very common.\nThen in summer it is exactly the other way. The day there in July is\nabout twenty hours long. The sun rising and setting in the north. A\ngreat deal has been said about the short seasons, but as a matter of\nfact a miner can work 12 months in the year when in that region.\n\nSpring opens about May 1st and the ice commences to break up about that\ntime. The Yukon River is generally clear of ice about May 15. The best\npart of the miner's work commences then and lasts till about October\n1st.\n\nThe winter commences in October but the miner keeps on working through\nthe winter. The rainy season commences in the latter part of August and\nlasts two or three weeks.\n\nA fall of two feet of snow is considered heavy.\n\nThere is a wide difference in the quantity of snow that accumulates on\nthe coast and the ranges in the interior where the principal mining\nclaims are located.\n\nWhile the fall of snow on the coast is heavy the depth of snow as far\ndown as the Yukon, Stewart and Klondyke rivers is inconsiderable.\n\nIn my new work on this territory entitled \"Klondyke Facts\" I deal more\nlargely on the climate of this region.\n\nThere are still good diggings at Circle City in Alaska, but nearly all\nthe miners have left for Klondyke, not being satisfied with the pay dirt\nwhich they were working. I know at least 20 good claims in Circle City.\n\nFort Cudahy, or as it is sometimes called Forty Mile Creek, is now\npractically exhausted as a mining camp, and the miners have left for\nother diggings.\n\nThere will undoubtedly be new and valuable diggings discovered very\nquickly along this region as it is certain that this enormous territory\nis rich in gold-bearing districts.\n\nThe entire country is teeming with mineral wealth.\n\nWhen mining operations commence on coal it will be specially valuable\nfor steamers on the various rivers and greatly assist transportation\nfacilities.\n\nIn the next few years there will certainly be recorded the most\nmarvellous discoveries in this territory, usually thought to be only a\nland of snow and ice and fit only to be classed with the Arctic regions.\n\nIt is marvellous to state that for some years past we have been finding\ngold in occasional places in this territory, but from the poverty of the\npeople no effort was made to prospect among the places reported.\n\nIt is my belief that the greatest finds of gold will be made in this\nterritory. It is safe to say that not 2 per cent. of all the gold\ndiscovered so far has been on United States soil.\n\nThe great mass of the work has been done on the Northwest territory,\nwhich is under the Canadian Government.\n\nIt is possible however that further discoveries will be made on American\nsoil, but it is my opinion that the most valuable discoveries will be\nfurther east and south of the present claims, and would advise\nprospectors to work east and south of Klondyke.\n\n\nTHE YUKON RIVER AND ITS TRIBUTARIES.\n\n\"What the Amazon is to South America, the Mississippi to the central\nportion of the United States, the Yukon is to Alaska. It is a great\ninland highway, which will make it possible for the explorer to\npenetrate the mysterious fastnesses of that still unknown region. The\nYukon has its source in the Rocky Mountains of British Columbia and the\nCoast Range Mountains in southeastern Alaska, about 125 miles from the\ncity of Juneau, which is the present metropolis of Alaska. But it is\nonly known as the Yukon River at the point where the Pelly River, the\nbranch that heads in British Columbia, meets with the Lewes River, which\nheads in southeastern Alaska. This point of confluence is at Fort\nSelkirk, in the Northwest Territory, about 125 miles south-east of the\nKlondyke. The Yukon proper is 2,044 miles in length. From Fort Selkirk\nit flows north-west 400 miles, just touching the Arctic circle; thence\nsouthward for a distance of 1,600 miles, where it empties into Behring\nSea. It drains more than 600,000 square miles of territory, and\ndischarges one-third more water into Behring Sea than does the\nMississippi into the Gulf of Mexico. At its mouth it is sixty miles\nwide. About 1,500 miles inland it widens out from one to ten miles. A\nthousand islands send the channel in as many different directions. Only\nnatives who are thoroughly familiar with the river are entrusted with\nthe piloting of boats up the stream during the season of low water. Even\nat the season of high water it is still so shallow as not to be\nnavigable anywhere by seagoing vessels, but only by flat-bottomed boats\nwith a carrying capacity of four to five hundred tons. The draft of\nsteamers on the Yukon should not exceed three and a half feet.\n\n\"The Yukon district, which is within the jurisdiction of the Canadian\nGovernment and in which the bulk of the gold has been found, has a total\narea, approximately, of 192,000 square miles, of which 150,768 square\nmiles are included in the watershed of the Yukon. Illustrating this, so\nthat it may appeal with definiteness to the reader, it may be said that\nthis territory is greater by 71,100 square miles than the area of Great\nBritain, and is nearly three times that of all the New England States\ncombined.\n\n\"A further fact must be borne in mind. The Yukon River is absolutely\nclosed to navigation during the winter months. In the winter the\nfrost-king asserts his dominion and locks up all approaches with\nimpenetrable ice, and the summer is of the briefest. It endures only for\ntwelve to fourteen weeks, from about the first of June to the middle of\nSeptember. Then an unending panorama of extraordinary picturesqueness is\nunfolded to the voyager. The banks are fringed with flowers, carpeted\nwith the all-pervading moss or tundra. Birds countless in numbers and of\ninfinite variety in plumage, sing out a welcome from every treetop.\nPitch your tent where you will in midsummer, a bed of roses, a clump of\npoppies and a bunch of bluebells will adorn your camping. But high above\nthis paradise of almost tropical exuberance giant glaciers sleep in the\nsummit of the mountain wall, which rises up from a bed of roses. By\nSeptember everything is changed. The bed of roses has disappeared before\nthe icy breath of the winter king, which sends the thermometer down\nsometimes to seventy degrees below freezing point. The birds fly to the\nsouthland and the bear to his sleeping chamber in the mountains. Every\nstream becomes a sheet of ice, mountain and valley alike are covered\nwith snow till the following May.\n\n\"That part of the basin of the Yukon in which gold in greater or less\nquantities has actually been found lies partly in Alaska and partly in\nBritish territory. It covers an area of some 50,000 square miles. But so\nfar the infinitely richest spot lies some one hundred miles east of the\nAmerican boundary, in the region drained by the Klondyke and its\ntributaries. This is some three hundred miles by river from Circle City.\n\n\"We have described some of the beauties of the Yukon basin in the summer\nseason, but this radiant picture has its obverse side.\n\n\"Horseflies, gnats and mosquitoes add to the joys of living throughout\nthe entire length of the Yukon valley. The horsefly is larger and more\npoignantly assertive than the insect which we know by that name. In\ndressing or undressing, it has a pleasant habit of detecting any bare\nspot in the body and biting out a piece of flesh, leaving a wound which\na few days later looks like an incipient boil. Schwatka reports that one\nof his party, so bitten was completely disabled for a week. 'At the\nmoment of infliction.' he adds, 'it was hard to believe that one was not\ndisabled for life.'\n\n\"The mosquitoes according to the same authority are equally distressing.\nThey are especially fond of cattle, but without any reciprocity of\naffection. 'According to the general terms of the survival of the\nfittest and the growth of muscles most used to the detriment of others,'\nsays the lieutenant in an unusual burst of humor, 'a band of cattle\ninhabiting this district, in the far future, would be all tail and no\nbody, unless the mosquitoes should experience a change of numbers.'\"\n\nI am indebted to Wm. Ogilvie, Esq., for the following valuable\ninformation relative to The Yukon District.\n\n\"The Yukon District comprises, speaking generally, that part of the\nNorthwest Territories lying west of the water shed of the Mackenzie\nRiver; most of it is drained by the Yukon River and its tributaries. It\ncovers a distance of about 650 miles along the river from the coast\nrange of mountains.\n\n\"In 1848 Campbell established Fort Selkirk at the confluence of the\nPelly and Lewes Rivers; it was plundered and destroyed in 1852 by the\nCoast Indians, and only the ruins now exist of what was at one time the\nmost important post of the Hudson's Bay Company to the west of the Rocky\nMountains in the far north. In 1869 the Hudson's Bay Company's officer\nwas expelled from Fort Yukon by the United States Government, they\nhaying ascertained by astronomical observations that the post was not\nlocated in British territory. The officer thereupon ascended the\nPorcupine to a point which was supposed to be within British\njurisdiction, where he established Rampart House; but in 1890 Mr. J.H.\nTurner of the United States Coast Survey found it to be 20 miles within\nthe lines of the United States. Consequently in 1891 the post was moved\n20 miles further up the river to be within British territory.\n\n\"The next people to enter the country for trading purposes were Messrs.\nHarper and McQuestion. They have been trading in the country since 1873\nand have occupied numerous posts all along the river, the greater number\nof which have been abandoned. Mr. Harper is now located as a trader at\nFort Selkirk, with Mr. Joseph Ladue under the firm name of Harper &\nLadue, and Mr. McQuestion is in the employ of the Alaska Commercial\nCompany at Circle City, which is the distributing point for the vast\nregions surrounding Birch Creek, Alaska. In 1882 a number of miners\nentered the Yukon country by the Taiya Pass; it is still the only route\nused to any extent by the miners, and is shorter than the other passes\nthough not the lowest. In 1883 Lieutenant Schwatka crossed this same\npass and descended the Lewes and Yukon Rivers to the ocean.\n\n\"The explorers found that in proximity to the boundary line there\nexisted extensive and valuable placer gold mines, in which even then as\nmany as three hundred miners were at work. Mr. Ogilvie determined, by a\nseries of lunar observations, the point at which the Yukon River is\nintersected by the 141st meridian, and marked the same on the ground. He\nalso determined and marked the point at which the western affluent of\nthe Yukon, known as Forty Mile Creek, is crossed by the same meridian\nline, that point being situated at a distance of about twenty-three\nmiles from the mouth of the creek. This survey proved that the place\nwhich had been selected as the most convenient, owing to the physical\nconformation of the region, from which to distribute the supplies\nimported for the various mining camps, and from which to conduct the\nother business incident to the mining operations--a place situate at the\nconfluence of the Forty Mile Creek and the Yukon, and to which the name\nof Fort Cudahy has been given--is well within Canadian territory. The\ngreater proportion of the mines then being worked Mr. Ogilvie found to\nbe on the Canadian side of the international boundary line, but he\nreported the existence of some mining fields to the south, the exact\nposition of which with respect to the boundary he did not have the\nopportunity to fix.\n\n\"The number of persons engaged in mining in the locality mentioned has\nsteadily increased year by year since the date of Mr. Ogilvie's survey,\nand it is estimated that at the commencement of the past season not less\nthan one thousand men were so employed. Incident to this mineral\ndevelopment there must follow a corresponding growth in the volume of\nbusiness of all descriptions, particularly the importation of dutiable\ngoods, and the occupation of tracts of the public lands for mining\npurposes which according to the mining regulations are subject to the\npayment of certain prescribed dues and charges. The Alaska Commercial\nCompany, for many years subsequent to the retirement of the Hudson's Bay\nCompany, had a practical monopoly of the trade of the Yukon, carrying\ninto the country and delivering at various points along the river,\nwithout regard to the international boundary line or the customs laws\nand regulations of Canada, such articles of commerce as were required\nfor the prosecution of the fur trade and latterly of placer mining,\nthese being the only two existing industries. With the discovery of\ngold, however, came the organization of a competing company known as the\nNorth American Transportation and Trading Company, having its\nheadquarters in Chicago and its chief trading and distributing post at\nCudahy. This company has been engaged in this trade for over three\nyears, and during the past season despatched two ocean steamers from San\nFrancisco to St. Michael, at the mouth of the Yukon, the merchandise\nfrom which was, at the last mentioned point, transhipped into river\nsteamers and carried to points inland, but chiefly to the company's\ndistributing centre within Canadian territory. Importations of\nconsiderable value, consisting of the immediately requisite supplies of\nthe miners, and their tools, also reach the Canadian portion of the\nYukon District from Juneau, in the United States, by way of the Taiya\nInlet, the mountain passes, and the chain of waterways leading therefrom\nto Cudahy. Upon none of these importations had any duty been collected,\nexcept a sum of $3,248.80 paid to Inspector Constantine in 1894, by the\nNorth American Transportation and Trading Company and others, and it is\nsafe to conclude, especially when it is remembered that the country\nproduces none of the articles consumed within it except fresh meat, that\na large revenue was being lost to the public exchequer under the then\nexisting conditions.\n\n\"For the purpose of ascertaining officially and authoritatively the\ncondition of affairs to which the correspondence referred to in the\nnext preceding paragraph relates, the Honorable the President of the\nPrivy Council, during the spring of 1894, despatched Inspector Charles\nConstantine, of the Northwest Mounted Police Force, accompanied by\nSergeant Brown, to Fort Cudahy and the mining camps in its vicinity. The\nreport made by Mr. Constantine on his return, established the\nsubstantial accuracy of the representations already referred to. The\nvalue of the total output of gold for the season of 1894 he estimated at\n$300,000.\n\n\"The facts recited clearly establish--first, that the time had arrived\nwhen it became the duty of the Government of Canada to make more\nefficient provision for the maintenance of order, the enforcement of the\nlaws, and the administration of justice in the Yukon country, especially\nin that section of it in which placer mining for gold is being\nprosecuted upon such an extensive scale, situated near to the boundary\nseparating the Northwest Territories from the possessions of the United\nStates in Alaska; and, second, that while such measures as were\nnecessary to that end were called for in the interests of humanity, and\nparticularly for the security and safety of the lives and property of\nthe Canadian subjects of Her Majesty resident in that country who are\nengaged in legitimate business pursuits, it was evident that the revenue\njustly due to the Government of Canada, under its customs, excise and\nland laws, and which would go a long way to pay the expenses of\ngovernment, was being lost for the want of adequate machinery for its\ncollection.\n\n\"Accordingly in June last a detachment[1] of twenty members of the\nMounted Police Force including officers was detailed for service in\nthat portion of the Northwest Territories. The officer in command, in\naddition to the magisterial and other duties he is required to perform\nby virtue of his office and under instructions from the Department of\nMounted Police, was duly authorized to represent where necessary, and\nuntil other arrangements can be made, all the departments of the\ngovernment having interests in that region. Particularly he is\nauthorized to perform the duties of Dominion lands agent, collector of\ncustoms, and collector of inland revenue. At the same time instructions\nwere given Mr. William Ogilvie, the surveyor referred to as having, with\nDr. Dawson, been entrusted with the conduct of the first government\nexpedition to the Yukon, to proceed again to that district for the\npurpose of continuing and extending the work of determining the 141st\nmeridian, of laying out building lots and mining claims, and generally\nof performing such duties as may be entrusted to him from time to time.\nMr. Ogilvie's qualifications as a surveyor, and his previous experience\nas explorer of this section of the Northwest, peculiarly fit him for the\ntask.\n\n[Footnote 1: The detachment was made up as follows:--Inspector C.\nConstantine, Officer Commanding Yukon Detachment N.W.M. Police;\nInspector, D.A.E. Strickland; Assistant Surgeon, A.E. Wills; 2 Staff\nSergeants; 2 Corporals; 13 Constables.]\n\n\"As it appears quite certain, from the report made by Mr. Ogilvie on his\nreturn to Ottawa, in 1889, and from the report of Mr. Constantine, that\nthe operations of the miners are being conducted upon streams which have\ntheir sources in the United States Territory of Alaska, and flow into\nCanada on their way to join the Yukon, and as doubtless some of the\nplacer diggings under development are situated on the United States side\nof the boundary it is highly desirable, both for the purpose of settling\ndefinitely to which country any land occupied for mining or other\npurposes actually belongs, and in order that the jurisdiction of the\ncourts and officers of the United States and Canada, for both civil and\ncriminal purposes, may be established, that the determination of the\n141st meridian west of Greenwich from the point of its intersection\nwith the Yukon, as marked by Mr. Ogilvie in 1887-88, for a considerable\ndistance south of the river, and possibly also for some distance to the\nnorth, should be proceeded with at once. Mr. Ogilvie's instructions\nrequire him to go on with the survey with all convenient speed, but in\norder that this work may be effective for the accomplishment of the\nobject in view the co-operation of the Government of the United States\nis necessary. Correspondence is in progress through the proper\nauthorities with a view to obtaining this co-operation. It may be\nmentioned that a United States surveyor has also determined the points\nat which the Yukon River and Forty Mile Creek are intersected by the\n141st meridian.\"\n\n\nROUTES, DISTANCES, AND TRANSPORTATION.\n\nAfter considerable experience I have decided that the best route for a\nman to take to the gold regions is from Seattle, Washington, to Juneau,\nAlaska, and then to Dawson City, by the pass and waterways, and I will\ntherefore describe this route more in detail than any of the others.\n\nI am devoting a special chapter to the outfit for travellers, and will\ntherefore deal in this chapter with the route only.\n\nThe traveller having paid his fare to Seattle should on arrival there\nhave not less than $500. This is the minimum sum necessary to pay his\nfare from Seattle to Juneau, purchase his outfit and supplies for one\nyear and pay his necessary expenses in the gold region for that length\nof time.\n\nI think it deplorable that so many are starting at this time for the\ngold-fields. I do not recommend starting before March 15. I will return\nat that time to my claims on the Klondyke, if it were wise to go sooner,\nI should certainly go.\n\nThe reason March 15 is best is that the season is better then. If a man\nhas only, say, $500 and wants to do his own packing over the Taiya Pass,\nit gives him time to do it by starting March 15, as he will then be in\nJuneau April 1st. I fear a great deal of hardship for those who started\nout so as to reach Juneau for winter travel.\n\nOf course while I say $500 is sufficient to go to Dawson City, a man\nshould take $1,000 or even more if possible as he will have many\nopportunities to invest the surplus.\n\nWhile prices will undoubtedly advance at Dawson City owing to the large\ninflux of people, I do not think the advance will be excessive. It has\nnever been the policy of the two trading companies to take advantage of\nthe miners.\n\nThe traveller having arrived in Juneau from Seattle, a journey of 725\nmiles by water, immediately purchases his complete outfit as described\nin another chapter. He then loses no time in leaving Juneau for Dyea,\ntaking a small steamboat which runs regularly to this port via the Lynn\nCanal. Dyea has recently been made a customs port of entry and the head\nof navigation this side of the Taiya Pass. The distance between Juneau\nand Dyea is about one hundred miles.\n\nFrom Dyea, which is the timber-line, he packs his outfit to the foot of\nthe Taiya Pass--the length of which to the summit is about 15 miles. He\nmust now carry his outfit up the Pass, which he generally does in two or\nmore trips according to the weight of his outfit, unless he is able to\nhire Indians or mules; but so far there are very few Indians to be hired\nand still fewer mules.\n\nHe now starts for Lake Lindeman from the head of the Pass, a distance of\neight miles--the distance from Dyea to Lake Lindeman being 31 miles.\n\nAt Lake Lindeman he commences to make his boat, for which he has brought\nthe proper supplies in his outfit, with the exception of the timber,\nwhich he finds at Lake Lindeman. He spends one week at Lake Lindeman\nmaking his boat and getting ready for the long trip down the waterways\nto Dawson City, the heart of the Klondyke region. The trip through Lake\nLindeman is short, the lake being only five miles long. At the foot of\nthe lake he must portage to Lake Bennet, the portage however being very\nshort, less than a mile.\n\nLake Bennet is 28 miles long, while going through this lake the\ntraveller crosses the boundary between British Columbia and the\nNorthwest Territory.\n\nAfter going down Lake Bennet the traveller comes to Caribou\nCrossing--about four miles long, which takes him to Lake Tagish, twenty\nmiles in length. After leaving Tagish he finds himself in Mud or Marsh\nLake, 24 miles long, then into the Lynx River, on which he continues for\n27 miles till he comes to Miles Canyon, five-eighths of a mile long.\n\nImmediately on leaving Miles Canyon he has three miles of what is called\nbad river work, which, while not hazardous, is dangerous from the swift\ncurrent and from being very rocky. Great care has to be taken in going\ndown this part of the river.\n\nHe now finds himself in White Horse Canyon the rapids of which are\nthree-eighths of a mile in length and one of the most dangerous places\non the trip, a man is here guarded by a sign, \"Keep a good lookout.\"\n\nNo stranger or novice should try to run the White Horse Rapids alone in\na boat. He should let his boat drop down the river guided by a rope with\nwhich he has provided himself in his outfit and which should be 150 feet\nlong. It would be better if the traveller should portage here, the\nminers having constructed a portage road on the west side and put down\nroller-ways in some places on which they roll their boats over. They\nhave also made some windlasses with which they haul their boat up the\nhill till they are at the foot of the canyon. The White Horse Canyon is\nvery rocky and dangerous and the current extremely swift.\n\nAfter leaving the White Horse Canyon he goes down the river to the head\nof Lake Labarge, a distance of 14 miles. He can sit down and steer with\nthe current, as he is going down the stream all the way. It is for this\nreason that in returning from the diggings he should take another\nroute, of which he will get full particulars before leaving Dawson;\ntherefore I do not take the time to give a full description of the\nreturn trip via the Yukon to St. Michael. He now goes through Lake\nLabarge--for 31 miles--till he strikes the Lewes River, this taking him\ndown to Hootalinqua. He is now in the Lewes River which takes him for 25\nmiles to Big Salmon River and from Big Salmon River 45 miles to Little\nSalmon River--the current all this time taking him down at the rate of\nfive miles an hour. Of course in the canyons it is very much swifter.\n\nThe Little Salmon River takes him to Five Finger Rapids, a distance of\none hundred and twenty miles. In the Five Finger Rapids the voyage\nshould be made on the right side of the river, going with the current.\nThese rapids are considered safe by careful management, but the novice\nwill already have had sufficient experience in guiding his boat before\nreaching them.\n\nFrom Five Finger Rapids the traveller goes six miles below, down the\nLewes, to the Rink Rapids. On going through the Rink Rapids, he\ncontinues on the Lewes River to Fort Selkirk, the trading post of Harper\nand Ladue, where the Pelly and Lewes, at their junction, form the\nheadwaters of the Yukon. You are now at the head of the Yukon River, and\nthe worst part of your trip is over.\n\nYou now commence to go down the Yukon, and after a trip of ninety-eight\nmiles, you are in the White River. You keep on the White River for ten\nmiles, to the Stewart River, and then twenty-five miles to Fort Ogilvie.\nYou are now only forty miles from Dawson City.\n\nYour journey is now almost ended. After a forty-mile trip on the Yukon,\nyou arrive at Dawson City, where the Klondyke empties in the Yukon.\n\nAll through this trip you have been going through a mountainous country,\nthe trees there being pine, a small amount of spruce, cottonwood and\nbirch. You have not seen much game, if any, as it is growing scarce\nalong that line of river, and very hard to find. The traveller had\ntherefore better make preparation to depend on the provisions he has\nbrought with him. If he has stopped to fish, he may have been successful\nin catching whitefish, grayling and lake trout, along the lakes and\nrivers.\n\nThe total journey from Seattle to Dawson City has taken about two\nmonths. In connection with this trip from Juneau to Dawson City, it is\nperhaps better to give the reader the benefit of the trip of Mr. William\nStewart, who writes from Lake Lindeman, May 31st, 1897, as follows:--\n\n\"We arrived here at the south end of the lake last night by boat. We\nhave had an awful time of it. The Taiya Pass is not a pass at all, but a\nclimb right over the mountains. We left Juneau on Thursday, the\ntwentieth, on a little boat smaller than the ferry at Ottawa. There were\nover sixty aboard, all in one room about ten by fourteen. There was\nbaggage piled up in one end so that the floor-space was only about eight\nby eight. We went aboard about three o'clock in the afternoon and went\nashore at Dyea at seven o'clock Friday night. We got the Indians to pack\nall our stuff up to the summit, but about fifty pounds each; I had\nforty-eight pounds and my gun.\n\n\"We left Dyea, an Indian village, Sunday, but only got up the river one\nmile. We towed all the stuff up the river seven miles, and then packed\nit to Sheep Camp. We reached Sheep Camp about seven o'clock at night, on\nthe Queen's Birthday. A beautiful time we had, I can tell you, climbing\nhills with fifty pounds on our backs. It would not be so bad if we could\nstrap it on rightly.\n\n\"We left Sheep Camp next morning at four o'clock, and reached the summit\nat half-past seven. It was an awful climb--an angle of about fifty-five\ndegrees. We could keep our hands touching the trail all the way up. It\nwas blowing and snowing up there. We paid off the Indians, and got some\nsleighs and sleighed the stuff down the hill. This hill goes down pretty\nswift, and then drops at an angle of fifty-five degrees for about forty\nfeet, and we had to rough-lock our sleighs and let them go. There was an\nawful fog, and we could not see where we were going. Some fellows helped\nus down with the first load, or there would have been nothing left of\nus. When we let a sleigh go from the top it jumps about fifty feet\nclear, and comes down in pieces. We loaded up the sleighs with some of\nour stuff, about two hundred and twenty-five pounds each, and started\nacross the lakes. The trail was awful, and we waded through water and\nslush two and three feet deep. We got to the mouth of the canyon at\nabout eight o'clock at night, done out. We left there that night, and\npushed on again until morning. We got to the bottom of an awful hill,\nand packed all our stuff from there to the hill above the lake. We had\nabout two and a half miles over hills, in snow and slush. I carried\nabout five hundred pounds over that part of the trail. We had to get\ndogs to bring the stuff down from the summit to the head of the canyon.\n\n\"We worked two days bringing the stuff over from the canyon to the hill\nabove the lake. Saturday we worked all day packing down the hill to the\nlake, and came here on a scow. We were out yesterday morning cutting\ndown trees to build a boat. The timber is small, and I don't think we\ncan get more than four-inch stuff. It rained all afternoon, and we\ncouldn't do anything. There are about fifty boats of all sorts on Lake\nBennet, which is about half a mile from here. I have long rubber boots\nup to the hips, and I did not have them on coming from the summit down,\nbut I have worn them ever since.\n\n\"We met Barwell and Lewis, of Ottawa, to-day. They were out looking for\nknees for their boats. They left Ottawa six weeks ago, and have not got\nany farther than we have. There was a little saw-mill going here, and\nthey have their lumber sawn. We have it that warm some days here that\nyou would fairly roast, and the next day you would be looking for your\novercoat. Everybody here seems to be taking in enough food to do them a\ncouple of years.\n\n\"We are now in Canadian territory, after we passed the summit. I will\nhave to catch somebody going through to Dyea to give him this letter,\nbut I don't know how long before I can get any one going through. This\nis the last you will hear from me until I get down to the Klondyke.\"\n\nMr. Stewart adds: \"I wrote this in the tent at 11 o'clock at night\nduring twilight.\"\n\nIf you take this trip in winter, however, you have to purchase a sled at\nJuneau, and sled it over the frozen waterways to Dawson City.\n\nFor the benefit of my readers in Canada and for parties leaving for the\ngreat Northwest Territory for the gold fields, I take pleasure in\nquoting the following description of a Canadian route:--\n\n\"Canadians should awaken to the fact that they have emphatically 'the\ninside track' to their own gold fields, a route not half the distance,\nlargely covered by railways and steamboats, with supply stations at\nconvenient intervals all the way. By this route the gold-fields can be\nreached in two months or six weeks, and the cost of travel is\nridiculously cheap--nearly anybody can afford to go even now, and by the\nspring it should be fitted out for the accommodation of any amount of\ntraffic.\n\n\"The details of the information in the following article are given by Mr.\nA.H.H. Heming, the artist who accompanied Mr. Whitney in his journey\ntowards the Barren Lands, and the data may be accepted as correct, as\nthey were secured from the Hudson Bay officials.\n\n\"The details of the inland Canadian route, briefly, are as follows: By\nC.P.R. to Calgary, and thence north by rail to Edmonton; from there by\nstage to Athabasca Landing, 40 miles; then, there is a continuous\nwaterway for canoe travel to Fort Macpherson, at the mouth of the\nMackenzie River, from which point the Peel River lies southward to the\ngold region. The exact figures are as follows:\n\n                                                 MILES.\nEdmonton to Athabasca Landing                      40\nTo Port McMurray                                  240\nFort Chippewyan                                   185\nSmith Landing                                     102\nFort Smith                                         16\nFort Resolution                                   194\nFort Providence                                   168\nFort Simpson                                      161\nFort Wrigley                                      136\nFort Norman                                       184\nFort Good Hope                                    174\nFort Macpherson                                   282\n                                                 -----\nTotal                                            1882\n\n\"There are only two portages on this route of any size--that from\nEdmonton to Athabasca Landing, over which there is a stage and wagon\nline, and at Smith Landing, sixteen miles, over which the Hudson Bay\nCompany has a tramway. There are four or five other portages of a few\nhundred yards, but with these exceptions there is a fine \"down grade\"\nwater route all the way. It is the old Hudson Bay trunk line to the\nnorth that has been in use for nearly a century. Wherever there is a\nlake or a long stretch of deep water river navigation the company has\nsmall freight steamers which ply back and forward during the summer\nbetween the portage points or shallows. With comparatively little\nexpenditure the company or the Government can improve the facilities\nalong the line so that any amount of freight or any number of passengers\ncan be taken into the gold region at less than half the time and cost\nthat it takes Americans to reach it from Port St. Michael, at the mouth\nof the Yukon to the Klondyke, exclusive of the steamer trip of 2500\nmiles from Seattle to Port St. Michael.\n\n\"Canadians can leave here on a Monday at 11.15 A.M., and reach Edmonton\non Friday at 7 P.M. From that point, a party of three men with a canoe,\nshould reach Fort Macpherson easily in from 50 to 60 days, provided they\nare able-bodied young fellows with experience in that sort of travel.\nThey will need to take canoes from here, unless they propose to hire\nIndians with large birch bark canoes to carry them. Birch bark canoes\ncan be secured of any size up to the big ones manned by ten Indians that\ncarry three tons. But birch barks are not reliable unless Indians are\ntaken along to doctor them, and keep them from getting water-logged. The\nHudson Bay Company will also contract to take freight northward on their\nsteamers until the close of navigation. Travellers to the gold mines\nleaving now would probably reach Fort Macpherson before navigation\nclosed.\n\n\"The letter from Rev. Mr. Stringer, the missionary, published in the\nSpectator on July 2, shows that the ice had only commenced to run in the\nPeel River, which is the water route south-east from Fort Macpherson\ninto the gold region, on September 30 last year.\n\n\"Any Canadians who are anxious to get into the Klondyke ahead of the\nAmericans can leave between now and August 1, reach Fort Macpherson,\nand if winter comes on they can exchange their canoes for dog trains,\nand reach the Klondyke without half the difficulty that would be\nexperienced on the Alaska route. The great advantage of the inland route\nis that it is an organized line of communication. Travellers need not\ncarry any more food than will take them from one Hudson Bay post to the\nnext, and then there is abundance of fish and wild fowl en route. They\ncan also be in touch with such civilization as prevails up there, can\nalways get assistance at the posts, and will have some place to stay\nshould they fall sick or meet with an accident. If they are lucky enough\nto make their pile in the Klondyke, they can come back by the dog sled\nroute during the winter. (There is one winter mail to Fort Macpherson in\nwinter.) Dogs for teams can be purchased at nearly any of the line of\nHudson Bay posts that form a chain of road-houses on the trip.\n\n\"Parties travelling alone will not need to employ guides until they get\nnear Fort Macpherson, and from there on to the Klondyke, as the rest of\nthe route from Edmonton is so well defined, having been travelled for\nyears, that no guides are required.\n\n\"You don't need a couple of thousand dollars to start for Klondyke\nto-morrow by the Edmonton route. All you need is a good constitution,\nsome experience in boating and camping, and about $150. Suppose a party\nof three decide to start. First they will need to purchase a canoe,\nabout $35 or less; first-class ticket from Hamilton to Edmonton, $71.40;\nsecond class, ditto, $40.90; cost of food at Edmonton for three men for\ntwo months (should consist of pork, flour, tea and baking-powder), $35;\nfreight on canoe to Edmonton, $23. Total for three men from Hamilton to\nFort Macpherson, provided they travel second-class on the C.P.R. will be\n$218.70. These figures are furnished by Mr. Heming, who has been over\nthe route 400 miles north of Edmonton, and got the rest of his data\nfrom the Hudson Bay officials.\n\n\"If three men chip in $150 each they would have a margin of over $200 for\npurchasing their tools and for transport from Fort Macpherson to the\nKlondyke. This is how it may be done on the cheap, though Mr. Heming\nconsiders it ample for any party starting this summer. Prices will\nlikely rise on the route when the rush begins. If the Hudson Bay people\nare alive to their interests they will forward a large amount of\nsupplies for Fort Macpherson immediately and make it the base of\nsupplies for the Klondyke during the coming winter.\n\n\"Parties should consist of three men each, as that is the crew of a\ncanoe. It will take 600 pounds of food to carry three men over the\nroute. Passengers on the C.P.R. are entitled to carry 600 pounds of\nbaggage. The paddling is all down stream, except when they turn south up\nPeel River, and sails should be taken, as there is often a favorable\nwind for days.\n\n\"There are large scows on the line, manned by ten men each and known as\n'sturgeon heads.' They are like canal boats, but are punted along and\nare used by the Hudson Bay people for taking forward supplies to the\nforts.\n\nThe return trip to the United States is usually made by the Yukon\nsteamers from Dawson City direct to St. Michael via the Yukon and Anvik\nRiver, thence by ocean steamer from St. Michael to San Francisco.\"\n\nThe following letter is interesting to the prospector as showing the\ndifficulties to overcome up the Taiya Pass to Lake Lindeman.\n\n_Winnipeg_, July 27, 1897.\n\nA letter has been received from George McLeod, one of the members of the\nWinnipeg party of gold hunters that left here recently for the Yukon.\nHe wrote from Lake Lindeman under date of July 4, and states that the\nparty expected to leave on the journey from the river a week later. They\nhad a fine boat, with a freight capacity of two tons about completed.\nThe real work of the expedition started when the small steamer which\nconveyed the party from Juneau arrived at Dyea. The men had to transfer\ntheir goods to a lighter one mile from shore, each man looking after his\nown packages. After getting everything ashore the party was organized\nfor ascent of the mountain pass, which at the hardest point is 3,000\nfeet above sea level. McLeod and his chum, to save time and money too,\nengaged 35 Indians to pack their supplies over the mountains, but they\nhad to carry their own bedding and grub to keep them on the road. It is\nfifteen miles to the summit of the pass and the party made twelve miles\nthe first day, going into camp at night tired from climbing over rocks,\nstumps, logs and hills, working through rivers and creeks and pushing\ntheir way through brush. At the end of twelve miles they thought they\nhad gone fifty. On the second day out they began to scale the summit of\nthe mountain. Hill after hill confronted them, each one being steeper\nthan the last. There was snow on the top of the mountain, and rain was\nfalling, and this added greatly to the difficulties of the ascent. In\nmany places the men had to crawl on their hands and knees, so\nprecipitous was the mountain side. Time after time the men would slip\nback several inches, but they recovered themselves and went at it again.\n\nFinally, the summit was gained, McLeod being the first of the party to\nreach the top. After resting and changing their clothes the descent was\ncommenced. McLeod and his chums purchased sleighs, on which they loaded\ntheir goods and hauled for five miles. This was extremely laborious\nwork, and the men were so used up working in the scorching sun that\nthey were compelled to work at nights and sleep during the day. Two days\nafter the descent began the sleighs were abandoned, and the men packed\nthe goods for three miles and a half. They were fortunate in securing\nthe services of a man who had two horses to convey the goods to Lake\nLindeman.\n\nMcLeod says the worry in getting over the pass is terrible, and he has\nno desire to repeat the experience.

Telegraph Creek is the head of steamer\nnavigation on the Stikine River and is about 150 miles from Teslin Lake.\nThe Yukon is navigable for steamers from its mouth to Teslin Lake, a\ndistance of 2,300 miles. A road is being located by the Dominion\nGovernment. A grant of $2,000 has been made by the province of British\nColumbia for opening it.\n\n\"J. Dalton, a trader, has used a route overland from Chilkat Inlet to\nFort Selkirk. Going up the Chilkat and Klaheela Rivers, he crosses the\ndivide to the Tahkeena River and continues northward over a fairly open\ncountry practicable for horses. The distance from the sea to Fort\nSelkirk is 350 miles.\n\n\"Last summer a Juneau butcher sent 40 head of cattle to Cudahy. G.\nBounds, the man in charge, crossed the divide over the Chilkat Pass,\nfollowed the shore of Lake Arkell and, keeping to the east of Dalton's\ntrail, reached the Yukon just below the Rink Rapids. Here the cattle\nwere slaughtered and the meat floated down on a raft to Cudahy, where it\nretailed at $1 a pound.\n\n\"It is proposed to establish a winter road somewhere across the country\ntravelled over by Dalton and Bounds. The Yukon cannot be followed, the\nice being too much broken, so that any winter road will have to be\noverland. A thorough exploration is now being made of all the passes at\nthe head of Lynn Canal and of the upper waters of the Yukon. In a few\nmonths it is expected that the best routes for reaching the district\nfrom Lynn Canal will be definitely known.\n\n\"It is said by those familiar with the locality that the storms which\nrage in the upper altitudes of the coast range during the greater part\nof the time, from October to March, are terrific. A man caught in one of\nthem runs the risk of losing his life, unless he can reach shelter in a\nshort time. During the summer there is nearly always a wind blowing from\nthe sea up Chatham Strait and Lynn Canal, which lie in almost a straight\nline with each other, and at the head of Lynn Canal are Chilkat and\nChilkoot Inlets. The distance from the coast down these channels to\nthe open sea is about 380 miles. The mountains on each side of the\nwater confine the currents of air, and deflect inclined currents in the\ndirection of the axis of the channel, so that there is nearly always a\nstrong wind blowing up the channel. Coming from the sea, this wind is\nheavily charged with moisture, which is precipitated when the air\ncurrents strike the mountains, and the fall of rain and snow is\nconsequently very heavy.\n\n\"In Chilkat Inlet there is not much shelter from the south wind, which\nrenders it unsafe for ships calling there. Capt. Hunter told me he would\nrather visit any other part of the coast than Chilkat.\n\n\"To carry the survey from the island across to Chilkoot Inlet I had to\nget up on the mountains north of Haines mission, and from there could\nsee both inlets. Owing to the bad weather I could get no observation for\nazimuth, and had to produce the survey from Pyramid Island to Taiya\nInlet by reading the angles of deflection between the courses. At Taiya\nInlet I got my first observation, and deduced the azimuths of my courses\nup to that point. Taiya Inlet has evidently been the valley of a\nglacier; its sides are steep and smooth from glacial action; and this,\nwith the wind almost constantly blowing landward, renders getting upon\nthe shore difficult. Some long sights were therefore necessary. The\nsurvey was made up to the head of the Inlet on the 2d of June.\nPreparations were then commenced for taking the supplies and instruments\nover the coast range of mountains to the head of Lake Lindeman on the\nLewes River. Commander Newell kindly aided me in making arrangements\nwith the Indians, and did all he could to induce them to be reasonable\nin their demands. This, however, neither he nor any one else could\naccomplish. They refused to carry to the lake for less than $20 per\nhundred pounds, and as they had learned that the expedition was an\nEnglish one, the second chief of the Chilkoot Indians recalled some\nmemories of an old quarrel which the tribe had with the English many\nyears ago, in which an uncle of his was killed, and he thought we should\npay for the loss of his uncle by being charged an exorbitant price for\nour packing, of which he had the sole control. Commander Newell told him\nI had a permit from the Great Father at Washington to pass through his\ncountry safely, that he would see that I did so, and if the Indians\ninterfered with me they would be punished for doing so. After much talk\nthey consented to carry our stuff to the summit of the mountain for $10\nper hundred pounds. This is about two-thirds of the whole distance,\nincludes all the climbing and all the woods, and is by far the most\ndifficult part of the way.\n\n\"On the 6th of June 120 Indians, men, women and children, started for\nthe summit. I sent two of my party with them to see the goods delivered\nat the place agreed upon. Each carrier when given a pack also got a\nticket, on which was inscribed the contents of the pack, its weight, and\nthe amount the individual was to get for carrying it. They were made to\nunderstand that they had to produce these tickets on delivering their\npacks, but were not told for what reason. As each pack was delivered one\nof my men receipted the ticket and returned it. The Indians did not seem\nto understand the import of this; a few of them pretended to have lost\ntheir tickets; and as they could not get paid without them, my\nassistant, who had duplicates of every ticket, furnished them with\nreceipted copies, after examining their packs.\n\n\"While they were packing to the summit I was producing the survey, and I\nmet them on their return at the foot of the canon, about eight miles\nfrom the coast, where I paid them. They came to the camp in the early\nmorning before I was up, and for about two hours there was quite a\nhubbub. When paying them I tried to get their names, but very few of\nthem would give any Indian name, nearly all, after a little reflection,\ngiving some common English name. My list contained little else than\nJack, Tom, Joe, Charlie, &c. some of which were duplicated three and\nfour times. I then found why some of them had pretended to lose their\ntickets at the summit. Three or four who had thus acted presented\nthemselves twice for payment, producing first the receipted ticket,\nafterwards the one they claimed to have lost, demanding pay for both.\nThey were much taken aback when they found that their duplicity had been\ndiscovered.\n\n\"These Indians are perfectly heartless. They will not render even the\nsmallest aid to each other without payment; and if not to each other,\nmuch less to a white man. I got one of them, whom I had previously\nassisted with his pack, to take me and two of my party over a small\ncreek in his canoe. After putting us across he asked for money, and I\ngave him half a dollar. Another man stepped up and demanded pay, stating\nthat the canoe was his. To see what the result would be, I gave to him\nthe same amount as to the first. Immediately there were three or four\nmore claimants for the canoe. I dismissed them with a blessing, and made\nup my mind that I would wade the next creek.\n\n\"While paying them I was a little apprehensive of trouble, for they\ninsisted on crowding into my tent, and for myself and the four men who\nwere with me to have attempted to eject them would have been to invite\ntrouble. I am strongly of the opinion that these Indians would have been\nmuch more difficult to deal with if they had not known that Commander\nNewell remained in the inlet to see that I got through without accident.\n\n\"While making the survey from the head of tide water I took the azimuths\nand altitudes of several of the highest peaks around the head of the\ninlet, in order to locate them, and obtain an idea of the general\nheight of the peaks in the coast range. As it does not appear to have\nbeen done before, I have taken the opportunity of naming all the peaks,\nthe positions of which I fixed in the above way. The names and altitudes\nappear on my map.\n\n\"While going up from the head of canoe navigation on the Taiya River I\ntook the angles of elevation of each station from the preceding one. I\nwould have done this from tide water up, but found many of the courses\nso short and with so little increase in height that with the instrument\nI had it was inappreciable. From these angles I have computed the height\nof the summit of the Taiya Pass,[2] above the head of canoe navigation,\nas it appeared to me in June, 1887, and find it to be 3,378 feet. What\ndepth of snow there was I cannot say. The head of canoe navigation I\nestimate at about 120 feet above tide water. Dr. Dawson gives it as 124\nfeet.\n\n[Footnote 2: The distance from the head of Taiya Inlet to the summit of\nthe pass is 15 miles, and the whole length of the pass to Lake Lindeman\nis 23 miles. Messrs. Healy and Wilson, dealers in general merchandise\nand miners' supplies at Taiya, have a train of pack horses carrying\nfreight from the head of Lynn Canal to the summit. They hope to be able\nto take freight through to Lake Lindeman with their horses during the\npresent season.]\n\n\"I determined the descent from the summit to Lake Lindeman by carrying\nthe aneroid from the lake to the summit and back again, the interval of\ntime from start to return being about eight hours. Taking the mean of\nthe readings at the lake, start and return, and the single reading at\nthe summit, the height of the summit above the lake was found to be\n1,237 feet. While making the survey from the summit down to the lake I\ntook the angles of depression of each station from the preceding one,\nand from these angles I deduced the difference of height, which I found\nto be 1,354 feet, or 117 feet more than that found by the aneroid. This\nis quite a large difference; but when we consider the altitude of the\nplace, the sudden changes of temperature, and the atmospheric\nconditions, it is not more than one might expect.\n\n\"While at Juneau I heard reports of a low pass from the head of Chilkoot\nInlet to the head waters of Lewes River. During the time I was at the\nhead of Taiya Inlet I made inquiries regarding it, and found that there\nwas such a pass, but could learn nothing definite about it from either\nwhites or Indians. As Capt. Moore, who accompanied me, was very anxious\nto go through it, and as the reports of the Taiya Pass indicated that no\nwagon road or railroad could ever be built through it, while the new\npass appeared, from what little knowledge I could get of it, to be much\nlower and possibly feasible for a wagon road, I determined to send the\ncaptain by that way, if I could get an Indian to accompany him. This, I\nfound, would be difficult to do. None of the Chilkoots appeared to know\nanything of the pass, and I concluded that they wished to keep its\nexistence and condition a secret. The Tagish, or Stick Indians, as the\ninterior Indians are locally called, are afraid to do anything in\nopposition to the wishes of the Chilkoots; so it was difficult to get\nany of them to join Capt. Moore; but after much talk and encouragement\nfrom the whites around, one of them named \"Jim\" was induced to go. He\nhad been through this pass before, and proved reliable and useful. The\ninformation obtained from Capt. Moore's exploration I have incorporated\nin my plan of the survey from Taiya Inlet, but it is not as complete as\nI would have liked. I have named this pass \"White Pass,\" in honor of the\nlate Hon. Thos. White, Minister of the Interior, under whose authority\nthe expedition was organized. Commencing at Taiya Inlet, about two miles\nsouth of its north end, it follows up the valley, of the Shkagway River\nto its source, and thence down the valley of another river which Capt.\nMoore reported to empty into the Takone or Windy Arm of Bove Lake\n(Schwatka). Dr. Dawson says this stream empties into Taku Arm, and in\nthat event Capt. Moore is mistaken. Capt. Moore did not go all the way\nthrough to the lake, but assumed from reports he heard from the miners\nand others that the stream flowed into Windy Arm, and this also was the\nidea of the Indian \"Jim\" from what I could gather from his remarks in\nbroken English and Chinook. Capt. Moore estimates the distance from tide\nwater to the summit at about 18 miles, and from the summit to the lake\nat about 22 to 23 miles. He reports the pass as thickly timbered all the\nway through.\n\n\"The timber line on the south side of the Taiya Pass, as determined by\nbarometer reading, is about 2,300 feet above the sea, while on the north\nside it is about 1,000 feet below the summit. This large difference is\ndue, I think, to the different conditions in the two places. On the\nsouth side the valley is narrow and deep, and the sun cannot produce its\nfull effect. The snow also is much deeper there, owing to the quantity\nwhich drifts in from the surrounding mountains. On the north side the\nsurface is sloping, and more exposed to the sun's rays. On the south\nside the timber is of the class peculiar to the coast, and on the north\nthat peculiar to the interior. The latter would grow at a greater\naltitude than the coast timber. It is possible that the summit of White\nPass is not higher than the timber line on the north of the Taiya Pass,\nor about 2,500 feet above tide water, and it is possibly even lower than\nthis, as the timber in a valley such as the White Pass would hardly live\nat the same altitude as on the open <DW72> on the north side.\n\n\"Capt. Moore has had considerable experience in building roads in\nmountainous countries. He considers that this would be an easy route for\na wagon road compared with some roads he has seen in British Columbia.\nAssuming his distances to be correct, and the height of the pass to be\nprobably about correctly indicated, the grades would not be very steep,\nand a railroad could easily be carried through if necessary.\n\n\"After completing the survey down to the lake, I set about getting my\nbaggage down too. Of all the Indians who came to the summit with packs,\nonly four or five could be induced to remain and pack down to the lake,\nalthough I was paying them at the rate of $4 per hundred pounds. After\none trip down only two men remained, and they only in hopes of stealing\nsomething. One of them appropriated a pair of boots, and was much\nsurprised to find that he had to pay for them on being settled with. I\ncould not blame them much for not caring to work, as the weather was\nvery disagreeable--it rained or snowed almost continuously. After the\nIndians left I tried to get down the stuff with the aid of my own men,\nbut it was slavish and unhealthy labor, and after the first trip one of\nthem was laid up with what appeared to be inflammatory rheumatism. The\nfirst time the party crossed, the sun was shining brightly, and this\nbrought on snow blindness, the pain of which only those who have\nsuffered from this complaint can realize. I had two sleds with me which\nwere made in Juneau specially for the work of getting over the mountains\nand down the lakes on the ice. With these I succeeded in bringing about\na ton and a-half to the lakes, but found that the time it would take to\nget all down in this way would seriously interfere with the programme\narranged with Dr. Dawson, to say nothing of the suffering of the men and\nmyself, and the liability to sickness which protracted physical exertion\nunder such uncomfortable conditions and continued suffering from snow\nblindness expose us to. I had with me a white man who lived at the head\nof the inlet with a Tagish Indian woman. This man had a good deal of\ninfluence with the Tagish tribe, of whom the greater number were then\nin the neighborhood where he resided, trying to get some odd jobs of\nwork, and I sent him to the head of the inlet to try and induce the\nTagish Indians to undertake the transportation, offering them $5 per\nhundred pounds. In the meantime Capt. Moore and the Indian \"Jim\" had\nrejoined me. I had their assistance for a day or two, and \"Jim's\"\npresence aided indirectly in inducing the Indians to come to my relief.\n\n\"The Tagish are little more than slaves to the more powerful coast\ntribes, and are in constant dread of offending them in any way. One of\nthe privileges which the coast tribes claim is the exclusive right to\nall work on the coast or in its vicinity, and the Tagish are afraid to\ndispute this claim. When my white man asked the Tagish to come over and\npack they objected on the grounds mentioned. After considerable ridicule\nof their cowardice, and explanation of the fact that they had the\nexclusive right to all work in their own country, the country on the\nside of the north side of the coast range being admitted by the coast\nIndians to belong to the Tagish tribe just as the coast tribes had the\nprivilege of doing all the work on the coast side of the mountains, and\nthat one of their number was already working with me unmolested, and\nlikely to continue so, nine of them came over, and in fear and trembling\nbegan to pack down to the lake. After they were at work for a few days\nsome of the Chilkoots came out and also started to work. Soon I had\nquite a number at work and was getting my stuff down quite fast. But\nthis good fortune was not to continue. Owing to the prevailing wet, cold\nweather on the mountains, and the difficulty of getting through the soft\nwet snow, the Indians soon began to quit work for a day or two at a\ntime, and to gamble with one another for the wages already earned. Many\nof them wanted to be paid in full, but this I positively refused,\nknowing that to do so was to have them all apply for their earnings and\nleave me until necessity compelled them to go to work again. I once for\nall made them distinctly understand that I would not pay any of them\nuntil the whole of the stuff was down. As many of them had already\nearned from twelve to fifteen dollars each, to lose which was a serious\nmatter to them, they reluctantly resumed work and kept at it until all\nwas delivered. This done, I paid them off, and set about getting my\noutfit across the lake, which I did with my own party and the two\nPeterborough canoes which I had with me.\n\n\"These two canoes travelled about 3,000 miles by rail and about 1,000\nmiles by steamship before being brought into service. They did\nconsiderable work on Chilkoot and Tagish Inlets, and were then packed\nover to the head of Lewes River (Lake Lindeman), from where they were\nused in making the survey of Lewes and Yukon Rivers. In this work they\nmade about 650 landings. They were then transported on sleighs from the\nboundary on the Yukon to navigable water on the Porcupine.\n\n\"In the spring of 1888 they descended the latter river, heavily loaded,\nand through much rough water, to the mouth of Bell's River, and up it to\nMcDougall's Pass. They were then carried over the pass to Poplar River\nand were used in going down the latter to Peel River, and thence up\nMackenzie River 1,400 miles; or, exclusive of railway and ship carriage,\nthey were carried about 170 miles and did about 2,500 miles of work for\nthe expedition, making in all about 1,700 landings in no easy manner and\ngoing through some very bad water. I left them at Fort Chipewyan in\nfairly good condition, and, with a little painting, they would go\nthrough the same ordeal again.\n\n\"After getting all my outfit over to the foot of Lake Lindeman I set some\nof the party to pack it to the head of Lake Bennet.\n\n\"I employed the rest of the party in looking for timber to build a boat\nto carry my outfit of provisions and implements down the river to the\nvicinity of the international boundary, a distance of about 700 miles.\nIt took several days to find a tree large enough to make plank for the\nboat I wanted, as the timber around the upper end of the lake is small\nand scrubby. My boat was finished on the evening of the 11th of July,\nand on the 12th I started a portion of the party to load it and go ahead\nwith it and the outfit to the canon. They had instructions to examine\nthe canon and, if necessary, to carry a part of the outfit past it--in\nany case, enough to support the party back to the coast should accident\nnecessitate such procedure. With the rest of the party I started to\ncarry on the survey, which may now be said to have fairly started ahead\non the lakes. This proved tedious work, on account of the stormy\nweather.\n\n\"In the summer months there is nearly always a wind blowing in from the\ncoast; it blows down the lakes and produces quite a heavy swell. This\nwould not prevent the canoes going with the decks on, but, as we had to\nland every mile or so, the rollers breaking on the generally flat beach\nproved very troublesome. On this account I found I could not average\nmore than ten miles per day on the lakes, little more than half of what\ncould be done on the river.\n\n\"The survey was completed to the canon on the 20th of July. There I\nfound the party with the large boat had arrived on the 18th, having\ncarried a part of the supplies past the canon, and were awaiting my\narrival to run through it with the rest in the boat. Before doing so,\nhowever, I made an examination of the canon. The rapids below it,\nparticularly the last rapid of the series (called the White Horse by the\nminers), I found would not be safe to run. I sent two men through the\ncanon in one of the canoes to await the arrival of the boat, and to be\nready in case of an accident to pick us up. Every man in the party was\nsupplied with a life-preserver, so that should a casualty occur we would\nall have floated. Those in the canoe got through all right; but they\nwould not have liked to repeat the trip. They said the canoe jumped\nabout a great deal more than they thought it would, and I had the same\nexperience when going through in the boat.\n\n\"The passage through is made in about three minutes, or at the rate of\nabout 12-1/2 miles an hour. If the boat is kept clear of the sides there\nis not much danger in high water; but in low water there is a rock in\nthe middle of the channel, near the upper end of the canon, that renders\nthe passage more difficult. I did not see this rock myself, but got my\ninformation from some miners I met in the interior, who described it as\nbeing about 150 yards down from the head and a little to the west of the\nmiddle of the channel. In low water it barely projects above the\nsurface. When I passed through there was no indication of it, either\nfrom the bank above or from the boat.\n\n\"The distance from the head to the foot of the canon is five-eighths of\na mile. There is a basin about midway in it about 150 yards in diameter.\nThis basin is circular in form, with steep sloping sides about 100 feet\nhigh. The lower part of the canon is much rougher to run through than\nthe upper part, the fall being apparently much greater. The sides are\ngenerally perpendicular, about 80 to 100 feet high, and consist of\nbasalt, in some places showing hexagonal columns.\n\n\"The White Horse Rapids are about three-eighths of a mile long. They are\nthe most dangerous rapids on the river, and are never run through in\nboats except by accident. They are confined by low basaltic banks,\nwhich, at the foot, suddenly close in and make the channel about 30\nyards wide. It is here the danger lies, as there is a sudden drop and\nthe water rashes through at a tremendous rate, leaping and seething like\na cataract. The miners have constructed a portage road on the west side,\nand put down rollways in some places on which to shove their boats over.\nThey have also made some windlasses with which to haul their boats up\nhill, notably one at the foot of the canon. This roadway and windlasses\nmust have cost them many hours of hard labor. Should it ever be\nnecessary, a tramway could be built past the canon on the east side with\nno great difficulty. With the exception of the Five Finger Rapids these\nappear to be the only serious rapids on the whole length of the river.\n\n\"Five Finger Rapids are formed by several islands standing in the\nchannel and backing up the water so much as to raise it about a foot,\ncausing a swell below for a few yards. The islands are composed of\nconglomerate rock, similar to the cliffs on each side of the river,\nwhence one would infer that there has been a fall here in past ages. For\nabout two miles below the rapids there is a pretty swift current, but\nnot enough to prevent the ascent of a steamboat of moderate power, and\nthe rapids themselves I do not think would present any serious obstacle\nto the ascent of a good boat. In very high water warping might be\nrequired. Six miles below these rapids are what are known as 'Rink\nRapids,' This is simply a barrier of rocks, which extends from the\nwesterly side of the river about half way across. Over this barrier\nthere is a ripple which would offer no great obstacle to the descent of\na good canoe. On the easterly sides there is no ripple, and the current\nis smooth and the water apparently deep. I tried with a 6 foot paddle,\nbut could not reach the bottom.\n\n\"On the 11th of August I met a party of miners coming out who had passed\nStewart River a few days before. They saw no sign of Dr. Dawson having\nbeen there. This was welcome news for me, as I expected he would have\nreached that point long before I arrived, on account of the many delays\nI had met with on the coast range. These miners also gave me the\npleasant news that the story told at the coast about the fight with the\nIndians at Stewart River was false, and stated substantially what I have\nalready repeated concerning it. The same evening I met more miners on\ntheir way out, and the next day met three boats, each containing four\nmen. In the crew of one of them was a son of Capt. Moore, from whom the\ncaptain got such information as induced him to turn back and accompany\nthem out.\n\n\"Next day, the 13th, I got to the mouth of the Pelly, and found that Dr.\nDawson had arrived there on the 11th. The doctor also had experienced\nmany delays, and had heard the same story of the Indian uprising in the\ninterior. I was pleased to find that he was in no immediate want of\nprovisions, the fear of which had caused me a great deal of uneasiness\non the way down the river, as it was arranged between us in Victoria\nthat I was to take with me provisions for his party to do them until\ntheir return to the coast. The doctor was so much behind the time\narranged to meet me that he determined to start for the coast at once. I\ntherefore set about making a short report and plan of my survey to this\npoint; and, as I was not likely to get another opportunity of writing at\nsuch length for a year, I applied myself to a correspondence designed to\nsatisfy my friends and acquaintances for the ensuing twelve months. This\nnecessitated three days' hard work.\n\n\"On the morning of the 17th the doctor left for the outside world,\nleaving me with a feeling of loneliness that only those who have\nexperienced it can realize. I remained at the mouth of the Pelly during\nthe next day taking magnetic and astronomical observations, and making\nsome measurements of the river. On the 19th I resumed the survey and\nreached White River on the 25th. Here I spent most of a day trying to\nascend this river, but found it impracticable, on account of the swift\ncurrent and shallow and very muddy water. The water is so muddy that it\nis impossible to see through one-eighth of an inch of it. The current is\nvery strong, probably eight miles or more per hour, and the numerous\nbars in the bed are constantly changing place. After trying for several\nhours, the base men succeeded in doing about half a mile only, and I\ncame to the conclusion that it was useless to try to get up this stream\nto the boundary with canoes. Had it proved feasible I had intended\nmaking a survey of this stream to the boundary, to discover more\nespecially the facilities it offered for the transport of supplies in\nthe event of a survey of the International Boundary being undertaken.\n\n\"I reached Stewart River on the 26th. Here I remained a day taking\nmagnetic observations, and getting information from a miner, named\nMcDonald, about the country up that river. McDonald had spent the summer\nup the river prospecting and exploring. His information will be given in\ndetail further on.\n\n\"Fort Reliance was reached on the 1st of September, and Forty Mile River\n(Cone-Hill River of Schwatka) on the 7th. In the interval between Fort\nReliance and Forty Mile River there were several days lost by rain.\n\n\"At Forty Mile River I made some arrangements with the traders there\n(Messrs. Harper & McQuestion) about supplies during the winter, and\nabout getting Indians to assist me in crossing from the Yukon to the\nhead of the Porcupine, or perhaps on to the Peel River. I then made a\nsurvey of the Forty Mile River up to the canon. I found the canon would\nbe difficult of ascent, and dangerous to descend, and therefore,\nconcluded to defer further operations until the winter, and until after\nI had determined the longitude of my winter post near the boundary, when\nI would be in a much better position to locate the intersection of the\nInternational Boundary with this river, a point important to determine\non account of the number and richness of the mining claims on the river.\n\n\"I left Forty Mile River for the boundary line between Alaska and the\nNorthwest Territories on the 12th September, and finished the survey to\nthat point on the 14th. I then spent two days in examining the valley of\nthe river in the vicinity of the boundary to get the most extensive view\nof the horizon possible, and to find a tree large enough to serve for a\ntransit stand.\n\n\"Before leaving Toronto I got Mr. Foster to make large brass plates with\nV's on them, which could be screwed firmly to a stump, and thus be made\nto serve as a transit stand. I required a stump at least 22 inches in\ndiameter to make a base large enough for the plates when properly placed\nfor the transit. In a search which covered about four miles of the river\nbank, on both sides, I found only one tree as large as 18 inches. I\nmention this fact to give an idea of the size of the trees along the\nriver in this vicinity. I had this stump enlarged by firmly fixing\npieces on the sides so as to bring it up to the requisite size. This\ndone, I built around the stump a small transit house of the ordinary\nform and then mounted and adjusted my transit. Meanwhile, most of the\nparty were busy preparing our winter quarters and building a magnetic\nobservatory. As I had been led to expect extremely low temperatures\nduring the winter, I adopted precautionary measures, so as to be as\ncomfortable as circumstances would permit during our stay there.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE YUKON, ITS AFFLUENT STREAMS, AND THE ADJACENT\nCOUNTRY.\n\n\"I will now give, from my own observation and from information received,\na more detailed description of the Lewes River, its affluent streams,\nand the resources of the adjacent country.\n\n\"For the purpose of navigation a description of the Lewes River begins\nat the head of Lake Bennet. Above that point, and between it and Lake\nLindeman, there is only about three-quarters of a mile of river, which\nis not more than fifty or sixty yards wide, and two or three feet deep,\nand is so swift and rough that navigation is out of the question.\n\n\"Lake Lindeman is about five miles long and half a mile wide. It is deep\nenough for all ordinary purposes. Lake Bennet[3] is twenty-six and a\nquarter miles long, for the upper fourteen of which it is about half a\nmile wide. About midway in its length an arm comes in from the west,\nwhich Schwatka appears to have mistaken for a river, and named Wheaton\nRiver. This arm is wider than the other arm down to that point, and is\nreported by Indians to be longer and heading in a glacier which lies in\nthe pass at the head of Chilkoot Inlet. This arm is, as far as seen,\nsurrounded by high mountains, apparently much higher than those on the\narm we travelled down. Below the junction of the two arms the lake is\nabout one and a half miles wide, with deep water. Above the forks the\nwater of the east branch is muddy. This is caused by the streams from\nthe numerous glaciers on the head of the tributaries of Lake Lindeman.\n\n[Footnote 3: A small saw-mill has been erected at the head of Lake\nBennet; lumber for boat building sells at $100 per M. Boats 25 feet long\nand 5 feet beam are $60 each. Last year the ice broke up in the lake on\nthe 12th June, but this season is earlier and the boats are expected to\ngo down the lake about the 1st of June.]\n\n\"A stream which flows into Lake Bennet at the south-west corner is also\nvery dirty, and has shoaled quite a large portion of the lake at its\nmouth. The beach at the lower end of this lake is comparatively flat and\nthe water shoal. A deep, wide valley extends northwards from the north\nend of the lake, apparently reaching to the canon, or a short distance\nabove it. This may have been originally a course for the waters of the\nriver. The bottom of the valley is wide and sandy, and covered with\nscrubby timber, principally poplar and pitch-pine. The waters of the\nlake empty at the extreme north-east angle through a channel not more\nthan one hundred yards wide, which soon expands into what Schwatka\ncalled Lake Nares.[4] Through this narrow channel there is quite a\ncurrent, and more than 7 feet of water, as a 6 foot paddle and a foot of\narm added to its length did not reach the bottom.\n\n[Footnote 4: The connecting waters between Lake Bennet and Tagish Lake\nconstitute what is now called Caribou Crossing.]\n\n\"The hills at the upper end of Lake Lindeman rise abruptly from the\nwater's edge. At the lower end they are neither so steep nor so high.\n\n\"Lake Nares is only two and a half miles long, and its greatest width is\nabout a mile; it is not deep, but is navigable for boats drawing 5 or 6\nfeet of water; it is separated from Lake Bennet by a shallow sandy point\nof not more than 200 yards in length.\n\n\"No streams of any consequence empty into either of these lakes. A small\nriver flows into Lake Bennet on the west side, a short distance north of\nthe fork, and another at the extreme north-west angle, but neither of\nthem is of any consequence in a navigable sense.\n\n\"Lake Nares flows through a narrow curved channel into Bove Lake\n(Schwatka). This channel is not more than 600 or 700 yards long, and the\nwater in it appears to be sufficiently deep for boats that could\nnavigate the lake. The land between the lakes along this channel is low,\nswampy, and covered with willows, and, at the stage in which I saw it,\ndid not rise more than 3 feet above the water. The hills on the\nsouth-west side <DW72> up easily, and are not high; on the north side\nthe deep valley already referred to borders it; and on the east side the\nmountains rise abruptly from the lake shore.\n\n\"Bove Lake (called Tagish Lake by Dr. Dawson) is about a mile wide for\nthe first two miles of its length, when it is joined by what the miners\nhave called the Windy Arm. One of the Tagish Indians informed me they\ncalled it Takone Lake. Here the lake expands to a width of about two\nmiles for a distance of some three miles, when it suddenly narrows to\nabout half a mile for a distance of a little over a mile, after which it\nwidens again to about a mile and a half or more.\n\n\"Ten miles from the head of the lake it is joined by the Taku Arm from\nthe south. This arm must be of considerable length, as it can be seen\nfor a long distance, and its valley can be traced through the mountains\nmuch farther than the lake itself can be seen. It is apparently over a\nmile wide at its mouth or junction.\n\n\"Dr. Dawson includes Bove Lake and these two arms under the common name\nof Tagish Lake. This is much more simple and comprehensive than the\nvarious names given them by travellers. These waters collectively are\nthe fishing and hunting grounds of the Tagish Indians, and as they are\nreally one body of water, there is no reason why they should not be all\nincluded under one name.\n\n\"From the junction with the Taku Arm to the north end of the lake the\ndistance is about six miles, the greater part being over two miles wide.\nThe west side is very flat and shallow, so much so that it was\nimpossible in many places to get our canoes to the shore, and quite a\ndistance out in the lake there was not more than 5 feet of water. The\nmembers of my party who were in charge of the large boat and outfit,\nwent down the east side of the lake and reported the depth about the\nsame as I found on the west side, with many large rocks. They passed\nthrough it in the night in a rainstorm, and were much alarmed for the\nsafety of the boat and provisions. It would appear that this part of the\nlake requires some improvement to make it in keeping with the rest of\nthe water system with which it is connected.\n\n\"Where the river debouches from it, it is about 150 yards wide, and for\na short distance not more than 5 or 6 feet deep. The depth is, however,\nsoon increased to 10 feet or more, and so continues down to what\nSchwatka calls Marsh Lake. The miners call it Mud Lake, but on this name\nthey do not appear to be agreed, many of them calling the lower part of\nTagish or Bove Lake \"Mud Lake,\" on account of its shallowness and flat\nmuddy shores, as seen along the west side, the side nearly always\ntravelled, as it is more sheltered from the prevailing southerly winds.\nThe term \"Mud Lake\" is, however, not applicable to this lake, as only a\ncomparatively small part of it is shallow or muddy; and it is nearly as\ninapplicable to Marsh Lake, as the latter is not markedly muddy along\nthe west side, and from the appearance of the east shore one would not\njudge it to be so, as the banks appear to be high and gravelly.\n\n\"Marsh Lake is a little over nineteen miles long, and averages about two\nmiles in width. I tried to determine the width of it as I went along\nwith my survey, by taking azimuths of points on the eastern shore from\ndifferent stations of the survey; but in only one case did I succeed, as\nthere were no prominent marks on that shore which could be identified\nfrom more than one place. The piece of river connecting Tagish and Marsh\nLakes is about five miles long, and averages 150 to 200 yards in width,\nand, as already mentioned, is deep, except for a short distance at the\nhead. On it are situated the only Indian houses to be found in the\ninterior with any pretension to skill in construction. They show much\nmore labor and imitativeness than one knowing anything about the Indian\nin his native state would expect. The plan is evidently taken from the\nIndian houses on the coast, which appear to me to be a poor copy of the\nhouses which the Hudson's Bay Company's servants build around their\ntrading posts. These houses do not appear to have been used for some\ntime past, and are almost in ruins. The Tagish Indians are now generally\non the coast, as they find it much easier to live there than in their\nown country. As a matter of fact, what they make in their own country is\ntaken from them by the Coast Indians, so that there is little inducement\nfor them to remain.\n\n\"The Lewes River, where it leaves Marsh Lake, is about 200 yards wide,\nand averages this width as far as the canon. I did not try to find\nbottom anywhere as I went along, except where I had reason to think it\nshallow, and there I always tried with my paddle. I did not anywhere\nfind bottom with this, which shows that there is no part of this stretch\nof the river with less than six feet of water at medium height, at which\nstage it appeared to me the river was at that time.\n\n\"From the head of Lake Bennet to the canon the corrected distance is\nninety-five miles, all of which is navigable for boats drawing 5 feet or\nmore. Add to this the westerly arm of Lake Bennet, and the Takone or\nWindy Arm of Tagish Lake, each about fifteen miles in length, and the\nTaku Arm of the latter lake, of unknown length, but probably not less\nthan thirty miles, and we have a stretch of water of upwards of one\nhundred miles in length, all easily navigable; and, as has been pointed\nout, easily connected with Taiya Inlet through the White Pass.\n\n\"No streams of any importance enter any of these lakes so far as I know.\nA river, called by Schwatka \"McClintock River,\" enters Marsh Lake at the\nlower end from the east. It occupies a large valley, as seen from the\nwesterly side of the lake, but the stream is apparently unimportant.\nAnother small stream, apparently only a creek, enters the south-east\nangle of the lake. It is not probable that any stream coming from the\neast side of the lake is of importance, as the strip of country between\nthe Lewes and Teslintoo is not more than thirty or forty miles in\nwidth at this point.\n\n\"The Taku Arm of Tagish Lake, is, so far, with the exception of reports\nfrom Indians, unknown; but it is equally improbable that any river of\nimportance enters it, as it is so near the source of the waters flowing\nnorthwards. However, this is a question that can only be decided by a\nproper exploration. The canon I have already described and will only add\nthat it is five-eighths of a mile long, about 100 feet wide, with\nperpendicular banks of basaltic rock from 60 to 100 feet high.\n\n\"Below the canon proper there is a stretch of rapids for about a mile;\nthen about half a mile of smooth water, following which are the White\nHorse Rapids, which are three-eighths of a mile long, and unsafe for\nboats.\n\n\"The total fall in the canon and succeeding rapids was measured and\nfound to be 32 feet. Were it ever necessary to make this part of the\nriver navigable it will be no easy task to overcome the obstacles at\nthis point; but a tram or railway could, with very little difficulty, be\nconstructed along the east side of the river past the canon.\n\n\"For some distance below the White Horse Rapids the current is swift and\nthe river wide, with many gravel bars. The reach between these rapids\nand Lake Labarge, a distance of twenty-seven and a half miles, is all\nsmooth water, with a strong current. The average width is about 150\nyards. There is no impediment to navigation other than the swift\ncurrent, and this is no stronger than on the lower part of the river,\nwhich is already navigated; nor is it worse than on the Saskatchewan and\nRed Rivers in the more eastern part of our territory.\n\n\"About midway in this stretch the Tahkeena River[5] joins the Lewes.\nThis river is, apparently, about half the size of the latter. Its waters\nare muddy, indicating the passage through a clayey district. I got some\nindefinite information about this river, from an Indian who happened to\nmeet me just below its mouth, but I could not readily make him\nunderstand me, and his replies were a compound of Chinook, Tagish, and\nsigns, and therefore largely unintelligible. From what I could\nunderstand with any certainty, the river was easy to descend, there\nbeing no bad rapids, and it came out of a lake much larger than any I\nhad yet passed.\n\n[Footnote 5: The Tahkeena was formerly much used by the Chilkat Indians\nas a means of reaching the interior, but never by the miners owing to\nthe distance from the sea to its head.]\n\n\"Here I may remark that I have invariably found it difficult to get\nreliable or definite information from Indians. The reasons for this are\nmany. Most of the Indians it has been my lot to meet are expecting to\nmake something, and consequently are very chary about doing or saying\nanything unless they think they will be well rewarded for it. They are\nnaturally very suspicions of strangers, and it takes some time, and some\nknowledge of their language, to overcome this suspicion and gain their\nconfidence. If you begin at once to ask questions about their country,\nwithout previously having them understand that you have no unfriendly\nmotive in doing so, they become alarmed, and although you may not meet\nwith a positive refusal to answer questions, you make very little\nprogress in getting desired information. On the other hand I have met\ncases where, either through fear or hope of reward, they were only too\nanxious to impart all they knew or had heard, and even more if they\nthought it would please their hearer. I need hardly say that such\ninformation is often not at all in accordance with the facts.\n\n\"I have several times found that some act of mine when in their\npresence has aroused either their fear, superstition or cupidity. As an\ninstance: on the Bell River I met some Indians coming down stream as I\nwas going up. We were ashore at the time, and invited them to join us.\nThey started to come in, but very slowly, and all the time kept a\nwatchful eye on us. I noticed that my double-barrelled shot gun was\nlying at my feet, loaded, and picked it up to unload it, as I knew they\nwould be handling it after landing. This alarmed them so much that it\nwas some time before they came in, and I don't think they would have\ncome ashore at all had they not heard that a party of white men of whom\nwe answered the description, were coming through that way (they had\nlearned this from the Hudson's Bay Company's officers), and concluded we\nwere the party described to them. After drinking some of our tea, and\ngetting a supply for themselves, they became quite friendly and\ncommunicative.\n\n\"I cite these as instances of what one meets with who comes in contact\nwith Indians, and of how trifles affect them. A sojourn of two or three\ndays with them and the assistance of a common friend would do much to\ndisabuse them of such ideas, but when you have no such aids you must not\nexpect to make much progress.\n\n\"Lake Labarge is thirty-one miles long. In the upper thirteen it varies\nfrom three to four miles in width; it then narrows to about two miles\nfor a distance of seven miles, when it begins to widen again, and\ngradually expands to about, two and a-half or three miles, the lower six\nmiles of it maintaining the latter width. The survey was carried along\nthe western shore, and while so engaged I determined the width of the\nupper wide part by triangulation at two points, the width of the narrow\nmiddle part at three points, and the width of the lower part, at three\npoints. Dr. Dawson on his way out made a track survey of the eastern\nshore. The western shore is irregular in many places, being indented by\nlarge bays, especially at the upper and lower ends. These bays are, as a\nrule, shallow, more especially those at the lower end.\n\n\"Just above where the lake narrows in the middle there is a large\nisland. It is three and a-half miles long and about half a mile in\nwidth. It is shown on Schwatka's map as a peninsula, and called by him\nRichtofen Rocks. How he came to think it a peninsula I cannot\nunderstand, as it is well out in the lake; the nearest point of it to\nthe western shore is upwards of half a mile distant, and the extreme\nwidth of the lake here is not more than five miles, which includes the\ndepth of the deepest bays on the western side. It is therefore difficult\nto understand that he did not see it as an island. The upper half of\nthis island is gravelly, and does not rise very high above the lake. The\nlower end is rocky and high, the rock being of a bright red color.\n\n\"At the lower end of the lake there is a large valley extending\nnorthwards, which has evidently at one time been the outlet of the lake.\nDr. Dawson has noted it and its peculiarities. His remarks regarding it\nwill be found on pages 156-160 of his report entitled 'Yukon District\nand Northern portion of British Columbia,' published in 1889.\n\n\"The width of the Lewes River as it leaves the lake is the same as at\nits entrance, about 200 yards. Its waters when I was there were murky.\nThis is caused by the action of the waves on the shore along the lower\nend of the lake. The water at the upper end and at the middle of the\nlake is quite clear, so much so that the bottom can be distinctly seen\nat a depth of 6 or 7 feet. The wind blows almost constantly down this\nlake, and in a high wind it gets very rough. The miners complain of much\ndetention owing to this cause, and certainly I cannot complain of a lack\nof wind while I was on the lake. This lake was named after one Mike\nLabarge, who was engaged by the Western Union Telegraph Company,\nexploring the river and adjacent country for the purpose of connecting\nEurope and America by telegraph through British Columbia, and Alaska,\nand across Behring Strait to Asia, and thence to Europe. This\nexploration took place in 1867, but it does not appear that Labarge\nthen, nor for some years after, saw the lake called by his name. The\nsuccessful laying of the Atlantic cable in 1866 put a stop to this\nproject, and the exploring parties sent out were recalled as soon as\nword could be got to them. It seems that Labarge had got up as far as\nthe Pelly before he received his recall; he had heard something of a\nlarge lake some distance further up the river, and afterwards spoke of\nit to some traders and miners who called it after him.\n\n\"After leaving Lake Labarge the river, for a distance of about five\nmiles, preserves a generally uniform width and an easy current of about\nfour miles per hour. It then makes a short turn round a low gravel\npoint, and flows in exactly the opposite of its general course for a\nmile when it again turns sharply to its general direction. The current\naround this curve and for some distance below it--in all four or five\nmiles--is very swift. I timed it in several places and found it from six\nto seven miles an hour. It then moderates to four or five, and continues\nso until the Teslintoo River is reached, thirty-one and seven tenths\nmiles from Lake Labarge. The average width of this part of the river is\nabout 150 yards, and the depth is sufficient to afford passage for boats\ndrawing at least 5 feet. It is, as a rule, crooked, and consequently a\nlittle difficult to navigate.\n\n\"The Teslintoo[6] was so called by Dr. Dawson--this, according to\ninformation obtained by him, being the Indian name. It is called by the\nminers 'Hootalinkwa' or Hotalinqua, and was called by Schwatka, who\nappears to have bestowed no other attention to it, the Newberry,\nalthough it is apparently much larger than the Lewes. This was so\napparent that in my interim reports I stated it as a fact. Owing to\ncircumstances already narrated, I had not time while at the mouth to\nmake any measurement to determine the relative size of the rivers; but\non his way out Dr. Dawson made these measurements, and his report,\nbefore referred to, gives the following values of the cross sections of\neach stream: Lewes, 3,015 feet; Teslintoo, 3,809 feet. In the same\nconnection he states that the Lewes appeared to be about 1 foot above\nits lowest summer level, while the Teslintoo appeared to be at its\nlowest level. Assuming this to be so, and taking his widths as our data,\nit would reduce his cross section of the Lewes to 2,595 feet. Owing,\nhowever, to the current in the Lewes, as determined by Dr. Dawson, being\njust double that of the Teslintoo, the figures being 5.68 and 2.88 miles\nper hour, respectively, the discharge of the Lewes, taking these figures\nagain in 18,644 feet, and of the Teslintoo 11,436 feet. To reduce the\nLewes to its lowest level the doctor says would make its discharge\n15,600 feet.\n\n[Footnote 6: The limited amount of prospecting that has been done on\nthis river is said to be very satisfactory, fine gold having been found\nin all parts of the river. The lack of supplies is the great drawback to\nits development, and this will not be overcome to any extent until by\nsome means heavy freight can be brought over the coast range to the head\nof the river. Indeed, owing to the difficulties attending access and\ntransportation, the great drawback to the entire Yukon district at\npresent is the want of heavy mining machinery and the scarcity of\nsupplies. The government being aware of the requirements and\npossibilities of the country, has undertaken the task of making\npreliminary surveys for trails and railroads, and no doubt in the near\nfuture the avenue for better and quicker transportation facilities will\nbe opened up.]\n\n\"The water of the Teslintoo is of a dark brown color, similar in\nappearance to the Ottawa River water, and a little turbid.\nNotwithstanding the difference of volume of discharge, the Teslintoo\nchanges completely the character of the river below the junction, and a\nperson coming up the river would, at the forks, unhesitatingly pronounce\nthe Teslintoo the main stream. The water of the Lewes is blue in color,\nand at the time I speak of was somewhat dirty--not enough so, however,\nto prevent one seeing to a depth of two or three feet.\n\n\"At the junction of the Lewes and Teslintoo I met two or three families\nof the Indians who hunt in the vicinity. One of them could speak a\nlittle Chinook. As I had two men with me who understood his jargon\nperfectly, with their assistance I tried to get some information from\nhim about the river. He told me the river was easy to ascend, and\npresented the same appearance eight days journey up as at the mouth;\nthen a lake was reached, which took one day to cross; the river was then\nfollowed again for half a day to another lake, which took two days to\ntraverse: into this lake emptied a stream which they used as a highway\nto the coast, passing by way of the Taku River. He said it took four\ndays when they had loads to carry, from the head of canoe navigation on\nthe Teslintoo to salt water on the Taku Inlet; but when they come light\nthey take only one to two days. He spoke also of a stream entering the\nlarge lake from the east which came from a distance; but they did not\nseem to know much about it, and considered it outside their country. If\ntheir time intervals are approximately accurate, they mean that there\nare about 200 miles of good river to the first lake, as they ought\neasily to make 25 miles a day on the river as I saw it. The lake takes\none day to traverse, and is at least 25 miles long, followed by say 12\nof river, which brings us to the large lake, which takes two days to\ncross, say 50 or 60 more--in all about 292 miles--say 300 to the head of\ncanoe navigation; while the distance from the head of Lake Bennet to the\njunction is only 188. Assuming the course of the Teslintoo to be nearly\nsouth (it is a little to the east of it), and throwing out every fourth\nmile for bends, the remainder gives us in arc three degrees and a\nquarter of latitude, which, deducted from 61 deg. 40', the latitude of the\njunction, gives us 58 deg. 25', or nearly the latitude of Juneau.\n\n\"To make sure that I understood the Indian aright, and that he knew what\nhe was speaking about, I got him to sketch the river and lake, as he\ndescribed them, on the sand, and repeat the same several times.\n\n\"I afterwards met Mr. T. Boswell, his brother, and another miner, who\nhad spent most of the summer on the river prospecting, and from them I\ngathered the following:\n\n\"The distance to the first, and only lake which they saw, they put at\n175 miles, and the lake itself they call at least 150 miles long, as it\ntook them four days to row in a light boat from end to end. The portage\nto the sea they did not appear to know anything about, but describe a\nlarge bay on the east side of the lake, into which a river of\nconsiderable size entered. This river occupies a wide valley, surrounded\nby high mountains. They thought this river must head near Liard River.\nThis account differs materially from that given by the Indian, and to\nput them on their guard, I told them what he had told me, but they still\npersisted in their story, which I find differs a good deal from the\naccount they gave Dr. Dawson, as incorporated in his report.\n\n\"Many years ago, sixteen I think, a man named Monroe prospected up the\nTaku and learned from the Indians something of a large lake not far from\nthat river. He crossed over and found it, and spent some time in\nprospecting, and then recrossed to the sea. This man had been at Forty\nMile River, and I heard from the miners there his account of the\nappearance of the lake, which amounted generally to this: The Boswells\ndid not know anything about it.\" It was unfortunate the Boswells did not\nremain at Forty Mile all winter, as by a comparison of recollections\nthey might have arrived at some correct conclusion.\n\n\"Conflicting as these descriptions are, one thing is certain: this\nbranch, if it has not the greater discharge, is the longer and more\nimportant of the two, and offers easy and uninterrupted navigation for\nmore than double the distance which the Lewes does, the canon being only\nninety miles above the mouth of the Teslintoo. The Boswells reported it\nas containing much more useful timber than the Lewes, which indeed one\nwould infer from its lower altitude.\n\n\"Assuming this as the main river, and adding its length to the\nLewes-Yukon below the junction, gives upward of 2,200 miles of river,\nfully two-thirds of which runs through a very mountainous country,\nwithout an impediment to navigation.\n\n\"Some indefinite information, was obtained as to the position of this\nriver in the neighborhood of Marsh Lake tending to show that the\ndistance between them was only about thirty or forty miles.\n\n\"Between the Teslintoo and the Big Salmon, so called by the miners, or\nD'Abbadie by Schwatka, the distance is thirty-three and a-half miles, in\nwhich the Lewes preserves a generally uniform width and current. For a\nfew miles below the Teslintoo it is a little over the ordinary width,\nbut then contracts to about two hundred yards which it maintains with\nlittle variation. The current is generally from four to five miles per\nhour.\n\n\"The Big Salmon I found to be about one hundred yards wide near the\nmouth, the depth not more than four or five feet, and the current, so\nfar as could be seen, sluggish. None of the miners I met could give me\nany information concerning this stream; but Dr. Dawson was more\nfortunate, and met a man who had spent most of the summer of 1887\nprospecting on it. His opinion was that it might be navigable for small\nstern-wheel steamers for many miles. The valley, as seen from the mouth,\nis wide, and gives one the impression of being occupied by a much more\nimportant stream. Looking up it, in the distance could be seen many high\npeaks covered with snow. As the date was August it is likely they are\nalways so covered, which would make their probable altitude above the\nriver 5,000 feet or more.\n\n\"Dr. Dawson, in his report, incorporates fully the notes obtained from\nthe miners. I will trespass so far on these as to say that they called\nthe distance to a small lake near the head of the river, 190 miles from\nthe mouth. This lake was estimated to be four miles in length; another\nlake about 12 miles above this was estimated to be twenty-four miles\nlong, and its upper end distant only about eight miles from the\nTeslintoo. These distances, if correct, make this river much more\nimportant than a casual glance at it would indicate; this, however, will\nbe more fully spoken of under its proper head.\n\n\"Just below the Big Salmon the Lewes takes a bend of nearly a right\nangle. Its course from the junction with the Tahkeena to this point is\ngenerally a little east of north; at this point it turns to nearly west\nfor some distance. Its course between here and its confluence with the\nPelly is north-west, and, I may add, it preserves this general direction\ndown to the confluence with the Porcupine. The river also changes in\nanother respect; it is generally wider, and often expands into what\nmight be called lakes, in which are islands. Some of the lakes are of\nconsiderable length, and well timbered.\n\n\"To determine which channel is the main one, that is, which carries the\ngreatest volume of water, or is best available for the purposes of\nnavigation, among these islands, would require more time than I could\ndevote to it on my way down; consequently I cannot say more than that I\nhave no reason to doubt that a channel giving six feet or more of water\ncould easily be found. Whenever, in the main channel, I had reason to\nthink the water shallow, I tried it with my paddle, but always failed to\nfind bottom, which gives upward of six feet. Of course I often found\nless than this, but not in what I considered the main channel.\n\n\"Thirty-six and a quarter miles below the Big Salmon, the Little\nSalmon--the Daly of Schwatka--enters the Lewes. This river is about 60\nyards wide at the mouth, and not more than two or three feet in depth.\nThe water is clear and of a brownish hue; there is not much current at\nthe mouth, nor as far as can be seen up the stream. The valley which,\nfrom the mouth, does not appear extensive, bears north-east for some\ndistance, when it appears to turn more to the east. Six or seven miles\nup, and apparently on the north side, some high cliffs of red rock,\napparently granite, can be seen. It is said that some miners have\nprospected this stream, but I could learn nothing definite about it.\n\n\"Lewes River makes a turn here to the south-west, and runs in that\ndirection six miles, when it again turns to the north-west for seven\nmiles, and then makes a short, sharp turn to the south and west around a\nlow sandy point, which will, at some day in the near future, be cut\nthrough by the current, which will shorten the river three or four\nmiles.\n\n\"Eight miles below Little Salmon River, a large rock called the Eagle's\nNest, stands up in a gravel <DW72> on the easterly bank of the river. It\nrises about five hundred feet above the river, and is composed of a\nlight gray stone. What the character of this rock is I could not\nobserve, as I saw it only from the river, which is about a quarter of a\nmile distant. On the westerly side of the river there are two or three\nother isolated masses of apparently the same kind of rock. One of them\nmight be appropriately called a mountain; it is south-west from the\nEagle's Nest and distant from it about three miles.\n\n\"Thirty-two miles below Eagle's Nest Rock, Nordenskiold River enters\nfrom the west. It is an unimportant stream, being not more than one\nhundred and twenty feet wide at the mouth, and only a few inches deep.\nThe valley, as far as can be seen, is not extensive, and, being very\ncrooked, it is hard to tell what its general direction is.\n\n\"The Lewes, between the Little Salmon and the Nordenskiold, maintains a\nwidth of from two to three hundred yards, with an occasional expansion\nwhere there are islands. It is serpentine in its course most of the way,\nand where the Nordenskiold joins it is very crooked, running several\ntimes under a hill, named by Schwatka Tantalus Butte, and in other\nplaces leaving it, for a distance of eight miles. The distance across\nfrom point to point is only half a mile.\n\n\"Below this to Five Finger Rapids, so-called from the fact that five\nlarge masses of rock stand in mid-channel, the river assumes its\nordinary straightness and width, with a current from four to five miles\nper hour. I have already described Five Finger Rapids; I do not think\nthey will prove anything more than a slight obstruction in the\nnavigation of the river. A boat of ordinary power would probably have to\nhelp herself up with windlass and line in high water.\n\n\"Below the rapids, for about two miles, the current is strong--probably\nsix miles per hour--but the water seems to be deep enough for any boat\nthat is likely to navigate it.\n\n\"Six miles below this, as already noticed, Rink Rapids are situated.\nThey are of no great importance, the westerly half of the stream only\nbeing obstructed. The easterly half is not in any way affected, the\ncurrent being smooth and the water deep.\n\n\"Below Five Finger Rapids about two miles a small stream enters from\nthe east. It is called by Dr. Dawson Tatshun River. It is not more than\n30 or 40 feet wide at the mouth, and contains only a little clear,\nbrownish water. Here I met the only Indians seen on the river between\nTeslintoo and Stewart Rivers. They were engaged in catching salmon at\nthe mouth of the Tatshun, and were the poorest and most unintelligent\nIndians it has ever been my lot to meet. It is needless to say that none\nof our party understood anything they said, as they could not speak a\nword of any language but their own. I tried by signs to get some\ninformation from them about the stream they were fishing in, but failed.\nI tried in the same way to learn if there were any more Indians in the\nvicinity, but again utterly failed. I then tried by signs to find out\nhow many days it took to go down to Pelly River, but although I have\nnever known these signs to fail in eliciting information in any other\npart of the territory, they did not understand. They appeared to be\nalarmed by our presence; and, as we had not yet been assured as to the\nrumor concerning the trouble between the miners and Indians, we felt a\nlittle apprehensive, but being able to learn nothing from them we had to\nput our fears aside and proceed blindly.\n\n\"Between Five Finger Rapids and Pelly River, fifty-eight and a\nhalf-miles, no streams of any importance enter the Lewes; in fact, with\nthe exception of the Tatshun, it may be said that none at all enter.\n\n\"About a mile below Rink Rapids the river spreads out into a lake-like\nexpanse, with many islands; this continues for about three miles, when\nit contracts to something like the usual width; but bars and small\nislands are very numerous all the way to Pelly River. About five miles\nabove Pelly River there is another lake-like expanse filled with\nislands. The river here for three or four miles is nearly a mile wide,\nand so numerous and close are the islands that it is impossible to tell\nwhen floating among them where the shores of the river are. The current,\ntoo, is swift, leading one to suppose the water shallow; but I think\neven here a channel deep enough for such boats as will navigate this\npart of the river can be found. Schwatka named this group of islands\n\"Ingersoll Islands.\"\n\n\"At the mouth of the Pelly the Lewes is about half a mile wide, and here\ntoo there are many islands, but not in groups as at Ingersoll Islands.\n\n\"About a mile below the Pelly, just at the ruins of Fort Selkirk, the\nYukon was found to be 565 yards wide; about two-thirds being ten feet\ndeep, with a current of about four and three-quarter miles per hour; the\nremaining third was more than half taken up by a bar, and the current\nbetween it and the south shore was very slack.\n\n\"Pelly River at its mouth is about two hundred yards wide, and continues\nthis width as far up as could be seen. Dr. Dawson made a survey and\nexamination of this river, which will be found in his report already\ncited, \"Yukon District and Northern British Columbia.\"\n\n\"Just here for a short distance the course of the Yukon is nearly west,\nand on the south side, about a mile below the mouth of the Lewes, stands\nall that remains of the only trading post ever built by white men in the\ndistrict. This post was established by Robert Campbell, for the Hudson's\nBay Company in the summer of 1848. It was first built on the point of\nland between the two rivers, but this location proving untenable on\naccount of flooding by ice jams in the spring, it was, in the season of\n1852, moved across the river to where the ruins now stand. It appears\nthat the houses composing the post were not finished when the Indians\nfrom the coast on Chilkat and Chilkoot Inlets came down the river to put\na stop to the competitive trade which Mr. Campbell had inaugurated, and\nwhich they found to seriously interfere with their profits. Their method\nof trade appears to have been then pretty much as it is now--very\nonesided. What they found it convenient to take by force they took, and\nwhat it was convenient to pay for at their own price they paid for.\n\n\"Rumors had reached the post that the coast Indians contemplated such a\nraid, and in consequence the native Indians in the vicinity remained\nabout nearly all summer. Unfortunately, they went away for a short time,\nand during their absence the coast Indians arrived in the early morning,\nand surprised Mr. Campbell in bed. They were not at all rough with him,\nbut gave him the privilege of leaving the place within twenty-four\nhours, after which he was informed that he was liable to be shot if seen\nby them in the locality. They then pillaged the place and set fire to\nit, leaving nothing but the remains of the two chimneys which are still\nstanding. This raid and capture took place on the 1st August, 1852.\n\n\"Mr. Campbell dropped down the river, and met some of the local Indians\nwho returned with him, but the robbers had made their escape. I have\nheard that the local Indians wished to pursue and overtake them, but to\nthis Mr. Campbell would not consent. Had they done so it is probable not\nmany of the raiders would have escaped, as the superior local knowledge\nof the natives would have given them an advantage difficult to estimate,\nand the confidence and spirit derived from the aid and presence of a\nwhite man or two would be worth much in such a conflict.\n\n\"Mr. Campbell went on down the river until he met the outfit for his\npost on its way up from Fort Yukon, which he turned back. He then\nascended the Pelly, crossed to the Liard, and reached Fort Simpson, on\nthe Mackenzie, late in October.\n\n\"Mr. Campbell's first visit to the site of Fort Selkirk was made in\n1840, under instructions from Sir George Simpson, then Governor of the\nHudson's Bay Company. He crossed from the head waters of the Liard to\nthe waters of the Pelly. It appears the Pelly, where he struck it, was a\nstream of considerable size, for he speaks of its appearance when he\nfirst saw it from 'Pelly Banks,' the name given the bank from which he\nfirst beheld it, as a'splendid river in the distance.' In June, 1843,\nhe descended the Pelly to its confluence with the larger stream, which\nhe named the 'Lewes.' Here he found many families of the native\nIndians--'Wood Indians,' he called them. These people conveyed to him,\nas best they could by word and sign, the dangers that would attend a\nfurther descent of the river, representing that the country below theirs\nwas inhabited by a tribe of fierce cannibals, who would assuredly kill\nand eat them. This so terrified his men that he had to return by the way\nhe came, pursued, as he afterwards learned, by the Indians, who would\nhave murdered himself and party had they got a favorable opportunity.\nThus it was not until 1850 that he could establish, what he says he all\nalong believed, 'that the Pelly and Yukon were identical.' This he did\nby descending the river to where the Porcupine joins it, and where in\n1847 Fort Yukon was established by Mr. A.H. Murray for the Hudson's Bay\nCompany.\n\n\"With reference to the tales told him by the Indians of bad people\noutside of their country, I may say that Mackenzie tells pretty much the\nsame story of the Indians on the Mackenzie when he discovered and\nexplored that river in 1789. He had the advantage of having Indians\nalong with him whose language was radically the same as that of the\npeople he was coming among, and his statements are more explicit and\ndetailed. Everywhere he came in contact with them they manifested,\nfirst, dread of himself and party, and when friendship and confidence\nwere established they nearly always tried to detain him by representing\nthe people in the direction he was going as unnaturally bloodthirsty and\ncruel, sometimes asserting the existence of monsters with supernatural\npowers, as at Manitou Island, a few miles below the present Fort Good\nHope, and the people on a very large river far to the west of the\nMackenzie, probably the Yukon, they described to him as monsters in\nsize, power and cruelty.\n\n\"In our own time, after the intercourse that there has been between them\nand the whites, more than a suspicion of such unknown, cruel people\nlurks in the minds of many of the Indians. It would be futile for me to\ntry to ascribe an origin for these fears, my knowledge of their language\nand idiosyncrasies being so limited.\n\n\"Nothing more was ever done in the vicinity of Fort Selkirk[7] by the\nHudson's Bay Company after these events, and in 1869 the Company was\nordered by Capt. Charles W. Raymond, who represented the United States\nGovernment, to evacuate the post at Fort Yukon, he having found that it\nwas west of the 141st meridian. The post was occupied by the Company,\nhowever, for some time after the receipt of this order, and until\nRampart House was built, which was intended to be on British territory,\nand to take the trade previously done at Fort Yukon.\n\n[Footnote 7: This is now a winter port for steamboats of the North\nAmerican Transportation and Trading Company, plying the Yukon and its\ntributaries. There is also a trading post here owned by Harper & Ladue.]\n\n\"Under present conditions the Company cannot very well compete with the\nAlaska Commercial Company, whose agents do the only trade in the\ndistrict,[8] and they appear to have abandoned--for the present at\nleast--all attempt to do any trade nearer to it than Rampart House to\nwhich point, notwithstanding the distance and difficulties in the way,\nmany of the Indians on the Yukon make a trip every two or three years to\nprocure goods in exchange for their furs. The clothing and blankets\nbrought in by the Hudson's Bay Company they claim are much better than\nthose traded on their own river by the Americans. Those of them that I\nsaw who had any English blankets exhibited them with pride, and\nexclaimed 'good,' They point to an American blanket in contempt, with\nthe remark 'no good,' and speak of their clothing in the same way.\n\n[Footnote 8: Since the date of this report the North American\nTransportation and Trading Company, better known in the Yukon valley as\n\"Captain Healy's Company,\" has established a number of posts on the\nriver.]\n\n\"On many maps of Alaska a place named 'Reed's House' is shown on or near\nthe upper waters of Stewart River. I made enquiries of all whom I\nthought likely to know anything concerning this post, but failed to\nelicit any information showing that there ever had been such a place. I\nenquired of Mr. Reid, who was in the Company's service with Mr. Campbell\nat Fort Selkirk, and after whom I thought, possibly, the place had been\ncalled, but he told me he knew of no such post, but that there was a\nsmall lake at some distance in a northerly direction from Fort Selkirk,\nwhere fish were procured. A sort of shelter had been made at that point\nfor the fishermen, and a few furs might have been obtained there, but it\nwas never regarded as a trading post.\n\n\"Below Fort Selkirk, the Yukon River is from five to six hundred yards\nbroad, and maintains this width down to White River, a distance of\nninety-six miles. Islands are numerous, so much so that there are very\nfew parts of the river where there are not one or more in sight. Many of\nthem are of considerable size, and nearly all are well timbered. Bars\nare also numerous, but almost all are composed of gravel, so that\nnavigators will not have to complain of shifting sand bars. The current\nas a general thing, is not so rapid as in the upper part of the river,\naveraging about four miles per hour. The depth in the main channel was\nalways found to be more than six feet.\n\n\"From Pelly River to within twelve miles of White River the general\ncourse of the river is a little north of west; it then turns to the\nnorth, and the general course as far as the site of Fort Reliance is due\nnorth.\n\n\"White River enters the main river from the west. At the mouth it is\nabout two hundred yards wide, but a great part of it is filled with\never-shifting sand-bars, the main volume of water being confined to a\nchannel not more than one hundred yards in width. The current is very\nstrong, certainly not less than eight miles per hour. The color of the\nwater bears witness to this, as it is much the muddiest that I have ever\nseen.[9]\n\n[Footnote 9: The White River very probably flows over volcanic deposits\nas its sediments would indicate; no doubt this would account for the\ndiscoloration of its waters. The volcanic ash appears to cover a great\nextent of the Upper Yukon basin drained by the Lewes and Pelly Rivers.\nVery full treatment of the subject is given by Dr. Dawson, in his report\nentitled \"Yukon District and Northern portion of British Columbia.\"]\n\n\"I had intended to make a survey of part of this river as far as the\nInternational Boundary, and attempted to do so; but after trying for\nover half a day, I found it would be a task of much labor and time,\naltogether out of proportion to the importance of the end sought, and\ntherefore abandoned it. The valley as far as can be seen from the mouth,\nruns about due west for a distance of eight miles; it then appears to\nbear to the south-west; it is about two miles wide where it joins the\nPelly valley and apparently keeps the same width as far as it can be\nseen.\n\n\"Mr. Harper, of the firm of Harper & Ladue, went up this river with\nsleds in the fall of 1872 a distance of fifty or sixty miles. He\ndescribes it as possessing the same general features all the way up,\nwith much clay soil along its banks. Its general course, as sketched by\nhim on a map of mine, is for a distance of about thirty miles a little\nnorth-west, thence south-west thirty or thirty-five miles, when it\ndeflects to the north-west running along the base of a high mountain\nridge. If the courses given are correct it must rise somewhere near the\nhead of Forty Mile River; and if so, its length is not at all in keeping\nwith the volume of its discharge, when compared with the known length\nand discharge of other rivers in the territory. Mr. Harper mentioned an\nextensive flat south of the mountain range spoken of, across which many\nhigh mountain peaks could be seen. One of these he thought must be Mount\nSt. Elias, as it overtopped all the others; but, as Mount St. Elias is\nabout one hundred and eighty miles distant, his conclusion is not\ntenable. From his description of this mountain it must be more than\ntwice the height of the highest peaks seen anywhere on the lower river,\nand consequently must be ten or twelve thousand feet above the sea. He\nstated that the current in the river was very swift, as far as he\nascended, and the water muddy. The water from this river, though\nprobably not a fourth of the volume of the Yukon, discolors the water of\nthe latter completely; and a couple of miles, below the junction the\nwhole river appears almost as dirty as White River.\n\n\"Between White and Stewart Rivers, ten miles, the river spreads out to a\nmile and upwards in width, and is a maze of islands and bars. The survey\nwas carried down the easterly shore, and many of the channels passed\nthrough barely afforded water enough to float the canoes. The main\nchannel is along the westerly shore, down which the large boat went, and\nthe crew reported plenty of water.\n\n\"Stewart River enters from the east in the middle of a wide valley, with\nlow hills on both sides, rising on the north sides in steps or terraces\nto distant hills of considerable height. The river half a mile or so\nabove the mouth, is two hundred yards in width. The current is slack and\nthe water shallow and clear, but dark.\n\n\"While at the mouth I was fortunate enough to meet a miner who had spent\nthe whole of the summer of 1887 on the river and its branches\nprospecting and exploring. He gave me a good deal of information of\nwhich I give a summary. He is a native of New Brunswick, Alexander\nMcDonald by name, and has spent some years mining in other places, but\nwas very reticent about what he had made or found. Sixty or seventy\nmiles up the Stewart a large creek enters from the south which he called\nRose Bud Creek or River, and thirty or forty miles further up a\nconsiderable stream flows from the north-east, which appears to be\nBeaver River, as marked on the maps of that part of the country. From\nthe head of this stream he floated down on a raft taking five days to do\nso. He estimated his progress at forty or fifty miles each day, which\ngives a length of from two hundred to two hundred and fifty miles. This\nis probably an over-estimate, unless the stream is very crooked, which,\nhe stated, was not the case. As much of his time would be taken up in\nprospecting, I should call thirty miles or less a closer estimate of his\nprogress. This river is from fifty to eighty yards wide and was never\nmore than four or five feet deep, often being not more than two or\nthree; the current, he said, was not at all swift. Above the mouth of\nthis stream the main river is from one hundred to one hundred and thirty\nyards wide with an even current and clear water. Sixty or seventy miles\nabove the last-mentioned branch another large branch joins, which is\npossibly the main river. At the head of it he found a lake nearly thirty\nmiles long, and averaging a mile and a half in width, which he called\nMayhew Lake, after one of the partners in the firm of Harper, McQuestion\n& Co.\n\n\"Thirty miles or so above the forks on the other branch there are\nfalls, which McDonald estimated to be from one to two hundred feet in\nheight. I met several parties who had seen these falls, and they\ncorroborate this estimate of their height. McDonald went on past the\nfalls to the head of this branch and found terraced gravel hills to the\nwest and north; he crossed them to the north and found a river flowing\nnorthward. On this he embarked on a raft and floated down it for a day\nor two, thinking it would turn to the west and join the Stewart, but\nfinding it still continuing north, and acquiring too much volume to be\nany of the branches he had seen while passing up the Stewart, he\nreturned to the point of his departure, and after prospecting among the\nhills around the head of the river, he started westward, crossing a high\nrange of mountains composed principally of shales with many thin seams\nof what he called quartz, ranging from one to six inches in thickness.\n\n\"On the west side of this range he found a river flowing out of what he\ncalled Mayhew Lake, and crossing this got to the head of Beaver River,\nwhich he descended as before mentioned.\n\n\"It is probable the river flowing northwards, on which he made a journey\nand returned, was a branch of Peel River. He described the timber on the\ngravel terraces of the watershed as small and open. He was alone in this\nunknown wilderness all summer, not seeing even any of the natives. There\nare few men so constituted as to be capable of isolating themselves in\nsuch a manner. Judging from all I could learn it is probable a\nlight-draught steamboat could navigate nearly all of Stewart Iver and\nits tributaries.\n\n\"From Stewart River to the site of Fort Reliance,[10] seventy-three and\na quarter miles, the Yukon is broad and full of islands. The average\nwidth is between a half and three quarters of a mile, but there are many\nexpansions where it is over a mile in breadth; however, in these places\nit cannot be said that the waterway is wider than at other parts of the\nriver, the islands being so large and numerous. In this reach no streams\nof any importance enter.\n\n[Footnote 10: This was at one time a trading post occupied by Messrs.\nHarper & McQuestion.]\n\n\"About thirteen miles below Stewart River a large valley joins that of\nthe river, but the stream occupying it is only a large creek. This\nagrees in position with what has been called Sixty Mile Creek, which was\nsupposed to be about that distance above Fort Reliance, but it does not\nagree with descriptions which I received of it; moreover as Sixty Mile\nCreek is known to be a stream of considerable length, this creek would\nnot answer its description.\n\n\"Twenty-two and a half miles from Stewart River another and larger creek\nenters from the same side; it agrees with the descriptions of Sixty Mile\nCreek, and I have so marked it on my map. This stream is of no\nimportance, except for what mineral wealth may be found on it.[11]\n\n[Footnote 11: Sixty Mile Creek is about one hundred miles long, very\ncrooked, with a swift current and many rapids, and is therefore not easy\nto ascend.\n\nMiller, Glacier, Gold, Little Gold and Bedrock Creeks are all\ntributaries of Sixty Mile. Some of the richest discoveries in gold so\nfar made in the interior since 1894 have been upon these creeks,\nespecially has this been the case upon the two first mentioned. There is\na claim upon Miller Creek owned by Joseph Boudreau from which over\n$100,000 worth of gold is said to have been taken out.\n\nFreight for the mines is taken up Forty Mile Creek in summer for a\ndistance of 30 miles, then portaged across to the heads of Miller and\nGlacier Creeks. In the winter it is hauled in by dogs.\n\nThe trip from Cudahy to the post at the mouth of Sixty Mile River is\nmade by ascending Forty Mile River a small distance, making a short\nportage to Sixty Mile River and running down with its swift current.\nComing back on the Yukon, nearly the whole of the round trip is made\ndown stream.\n\nIndian Creek enters the Yukon from the east about 30 miles below Sixty\nMile. It is reported to be rich in gold, but owing to the scarcity of\nsupplies its development has been retarded.\n\nAt the mouth of Sixty Mile Creek a townsite of that name is located, it\nis the headquarters for upwards of 100 miners and where they more or\nless assemble in the winter months.\n\nMessrs. Harper & Co. have a trading post and a saw-mill on an island at\nthe mouth of the creek; both, of which are in charge of Mr. J. Ladue,\none of the partners of the firm, and who was at one time in the employ\nof the Alaska Commercial Company.]\n\n\"Six and a half miles above Port Reliance the Thron-Diuck[12] River of\nthe Indians (Deer River of Schwatka) enters from the east. It is a small\nriver about forty yards wide at the mouth, and shallow; the water is\nclear and transparent, and of beautiful blue color. The Indians catch\ngreat numbers of salmon here. They had been fishing shortly before my\narrival, and the river, for some distance up, was full of salmon traps.\n\n[Footnote 12: Dawson City is situated at the mouth of the Thron-Diuck\nnow known as Klondyke, and although it was located only a few months ago\nit is the scene of great activity. Very rich deposits of gold have been\nlately found on Bonanza Creek and other affluents of the Thron-Diuck.]\n\n\"A miner had prospected up this river for an estimated distance of forty\nmiles, in the season of 1887. I did not see him, but got some of his\ninformation at second hand. The water being so beautifully clear I\nthought it must come through a large lake not far up; but as far as he\nhad gone no lakes were seen. He said the current was comparatively\nslack, with an occasional 'ripple' or small rapid. Where he turned back\nthe river is surrounded by high mountains, which were then covered with\nsnow, which accounts for the purity and clearness of the water.\n\n\"It appears that the Indians go up this stream a long distance to hunt,\nbut I could learn nothing definite as to their statements concerning it.\n\n\"Twelve and a half miles below Fort Reliance, the Chandindu River, as\nnamed by Schwatka, enters from the east. It is thirty to forty yards\nwide at the mouth, very shallow, and for half a mile up is one\ncontinuous rapid. Its valley is wide and can be seen for a long distance\nlooking north-eastward from the mouth.\n\n\"Between Fort Reliance and Forty Mile River (called Cone Hill River by\nSchwatka) the Yukon assumes its normal appearance, having fewer islands\nand being narrower, averaging four to six hundred yards wide, and the\ncurrent being more regular. This stretch is forty-six miles long, but\nwas estimated by the traders at forty, from which the Forty Mile River\ntook its name.\n\n\"Forty Mile River[13] joins the main river from the west. Its general\ncourse as far up as the International Boundary, a distance of\ntwenty-three miles, is south-west; after this it is reported by the\nminers to run nearer south. Many of them claim to have ascended this\nstream for more than one hundred miles, and speak of it there as quite a\nlarge river. They say that at that distance it has reached the level of\nthe plateau, and the country adjoining it they describe as flat and\nswampy, rising very little above the river. It is only a short distance\nacross to the Tanana River--a large tributary of the Yukon--which is\nhere described as an important stream. However, only about twenty-three\nmiles of Forty Mile River are in Canada; and the upper part of it and\nits relation to other rivers in the district have no direct interest for\nus.\n\n[Footnote 13: Forty Mile townsite is situated on the south side of the\nForty Mile River at its junction with the Yukon. The Alaska Commercial\nCompany has a station here which was for some years in charge of L.N.\nMcQuestion; there are also several blacksmith shops, restaurants,\nbilliard halls, bakeries, an opera house and so on. Rather more than\nhalf a mile below Forty Mile townsite the town of Cudahy was founded on\nthe north side of Forty Mile River in the summer of 1892. It is named\nafter a well known member of the North American Transportation and\nTrading Company. In population and extent of business the town bears\ncomparison with its neighbor across the river. The opposition in trade\nhas been the means of very materially reducing the cost of supplies and\nliving. The North American Transportation and Trading Company has\nerected a saw-mill and some large warehouses. Fort Constantine was\nestablished here immediately upon the arrival of the Mounted Police\ndetachment in the latter part of July, 1895. It is described further on\nin an extract from Inspector Constantine's supplementary report for the\nyear 1895.]\n\n\"Forty Mile River is one hundred to one hundred and fifty yards wide at\nthe mouth, and the current is generally strong, with many small rapids.\nEight miles up is the so-called canon; it is hardly entitled to that\ndistinctive name, being simply a crooked contraction of the river, with\nsteep rocky banks, and on the north side there is plenty of room to walk\nalong the beach. At the lower end of the canon there is a short turn and\nswift water in which are some large rocks; these cannot generally be\nseen, and there is much danger of striking them running down in a boat.\nAt this point several miners have been drowned by their boats being\nupset in collision with these rocks. It is no great distance to either\nshore, and one would think an ordinary swimmer would have no difficulty\nin reaching land; but the coldness of the water soon benumbs a man\ncompletely and renders him powerless. In the summer of 1887, an Indian,\nfrom Tanana, with his family, was coming down to trade at the post at\nthe mouth of Forty Mile River; his canoe struck on these rocks and\nupset, and he was thrown clear of the canoe, but the woman and children\nclung to it. In the rough water he lost sight of them, and concluded\nthat they were lost: it is said he deliberately drew his knife and cut\nhis throat, thus perishing, while his family were hauled ashore by some\nminers. The chief of the band to which this Indian belonged came to the\npost and demanded pay for his loss, which he contended was occasioned by\nthe traders having moved from Belle Isle to Forty Mile, thus causing\nthem to descend this dangerous rapid, and there is little doubt that had\nthere not been so many white men in the vicinity he would have tried to\nenforce his demand.\n\n\"The length of the so-called canon is about a mile. Above it the river\nup to the boundary is generally smooth, with swift current and an\noccasional ripple. The amount of water discharged by this stream is\nconsiderable; but there is no prospect of navigation, it being so swift\nand broken by small rapids.\n\n\"From Forty Mile River to the boundary the Yukon preserves the same\ngeneral character as between\n\n### Summary:\n\n"}

He came of\na very old family of English country gentlemen which had\nmigrated to Ireland in the seventeenth century and\nintermarried with other Anglo-Irish families equally\ndevoted to the service of the British Crown. Guy's father\nwas Christopher Carleton of Newry in County Down. His\nmother was Catherine Ball of County Donegal. His father\ndied comparatively young; and, when he was himself fifteen,\nhis mother married the rector of Newry, the Reverend\nThomas Skelton, whose influence over the six step-children\nof the household worked wholly for their good.\n\nAt eighteen Guy received his first commission as ensign\nin the 25th Foot, then known as Lord Rothes' regiment\nand now as the King's Own Scottish Borderers. At\ntwenty-three he fought gallantly at the siege of\nBergen-op-Zoom. Four years later (1751) he was a lieutenant\nin the Grenadier Guards. He was one of those quiet men\nwhose sterling value is appreciated only by the few till\nsome crisis makes it stand forth before the world at\nlarge. Pitt, Wolfe, and George II all recognized his\nsolid virtues. At thirty he was still some way down the\nlist of lieutenants in the Grenadiers, while Wolfe, two\nyears his junior in age, had been four years in command\nof a battalion with the rank of lieutenant-colonel. Yet\nhe had long been'my friend Carleton' to Wolfe, he was\nsoon to become one of 'Pitt's Young Men,' and he was\nenough of a 'coming man' to incur the king's displeasure.\nHe had criticized the Hanoverians; and the king never\nforgave him. The third George 'gloried in the name of\nEnglishman.' But the first two were Hanoverian all through.\nAnd for an English guardsman to disparage the Hanoverian\narmy was considered next door to _lese-majeste_.\n\nLady Dorchester burnt all her husband's private papers\nafter his death in 1808; so we have lost some of the most\nintimate records concerning him. But 'grave Carleton'\nappears so frequently in the letters of his friend Wolfe\nthat we can see his character as a young man in almost\nany aspect short of self-revelation. The first reference\nhas nothing to do with affairs of state. In 1747 Wolfe,\naged twenty, writing to Miss Lacey, an English girl in\nBrussels, and signing himself'most sincerely your friend\nand admirer,' says: 'I was doing the greatest injustice\nto the dear girls to admit the least doubt of their\nconstancy. Perhaps with respect to ourselves there may\nbe cause of complaint. Carleton, I'm afraid, is a recent\nexample of it.' From this we may infer that Carleton was\nless 'grave' as a young man than Wolfe found him later\non. Six years afterwards Wolfe strongly recommended him\nfor a position which he had himself been asked to fill,\nthat of military tutor to the young Duke of Richmond,\nwho was to get a company in Wolfe's own regiment. Writing\nhome from Paris in 1753 Wolfe tells his mother that the\nduke 'wants some skilful man to travel with him through\nthe Low Countries and into Lorraine. I have proposed my\nfriend Carleton, whom Lord Albemarle approves of.' Lord\nAlbemarle was the British ambassador to France; so Carleton\ngot the post and travelled under the happiest auspices,\nwhile learning the frontier on which the Belgian, French,\nand British allies were to fight the Germans in the Great\nWorld War of 1914. It was during this military tour of\nfortified places that Carleton acquired the engineering\nskill which a few years later proved of such service to\nthe British cause in Canada.\n\nIn 1754 George Washington, at that time a young Virginian\nofficer of only twenty-two, fired the first shot in what\npresently became the world-wide Seven Years' War. The\nimmediate result was disastrous to the British arms; and\nWashington had to give up the command of the Ohio by\nsurrendering Fort Necessity to the French on--of all\ndates--the 4th of July! In 1755 came Braddock's defeat.\nIn 1756 Montcalm arrived in Canada and won his first\nvictory at Oswego. In 1757 Wolfe distinguished himself\nby formulating the plan which, if properly executed,\nwould have prevented the British fiasco at Rochefort on\nthe coast of France. But Carleton remained as undistinguished\nas before. He simply became lieutenant-colonel commanding\nthe 72nd Foot, now the Seaforth Highlanders. In 1758 his\nchance appeared to have come at last. Amherst had asked\nfor his services at Louisbourg. But the king had neither\nforgotten nor forgiven the remarks about the Hanoverians,\nand so refused point-blank, to Wolfe's'very great grief\nand disappointment... It is a public loss Carleton's not\ngoing.' Wolfe's confidence in Carleton, either as a friend\nor as an officer, was stronger than ever. Writing to\nGeorge Warde, afterwards the famous cavalry leader, he\nsaid: 'Accidents may happen in the family that may throw\nmy little affairs into disorder. Carleton is so good as\nto say he will give what help is in his power. May I ask\nthe same favour of you, my oldest friend?' Writing to\nLord George Sackville, of whom we shall hear more than\nenough at the crisis of Carleton's career Wolfe said:\n'Amherst will tell you his opinion of Carleton, by which\nyou will probably be better convinced of our loss.' Again,\n'We want grave Carleton for every purpose of the war.'\nAnd yet again, after the fall of Louisbourg: 'If His\nMajesty had thought proper to let Carleton come with us\nas engineer it would have cut the matter much shorter\nand we might now be ruining the walls of Quebec and\ncompleting the conquest of New France.' A little later\non Wolfe blazes out with indignation over Carleton's\nsupersession by a junior. 'Can Sir John Ligonier (the\ncommander-in-chief) allow His Majesty to remain\nunacquainted with the merit of that officer, and can he\nsee such a mark of displeasure without endeavouring to\nsoften or clear the matter up a little? A man of honour\nhas the right to expect the protection of his Colonel\nand of the Commander of the troops, and he can't serve\nwithout it.  If I was in Carleton's place I wouldn't stay\nan hour in the Army after being aimed at and distinguished\nin so remarkable a manner.' But Carleton bided his time.\n\nAt the beginning of 1759 Wolfe was appointed to command\nthe army destined to besiege Quebec. He immediately\nsubmitted Carleton's name for appointment as\nquartermaster-general. Pitt and Ligonier heartily approved.\nBut the king again refused. Ligonier went back a second\ntime to no purpose. Pitt then sent him in for the third\ntime, saying, in a tone meant for the king to overhear:\n'Tell His Majesty that in order to render the General\n[Wolfe] completely responsible for his conduct he should\nbe made, as far as possible, inexcusable if he should\nfail; and that whatever an officer entrusted with such\na service of confidence requests ought therefore to be\ngranted.' The king then consented. Thus began Carleton's\nlong, devoted, and successful service for Canada, the\nEmpire, and the Crown.\n\nEarly in this memorable Empire Year of 1759 he sailed\nwith Wolfe and Saunders from Spithead. On the 30th of\nApril the fleet rendezvoused at Halifax, where Admiral\nDurell, second-in-command to Saunders, had spent the\nwinter with a squadron intended to block the St Lawrence\ndirectly navigation opened in the spring. Durell was a\ngood commonplace officer, but very slow. He had lost many\nhands from sickness during a particularly cold season,\nand he was not enterprising enough to start cruising\nround Cabot Strait before the month of May. Saunders,\ngreatly annoyed by this delay, sent him off with eight\nmen-of-war on the 5th of May. Wolfe gave him seven hundred\nsoldiers under Carleton. These forces were sufficient to\nturn back, capture, or destroy the twenty-three French\nmerchantmen which were then bound for Quebec with supplies\nand soldiers as reinforcements for Montcalm. But the\nFrench ships were a week ahead of Durell; and, when he\nlanded Carleton at Isle-aux-Coudres on the 28th of May,\nthe last of the enemy's transports had already discharged\nher cargo at Quebec, sixty miles above.\n\nIsle-aux-Coudres, so named by Jacques Cartier in 1535,\nwas a point of great strategic importance; for it commanded\nthe only channel then used. It was the place Wolfe had\nchosen for his winter quarters, that is, in case of\nfailure before Quebec and supposing he was not recalled.\nNone but a particularly good officer would have been\nappointed as its first commandant. Carleton spent many\nbusy days here preparing an advanced base for the coming\nsiege, while the subsequently famous Captain Cook was\nequally busy 'a-sounding of the channell of the Traverse'\nwhich the fleet would have to pass on its way to Quebec.\nSome of Durell's ships destroyed the French 'long-shore\nbatteries near this Traverse, at the lower end of the\nisland of Orleans, while the rest kept ceaseless watch\nto seaward, anxiously scanning the offing, day after day,\nto make out the colours of the first fleet up. No one\nknew what the French West India fleet would do; and there\nwas a very disconcerting chance that it might run north\nand slip into the St Lawrence, ahead of Saunders, in the\nsame way as the French reinforcements had just slipped\nin ahead of Durell. Presently, at the first streak of\ndawn on the 23rd of June, a strong squadron was seen\nadvancing rapidly under a press of sail. Instantly the\nofficers of the watch called all hands up from below.\nThe boatswains' whistles shrilled across the water as\nthe seamen ran to quarters and cleared the decks for\naction. Carleton's camp was equally astir. The guards\nturned out. The bugles sounded. The men fell in and\nwaited. Then the flag-ship signalled ashore that the\nstrangers had just answered correctly in private code\nthat all was well and that Wolfe and Saunders were aboard.\n\nNext to Wolfe himself Carleton was the busiest man\nin the army throughout the siege of Quebec. In addition\nto his arduous and very responsible duties as\nquartermaster-general, he acted as inspector of engineers\nand as a special-service officer for work of an\nexceptionally confidential nature. As quartermaster-general\nhe superintended the supply and transport branches.\nConsidering that the army was operating in a devastated\nhostile country, a thousand miles away from its bases at\nHalifax and Louisbourg, and that the interaction of the\ndifferent services--naval and military, Imperial and\nColonial--required adjustment to a nicety at every turn,\nit was wonderful that so much was done so well with means\nwhich were far from being adequate. War prices of course\nruled in the British camp. But they compared very favourably\nwith the famine prices in Quebec, where most 'luxuries'\nsoon became unobtainable at any price. There were no\ncanteen or camp-follower scandals under Carleton. Then,\nas now, every soldier had a regulation ration of food\nand a regulation allowance for his service kit. But\n'extras' were always acceptable. The price-list of these\n'extras' reads strangely to modern ears. But, under the\ncircumstances, it was not exorbitant, and it was slightly\ntempered by being reckoned in Halifax currency of four\ndollars to the pound instead of five. The British Tommy\nAtkins of that and many a later day thought Canada a\nwonderful country for making money go a long way when he\ncould buy a pot of beer for twopence and get back thirteen\npence Halifax currency as change for his English shilling.\nBeef and ham ran from ninepence to a shilling a pound.\nMutton was a little dearer. Salt butter was eightpence\nto one-and-threepence. Cheese was tenpence; potatoes from\nfive to ten shillings a bushel. 'A reasonable loaf of\ngood soft Bread' cost sixpence. Soap was a shilling a\npound. Tea was prohibitive for all but the officers.\n'Plain Green Tea and very Badd' was fifteen shillings,\n'Couchon' twenty shillings, 'Hyson' thirty. Leaf tobacco\nwas tenpence a pound, roll one-and-tenpence, snuff\ntwo-and-threepence. Sugar was a shilling to eighteen\npence. Lemons were sixpence apiece. The non-intoxicating\n'Bad Sproos Beer' was only twopence a quart and helped\nto keep off scurvy. Real beer, like wine and spirits,\nwas more expensive. 'Bristol Beer' was eighteen shillings\na dozen, 'Bad malt Drink from Hellifax' ninepence a quart.\nRum and claret were eight shillings a gallon each, port\nand Madeira ten and twelve respectively. The term 'Bad'\ndid not then mean noxious, but only inferior. It stood\nagainst every low-grade article in the price-list. No\ngoods were over-classified while Carleton was\nquartermaster-general.\n\nThe engineers were under-staffed, under-manned, and\noverworked. There were no Royal Engineers as a permanent\nand comprehensive corps till the time of Wellington.\nWolfe complained bitterly and often of the lack of men\nand materials for scientific siege work. But he'relied\non Carleton' to good purpose in this respect as well as\nin many others. In his celebrated dispatch to Pitt he\nmentions Carleton twice. It was Carleton whom he sent to\nseize the west end of the island of Orleans, so as to\ncommand the basin of Quebec, and Carleton whom he sent to\ntake prisoners and gather information at Pointe-aux-Trembles,\ntwenty miles above the city. Whether or not he revealed\nthe whole of his final plan to Carleton is probably more\nthan we shall ever know, since Carleton's papers were\ndestroyed. But we do know that he did not reveal it to\nany one else, not even to his three brigadiers, Monckton,\nTownshend, and Murray.\n\nCarleton was wounded in the head during the Battle of\nthe Plains; but soon returned to duty. Wolfe showed his\nconfidence in him to the last. Carleton's was the only\nname mentioned twice in the will which Wolfe handed over\nto Jervis, the future Lord St Vincent, the night before\nthe battle. 'I leave to Colonel Oughton, Colonel Carleton,\nColonel Howe, and Colonel Warde a thousand pounds each.'\n'All my books and papers, both here and in England, I\nleave to Colonel Carleton.' Wolfe's mother, who died five\nyears later, showed the same confidence by appointing\nCarleton her executor.\n\nWith the fall of Quebec in 1759 Carleton disappears from\nthe Canadian scene till 1766. But so many pregnant events\nhappened in Canada during these seven years, while so\nfew happened in his own career, that it is much more\nimportant for us to follow her history than his biography.\n\nIn 1761 he was wounded at the storming of Port Andro\nduring the attack on Belle Isle off the west coast of\nFrance. In 1762 he was wounded at Havana in the West\nIndies. After that he enjoyed four years of quietness at\nhome. Then came the exceedingly difficult task of guiding\nCanada through twelve years of turbulent politics and\nmost subversive war.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nGENERAL MURRAY\n1759-1766\n\nBoth armies spent a terrible winter after the Battle of\nthe Plains. There was better shelter for the French in\nMontreal than for the British among the ruins of Quebec.\nBut in the matter of food the positions were reversed.\nNevertheless the French gallantly refused the truce\noffered them by Murray, who had now succeeded Wolfe. They\nwere determined to make a supreme effort to regain Quebec\nin the spring; and they were equally determined that the\nhabitants should not be free to supply the British with\nprovisions.\n\nIn spite of the state of war, however, the French and\nBritish officers, even as prisoners and captors, began\nto make friends. They had found each other foemen worthy\nof their steel. A distinguished French officer, the Comte\nde Malartic, writing to Levis, Montcalm's successor,\nsaid: 'I cannot speak too highly of General Murray,\nalthough he is our enemy.' Murray, on his part, was\nequally loud and generous in his praise of the French.\nThe Canadian seigneurs found fellow-gentlemen among\nthe British officers. The priests and nuns of Quebec\nfound many fellow-Catholics among the Scottish and Irish\ntroops, and nothing but courteous treatment from the\nsoldiers of every rank and form of religion. Murray\ndirected that 'the compliment of the hat' should be paid\nto all religious processions. The Ursuline nuns knitted\nlong stockings for the bare-legged Highlanders when the\nwinter came on, and presented each Scottish officer with\nan embroidered St Andrew's Cross on the 30th of November,\nSt Andrew's Day. The whole garrison won the regard of\nthe town by giving up part of their rations for the hungry\npoor; while the habitants from the surrounding country\npresently began to find out that the British were honest\nto deal with and most humane, though sternly just, as\nconquerors.\n\nIn the following April Levis made his desperate throw\nfor victory; and actually did succeed in defeating Murray\noutside the walls of Quebec. But the British fleet came\nup in May; and that summer three British armies converged\non Montreal, where the last doomed remnants of French\npower on the St Lawrence stood despairingly at bay. When\nLevis found his two thousand effective French regulars\nsurrounded by eight times as many British troops he had\nno choice but to lay down the arms of France for ever.\nOn the 8th of September 1760 his gallant little army was\nincluded in the Capitulation of Montreal, by which the\nwhole of Canada passed into the possession of the British\nCrown.\n\nGreat Britain had a different general idea for each one\nof the four decades which immediately followed the conquest\nof Canada. In the sixties the general idea was to kill\nrefractory old French ways with a double dose of new\nBritish liberty and kindness, so that Canada might\ngradually become the loyal fourteenth colony of the Empire\nin America. But the fates were against this benevolent\nscheme. The French Canadians were firmly wedded to their\nold ways of life, except in so far as the new liberty\nenabled them to throw off irksome duties and restraints,\nwhile the new English-speaking 'colonists' were so few,\nand mostly so bad, that they became the cause of endless\ndiscord where harmony was essential. In the seventies\nthe idea was to restore the old French-Canadian life so\nas not only to make Canada proof against the disaffection\nof the Thirteen Colonies but also to make her a safe base\nof operations against rebellious Americans. In the eighties\nthe great concern of the government was to make a harmonious\nwhole out of two very widely differing parts--the\nlong-settled French Canadians and the newly arrived United\nEmpire Loyalists. In the nineties each of these parts\nwas set to work out its own salvation under its own\nprovincial constitution.\n\nCarleton's is the only personality which links together\nall four decades--the would-be American sixties, the\nFrench-Canadian seventies, the Anglo-French-Canadian\neighties, and the bi-constitutional nineties--though, as\nmentioned already, Murray ruled Canada for the first\nseven years, 1759-66.\n\nJames Murray, the first British governor of Canada, was\na younger son of the fourth Lord Elibank. He was just\nover forty, warm-hearted and warm-tempered, an excellent\nFrench scholar, and every inch a soldier. He had been a\nwitness for the defence of Mordaunt at the court-martial\nheld to try the authors of the Rochefort fiasco in 1757.\nWolfe, who was a witness on the other side, referred to\nhim later on as'my old antagonist Murray.' But Wolfe\nknew a good man when he saw one and gave his full confidence\nto his 'old antagonist' both at Louisbourg and Quebec.\nMurray was not born under a lucky star. He saw three\ndefeats in three successive wars. He began his service\nwith the abortive attack on pestilential Cartagena, where\nWolfe's father was present as adjutant-general. In\nmid-career he lost the battle of Ste Foy. [Footnote:\nSee _The Winning of Canada_, chap. viii. See also, for\nthe best account of this battle and other events of the\nyear between Wolfe's victory and the surrender of Montreal,\n_The Fall of Canada_, by George M. Wrong. Oxford, 1914.]\nAnd his active military life ended with his surrender of\nMinorca in 1782. But he was greatly distinguished for\nhonour and steadfastness on all occasions. An admiring\ncontemporary described him as a model of all the military\nvirtues except prudence. But he had more prudence and\nless genius than his admirer thought; and he showed a\nmarked talent for general government. The problem before\nhim was harder than his superiors could believe. He was\nexpected to prepare for assimilation some sixty-five\nthousand 'new subjects' who were mostly alien in religion\nand wholly alien in every other way. But, for the moment,\nthis proved the least of his many difficulties because\nno immediate results were required.\n\nWhile the war went on in Europe Canada remained nominally\na part of the enemy's dominions, and so, of course, was\nsubject to military rule. Sir Jeffery Amherst, the British\ncommander-in-chief in America, took up his headquarters\nin New York. Under him Murray commanded Canada from\nQuebec. Under Murray, Colonel Burton commanded the district\nof Three Rivers while General Gage commanded the district\nof Montreal, which then extended to the western wilds.\n[Footnote: See _The War Chief of the Ottawas_, chap. iii.]\n\nMurray's first great trouble arose in 1761. It was caused\nby an outrageous War Office order that fourpence a day\nshould be stopped from the soldiers to pay for the rations\nthey had always got free. Such gross injustice, coming\nin time of war and applied to soldiers who richly deserved\nreward, made the veterans'mad with rage.' Quebec promised\nto be the scene of a wild mutiny. Murray, like all his\nofficers, thought the stoppage nothing short of robbery.\nBut he threw himself into the breach. He assembled the\nofficers and explained that they must die to the last\nman rather than allow the mutineers a free hand. He then\nheld a general parade at which he ordered the troops to\nmarch between two flag-poles on pain of instant death,\npromising to kill with his own hands the first man who\nrefused. He added that he was ready to hear and forward\nany well-founded complaint, but that, since insubordination\nhad been openly threatened, he would insist on subordination\nbeing publicly shown. Then, amid tense silence, he gave\nthe word of command--_Quick, March!_--while every officer\nfelt his trigger. To the immense relief of all concerned\nthe men stepped off, marched straight between the flags\nand back to quarters, tamed. The criminal War Office\nblunder was rectified and peace was restored in the ranks.\n\n'Murray's Report' of 1762 gives us a good view of the\nCanada of that day and shows the attitude of the British\ntowards their new possession. Canada had been conquered\nby Great Britain, with some help from the American\ncolonies, for three main reasons: first, to strike a\ndeath-blow at French dominion in America; secondly, to\nincrease the opportunities of British seaborne trade;\nand, thirdly, to enlarge the area available for British\nsettlement. When Murray was instructed to prepare a report\non Canada he had to keep all this in mind; for the\ngovernment wished to satisfy the public both at home and\nin the colonies. He had to examine the military strength\nof the country and the disposition of its population in\ncase of future wars with France. He had to satisfy the\nnatural curiosity of men like the London merchants. And\nhe had to show how and where English-speaking settlers\ncould go in and make Canada not only a British possession\nbut the fourteenth British colony in North America. Burton\nand Gage were also instructed to report about their own\ndistricts of Three Rivers and Montreal. The documents\nthey prepared were tacked on to Murray's. By June 1762\nthe work was completed and sent on to Amherst, who sent\nit to England in ample time to be studied there before\nthe opening of the impending negotiations for peace.\n\nMurray was greatly concerned about the military strength\nof Quebec, then, as always, the key of Canada. Like the\nunfortunate Montcalm he found the walls of Quebec badly\nbuilt, badly placed, and falling into ruins, and he\nthought they could not be defended by three thousand men\nagainst 'a well conducted _Coup-de-main_.' He proposed\nto crown Cape Diamond with a proper citadel, which would\noverawe the disaffected in Quebec itself and defend the\nplace against an outside enemy long enough to let a\nBritish fleet come up to its relief. The rest of the\ncountry was defended by little garrisons at Three Rivers\nand Montreal as well as by several small detachments\ndistributed among the trading-posts where the white men\nand the red met in the depths of the western wilderness.\n\nThe relations between the British garrison and the French\nCanadians were so excellent that what Gage reported from\nMontreal might be taken as equally true of the rest of\nthe country: 'The Soldiers live peaceably with the\nInhabitants and they reciprocally acquire an affection\nfor each other.' The French Canadians numbered sixty-five\nthousand altogether, exclusive of the fur traders and\ncoureurs de bois. Barely fifteen thousand lived in the\nthree little towns of Quebec, Montreal, and Three Rivers;\nwhile over fifty thousand lived in the country. Nearly\nall the officials had gone back to France. The three\nclasses of greatest importance were the seigneurs, the\nclergy, and the habitants. The lawyers were not of much\naccount; the petty commercial classes of less account\nstill. The coureurs de bois and other fur traders formed\nan important link between the savage and the civilized\nlife of the country.\n\nApart from furs the trade of Canada was contemptibly\nsmall in the eyes of men like the London merchants. But\nthe opportunity of fostering all the fur trade that could\nbe carried down the St Lawrence was very well worth while;\nand if there was no other existing trade worth capturing\nthere seemed to be some kinds worth creating. Murray held\nout well-grounded hopes of the fisheries and forests. 'A\nMost immense Cod Fishery can be established in the River\nand Gulph of St Lawrence. A rich tract of country on the\nSouth Side of the Gulph will be settled and improved,\nand a port or ports furnished with every material requisite\nto repair ships.' He then went on to enumerate the other\nkinds of fishery, the abundance of whales, seals, and\nwalruses in the Gulf, and of salmon up all the tributary\nrivers. Burton recommends immediate attention to the iron\nmines behind Three Rivers. All the governors expatiate\non the vast amount of forest wealth and remind the home\ngovernment that under the French regime the king, when\nmaking out patents for the seigneurs, reserved the right\nof taking wood for ship-building and fortifications from\nany of the seigneuries. Agriculture was found to be in\na very backward state. The habitants would raise no more\nthan they required for their own use and for a little\nlocal trade. But the fault was attributed to the gambling\nattractions of the fur trade, to the bad governmental\nsystem, and to the frequent interruptions of the _corvee_,\na kind of forced labour which was meant to serve the\npublic interest, but which Bigot and other thievish\nofficials always turned to their own private advantage.\nOn the whole, the reports were most encouraging in the\nprospects they held out to honest labour, trade, and\ngovernment.\n\nWhile Murray and his lieutenants had been collecting\ninformation for their reports the home government had\nbeen undergoing many changes for the worse. The\nmaster-statesman Pitt had gone out of power and the\nback-stairs politician Bute had come in. Pitt's 'bloody\nand expensive war'--the war that more than any other,\nlaid the foundations of the present British Empire--was\nto be ended on any terms the country could be persuaded\nto bear. Thus the end of the Seven Years' War, or, as\nthe British part of it was more correctly called, the\n'Maritime War,' was no more glorious in statesmanship\nthan its beginning had been in arms. But the spirit of\nits mighty heart still lived on in the Empire's grateful\nmemories of Pitt and quickened the English-speaking world\nenough to prevent any really disgraceful surrender of\nthe hard-won fruits of victory.\n\nThe Treaty of Paris, signed on the 10th of February 1763,\nand the king's proclamation, published in October, were\nduly followed by the inauguration of civil government in\nCanada. The incompetent Bute, anxious to get Pitt out of\nthe way, tried to induce him to become the first British\ngovernor of the new colony. Even Bute probably never\ndared to hope that Pitt would actually go out to Canada.\nBut he did hope to lower his prestige by making him the\nholder of a sinecure at home. However this may be, Pitt,\nmightiest of all parliamentary ministers of war, refused\nto be made either a jobber or an exile; whereupon Murray's\nposition was changed from a military command into that\nof 'Governor and Captain-General.'\n\nThe changes which ensued in the laws of Canada were\nheartily welcomed so far as the adoption of the humaner\ncriminal code of England was concerned. The new laws\nrelating to debtor and creditor also gave general\nsatisfaction, except, as we shall presently see, when\nthey involved imprisonment for debt. But the tentative\nefforts to introduce English civil law side by side with\nthe old French code resulted in great confusion and much\ndiscontent. The land laws had become so unworkable under\nthis dual system that they had to be left as they were.\nA Court of Common Pleas was set up specially for the\nbenefit of the French Canadians. If either party demanded\na jury one had to be sworn in; and French Canadians were\nto be jurors on equal terms with 'the King's Old Subjects.'\nThe Roman Catholic Church was to be completely tolerated\nbut not in any way established. Lord Egremont, in giving\nthe king's instructions to Murray, reminded him that the\nproviso in the Treaty of Paris--_as far as the Laws of\nGreat Britain permit_--should govern his action whenever\ndisputes arose. It must be remembered that the last\nJacobite rising was then a comparatively recent affair,\nand that France was equally ready to upset either the\nProtestant succession in England or the British regime\nin Canada.\n\nThe Indians were also an object of special solicitude in\nthe royal proclamation. 'The Indians who live under our\nProtection should not be molested in the possession of\nsuch parts of our Dominions and Territories as, not having\nbeen ceded to or purchased by Us, are reserved to them.'\nThe home government was far in advance of the American\ncolonists in its humane attitude towards the Indians.\nThe common American attitude then and long afterwards\n--indeed, up to a time well within living memory--was\nthat Indians were a kind of human vermin to be exterminated\nwithout mercy, unless, of course, more money was to be\nmade out of them alive. The result was an endless struggle\nalong the ever-receding frontier of the West. And just\nat this particular time the 'Conspiracy of Pontiac' had\nbrought about something like a real war. The story of\nthis great effort of the Indians to stem the encroachments\nof the exterminating colonists is told in another chronicle\nof the present Series. [Footnote: The War Chief of the\nOttawas.] The French traders in the West undoubtedly had\na hand in stirring up the Indians. Pontiac, a sort of\nIndian Napoleon, was undoubtedly cruel as well as crafty.\nAnd the Indians undoubtedly fought just as the ancestors\nof the French and British used to fight when they were\nat the corresponding stage of social evolution. But the\nmere fact that so many jealously distinct tribes united\nin this common cause proves how much they all must have\nsuffered at the hands of the colonists.\n\nWhile Pontiac's war continued in the West Murray had to\ndeal with a political war in Canada which rose to its\nheight in 1764. The king's proclamation of the previous\nOctober had 'given express Power to our Governor that,\nso soon as the state and circumstances of the said Colony\nwill admit thereof, he shall call a General Assembly in\nsuch manner and form as is used in those Colonies and\nProvinces in America which are under our immediate\ngovernment.' The intention of establishing parliamentary\ninstitutions was, therefore, perfectly clear. But it was\nequally clear that the introduction of such institutions\nwas to depend on 'circumstances,' and it is well to\nremember here that these 'circumstances' were not held\nto warrant the opening of a Canadian parliament till\n1792. Now, the military government had been a great\nsuccess. There was every reason to suppose that civil\ngovernment by a governor and council would be the next\nbest thing. And it was quite certain that calling a\n'General Assembly' at once would defeat the very ends\nwhich such bodies are designed to serve. More than\nninety-nine per cent of the population were dead against\nan assembly which none of them understood and all\ndistrusted. On the other hand, the clamorous minority of\nless than one per cent were in favour only of a parliament\nfrom which the majority should be rigorously excluded,\neven, if possible, as voters. The immense majority\ncomprised the entire French-Canadian community. The\nabsurdly small minority consisted mostly of Americanized\ncamp-following traders, who, having come to fish in\ntroubled waters, naturally wanted the laws made to suit\npoachers. The British garrison, the governing officials,\nand the very few other English-speaking people of a more\nenlightened class all looked down on the rancorous\nminority. The whole question resolved itself into this:\nshould Canada be handed over to the licensed exploitation\nof a few hundred low-class camp-followers, who had done\nnothing to win her for the British Empire, who were\ndespised by those who had, and who promised to be a\ndangerous thorn in the side of the new colony?\n\nWhat this ridiculous minority of grab-alls really wanted\nwas not a parliament but a rump. Many a representative\nassembly has ended in a rump, The grab-alls wished to\nbegin with one and stop there. It might be supposed that\nsuch pretensions would defeat themselves. But there was\na twofold difficulty in the way of getting the truth\nunderstood by the English-speaking public on both sides\nof the Atlantic. In the first place, the French Canadians\nwere practically dumb to the outside world. In the second,\nthe vociferous rumpites had the ear of some English and\nmore American commercial people who were not anxious to\nunderstand; while the great mass of the general public\nwere inclined to think, if they ever thought at all, that\nparliamentary government must mean more liberty for every\none concerned.\n\nA singularly apt commentary on the pretensions of the\ncamp-followers is supplied by the famous, or infamous,\n'Presentment of the Grand Jury of Quebec' in October\n1764. The moving spirits of this precious jury were\naspirants to membership in the strictly exclusive, rumpish\nlittle parliament of their own seeking. The signatures\nof the French-Canadian members were obtained by fraud,\nas was subsequently proved by a sworn official protestation.\nThe first presentment tells its own tale, as it refers\nto the only courts in which French-Canadian lawyers were\nallowed to plead. 'The great number of inferior Courts\nare tiresome, litigious, and expensive to this poor\nColony.' Then came a hit at the previous military\nrule--'That Decrees of the military Courts may be amended\n[after having been confirmed by legal ordinance] by\nallowing Appeals if the matter decided exceed Ten Pounds,'\nwhich would put it out of the reach of the 'inferior\nCourts' and into the clutches of 'the King's Old Subjects.'\nBut the gist of it all was contained in the following:\n'We represent that as the Grand Jury must be considered\nat present as the only Body representative of the Colony,\n... We propose that the Publick Accounts be laid before\nthe Grand Jury at least twice a year.' That the grand\njury was to be purged of all its French-Canadian members\nis evident from the addendum slipped in behind their\nbacks. This addendum is a fine specimen of verbose\ninvective against 'the Church of Rome,' the Pope, Bulls,\nBriefs, absolutions, etc., the empanelling 'en Grand and\npetty Jurys' of '<DW7> or popish Recusants Convict,'\nand so on.\n\nThe 'Presentment of the Grand Jury' was presently followed\nby _The Humble Petition of Your Majesty's most faithful\nand loyal Subjects, British Merchants and Traders, in\nbehalf of Themselves and their fellow Subjects, Inhabitants\nof Your Majesty's Province of Quebec_. 'Their fellow\nSubjects' did not, of course, include any '<DW7> or\npopish Recusants Convict.' Among the 'Grievances and\nDistresses' enumerated were 'the oppressive and severely\nfelt Military government,' the inability to'reap the\nfruit of our Industry' under such a martinet as Murray,\nwho, in one paragraph, is accused of'suppressing dutyfull\nRemonstrances in Silence' and, in the next, of 'treating\nthem with a Rage and Rudeness of Language and Demeanor\nas dishonourable to the Trust he holds of Your Majesty\nas painfull to Those who suffer from it.' Finally, the\npetitioners solemnly warn His Majesty that their 'Lives\nin the Province are so very unhappy that we must be under\nthe Necessity of removing from it, unless timely prevented\nby a Removal of the present Governor.'\n\nIn forwarding this document Murray poured out the vials\nof his wrath on 'the Licentious Fanaticks Trading here,'\nwhile he boldly championed the cause of the French\nCanadians, 'a Race, who, could they be indulged with a\nfew priveledges which the Laws of England deny to Roman\nCatholicks at home, would soon get the better of every\nNational Antipathy to their Conquerors and become the\nmost faithful and most useful set of Men in this American\nEmpire.'\n\nWhile these charges and counter-charges were crossing\nthe Atlantic another, and much more violent, trouble came\nto a head. As there were no barracks in Canada billeting\nwas a necessity. It was made as little burdensome as\npossible and the houses of magistrates were specially\nexempt. This, however, did not prevent the magistrates\nfrom baiting the military whenever they got the chance.\nFines, imprisonments, and other sentences, out of all\nproportion to the offence committed, were heaped on every\nredcoat in much the same way as was then being practised\nin Boston and other hotbeds of disaffection. The redcoats\nhad done their work in ridding America of the old French\nmenace. They were doing it now in ridding the colonies\nof the last serious menace from the Indians. And so the\ncolonists, having no further use for them, began trying\nto make the land they had delivered too hot to hold them.\nThere were, of course, exceptions; and the American\ncolonists had some real as well as pretended grievances.\nBut wantonly baiting the redcoats had already become a\nmost discreditable general practice.\n\nMontreal was most in touch with the disaffected people\nto the south. It also had a magistrate of the name of\nWalker, the most rancorous of all the disaffected\nmagistrates in Canada. This Walker, well mated with an\nequally rancorous wife, was the same man who entertained\nBenjamin Franklin and the other commissioners sent by\nCongress into Canada in 1776, the year in which both the\nAmerican Republic and a truly British Canada were born.\nHe would not have been flattered could he have seen the\nentry Franklin made about him and his wife in a diary\nwhich is still extant. The gist of it was that wherever\nthe Walkers might be they would soon set the place by\nthe ears. Walker, of course, was foremost in the persecution\nof the redcoats; and he eagerly seized his opportunity\nwhen an officer was billeted in a house where a brother\nmagistrate happened to be living as a lodger. Under such\ncircumstances the magistrate could not claim exemption.\nBut this made no difference either to him or to Walker.\nCaptain Payne, the gentleman whose presence enraged these\nboors, was seized and thrown into gaol. The chief justice\ngranted a writ of habeas corpus. But the mischief was\ndone and resentment waxed high. The French-Canadian\nseigneurs sympathized with Payne, which added fuel to\nthe magisterial flame; and Murray, scenting danger,\nsummoned the whole bench down to Quebec.\n\nBut before this bench of bumbles started some masked men\nseized Walker in his own house and gave him a good sound\nthrashing. Unfortunately they spoilt the fair reprisal\nby cutting off his ear. That very night the news had run\nround Montreal and made a start for Boston and Quebec.\nFeeling ran high; and higher still when, a few weeks\nlater, the civil magistrates vented their rage on several\nredcoats by imposing sentences exceeding even the utmost\nlimits of their previous vindictive action. Montreal\nbecame panic-stricken lest the soldiers, baited past\nendurance, should break out in open violence. Murray\ndrove up, post-haste, from Quebec, ordered the affected\nregiment to another station, reproved the offending\nmagistrates, and re-established public confidence. Official\nand private rewards were offered to any witnesses who\nwould identify Walker's assailants. But in vain. The\nsmouldering fire burst out again under Carleton. But the\nmystery was never cleared up.\n\nThings had now come to a crisis. The London merchants,\nknowing nothing about the internal affairs of Canada,\nbacked the petition of the Quebec traders, who were quite\nunworthy of such support from men of real business probity\nand knowledge. The magisterial faction in Canada advertised\ntheir side of the case all over the colonies and in any\nsympathetic quarter they could find in England. The\nseigneurs sent home a warm defence of Murray; and Murray\nhimself sent Cramahe, a very able Swiss officer in the\nBritish Army. The home government thus had plenty of\ncontradictory evidence before it in 1765. The result was\nthat Murray was called home in 1766, rather in a spirit\nof open-minded and sympathetic inquiry into his conduct\nthan with any idea of censuring him. He never returned\nto Canada. But as he held the titular governorship for\nsome time longer, and as he was afterwards employed in\npositions of great responsibility and trust, the verdict\nof the home authorities was clearly given in his favour.\n\nThe troublous year of 1764 saw another innovation almost\nas revolutionary, compared with the old regime, as the\nintroduction of civil government itself. This was the\nissue of the first newspaper in Canada, where, indeed,\nit was also the first printed thing of any kind. Nova\nScotia had produced an earlier paper, the _Halifax\nGazette_, which lived an intermittent life from 1752 to\n1800. But no press had ever been allowed in New France.\nThe few documents that required printing had always been\ndone in the mother country. Brown and Gilmore, two\nPhiladelphians, were thus undertaking a pioneer business\nwhen they announced that 'Our Design is, in case we are\nfortunate enough to succeed, early in this spring to\nsettle in this City [Quebec] in the capacity of Printers,\nand forthwith to publish a weekly newspaper in French\nand English.' The _Quebec Gazette_, which first appeared\non the 21st of the following June, has continued to the\npresent time, though it is now a daily and is known as\nthe _Quebec Chronicle_. Centenarian papers are not common\nin any country; and those that have lived over a century\nand a half are very few indeed. So the _Quebec Chronicle_,\nwhich is the second surviving senior in America, is also\namong the great press seniors of the world.\n\nThe original number is one of the curiosities of journalism.\nThe publishers felt tolerably sure of having what was\nthen considered a good deal of recent news for their\nthree hundred readers during the open season. But, knowing\nthat the supply would be both short and stale in winter,\nthey held out prospects of a Canadian _Tatler_ or _Spectator_,\nwithout, however, being rash enough to promise a supply\nof Addisons and Steeles. Their announcement makes curious\nreading at the present day.\n\n   The Rigour of Winter preventing the arrival of ships\n   from _Europe_, and in a great measure interrupting\n   the ordinary intercourse with the Southern Provinces,\n   it will be necessary, in a paper designed for General\n   Perusal, and Publick Utility, to provide some things\n   of general Entertainment, independent of foreign\n   intelligence: we shall therefore, on such occasions,\n   present our Readers with such _Originals_, both in\n   _Prose_ and _Verse_, as will please the FANCY and\n   instruct the JUDGMENT. And here we beg leave to observe\n   that we shall have nothing so much at heart as the\n   support of VIRTUE and MORALITY and the noble cause of\n   LIBERTY. The refined amusements of LITERATURE, and\n   the pleasing veins of well pointed wit, shall also be\n   considered as necessary to this collection; interspersed\n   with chosen pieces, and curious essays, extracted from\n   the most celebrated authors; So that, blending PHILOSOPHY\n   with POLITICKS, HISTORY, &c., the youth of both sexes\n   will be improved and persons of all ranks agreeably\n   and usefully entertained. And upon the whole we will\n   labour to attain to all the exactness that so much\n   variety will permit, and give as much variety as will\n   consist with a reasonable exactness. And as this part\n   of our project cannot be carried into execution without\n   the correspondence of the INGENIOUS, we shall take\n   all opportunities of acknowledging our obligations,\n   to those who take the trouble of furnishing any matter\n   which shall tend to entertainment or instruction. Our\n   Intentions to please the _Whole_, without offence to\n   any _Individual_, will be better evinced by our practice,\n   than by writing volumes on the subject. This one thing\n   we beg may be believed, that PARTY PREJUDICE, or\n   PRIVATE SCANDAL, will never find a place in this PAPER.\n\n\n\n\nGOVERNOR CARLETON\n1766-1774\n\nThe twelve years of Carleton's first administration\nnaturally fall into three distinct periods of equal\nlength. During the first he was busily employed settling\nas many difficulties as he could, examining the general\nstate of the country, and gradually growing into the\nchange that was developing in the minds of the home\ngovernment, the change, that is, from the Americanizing\nsixties to the French-Canadian seventies. During the\nsecond period he was in England, helping to shape the\nfamous Quebec Act. During the third he was defending\nCanada from American attack and aiding the British\ncounterstroke by every means in his power.\n\nOn the 22nd of September 1766 Carleton arrived at Quebec\nand began his thirty years' experience as a Canadian\nadministrator by taking over the government from Colonel\nIrving, who had held it since Murray's departure in the\nspring. Irving had succeeded Murray simply because he\nhappened to be the senior officer present at the time.\nCarleton himself was technically Murray's lieutenant till\n1768. But neither of these facts really affected the\ncourse of Canadian history.\n\nThe Council, the magistrates, and the traders each\npresented. the new governor with an address containing\nthe usual professions of loyal devotion. Carleton remarked\nin his dispatch that these separate addresses, and the\nmarked absence of any united address, showed how much\nthe population was divided. He also noted that a good\nmany of the English-speaking minority had objected to\nthe addresses on account of their own opposition to the\nStamp Act, and that there had been some broken heads in\nconsequence. Troubles enough soon engaged his anxious\nattention--troubles over the Indian trade, the rights\nand wrongs of the Canadian Jesuits, the wounded dignity\nof some members of the Council, and the still smouldering\nand ever mysterious Walker affair.\n\nThe strife between Canada and the Thirteen Colonies over\nthe Indian trade of the West remained the same in principle\nas under the old regime. The Conquest had merely changed\nthe old rivalry between two foreign powers into one\nbetween two widely differing British possessions; and\nthis, because of the general unrest among the Americans,\nmade the competition more bitter, if possible, than ever.\n\nThe Jesuits pressed their claims for recognition, for\ntheir original estates, and for compensation. But their\norder had fallen on evil days all over the world. It was\nnot popular even in Canada. And the arrangement was that\nwhile the existing members were to be treated with every\nconsideration the Society itself was to be allowed to\ndie out.\n\nThe offended councillors went so far as to present Carleton\nwith a remonstrance which Irving himself had the misfortune\nto sign. Carleton had consulted some members on points\nwith which they were specially acquainted. The members\nwho had not been consulted thereupon protested to Irving,\nwho assured them that Carleton must have done so by\naccident, not design. But when Carleton received a joint\nletter in which they said, 'As you are pleased to signifye\nto Us by Coll. Irving that it was accident, & not\nIntention,' he at once replied: 'As Lieutenant Colonel\nIrving has signified to you that the Part of my Conduct\nyou think worthy of your Reprehension happened by Accident\nlet him explain his reasons for so doing. He had no\nauthority from me.' Carleton then went on to say that he\nwould consult any 'Men of Good Sense, Truth, Candour,\nand Impartial Justice' whenever he chose, no matter\nwhether they were councillors or not.\n\nThe Walker affair, which now broke out again, was much\nmore serious than the storm in the Council's teacup. It\nagitated the whole of Canada and threatened to range the\npopulation of Montreal and Quebec into two irreconcilable\nfactions, the civil and the military. For the whole of\nthe two years since Murray had been called upon to deal\nwith it cleverly presented versions of Walker's views\nhad been spread all over the colonies and worked into\ninfluential Opposition circles in England. The invectives\nagainst the redcoats and their friends the seigneurs were\nof the usual abusive type. But they had an unusually\npowerful effect at that particular time in the Thirteen\nColonies as well as in what their authors hoped to make\na Fourteenth Colony after a fashion of their own; and\nthey looked plausible enough to mislead a good many\nmoderate men in the mother country too. Walker's case\nwas that he had an actual witness, as to the identity of\nhis assailants, in the person of McGovoch, a discharged\nsoldier, who laid information against one civilian, three\nBritish officers, and the celebrated French-Canadian\nleader, La Corne de St Luc. All the accused were arrested\nin their beds in Montreal and thrown into the common\ngaol. Walker objected to bail on the plea that his life\nwould be in danger if they were allowed at large. He also\nsought to postpone the trial in order to punish the\naccused as much as possible, guilty or innocent. But\nWilliam Hey, the chief justice, an able and upright man,\nwould consent to postponement only on condition that bail\nshould be allowed; so the trial proceeded. When the grand\njury threw out the case against one of the prisoners\nWalker let loose such a flood of virulent abuse that\nmoderate men were turned against him. In the end all the\naccused were honourably acquitted, while McGovoch, who\nwas proved to have been a false witness from the first,\nwas convicted of perjury. Carleton remained absolutely\nimpartial all through, and even dismissed Colonel Irving\nand another member of the Council for heading a petition\non behalf of the military prisoners.\n\nThe Walker affair was an instance of a bad case in which\nthe law at last worked well. But there were many others\nin which it did not. What with the _Coutume de Paris_,\nwhich is still quoted in the province of Quebec; the\nother complexities of the old French law; the doubtful\nmeanings drawn from the capitulation, the treaty, the\nproclamation, and the various ordinances; the instinctive\nopposition between the French Canadians and the\nEnglish-speaking civilians; and, finally, what with the\nportents of subversive change that were already beginning\nto overshadow all America,--what with all this and more,\nCarleton found himself faced with a problem which no man\ncould have solved to the satisfaction of every one\nconcerned. Each side in a lawsuit took whatever amalgam\nof French and English codes was best for its own argument.\nBut, generally speaking, the ingrained feeling of the\nFrench Canadians was against any change of their own laws\nthat was not visibly and immediately beneficial to their\nown particular interests. Moreover, the use of the unknown\nEnglish language, the worthlessness of the rapacious\nEnglish-speaking magistrates, and the detested innovation\nof imprisonment for debt, all combined to make every part\nof English civil law hated simply because it happened to\nbe English and not French. The home authorities were\nanxious to find some workable compromise. In 1767 Carleton\nexchanged several important dispatches with them; and in\n1768 they sent out Maurice Morgan to study and report,\nafter consultation with the chief justice and 'other well\ninstructed persons.' Morgan was an indefatigable and\nclear-sighted man who deserves to be gratefully remembered\nby both races; for he was a good friend both to the French\nCanadians before the Quebec Act and to the United Empire\nLoyalists just before their great migration, when he was\nCarleton's secretary at New York. In 1769 the official\ncorrespondence entered the'secret and confidential'\nstage with a dispatch from the home government to Carleton\nsuggesting a House of Representatives to which, practically\nspeaking, the towns would send Protestant members and\nthe country districts Roman Catholics.\n\nIn 1770 Carleton sailed for England. He carried a good\ndeal of hard-won experience with him, both on this point\nand on many others. He went home with a strong opinion\nnot only against an assembly but against any immediate\nattempts at Anglicization in any form. The royal\ninstructions that had accompanied his commission as\n'Captain-General and Governor-in-chief' in 1768 contained\ndirections for establishing the Church of England with a\nview to converting the whole population to its tenets later\non. But no steps had been taken, and, needless to say, the\nFrench Canadians remained as Roman Catholic as ever.\n\nAn increasingly important question, soon to overshadow\nall others, was defence. In April 1768 Carleton had\nproposed the restoration of the seigneurial militia\nsystem. 'All the Lands here are held of His Majesty's\nCastle of St Lewis [the governor's official residence in\nQuebec]. The Oath which the Vassals [seigneurs] take is\nvery Solemn and Binding. They are obliged to appear in\nArms for the King's defence, in case his Province is\nattacked.' Carleton pointed out that a hundred men of\nthe Canadian seigneurial families were being kept on full\npay in France, ready to return and raise the Canadians\nat the first opportunity. 'On the other hand, there are\nonly about seventy of these officers in Canada who have\nbeen in the French service. Not one of them has been\ngiven a commission in the King's [George's] Service, nor\nis there One who, from any motive whatever, is induced\nto support His Government.' The few French Canadians\nraised for Pontiac's war had of course been properly paid\nduring the continuance of their active service. But they\nhad been disbanded like mere militia afterwards, without\neither gratuities or half-pay for the officers. This\nnaturally made the class from which officers were drawn\nthink that no career was open to them under the Union\nJack and turned their thoughts towards France, where\ntheir fellows were enjoying full pay without a break.\n\nWhat made this the more serious was the weakness of the\nregular garrisons, all of which, put together, numbered\nonly 1,627 men. Carleton calculated that about five\nhundred of 'the King's Old Subjects' were capable of\nbearing arms; though most of them were better at talking\nthan fighting. He had nothing but contempt for 'the flimsy\nwall round Montreal,' and relied little more on the very\ndefective works at Quebec. Thus with all his wonderful\nequanimity, 'grave Carleton' left Canada with no light\nheart when he took six months' leave of absence in 1770;\nand he would have been more anxious still if he could\nhave foreseen that his absence was to be prolonged to no\nless than four years.\n\nHe had, however, two great satisfactions. He was\nrepresented at Quebec by a most steadfast lieutenant,\nthe quiet, alert, discreet, and determined Cramahe; and\nhe was leaving Canada after having given proof of a\ndisinterestedness which was worthy of the elder Pitt\nhimself. When Pitt became Paymaster-General of England\nhe at once declined to use the two chief perquisites of\nhis office, the interest on the government balance and\nthe half per cent commission on foreign subsidies, though\nboth were regarded as a kind of indirect salary. When\nCarleton became governor of Canada he at once issued a\nproclamation abolishing all the fees and perquisites\nattached to his position and explained his action to the\nhome authorities in the following words: 'There is a\ncertain appearance of dirt, a sort of meanness, in exacting\nfees on every occasion. I think it necessary for the\nKing's service that his representative should be thought\nunsullied.' Murray, who had accepted the fees, at first\ntook umbrage. But Carleton soon put matters straight with\nhim. The fact was that fees, and even certain perquisites,\nwere no dishonour to receive, as they nearly always formed\na recognized part, and often the whole, of a perfectly\nlegal salary. But fees and perquisites could be abused;\nand they did lead to misunderstandings, even when they\nwere not abused; while fixed salaries were free from both\nobjections. So Carleton, surrounded by shamelessly\nrapacious magistrates and the whole vile camp-following\ngang, as well as by French Canadians who had suffered\nfrom the robberies of Bigot and his like, decided to\nsacrifice everything but his indispensable fixed salary\nin order that even the most malicious critics could not\nbring any accusation, however false, against the man who\nrepresented Britain and her king.\n\nAn interesting personal interlude, which was not without\nconsiderable effect on Canadian history, took place in\nthe middle of Carleton's four years' stay in England. He\nwas forty-eight and still a bachelor. Tradition whispers\nthat these long years of single life were the result of\na disappointing love affair with Jane Carleton, a pretty\ncousin, when both he and she were young. However that\nmay be, he now proposed to Lady Anne Howard, whose father,\nthe Earl of Effingham, was one of his greatest friends.\nBut he was doomed to a second, though doubtless very\nminor, disappointment. Lady Anne, who probably looked on\n'grave Carleton' as a sort of amiable, middle-aged uncle,\nhad fallen in love with his nephew, whom she presently\nmarried, and with whom she afterwards went out to Canada,\nwhere her husband served under the rejected uncle himself.\nWhat added spice to this peculiar situation was the fact\nthat Carleton actually married the younger sister of the\ntoo-youthful Lady Anne. When Lady Anne rejoined her sister\nand their bosom friend, Miss Seymour, after the\ndisconcerting interview with Carleton, she explained her\ntears by saying they were due to her having been 'obliged\nto refuse the best man on earth.' 'The more fool you!'\nanswered the younger sister, Lady Maria, then just\neighteen, 'I only wish he had given me the chance!' There,\nfor the time, the matter ended. Carleton went back to\nhis official duties in furtherance of the Quebec Act.\nHis nephew and the elder sister made mutual love. Lady\nMaria held her tongue. But Miss Seymour had not forgotten;\nand one day she mustered up courage to tell Carleton the\nstory of 'the more fool you!' This decided him to act at\nonce. He proposed; was accepted; and lived happily married\nfor the rest of his long life. Lady Maria was small,\nfair-haired, and blue-eyed, which heightened her girlish\nappearance when, like Madame de Champlain, she came out\nto Canada with a husband more than old enough to be her\nfather. But she had been brought up at Versailles. She\nknew all the aristocratic graces of the old regime. And\nher slight, upright figure--erect as any soldier's to\nher dying day--almost matched her husband's stalwart form\nin dignity of carriage.\n\nThe Quebec Act of 1774--the Magna Charta of the\nFrench-Canadian race--finally passed the House of Lords\non the 18th of June. The general idea of the Act was to\nreverse the unsuccessful policy of ultimate assimilation\nwith the other American colonies by making Canada a\ndistinctly French-Canadian province. The Maritime Provinces,\nwith a population of some thirty thousand, were to be as\nEnglish as they chose. But a greatly enlarged Quebec,\nwith a population of ninety thousand, and stretching far\ninto the unsettled West, was to remain equally\nFrench-Canadian; though the rights of what it was then\nthought would be a perpetual English-speaking minority\nwere to be safeguarded in every reasonable way. The whole\ncountry between the American colonies and the domains of\nthe Hudson's Bay Company was included in this new Quebec,\nwhich comprised the southern half of what is now the\nNewfoundland Labrador, practically the whole of the modern\nprovinces of Quebec and Ontario, and all the western\nlands between the Ohio and the Great Lakes as far as the\nMississippi, that is, the modern American states of Ohio,\nIndiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin.\n\nThe Act gave Canada the English criminal code. It recognized\nmost of the French civil law, including the seigneurial\ntenure of land. Roman Catholics were given 'the free\nExercise' of their religion,'subject to the King's\nSupremacy' as defined 'by an Act made in the First Year\nof Queen Elizabeth,' which Act, with a magnificently\nprophetic outlook on the future British Empire, was to\napply to 'all the Dominions and Countries which then did,\nor thereafter should, belong to the Imperial Crown.' The\nRoman Catholic clergy were authorized to collect 'their\naccustomed Dues and Rights' from members of their own\ncommunion. The new oath of allegiance to the Crown was\nsilent about differences of religion, so that Roman\nCatholics might take it without question. The clergy and\nseigneurs were thus restored to an acknowledged leadership\nin church and state. Those who wanted a parliament were\ndistinctly told that 'It is at present inexpedient to\ncall an Assembly,' and that a Council of from seventeen\nto twenty-three members, all appointed by the Crown,\nwould attend to local government and have power to levy\ntaxes for roads and public buildings only. Lands held\n'in free and common socage' were to be dealt with by the\nlaws of England, as was all property which could be freely\nwilled away. A possible establishment of the Church of\nEngland was provided for but never put in operation.\n\nIn some ways the Act did, in other ways it did not, fulfil\nthe objects of its framers. It was undoubtedly a generous\nconcession to the leading French Canadians. It did help\nto keep Canada both British and Canadian. And it did open\nthe way for what ought to have been a crushing attack on\nthe American revolutionary forces. But it was not, and\nneither it nor any other Act could possibly have been,\nat that late hour, completely successful. It conciliated\nthe seigneurs and the parochial clergy. But it did not,\nand it could not, also conciliate the lesser townsfolk\nand the habitants. For the last fourteen years the\nhabitants had been gradually drifting away from their\nformer habits of obedience and former obligations towards\ntheir leaders in church and state. The leaders had lost\ntheir old followers. The followers had found no new\nleaders of their own.\n\nNaturally enough, there was great satisfaction among the\nseigneurs and the clergy, with a general feeling among\ngovernment supporters, both in England and Canada, that\nthe best solution of a very refractory problem had been\nfound at last. On the other hand, the Opposition in\nEngland, nearly every one in the American colonies, and\nthe great majority of English-speaking people in\nNewfoundland, the Maritime Provinces, and Canada itself\nwere dead against the Act; while the habitants, resenting\nthe privileges already reaffirmed in favour of the\nseigneurs and clergy, and suspicious of further changes\nin the same unwelcome direction, were neutral at the best\nand hostile at the worst.\n\nThe American colonists would have been angered in any\ncase. But when they saw Canada proper made as unlike a\n'fourteenth colony' as could be, and when they also saw\nthe gates of the coveted western lands closed against\nthem by the same detested Act--the last of the 'five\nintolerable acts' to which they most objected--their fury\nknew no bounds. They cursed the king, the pope, and the\nFrench Canadians with as much violence as any temporal\nor spiritual rulers had ever cursed heretics and rebels.\nThe 'infamous and tyrannical ministry' in England was\naccused of 'contemptible subservience' to the 'bloodthirsty,\nidolatrous, and hypocritical creed' of the French Canadians.\nTo think that people whose religion had spread'murder,\npersecution, and revolt throughout the world' were to be\nentrenched along the St Lawrence was bad enough. But to\nsee Crown protection given to the Indian lands which the\nAmericans considered their own western 'birthright' was\ninfinitely worse. Was the king of England to steal the\nvalley of the Mississippi in the same way as the king of\nFrance?\n\nIt is easy to be wise after the event and hard to follow\nany counsel of perfection. But it must always be a subject\nof keen, if unavailing, regret that the French Canadians\nwere not guaranteed their own way of life, within the\nlimits of the modern province of Quebec, immediately\nafter the capitulation of Montreal in 1760. They would\nthen have entered the British Empire, as a whole people,\non terms which they must all have understood to be\nexceedingly generous from any conquering power, and which\nthey would have soon found out to be far better than\nanything they had experienced under the government of\nFrance. In return for such unexampled generosity they\nmight have become convinced defenders of the only flag\nin the world under which they could possibly live as\nFrench Canadians. Their relations to each other, to the\nrest of a changing Canada, and to the Empire would have\nfollowed the natural course of political evolution, with\nthe burning questions of language, laws, and religion\nsafely removed from general controversy in after years.\nThe rights of the English-speaking minority could, of\ncourse, have been still better safeguarded under this\nsystem than under the distracting series of half-measures\nwhich took its place. There should have been no question\nof a parliament in the immediate future. Then, with the\npeopling of Ontario by the United Empire Loyalists and\nthe growth of the Maritime Provinces on the other side,\nQuebec could have entered Carleton's proposed Confederation\nin the nineties to her own and every one else's best\nadvantage.\n\nOn the other hand, the delay of fourteen years after the\nCapitulation of 1760 and the unwarrantable extension of\nthe provincial boundaries were cardinal errors of the\nmost disastrous kind. The delay, filled with a futile\nattempt at mistaken Americanization, bred doubts and\ndissensions not only between the two races but between\nthe different kinds of French Canadians. When the hour\nof trial came disintegration had already gone too far.\nThe mistake about the boundaries was equally bad. The\nwestern wilds ought to have been administered by a\nlieutenant-governor under the supervision of a\ngovernor-general. Even leasing them for a short term of\nyears to the Hudson's Bay Company would have been better\nthan annexing them to a preposterous province of Quebec.\nThe American colonists would have doubtless objected to\neither alternative. But both could have been defended on\nsound principles of administration; while the sudden\ninvasion of a new and inflated Quebec into the colonial\nhinterlands was little less than a declaration of war.\nThe whole problem bristled with enormous difficulties,\nand the circumstances under which it had to be faced made\nan ideal solution impossible. But an earlier Quebec Act,\nwithout its outrageous boundary clause, would have been\nwell worth the risk of passing; for the delay led many\nFrench Canadians to suppose, however falsely, that the\nEmpire's need might always be their opportunity; and this\nidea, however repugnant to their best minds and better\nfeelings, has persisted among their extreme particularists\nuntil the present day.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nINVASION\n1775\n\nCarleton's first eight years as governor of Canada were\nalmost entirely occupied with civil administration. The\nnext four were equally occupied with war; so much so,\nindeed, that the Quebec Act could not be put in force on\nthe 1st of May 1775, as provided for in the Act itself,\nbut only bit by bit much later on. There was one short\nsession of the new Legislative Council, which opened on\nthe 17th of August. But all men's minds were even then\nturned towards the Montreal frontier, whence the American\ninvasion threatened to overspread the whole country and\nmake this opening session the last that might ever be\nheld. Most of the members were soon called away from the\ncouncil-chamber to the field. No further session could\nbe held either that year or the next; and Carleton was\nobliged to nominate the judges himself. The fifteen years\nof peace were over, and Canada had once more become an\nobject of contention between two fiercely hostile forces.\n\nThe War of the American Revolution was a long and\nexceedingly complicated struggle; and its many varied\nfortunes naturally had a profound effect on those of\nCanada. But Canada was directly engaged in no more than\nthe first three campaigns, when the Americans invaded\nher in 1775 and '76, and when the British used her as\nthe base from which to invade the new American Republic\nin 1777. These first three campaigns formed a purely\ncivil war within the British Empire. On each side stood\nthree parties. Opponents were ranged against each other\nin the mother country, in the Thirteen Colonies, and in\nCanada. In the mother country the king and his party\ngovernment were ranged against the Opposition and all\nwho held radical or revolutionary views. Here the strife\nwas merely political. But in the Thirteen Colonies the\nforces of the Crown were ranged against the forces of\nthe new Continental Congress. The small minority of\ncolonists who were afterwards known as the United Empire\nLoyalists sided with the Crown. A majority sided with\nthe Congress. The rest kept as selfishly neutral as they\ncould. Among the English-speaking civilians in Canada,\nmany of whom were now of a much better class than the\noriginal camp-followers, the active loyalists comprised\nonly the smaller half. The larger half sided with the\nAmericans, as was only natural, seeing that most of them\nwere immigrants from the Thirteen Colonies. But by no\nmeans all these sympathizers were ready for a fight.\nAmong the French Canadians the loyalists included very\nfew besides the seigneurs, the clergy, and a handful of\neducated people in Montreal, Three Rivers, and Quebec.\nThe mass of the habitants were more or less neutral. But\nmany of them were anti-British at first, while most of\nthem were anti-American afterwards.\n\nEvents moved quickly in 1775. On the 19th of April the\n'shot heard round the world' was fired at Lexington in\nMassachusetts. On the 1st of May, the day appointed for\nthe inauguration of the Quebec Act, the statue of the\nking in Montreal was grossly defaced and hung with a\ncross, a necklace of potatoes, and a placard bearing the\ninscription, _Here's the Canadian Pope and English\nFool--Voila le Pape du Canada et le sot Anglais_. Large\nrewards were offered for the detection of the culprits;\nbut without avail. Excitement ran high and many an argument\nended with a bloody nose.\n\nMeanwhile three Americans were plotting an attack along\nthe old line of Lake Champlain. Two of them were outlaws\nfrom the colony of New York, which was then disputing\nwith the neighbouring colony of New Hampshire the possession\nof the lawless region in which all three had taken refuge\nand which afterwards became Vermont. Ethan Allen, the\ngigantic leader of the wild Green Mountain Boys, had a\nprice on his head. Seth Warner, his assistant, was an\noutlaw of a somewhat humbler kind. Benedict Arnold, the\nthird invader, came from Connecticut. He was a horse-dealer\ncarrying on business with Quebec and Montreal as well as\nthe West Indies. He was just thirty-four; an excellent\nrider, a dead shot, a very fair sailor, and captain of\na crack militia company. Immediately after the affair at\nLexington he had turned out his company, reinforced by\nundergraduates from Yale, had seized the New Haven powder\nmagazine and marched over to Cambridge, where the\nMassachusetts Committeemen took such a fancy to him that\nthey made him a colonel on the spot, with full authority\nto raise men for an immediate attack on Ticonderoga. The\nopportunity seemed too good to be lost; though the\nContinental Congress was not then in favour of attacking\nCanada, as its members hoped to see the Canadians throw\noff the yoke of empire on their own account. The British\nposts on Lake Champlain were absurdly undermanned.\nTiconderoga contained two hundred cannon, but only forty\nmen, none of whom expected an attack. Crown Point had\nonly a sergeant and a dozen men to watch its hundred and\nthirteen pieces. Fort George, at the head of Lake George,\nwas no better off; and nothing more had been done to man\nthe fortifications at St Johns on the Richelieu, where\nthere was an excellent sloop as well as many cannon in\ncharge of the usual sergeant's guard. This want of\npreparation was no fault of Carleton's. He had frequently\nreported home on the need of more men. Now he had less\nthan a thousand regulars to defend the whole country:\nand not another man was to arrive till the spring of next\nyear. When Gage was hard pressed for reinforcements at\nBoston in the autumn of 1774 Carleton had immediately\nsent him two excellent battalions that could ill be spared\nfrom Canada. But when Carleton himself made a similar\nrequest, in the autumn of 1775, Admiral Graves, to his\nlasting dishonour, refused to sail up to Quebec so late\nas October.\n\nThe first moves of the three Americans smacked strongly\nof a well-staged extravaganza in which the smart Yankees\nnever failed to score off the dunderheaded British. The\nGreen Mountain Boys assembled on the east side of the\nlake. Spies walked in and out of Ticonderoga, exactly\nopposite, and reported to Ethan Allen that the commandant\nand his whole garrison of forty unsuspecting men would\nmake an easy prey. Allen then sent eighty men down to\nSkenesborough (now Whitehall) at the southern end of the\nlake, to take the tiny post there and bring back boats\nfor the crossing on the 10th of May. Then Arnold turned\nup with his colonel's commission, but without the four\nhundred men it authorized him to raise. Allen, however,\nhad made himself a colonel too, with Warner as his\nsecond-in-command. So there were no less than three\ncolonels for two hundred and thirty men. Arnold claimed\nthe command by virtue of his Massachusetts commission.\nBut the Green Mountain Boys declared they would follow\nno colonels but their own; and so Arnold, after being\nthreatened with arrest, was appointed something like\nchief of the staff, on the understanding that he would\nmake himself generally useful with the boats. This\nappointment was made at dawn on the 10th of May, just as\nthe first eighty men were advancing to the attack after\ncrossing over under cover of night. The British sentry's\nmusket missed fire; whereupon he and the guard were\nrushed, while the rest of the garrison were surprised in\ntheir beds. Ethan Allen, who knew the fort thoroughly,\nhammered on the commandant's door and summoned him to\nsurrender 'In the name of the Great Jehovah and the\nContinental Congress!' The astonished commandant, seeing\nthat resistance was impossible, put on his dressing-gown\nand paraded his disarmed garrison as prisoners of war.\nSeth Warner presently arrived with the rest of Allen's\nmen and soon became the hero of Crown Point, which he\ntook with the whole of its thirteen men and a hundred\nand thirteen cannon. Then Arnold had his own turn, in\ncommand of an expedition against the sergeant's guard,\ncannon, stores, fort, and sloop at St Johns on the\nRichelieu, all of which he captured in the same absurdly\nsimple way. When he came sailing back the three victorious\ncommanders paraded all their men and fired off many\nstraggling fusillades of joy. In the meantime the\nContinental Congress at Philadelphia, with a delightful\ntouch of unconscious humour, was gravely debating the\nfollowing resolution, which was passed on the 1st of\nJune: _That no Expedition or Incursion ought to be\nundertaken or made, by any Colony or body of Colonists,\nagainst or into Canada_.\n\nThe same Congress, however, found reasons enough for\nchanging its mind before the month of May was out. The\nBritish forces in Canada had already begun to move towards\nthe threatened frontier. They had occupied and strengthened\nSt Johns. And the Americans were beginning to fear lest\nthe command of Lake Champlain might again fall into\nBritish hands. On the 27th of May the Congress closed\nthe phase of individual raids and inaugurated the phase\nof regular invasion by commissioning General Schuyler to\n'pursue any measures in Canada that may have a tendency\nto promote the peace and security of these Colonies.'\nPhilip Schuyler was a distinguished member of the family\nwhose head had formulated the 'Glorious Enterprize' of\nconquering New France in 1689. [Footnote: See, in this\nSeries, _The Fighting Governor_.] So it was quite in line\nwith the family tradition for him to be under orders to\n'take possession of St Johns, Montreal, and any other\nparts of the country,' provided always, adds the cautious\nCongress, that 'General Schuyler finds it practicable,\nand that it will not be disagreeable to the Canadians.'\n\nA few days later Arnold was trying to get a colonelcy\nfrom the Convention of New York, whose members just then\nhappened to be thinking of giving commissions to his\nrivals, the leaders of the Green Mountain Boys, while,\nto make the complication quite complete, these Boys\nthemselves had every intention of electing officers on\ntheir own account. In the meantime Connecticut, determined\nnot to be forestalled by either friend or foe, ordered\na thousand men to Ticonderoga and commissioned a general\ncalled Wooster to command them. Thus early were sown the\nseeds of those dissensions between Congress troops and\nColony troops which nearly drove Washington mad.\n\nSchuyler reached Ticonderoga in mid-July and assumed his\nposition as Congressional commander-in-chief. Unfortunately\nfor the good of the service he had only a few hundred\nmen with him; so Wooster, who had a thousand, thought\nhimself the bigger general of the two. The Connecticut\nmen followed Wooster's lead by jeering at Schuyler's men\nfrom New York; while the Vermonters added to the confusion\nby electing Seth Warner instead of Ethan Allen. In\nmid-August a second Congressional general arrived, making\nthree generals and half a dozen colonels for less than\nfifteen hundred troops. This third general was Richard\nMontgomery, an ardent rebel of thirty-eight, who had been\na captain in the British Army. He had sold his commission,\nbought an estate on the Hudson, and married a daughter\nof the Livingstons. The Livingstons headed the\nAnglo-American revolutionists in the colony of New York\nas the Schuylers headed the Knickerbocker Dutch. One of\nthem was very active on the rebel side in Montreal and\nwas soon to take the field at the head of the American\n'patriots' in Canada. Montgomery was brother to the\nCaptain Montgomery of the 43rd who was the only British\nofficer to disgrace himself during Wolfe's Quebec campaign,\nwhich he did by murdering his French-Canadian prisoners\nat Chateau Richer because they had fought disguised as\nIndians. [Footnote: See _The Passing of New France_, p.\n118.] Richard Montgomery was a much better man than his\nsavage brother; though, as the sequel proves, he was by\nno means the perfect hero his American admirers would\nhave the world believe. His great value at Ticonderoga\nwas his professional knowledge and his ardour in the\ncause he had espoused. His presence 'changed the spirit\nof the camp.' It sadly needed change. 'Such a set of\npusillanimous wretches never were collected' is his own\ndescription in a despairing letter to his wife. The\n'army,' in fact, was all parts and no whole, and all the\nparts were mere untrained militia. Moreover, the spirit\nof the 'town meeting' ruled the camp. Even a battery\ncould not be moved without consulting a council of war.\nSchuyler, though far more phlegmatic than Montgomery,\nagreed with him heartily about this and many other\nexasperating points. 'If Job had been a general in my\nsituation, his memory had not been so famous for patience.'\n\nWorn out by his worries, Schuyler fell ill and was sent\nto command the base at Albany. Montgomery then succeeded\nto the command of the force destined for the front. The\nplan of invasion approved by Washington was, first, to\nsweep the line of the Richelieu by taking St Johns and\nChambly, then to take Montreal, next to secure the line\nof the St Lawrence, and finally to besiege Quebec.\nMontgomery's forces were to carry out all the preliminary\nparts alone. But Arnold was to join him at Quebec after\nadvancing across country from the Kennebec to the Chaudiere\nwith a flying column of Virginians and New Englanders.\n\nCarleton opened the melancholy little session of the new\nLegislative Council at Quebec on the very day Montgomery\narrived at Ticonderoga--the 17th of August. When he closed\nit, to take up the defence of Canada, the prospect was\nalready black enough, though it grew blacker still as\ntime went on. Immediately on hearing the news of\nTiconderoga, Crown Point, and St Johns at the end of May\nhe had sent every available man from Quebec to Montreal,\nwhence Colonel Templer had already sent off a hundred\nand forty men to St Johns, while calling for volunteers\nto follow. The seigneurial class came forward at once.\nBut all attempts to turn out the militia en masse_ proved\nutterly futile. Fourteen years of kindly British rule\nhad loosened the old French bonds of government and the\nhabitants were no longer united as part of one people\nwith the seigneurs and the clergy. The rebels had been\nbusy spreading insidious perversions of the belated Quebec\nAct, poisoning the minds of the habitants against the\nBritish government, and filling their imaginations with\nall sorts of terrifying doubts. The habitants were\nignorant, credulous, and suspicious to the last degree.\nThe most absurd stories obtained ready credence and ran\nlike wildfire through the province. Seven thousand Russians\nwere said to be coming up the St Lawrence--whether as\nfriends or foes mattered nothing compared with the awful\nfact that they were all outlandish bogeys. Carleton was\nsaid to have a plan for burning alive every habitant he\ncould lay his hands on. Montgomery's thousand were said\nto be five thousand, with many more to follow. And later\non, when Arnold's men came up the Kennebec, it was\nsatisfactorily explained to most of the habitants that\nit was no good resisting dead-shot riflemen who were\nbullet-proof themselves. Carleton issued proclamations.\nThe seigneurs waved their swords. The clergy thundered\nfrom their pulpits. But all in vain. Two months after\nthe American exploits on Lake Champlain Carleton gave a\nguinea to the sentry mounted in his honour by the local\nmilitia colonel, M. de Tonnancour, because this man was\nthe first genuine habitant he had yet seen armed in the\nwhole district of Three Rivers. What must Carleton have\nfelt when the home government authorized him to raise\nsix thousand of His Majesty's loyal French-Canadian\nsubjects for immediate service and informed him that the\narms and equipment for the first three thousand were\nalready on the way to Canada! Seven years earlier it\nmight still have been possible to raise French-Canadian\ncounterparts of those Highland regiments which Wolfe had\nrecommended and Pitt had so cordially approved. Carleton\nhimself had recommended this excellent scheme at the\nproper time. But, though the home government even then\nagreed with him, they thought such a measure would raise\nmore parliamentary and public clamour than they could\nsafely face. The chance once lost was lost for ever.\n\nCarleton had done what he could to keep the enemy at\narm's length from Montreal by putting every available\nman into Chambly and St Johns. He knew nothing of Arnold's\nforce till it actually reached Quebec in November. Quebec\nwas thought secure for the time being, and so was left\nwith a handful of men under Cramahe. Montreal had a few\nregulars and a hundred 'Royal Emigrants,' mostly old\nHighlanders who had settled along the New York frontier\nafter the Conquest. For the rest, it had many American\nand a few British sympathizers ready to fly at each\nothers' throats and a good many neutrals ready to curry\nfavour with the winners. Sorel was a mere post without\nany effective garrison. Chambly was held by only eighty\nmen under Major Stopford. But its strong stone fort was\nwell armed and quite proof against anything except siege\nartillery; while its little garrison consisted of good\nregulars who were well provisioned for a siege. The mass\nof Carleton's little force was at St Johns under Major\nPreston, who had 500 men of the 7th and 26th (Royal\nFusiliers and Cameronians), 80 gunners, and 120 volunteers,\nmostly French-Canadian gentlemen. Preston was an excellent\nofficer, and his seven hundred men were able to give a\nvery good account of themselves as soldiers. But the fort\nwas not nearly so strong as the one at Chambly; it had\nno natural advantages of position; and it was short of\nboth stores and provisions.\n\nThe three successive steps for Montgomery to take were\nSt Johns, Chambly, and Montreal. But the natural order\nof events was completely upset by that headstrong Yankee,\nEthan Allen, who would have his private war at Montreal,\nand by that contemptible British officer, Major Stopford,\nwho would not defend Chambly. Montgomery laid siege to\nSt Johns on the 18th of September, but made no substantial\nprogress for more than a month. He probably had no use\nfor Allen at anything like a regular siege. So Allen and\na Major Brown went on to 'preach politicks' and concert\na rising with men like Livingston and Walker. Livingston,\nas we have seen already, belonged to a leading New York\nfamily which was very active in the rebel cause; and\nLivingston, Walker, Allen, and Brown would have made a\ndangerous anti-British combination if they could only\nhave worked together. But they could not. Livingston\nhurried off to join Montgomery with four hundred 'patriots'\nwho served their cause fairly well till the invasion was\nover. Walker had no military qualities whatever. So Allen\nand Brown were left to their own disunited devices.\nMontreal seemed an easy prey. It had plenty of rebel\nsympathizers. Nearly all the surrounding habitants were\neither neutrals or inclined to side with the Americans,\nthough not as fighting men. Carleton's order to bring in\nall the ladders, so as to prevent an escalade of the\nwalls, had met with general opposition and evasion.\nNothing seemed wanting but a good working plan.\n\nBrown, or possibly Allen himself, then hit upon the idea\nof treating Montreal very much as Allen had treated\nTiconderoga. In any case Allen jumped at it. He jumped\nso far, indeed, that he forestalled Brown, who failed to\nappear at the critical moment. Thus, on the 24th of\nSeptember, Allen found himself alone at Long Point with\na hundred and twenty men in face of three times as many\nunder the redoubtable Major Carden, a skilled veteran\nwho had won Wolfe's admiration years before. Carden's\nforce included thirty regulars, two hundred and forty\nmilitiamen, and some Indians, probably not over a hundred\nstrong. The militia were mostly of the seigneurial class\nwith a following of habitants and townsmen of both French\nand British blood. Carden broke Allen's flanks rounded\nup his centre, and won the little action easily, though\nat the expense of his own most useful life. Allen was\nvery indignant at being handcuffed and marched off like\na common prisoner after having made himself a colonel\ntwice over. But Carleton had no respect for\nself-commissioned officers and had no soldiers to spare\nfor guarding dangerous rebels. So he shipped Allen off\nto England, where that eccentric warrior was confined in\nPendennis Castle near Falmouth in Cornwall.\n\nThis affair, small as it was, revived British hopes in\nMontreal and induced a few more militiamen and Indians\nto come forward. But within a month more was lost at\nChambly than had been gained at Montreal. On the 18th of\nOctober a small American detachment attacked Chambly with\ntwo little field-guns and induced it to surrender on the\n20th. If ever an officer deserved to be shot it was Major\nStopford, who tamely surrendered his well-armed and\nwell-provided fort to an insignificant force, after a\nflimsy resistance of only thirty-six hours, without even\ntaking the trouble to throw his stores into the river\nthat flowed beside his strong stone walls. The news of\nthis disgraceful surrender, diligently spread by rebel\nsympathizers, frightened the Indians away from St Johns,\nthus depriving Major Preston, the commandant, of his best\ncouriers at the very worst time. But the evil did not\nstop there; for nearly all the few French-Canadian\nmilitiamen whom the more distant seigneurs had been able\nto get under arms deserted _en masse_, with many threats\nagainst any one who should try to turn them out again.\n\nChambly is only a short day's march from Montreal to the\nwest and St Johns to the south; so its capture meant that\nSt Johns was entirely cut off from the Richelieu to the\nnorth and dangerously exposed to being cut off from\nMontreal as well. Its ample stores and munitions of war\nwere a priceless boon to Montgomery, who now redoubled\nhis efforts to take St Johns. But Preston held out bravely\nfor the remainder of the month, while Carleton did his\nbest to help him. A fortnight earlier Carleton had arrested\nthat firebrand, Walker, who had previously refused to\nleave the country, though Carleton had given him the\nchance of doing so. Mrs Walker, as much a rebel as her\nhusband, interviewed Carleton and noted in her diary that\nhe'said many severe Things in very soft & Polite Termes.'\nCarleton was firm. Walker's actions, words, and\ncorrespondence all proved him a dangerous rebel whom no\ngovernor could possibly leave at large without breaking\nhis oath of office. Walker, who had himself caused so\nmany outrageous arrests, now not only resisted the legal\narrest of his own person, but fired on the little party\nof soldiers who had been sent to bring him into Montreal.\nThe soldiers then began to burn him out; whereupon he\ncarried his wife to a window from which the soldiers\nrescued her. He then surrendered and was brought into\nMontreal, where the sight of him as a prisoner made a\nconsiderable impression on the waverers.\n\nA few hundred neighbouring militiamen were scraped\ntogether. Every one of the handful of regulars who could\nbe spared was turned out. And Carleton set off to the\nrelief of St Johns. But Seth Warner's Green Mountain\nBoys, reinforced by many more sharpshooters, prevented\nCarleton from landing at Longueuil, opposite Montreal.\nThe remaining Indians began to slink away. The\nFrench-Canadian militiamen deserted fast--'thirty or\nforty of a night.' There were not two hundred regulars\navailable for a march across country. And on the 30th\nCarleton was forced to give up in despair. Within the\nweek St Johns surrendered with 688 men, who were taken\nsouth as prisoners of war. Preston had been completely\ncut off and threatened with starvation as well. So when\nhe destroyed everything likely to be needed by the enemy\nhe had done all that could be expected of a brave and\ncapable commander.\n\nIt was the 3rd of November when St Johns surrendered.\nTen days later Montgomery occupied Montreal and Arnold\nlanded at Wolfe's Cove just above Quebec. The race for\nthe possession of Quebec had been a very close one. The\nrace for the capture of Carleton was to be closer still.\nAnd on the fate of either depended the immediate, and\nperhaps the ultimate, fate of Canada.\n\nThe race for Quebec had been none the less desperate\nbecause the British had not known of the danger from the\nsouth till after Arnold had suddenly emerged from the\nwilds of Maine and was well on his way to the mouth of\nthe Chaudiere, which falls into the St Lawrence seven\nmiles above the city. Arnold's subsequent change of sides\nearned him the execration of the Americans. But there\ncan be no doubt whatever that if he had got through in\ntime to capture Quebec he would have become a national\nhero of the United States. He had the advantage of leading\npicked men; though nearly three hundred faint-hearts did\nturn back half-way. But, even with picked men, his feat\nwas one of surpassing excellence. His force went in eleven\nhundred strong. It came out, reduced by desertion as well\nas by almost incredible hardships, with barely seven\nhundred. It began its toilsome ascent of the Kennebec\ntowards the end of September, carrying six weeks' supplies\nin the bad, hastily built boats or on the men's backs.\nDaniel Morgan and his Virginian riflemen led the way.\nAaron Burr was present as a young volunteer. The portages\nwere many and trying. The settlements were few at first\nand then wanting altogether. Early in October the drenched\nportagers were already sleeping in their frozen clothes.\nThe boats began to break up. Quantities of provisions\nwere lost. Soon there was scarcely anything left but\nflour and salt pork. It took nearly a fortnight to get\npast the Great Carrying Place, in sight of Mount Bigelow.\nRock, bog, and freezing slime told on the men, some of\nwhom began to fall sick. Then came the chain of ponds\nleading into Dead River. Then the last climb up to the\nheight-of-land beyond which lay the headwaters of the\nChaudiere, which takes its rise in Lake Megantic.\n\nThere were sixty miles to go beyond the lake, and a badly\nbroken sixty miles they were, before the first settlement\nof French Canadians could be reached. There was no trail.\nProvisions were almost at an end. Sickness increased.\nThe sick began to die. 'And what was it all for? A chance\nto get killed! The end of the march was Quebec\n--impregnable!' On the 24th of October Arnold, with\nfifteen other men, began 'a race against time, a race\nagainst starvation' by pushing on ahead in a desperate\neffort to find food. Within a week he had reached the\nfirst settlement, after losing three of his five boats\nwith everything in them. Three days later, and not one\nday too soon, the French Canadians met his seven hundred\nfamishing men with a drove of cattle and plenty of\nprovisions. The rest of the way was toilsome enough. But\nit seemed easy by comparison. The habitants were friendly,\nbut very shy about enlisting, in spite of Washington's\ninvitation to 'range yourselves under the standard of\ngeneral liberty.' The Indians were more responsive, and\nnearly fifty joined on their own terms. By the 8th of\nNovember Arnold was marching down the south shore of the\nSt Lawrence, from the Chaudiere to Point Levis, in full\nview of Quebec. He had just received a dispatch ten days\nold from Montgomery by which he learned that St Johns\nwas expected to fall immediately and that Schuyler was\nno longer with the army at the front. But he could not\ntell when the junction of forces would be made; and he\nsaw at once that Quebec was on the alert because every\nboat had been either destroyed or taken over to the other\nside.\n\nThe spring and summer had been anxious times enough in\nQuebec. But the autumn was a great deal worse. Bad news\nkept coming down from Montreal. The disaffected got more\nand more restless and began 'to act as though no opposition\nmight be shown the rebel forces.' And in October it did\nseem as if nothing could be done to stop the invaders.\nThere were only a few hundred militiamen that could be\ndepended on. The regulars, under Colonel Maclean, had\ngone up to help Carleton on the Montreal frontier. The\nfortifications were in no state to stand a siege. But\nCramahe was full of steadfast energy. He had mustered\nthe French-Canadian militia on September 11, the very\nday Arnold was leaving Cambridge in Massachusetts for\nhis daring march against Quebec. These men had answered\nthe call far better in the city of Quebec than anywhere\nelse. There was also a larger proportion of English-speaking\nloyalists here than in Montreal. But no transports brought\ntroops up the St Lawrence from Boston or the mother\ncountry, and no vessel brought Carleton down. The loyalists\nwere, however, encouraged by the presence of two small\nmen-of-war, one of which, the _Hunter_, had been the\nguide-ship for Wolfe's boat the night before the Battle\nof the Plains. Some minor reinforcements also kept\narriving: veterans from the border settlements and a\nhundred and fifty men from Newfoundland. On the 3rd of\nNovember, the day St Johns surrendered to Montgomery, an\nintercepted dispatch had warned Cramahe of Arnold's\napproach and led him to seize all the boats on the south\nshore opposite Quebec. This was by no means his first\nprecaution. He had sent some men forty miles up the\nChaudiere as soon as the news of the raids on Lake\nChamplain and St Johns had arrived at the end of May.\nThus, though neither of them had anticipated such a bolt\nfrom the blue, both Carleton and Cramahe had taken all\nthe reasonable means within their most restricted power\nto provide against unforeseen contingencies.\n\nArnold's chance of surprising Quebec had been lost ten\ndays before he was able to cross the St Lawrence; and\nwhen the habitants on the south shore were helping his\nmen to make scaling-ladders the British garrison on the\nnorth had already become too strong for him. But he was\nindefatigable in collecting boats and canoes at the mouth\nof the Chaudiere, and at other points higher up than\nCramahe's men had reached when on their mission of\ndestruction or removal, and he was as capable as ever\nwhen, on the pitch-black night of the 13th, he led his\nlittle flotilla through the gap between the two British\nmen-of-war, the _Hunter_ and the _Lizard_. The next day\nhe marched across the Plains of Abraham and saluted Quebec\nwith three cheers. But meanwhile Colonel Maclean, who\nhad set out to help Carleton at Montreal and turned back\non hearing the news of St Johns, had slipped into Quebec\non the 12th. So Arnold found himself with less than seven\nhundred effectives against the eleven hundred British\nwho were now behind the walls. After vainly summoning\nthe city to surrender he retired to Pointe-aux-Trembles,\nmore than twenty miles up the north shore of the St\nLawrence, there to await the arrival of the victorious\nMontgomery.\n\nMeanwhile Montgomery was racing for Carleton and Carleton\nwas racing for Quebec. Montgomery's advance-guard had\nhurried on to Sorel, at the mouth of the Richelieu,\nforty-five miles below Montreal, to mount guns that would\ncommand the narrow channel through which the fugitive\ngovernor would have to pass on his way to Quebec. They\nhad ample time to set the trap; for an incessant nor'-easter\nblew up the St Lawrence day after day and held Carleton\nfast in Montreal, while, only a league away, Montgomery's\nmain body was preparing to cross over. Escape by land\nwas impossible, as the Americans held Berthier, on the\nnorth shore, and had won over the habitants, all the way\ndown from Montreal, on both sides of the river. At last,\non the afternoon of the 11th, the wind shifted. Immediately\na single cannon-shot was fired, a bugle sounded the _fall\nin!_ and 'the whole military establishment' of Montreal\nformed up in the barrack square--one hundred and thirty\nofficers and men, all told. Carleton, 'wrung to the soul,'\nas one of his officers wrote home, came on parade 'firm,\nunshaken, and serene.' The little column then marched\ndown to the boats through shuttered streets of timid\nneutrals and scowling rebels. The few loyalists who came\nto say good-bye to Carleton at the wharf might well have\nthought it was the last handshake they would ever get\nfrom a British 'Captain-General and Governor-in-chief'\nas they saw him step aboard in the dreary dusk of that\nNovember afternoon. And if he and they had known the\nworst they might well have thought their fate was sealed;\nfor neither of them then knew that both sides of the St\nLawrence were occupied in force at two different places\non the perilous way to Quebec.\n\nThe little flotilla of eleven vessels got safely down to\nwithin a few miles of Sorel, when one grounded and delayed\nthe rest till the wind failed altogether at noon on the\n12th. The next three days it blew upstream without a\nbreak. No progress could be made as there was no room to\ntack in the narrow passages opposite Sorel. On the third\nday an American floating battery suddenly appeared, firing\nhard. Behind it came a boat with a flag of truce and the\nfollowing summons from Colonel Easton, who commanded\nMontgomery's advance-guard at Sorel:\n\n   SIR,--By this you will learn that General Montgomery\n   is in Possession of the Fortress Montreal. You are\n   very sensible that I am in Possession at this Place,\n   and that, from the strength of the United Colonies on\n   both sides your own situation is Rendered Very\n   disagreeable. I am therefore induced to make you the\n   following Proposal, viz.:--That if you will Resign\n   your Fleet to me Immediately, without destroying the\n   Effects on Board, You and Your men shall be used with\n   due civility, together with women & Children on Board.\n   To this I shall expect Your direct and Immediate\n   answer. Should you Neglect You will Cherefully take\n   the Consequences which will follow.\n\nCarleton was surprised: and well he might be. He had not\nsupposed that Montgomery's men were in any such commanding\nposition. But, like Cramahe at Quebec, he refused to\nanswer; whereupon Easton's batteries opened both from\nthe south shore and from Isle St Ignace. Carleton's\nheaviest gun was a 9-pounder; while Easton had four\n12-pounders, one of them mounted on a rowing battery that\nsoon forced the British to retreat. The skipper of the\nschooner containing the powder magazine wanted to surrender\non the spot, especially when he heard that the Americans\nwere getting some hot shot ready for him. But Carleton\nretreated upstream, twelve miles above Sorel, to Lavaltrie,\njust above Berthier on the north shore, where, on attempting\nto land, he was driven back by some Americans and habitants.\nNext morning, the 16th, a fateful day for Canada, the\nsame Major Brown who had failed Ethan Allen at Montreal\ncame up with a flag of truce to propose that Carleton\nshould send an officer to see for himself how well all\nchance of escape had now been cut off. The offer was\naccepted; and Brown explained the situation from the\nrebel point of view. 'This is my small battery; and, even\nif you should chance to escape, I have a grand battery\nat the mouth of the Sorel [Richelieu] which will infallibly\nsink all of your vessels. Wait a little till you see the\n32-pounders that are now within half-a-mile.' There was\na good deal of Yankee bluff in this warning, especially\nas the 32-pounders could not be mounted in time. But the\nBritish officer seemed perfectly satisfied that the way\nwas completely blocked; and so the Americans felt sure\nthat Carleton would surrender the following day.\n\nCarleton, however, was not the man to give in till the\nvery last; and one desperate chance still remained. His\nflotilla was doomed. But he might still get through alone\nwithout it. One of the French-Canadian skippers, better\nknown as 'Le Tourte' or 'Wild Pigeon' than by his own\nname of Bouchette because of his wonderfully quick trips,\nwas persuaded to make the dash for freedom. So Carleton,\nhaving ordered Prescott, his second-in-command, not to\nsurrender the flotilla before the last possible moment,\narranged for his own escape in a whaleboat. It was with\ninfinite precaution that he made his preparations, as\nthe enemy, though confident of taking him, were still on\nthe alert to prevent such a prize from slipping through\ntheir fingers. He dressed like a habitant from head to\nfoot, putting on a tasselled _bonnet rouge_ and an _etoffe\ndu pays_ (grey homespun) suit of clothes, with a red sash\nand _bottes sauvages_ like Indian moccasins. Then the\nwhaleboat was quietly brought alongside. The crew got in\nand plied their muffled oars noiselessly down to the\nnarrow passage between Isle St Ignace and the Isle du\nPas, where they shipped the oars and leaned over the side\nto paddle past the nearest battery with the palms of\ntheir hands. It was a moment of breathless excitement;\nfor the hope of Canada was in their keeping and no turning\nback was possible. But the American sentries saw no\nfurtive French Canadians gliding through that dark November\nnight and heard no suspicious noises above the regular\nripple of the eddying island current. One tense half-hour\nand all was over, The oars were run out again; the men\ngave way with a will; and Three Rivers was safely reached\nin the morning.\n\nHere Carleton met Captain Napier, who took him aboard\nthe armed ship _Fell_, in which he continued his journey\nto Quebec. He was practically safe aboard the _Fell_;\nfor Arnold had neither an army strong enough to take\nQuebec nor any craft big enough to fight a ship. But the\nflotilla above Sorel was doomed. After throwing all its\npowder into the St Lawrence it surrendered on the 19th,\nthe very day Carleton reached Quebec. The astonished\nAmericans were furious when they found that Carleton had\nslipped through their fingers after all. They got Prescott,\nwhom they hated; and they released Walker, whom Carleton\nwas taking as a prisoner to Quebec. But no friends and\nfoes like Walker and Prescott could make up for the loss\nof Carleton, who was the heart as well as the head of\nCanada at bay.\n\nThe exultation of the British more than matched the\ndisappointment of the Americans. Thomas Ainslie, collector\nof customs and captain of militia at Quebec, only expressed\nthe feelings of all his fellow-loyalists when he made\nthe following entry in the extremely accurate diary he\nkept throughout those troublous times:\n\n'On the 19th (a Happy Day for Quebec!), to the unspeakable\njoy of the friends of the Government, and to the utter\nDismay of the abettors of Sedition and Rebellion, General\nCarleton arrived in the _Fell_, arm'd ship, accompanied\nby an arm'd schooner. We saw our Salvation in his Presence.'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nBELEAGUERMENT\n1775-1776\n\nWhen Carleton finally turned at bay within the walls of\nQuebec the British flag waved over less than a single\none out of the more than a million square miles that had\nso recently been included within the boundaries of Canada.\nThe landward walls cut off the last half-mile of the\ntilted promontory which rises three hundred feet above\nthe St Lawrence but only one hundred above the valley of\nthe St Charles. This promontory is just a thousand yards\nwide where the landward walls run across it, and not much\nwider across the world-famous Heights and Plains of\nAbraham, which then covered the first two miles beyond.\nThe whole position makes one of Nature's strongholds when\nthe enemy can be kept at arm's length. But Carleton had\nno men to spare for more than the actual walls and the\nnarrow little strip of the Lower Town between the base\nof the cliff and the St Lawrence. So the enemy closed in\nalong the Heights' and among the suburbs, besides occupying\nany point of vantage they chose across the St Lawrence\nor St Charles.\n\nThe walls were by no means fit to stand a siege, a fact\nwhich Carleton had frequently reported. But, as the\nAmericans had neither the men nor the material for a\nregular siege, they were obliged to confine themselves\nto a mere beleaguerment, with the chance of taking Quebec\nby assault. One of Carleton's first acts was to proclaim\nthat every able-bodied man refusing to bear arms was to\nleave the town within four days. But, though this had\nthe desired effect of clearing out nearly all the dangerous\nrebels, the Americans still believed they had enough\nsympathizers inside to turn the scale of victory if they\ncould only manage to take the Lower Town, with all its\ncommercial property and shipping, or gain a footing\nanywhere within the walls.\n\nThere were five thousand souls left in Quebec, which was\nwell provisioned for the winter. The women, children,\nand men unfit to bear arms numbered three thousand. The\n'exempts' amounted to a hundred and eighty. As there was\na growing suspicion about many of these last, Carleton\nparaded them for medical examination at the beginning of\nMarch, when, a good deal more than half were found quite\nfit for duty. These men had been malingering all winter\nin order to skulk out of danger; so he treated them with\nextreme leniency in only putting them on duty as a 'company\nof Invalids.' But the slur stuck fast. The only other\nexceptions to the general efficiency were a very few\ninstances of cowardice and many more of slackness. The\nmilitia order-books have repeated entries about men who\nturned up late for even important duties as well as about\nothers whose authorized substitutes were no better than\nthemselves. But it should be remembered that, as a whole,\nthe garrison did exceedingly good service and that all\nthe malingerers and serious delinquents together did not\namount to more than a tenth of its total, which is a\nsmall proportion for such a mixed body.\n\nThe effective strength at the beginning of the siege was\neighteen hundred of all ranks. Only one hundred of these\nbelonged to the regular British garrison in Canada--a\nfew staff-officers, twenty-two men of the Royal Artillery,\nand seventy men of the 7th Royal Fusiliers, a regiment\nwhich was to be commanded in Quebec sixteen years later\nby Queen Victoria's father, the Duke of Kent. The Fusiliers\nand two hundred and thirty 'Royal Emigrants' were formed\ninto a little battalion under Colonel Maclean, a first-rate\nofficer and Carleton's right-hand man in action. 'His\nMajesty's Royal Highland Regiment of Emigrants,' which\nsubsequently became the 84th Foot, now known as the 2nd\nYork and Lancaster, was hastily raised in 1775 from the\nHighland veterans who had settled in the American colonies\nafter the Peace of 1763. Maclean's two hundred and thirty\nwere the first men he could get together in time to reach\nQuebec. The only other professional fighters were four\nhundred blue-jackets and thirty-five marines of H.M.SS.\n_Lizard_ and _Hunter_, who were formed into a naval\nbattalion under their own officers, Captains Hamilton\nand McKenzie, Hamilton being made a lieutenant-colonel\nand McKenzie a major while doing duty ashore. Fifty\nmasters and mates of trading vessels were enrolled in\nthe same battalion. The whole of the shipping was laid\nup for the winter in the Cul de Sac, which alone made\nthe Lower Town a prize worth taking. The 'British Militia'\nmustered three hundred and thirty, the 'Canadian Militia'\nfive hundred and forty-three. These two corps included\npractically all the official and business classes in\nQuebec and formed nearly half the total combatants. Some\nof them took no pay and were not bound to service beyond\nthe neighbourhood of Quebec, thus being very much like\nthe Home Guards raised all over Canada and the rest of\nthe Empire during the Great World War of 1914. All the\nmilitia wore dark green coats with buff waistcoats and\nbreeches. The total of eighteen hundred was completed by\na hundred and twenty 'artificers,' that is, men who would\nnow belong to the Engineers, Ordnance, and Army Service\nCorps. As the composition of this garrison has been so\noften misrepresented, it may be as well to state distinctly\nthat the past or present regulars of all kinds, soldiers\nand sailors together, numbered eight hundred and the\nmilitia and other non-regulars a thousand. The French\nCanadians, very few of whom were or had been regulars,\nformed less than a third of the whole.\n\nMontgomery and Arnold had about the same total number of\nmen. Sometimes there were more, sometimes less. But what\nmade the real difference, and what really turned the\nscale, was that the Americans had hardly any regulars\nand that their effectives rarely averaged three-quarters\nof their total strength. The balance was also against\nthem in the matter of armament. For, though Morgan's\nVirginians had many more rifles than were to be found\namong the British, the Americans in general were not so\nwell off for bayonets and not so well able to use those\nthey had; while the artillery odds were still more against\nthem. Carleton's artillery was not of the best. But it\nwas better than that of the Americans. He decidedly\novermatched them in the combined strength of all kinds\nof ordnance--cannons, carronades, howitzers, mortars,\nand swivels. Cannons and howitzers fired shot and shell\nat any range up to the limit then reached, between two\nand three miles. Carronades were on the principle of a\ngigantic shotgun, firing masses of bullets with great\neffect at very short ranges--less than that of a long\nmusket-shot, then reckoned at two hundred yards. The\nbiggest mortars threw 13-inch 224-lb shells to a great\ndistance. But their main use was for high-angle fire,\nsuch as that from the suburb of St Roch under the walls\nof Quebec. Swivels were the smallest kind of ordnance,\nfiring one-, two-, or three-pound balls at short or medium\nranges. They were used at convenient points to stop\nrushes, much like modern machine-guns.\n\nThanks chiefly to Cramahe, the defences were not nearly\nso 'ruinous' as Arnold at first had thought them. The\nwalls, however useless against the best siege artillery,\nwere formidable enough against irregular troops and\nmakeshift batteries; while the warehouses and shipping\nin the Lower Town were protected by two stockades, one\nstraight under Cape Diamond, the other at the corner\nwhere the Lower Town turns into the valley of the St\nCharles. The first was called the Pres-de-Ville, the\nsecond the Sault-au-Matelot. The shipping was open to\nbombardment from the Levis shore. But the Americans had\nno guns to spare for this till April.\n\nMontgomery's advance was greatly aided by the little\nflotilla which Easton had captured at Sorel. Montgomery\nmet Arnold at Pointe-aux-Trembles, twenty miles above\nQuebec, on the 2nd of December and supplied his little\nhalf-clad force with the British uniforms taken at St\nJohns and Chambly. He was greatly pleased with the\nmagnificent physique of Arnold's men, the fittest of an\noriginally well-picked lot. He still had some 'pusillanimous\nwretches' among his own New Yorkers, who resented the\nair of superiority affected by Arnold's New Englanders\nand Morgan's Virginians. He felt a well-deserved confidence\nin Livingston and some of the English-speaking Canadian\n'patriots' whom Livingston had brought into his camp\nbefore St Johns in September. But he began to feel more\nand more doubtful about the French Canadians, most of\nwhom began to feel more and more doubtful about themselves.\nOn the 6th he arrived before Quebec and took up his\nquarters in Holland House, two miles beyond the walls,\nat the far end of the Plains of Abraham. The same day he\nsent Carleton the following summons:\n\n   SIR;--Notwithstanding the personal ill-treatment I\n   have received at your hands--notwithstanding your\n   cruelty to the unhappy Prisoners you have taken, the\n   feelings of humanity induce me to have recourse to\n   this expedient to save you from the Destruction which\n   hangs over you. Give me leave, Sir, to assure you that\n   I am well acquainted with your situation. A great\n   extent of works, in their nature incapable of defence,\n   manned with a motley crew of sailors, the greatest\n   part our friends; of citizens, who wish to see us\n   within their walls, & a few of the worst troops who\n   ever stiled themselves Soldiers. The impossibility of\n   relief, and the certain prospect of wanting every\n   necessary of life, should your opponents confine their\n   operations to a simple Blockade, point out the absurdity\n   of resistance. Such is your situation! I am at the\n   head of troops accustomed to Success, confident of\n   the righteousness of the cause they are engaged in,\n   inured to danger, & so highly incensed at your\n   inhumanity, illiberal abuse, and the ungenerous means\n   employed to prejudice them in the mind of the Canadians\n   that it is with difficulty I restrain them till my\n   Batteries are ready from assaulting your works, which\n   afford them a fair opportunity of ample vengeance and\n   just retaliation. Firing upon a flag of truce, hitherto\n   unprecedented, even among savages, prevents my taking\n   the ordinary mode of communicating my sentiments.\n   However, I will at any rate acquit my conscience.\n   Should you persist in an unwarrantable defence, the\n   consequences be upon your own head. Beware of destroying\n   stores of any kind, Publick or Private, as you have\n   done at Montreal and in Three Rivers--If you do, by\n   Heaven, there will be no mercy shown.\n\nThough Montgomery wrote bunkum like the common politician\nof that and many a later age, he was really a brave\nsoldier. What galled him into fury was 'grave Carleton's'\nquiet refusal to recognize either him or any other rebel\ncommander as the accredited leader of a hostile army. It\ncertainly must have been exasperating for the general of\nthe Continental Congress to be reduced to such expedients\nas tying a grandiloquent ultimatum to an arrow and shooting\nit into the beleaguered town. The charge of firing on\nflags of truce was another instance of 'talking for\nBuncombe.' Carleton never fired on any white flag. But\nhe always sent the same answer: that he could hold no\ncommunication with any rebels unless they came to implore\nthe king's pardon. This, of course, was an aggravation\nof his offensive calmness in the face of so much\nrevolutionary rage. To individual rebels of all sorts he\nwas, if anything, over-indulgent. He would not burn the\nsuburbs of Quebec till the enemy forced him to it, though\nmany of the houses that gave the Americans the best cover\nbelonged to rebel Canadians. He went out of his way to\nbe kind to all prisoners, especially if sick or wounded.\nAnd it was entirely owing to his restraining influence\nthat the friendly Indians had not raided the border\nsettlements of New England during the summer. Nor was he\nanimated only by the very natural desire of bringing back\nrebellious subjects to what he thought their true\nallegiance, as his subsequent actions amply proved. He\nsimply acted with the calm dignity and impartial justice\nwhich his position required.\n\nThree days before Christmas the bombardment began in\nearnest. The non-combatants soon found, to their equal\namazement and delight, that a good many shells did very\nlittle damage if fired about at random. But news intended\nto make their flesh creep came in at the same time, and\nprobably had more effect than the shells on the weak-kneed\nmembers of the community. Seven hundred scaling-ladders,\nno quarter if Carleton persisted in holding out, and a\nprophecy attributed to Montgomery that he would eat his\nChristmas dinner either in Quebec or in Hell--these were\nsome of the blood-curdling items that came in by petticoat\nor arrow post. One of the most active purveyors of all\nthis bombast was Jerry Duggan, a Canadian 'patriot' barber\nnow become a Continental major.\n\nBut there was a serious side. Deserters and prisoners,\nas well as British adherents who had escaped, all began\nto tell the same tale, though with many variations.\nMontgomery was evidently bent on storming the walls the\nfirst dark night. His own orders showed it.\n\n   HEAD QUARTERS, HOLLAND HOUSE.\n   Near Quebec, 15th Decr. 1755.\n\n   The General having in vain offered the most favourable\n   terms of accommodation to the Governor of Quebec, &\n   having taken every possible step to prevail on the\n   inhabitants to desist from seconding him in his wild\n   scheme of defending the Town--for the speedy reduction\n   of the only hold possessed by the Ministerial Troops\n   in this Province--The soldiers, flushed with continual\n   success, confident of the justice of their cause, &\n   relying on that Providence which has uniformly protected\n   them, will advance with alacrity to the attack of\n   works incapable of being defended by the wretched\n   Garrison posted behind them, consisting of Sailors\n   unacquainted with the use of arms, of Citizens incapable\n   of Soldiers' duty, & of a few miserable Emigrants.\n   The General is confident that a vigorous & spirited\n   attack must be attended with success. The Troops shall\n   have the effects of the Governor, Garrison, & of such\n   as have been active in misleading the Inhabitants &\n   distressing the friends of liberty, equally divided\n   among them, except the 100th share out of the whole,\n   which shall be at the disposal of the General to be\n   given to such soldiers as distinguished themselves by\n   their activity & bravery, to be sold at public auction:\n   the whole to be conducted as soon as the City is in\n   our hands and the inhabitants disarmed.\n\nIt was a week after these orders had been written before\nthe first positive news of the threatened assault was\nbrought into town by an escaped British prisoner who,\nstrangely enough, bore the name of Wolfe. Wolfe's escape\nnaturally caused a postponement of Montgomery's design\nand a further council of war. Unlike most councils of\nwar this one was full of fight. Three feints were to be\nmade at different points while the real attack was to be\ndriven home at Cape Diamond. But just after this decision\nhad been reached two rebel Montrealers came down and, in\nanother debate, carried the day for another plan. These\nmen, Antell and Price, were really responsible for the\nfinal plan, which, like its predecessor, did not meet\nwith Montgomery's approval. Montgomery wanted to make a\nbreach before trying the walls. But he was no more than\nthe chairman of a committee; and this egregious committee\nfirst decided to storm the unbroken walls and then changed\nto an attack on the Lower Town only. Antell was Montgomery's\nengineer. Price was a red-hot agitator. Both were better\nat politics than soldiering. Their argument was that if\nthe Lower Town could be taken the Quebec militia would\nforce Carleton to surrender in order to save the warehouses,\nshipping, and other valuable property along the waterfront,\nand that even if Carleton held out in debate he would\nsoon be brought to his knees by the Americans, who would\nmarch through the gates, which were to be opened by the\n'patriots' inside.\n\nAnother week passed; and Montgomery had not eaten his\nChristmas dinner either in Quebec or in the other place.\nBut both sides knew the crisis must be fast approaching;\nfor the New Yorkers had sworn that they would not stay\na minute later than the end of the year, when their term\nof enlistment was up. Thus every day that passed made an\nimmediate assault more likely, as Montgomery had to strike\nbefore his own men left him. Yet New Year's Eve itself\nbegan without the sign of an alarm.\n\nCarleton had been sleeping in his clothes at the Recollets',\nnight after night, so that he might be first on parade\nat the general rendezvous on the Place d'Armes, which\nstood near the top of Mountain Hill, the only road between\nthe Upper and the Lower Town. Officers and men off duty\nhad been following his example; and every one was ready\nto turn out at a moment's notice.\n\nA north-easterly snowstorm was blowing furiously, straight\nup the St Lawrence, making Quebec a partly seen blur to\nthe nearest American patrols and the Heights of Abraham\na wild sea of whirling drifts to the nearest British\nsentries. One o'clock passed, and nothing stirred. But\nwhen two o'clock struck at Holland House Montgomery rose\nand began to put the council's plan in operation. The\nLower Town was to be attacked at both ends. The\nPres-de-Ville barricade was to be carried by Montgomery\nand the Sault-au-Matelot by Arnold, while Livingston was\nto distract Carleton's attention as much as possible by\nmaking a feint against the landward walls, where the\nBritish still expected the real attack. Livingston's\nCanadian fighting 'patriots' waded through the drifts,\nagainst the storm, across the Plains, and took post close\nin on the far side of Cape Diamond, only eighty yards\nfrom the same walls that were to have been stormed some\ndays before. Jerry Duggan's parasitic Canadian 'patriots'\ntook post in the suburb of St John and thence round to\nPalace Gate. Montgomery led his own column straight to\nWolfe's Cove, whence he marched in along the narrow path\nbetween the cliff and the St Lawrence till he reached\nthe spot at the foot of Cape Diamond just under the right\nof Livingston's line. Arnold, whose quarters were in the\nvalley of the St Charles, took post in St Roch, with a\nmortar battery to fire against the walls and a column of\nmen to storm the Sault-au-Matelot. Livingston's and Jerry\nDuggan's whole command numbered about four hundred men,\nMontgomery's five hundred, Arnold's six. The opposing\ntotals were fifteen hundred Americans against seventeen\nhundred British. There was considerable risk of confusion\nbetween friend and foe, as most of the Americans, especially\nArnold's men, wore captured British uniforms with nothing\nto distinguish them but odds and ends of their former\nkits and a sort of paper hatband bearing the inscription\n_Liberty or Death_.\n\nA little after four the sentries on the walls at Cape\nDiamond saw lights flashing about in front of them and\nwere just going to call the guard when Captain Malcolm\nFraser of the Royal Emigrants came by on his rounds and\nsaw other lights being set out in regular order like\nlamps in a street. He instantly turned out the guards\nand pickets. The drums beat to arms. Every church bell\nin the city pealed forth its alarm into that wild night.\nThe bugles blew. The men off duty swarmed on to the Place\nd'Armes, where Carleton, calm and intrepid as ever, took\npost with the general reserve and waited. There was\nnothing for him to do just yet. Everything that could\nhave been foreseen had already been amply provided for;\nand in his quiet confidence his followers found their\nown.\n\nTowards five o'clock two green rockets shot up from\nMontgomery's position beside the Anse des Meres under\nCape Diamond. This was the signal for attack. Montgomery's\ncolumn immediately struggled on again along the path\nleading round the foot of the Cape towards the Pres-de-Ville\nbarricade. Livingston's serious 'patriots' on the top of\nthe Cape changed their dropping shots into a hot fire\nagainst the walls; while Jerry Duggan's little mob of\nwould-be looters shouted and blazed away from safer cover\nin the suburbs of St John and St Roch. Arnold's mortars\npitched shells all over the town; while his storming-party\nadvanced towards the Sault-au-Matelot barricade. Carleton,\nnaturally anxious about the landward walls, sent some of\nthe British militia to reinforce the men at Cape Diamond,\nwhich, as he knew, Montgomery considered the best point\nof attack. The walls lower down did not seem to be in\nany danger from Jerry Duggan's 'patriots,' whose noisy\ndemonstration was at once understood to be nothing but\nan empty feint. The walls facing the St Charles were well\nmanned and well gunned by the naval battalion. Those\nfacing the St Lawrence, though weak in themselves, were\npractically impregnable, as the cliffs could not be scaled\nby any formed body. The Lower Town, however, was by no\nmeans so safe, in spite of its two barricades. The general\nuproar was now so great that Carleton could not distinguish\nthe firing there from what was going on elsewhere. But\nit was at these two points that the real attack was\nrapidly developing.\n\nThe first decisive action took place at Pres-de-Ville.\nThe guard there consisted of fifty men--John Coffin, who\nwas a merchant of Quebec, Sergeant Hugh McQuarters of\nthe Royal Artillery, Captain Barnsfair, a merchant skipper,\nwith fifteen mates and skippers like himself, and thirty\nFrench Canadians under Captain Chabot and Lieutenant\nPicard. These fifty men had to guard a front of only as\nmany feet. On their right Cape Diamond rose almost sheer.\nOn their left raged the stormy St Lawrence. They had a\ntiny block-house next to the cliff and four small guns\non the barricade, all double-charged with canister and\ngrape. They had heard the dropping shots on the top of\nthe Cape for nearly an hour and had been quick to notice\nthe change to a regular hot fire. But they had no idea\nwhether their own post was to be attacked or not till\nthey suddenly saw the head of Montgomery's column halting\nwithin fifty paces of them. A man came forward cautiously\nand looked at the barricade. The storm was in his face.\nThe defences were wreathed in whirling snow. And the men\ninside kept silent as the grave. When he went back a\nlittle group stood for a couple of minutes in hurried\nconsultation. Then Montgomery waved his sword, called\nout 'Come on, brave boys, Quebec is ours!' and led the\ncharge. The defenders let the Americans get about half-way\nbefore Barnsfair shouted 'Fire!' Then the guns and muskets\nvolleyed together, cutting down the whole front of the\ndensely massed column. Montgomery, his two staff-officers,\nand his ten leading men were instantly killed. Some more\nfarther back were wounded. And just as the fifty British\nfired their second round the rest of the five hundred\nAmericans turned and ran in wild confusion.\n\nA few minutes later a man whose identity was never\nestablished came running from the Lower Town to say that\nArnold's men had taken the Sault-au-Matelot barricade.\nIf this was true it meant that the Pres-de-Ville fifty\nwould be caught between two fires. Some of them made as\nif to run back and reach Mountain Hill before the Americans\ncould cut them off. But Coffin at once threatened to kill\nthe first man to move; and by the time an artillery\nofficer had arrived with reinforcements perfect order\nhad been restored. This officer, finding he was not wanted\nthere, sent back to know where else he was to go, and\nreceived an answer telling him to hurry to the\nSault-au-Matelot. When he arrived there, less than half\na mile off, he found that desperate street fighting had\nbeen going on for over an hour.\n\nArnold's advance had begun at the same time as Livingston's\ndemonstration and Montgomery's attack. But his task was\nvery different and the time required much longer. There\nwere three obstacles to be overcome. First, his men had\nto run the gauntlet of the fire from the bluejackets\nranged along the Grand Battery, which faced the St Charles\nat its mouth and overlooked the narrow little street of\nSous-le-Cap at a height of fifty or sixty feet. Then they\nhad to take the small advanced barricade, which stood a\nhundred yards on the St Charles side of the actual\nSault-au-Matelot or Sailor's Leap, which is the\nnorth-easterly point of the Quebec promontory and nearly\na hundred feet high. Finally, they had to round this\npoint and attack the regular Sault-au-Matelot barricade.\nThis second barricade was about a hundred yards long,\nfrom the rock to the river. It crossed Sault-au-Matelot\nStreet and St Peter Street, which were the same then as\nnow. But it ended on a wharf half-way down the modern St\nJames Street, as the outer half of this street was then\na natural strand completely covered at high tide. It was\nmuch closer than the Pres-de-Ville barricade was to\nMountain Hill, at the top of which Carleton held his\ngeneral reserve ready in the Place d'Armes; and it was\nfairly strong in material and armament. But it was at\nfirst defended by only a hundred men.\n\nThe American forlorn hope, under Captain Oswald, got past\nmost of the Grand Battery unscathed. But by the time the\nmain body was following under Morgan the British\nblue-jackets were firing down from the walls at less than\npoint-blank range. The driving snow, the clumps of bushes\non the cliff, and the little houses in the street below\nall gave the Americans some welcome cover. But many of\nthem were hit; while the gun they were towing through\nthe drifts on a sleigh stuck fast and had to be abandoned.\nCaptain Dearborn, the future commander-in-chief of the\nAmerican army in the War of 1812, noted in his diary that\nhe'met the wounded men very thick' as he was bringing\nup the rear. When the forlorn hope reached the advanced\nbarricade Arnold halted it till the supports had come\nup. The loss of the gun and the worrying his main body\nwas receiving from the sailors along the Grand Battery\nspoilt his original plan of smashing in the barricade by\nshell fire while Morgan circled round its outer flank on\nthe ice of the tidal flats and took it in rear. So he\ndecided on a frontal attack. When he thought he had a\nfair chance he stepped to the front and shouted, 'Now,\nboys, all together, rush!' But before he could climb the\nbarricade he was shot through the leg. For some time he\npropped himself up against a house and, leaning on his\nrifle, continued encouraging his men, who were soon firing\nthrough the port-holes as well as over the top. But\npresently growing faint from loss of blood he had to be\ncarried off the field to the General Hospital on the\nbanks of the St Charles.\n\nThe men now called out for a lead from Morgan, who climbed\na ladder, leaped the top, and fell under a gun inside.\nIn another minute the whole forlorn hope had followed\nhim, while the main body came close behind. The guard,\nnot strong in numbers and weak in being composed of young\nmilitiamen, gave way but kept on firing. 'Down with your\narms if you want quarter!' yelled Morgan, whose men were\nin overwhelming strength; and the guard surrendered. A\nlittle way beyond, just under the bluff of the\nSault-au-Matelot, the British supports, many of whom were\nSeminary students, also surrendered to Morgan, who at\nonce pressed on, round the corner of the Sault-au-Matelot,\nand halted in sight of the second or regular barricade.\nWhat was to be done now? Where was Montgomery? How strong\nwas the barricade; and had it been reinforced? It could\nnot be turned because the cliff rose sheer on one flank\nwhile the icy St Lawrence lashed the other. Had Morgan\nknown that there were only a hundred men behind it when\nhe attacked its advanced barricade he might have pressed\non at all costs and carried it by assault. But it looked\nstrong, there were guns on its platforms, and it ran\nacross two streets. His hurried council of war over-ruled\nhim, as Montgomery's council had over-ruled the original\nplan of storming the walls; and so his men began a\ndesultory fight in the streets and from the houses.\n\nThis was fatal to American success. The original British\nhundred were rapidly reinforced. The artillery officer\nwho had found that he was not needed at the Pres-de-Ville\nafter Montgomery's defeat, and who had hurried across\nthe intervening half-mile, now occupied the corner houses,\nenlarged the embrasures, and trained his guns on the\nhouses occupied by the enemy. Detachments of Fusiliers\nand Royal Emigrants also arrived, as did the thirty-five\nmasters and mates of merchant vessels who were not on\nguard with Barnsfair at the Pres-de-Ville. Thus, what\nwith soldiers, sailors, and militiamen of both races,\nthe main Sault-au-Matelot barricade was made secure\nagainst being rushed like the outer one. But there was\nplenty of fighting, with some confusion at close quarters\ncaused by the British uniforms which both sides were\nwearing. A Herculean sailor seized the first ladder the\nAmericans set against the barricade, hauled it up, and\nset it against the window of a house out of the far end\nof which the enemy were firing. Major Nairne and Lieutenant\nDambourges of the Royal Emigrants at once climbed in at\nthe head of a storming-party and wild work followed with\nthe bayonet. All the Americans inside were either killed\nor captured. Meanwhile a vigorous British nine-pounder\nhad been turned on another house they occupied. This\nhouse was likewise battered in, so that its surviving\noccupants had to run into the street, where they were\nwell plied with musketry by the regulars and militiamen.\nThe chance for a sortie then seeming favourable, Lieutenant\nAnderson of the Navy headed his thirty-five merchant\nmates and skippers in a rush along Sault-au-Matelot\nStreet. But his effort was premature. Morgan shot him\ndead, and Morgan's Virginians drove the seamen back inside\nthe barricade.\n\nCarleton had of course kept in perfect touch with every\nphase of the attack and defence; and now, fearing no\nsurprise against the walls in the growing daylight, had\ndecided on taking Arnold's men in rear. To do this he\nsent Captain Lawes of the Royal Engineers and Captain\nMcDougall of the Royal Emigrants with a hundred and twenty\nmen out through Palace Gate. This detachment had hardly\nreached the advanced barricade before they fell in with\nthe enemy's rearguard, which they took by complete surprise\nand captured to a man. Leaving McDougall to secure these\nprisoners before following on, Lawes pushed eagerly\nforward, round the corner of the Sault-au-Matelot cliff,\nand, running in among the Americans facing the main\nbarricade, called out, 'You are all my prisoners!' 'No,\nwe're not; you're ours!' they answered. 'No, no,' replied\nLawes, as coolly as if on parade 'don't mistake yourselves,\nI vow to God you're mine!' 'But where are your men?'\nasked the astonished Americans; and then Lawes suddenly\nfound that he was utterly alone! The roar of the storm\nand the work of securing the prisoners on the far side\nof the advanced barricade had prevented the men who should\nhave followed him from understanding that only a few were\nneeded with McDougall. But Lawes put a bold face on it\nand answered, 'O, Ho, make yourselves easy! My men are\nall round here and they'll be with you in a twinkling.'\nHe was then seized and disarmed. Some of the Americans\ncalled out, 'Kill him! Kill him!' But a Major Meigs\nprotected him. The whole parley had lasted about ten\nminutes when McDougall came running up with the missing\nmen, released Lawes, and made prisoners of the nearest\nAmericans. Lawes at once stepped forward and called on the\nrest to surrender. Morgan was for cutting his way through.\nA few men ran round by the wharf and escaped on the tidal\nflats of the St Charles. But, after a hurried consultation,\nthe main body, including Morgan, laid down their arms. This\nwas decisive. The British had won the fight.\n\nThe complete British loss in killed and wounded was\nwonderfully small, only thirty, just one-tenth of the\ncorresponding American loss, which was large out of all\nproportion. Nearly half of the fifteen hundred Americans\nhad gone--over four hundred prisoners and about three\nhundred killed and wounded. Nor were the mere numbers\nthe most telling point about it; for the worse half\nescaped--Livingston's Montreal 'patriots,' many of whom\nhad done very little fighting, Montgomery's time-expired\nNew Yorkers, most of whom wanted to go home, and Jerry\nDuggan's miscellaneous rabble, all of whom wanted a\nmaximum of plunder with a minimum of war.\n\nThe British victory was as nearly perfect as could have\nbeen desired. It marked the turn of the tide in a desperate\ncampaign which might have resulted in the total loss of\nCanada. And it was of the greatest significance and\nhappiest augury because all the racial elements of this\nnew and vast domain had here united for the first time\nin defence of that which was to be their common heritage.\nIn Carleton's little garrison of regulars and militia,\nof bluejackets, marines, and merchant seamen, there were\nFrenchmen and French Canadians, there were Englishmen,\nIrishmen, Scotsmen, Welshmen, Orcadians, and Channel\nIslanders, there were a few Newfoundlanders, and there\nmere a good many of those steadfast Royal Emigrants who\nmay be fitly called the forerunners of the United Empire\nLoyalists. Yet, in spite of this remarkable significance,\nno public memorial of Carleton has ever been set up; and\nit was only in the twentieth century that the Dominion\nfirst thought of commemorating his most pregnant victory\nby placing tablets to mark the sites of the two famous\nbarricades.\n\nAs soon as things had quieted down within the walls\nCarleton sent out search-parties to bring in the dead\nfor decent burial and to see if any of the wounded had\nbeen overlooked.

CONCLUSION\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n\nA QUESTION OF MIDSHIPMAN HONOR\n\n\"How can a midshipman and gentleman act in that way?\"\n\nThe voice of Midshipman David Darrin, United States Navy, vibrated\nuneasily as he turned to his comrades.\n\n\"It's a shame--that's what it is,\" quivered Mr. Farley, also of the\nthird class at the United States Naval Academy.\n\n\"But the question is,\" propounded Midshipman Dan Dalzell, \"what are we\ngoing to do about it?\"\n\n\"Is it any part of our business to bother with the fellow?\" demanded\nFarley half savagely.\n\nNow Farley was rather hot-tempered, though he was \"all there\" in points\nthat involved the honor of the brigade of midshipmen.\n\nFive midshipmen stood in the squalid, ill-odored back room of a Chinese\nlaundry in the town of Annapolis.\n\nThere was a sixth midshipman present in the handsome blue uniform of the\nbrigade; and it was upon this sixth one that the anger and disgust of\nthe other five had centered.\n\nHe lay in a sleep too deep for stirring. On the still, foul air floated\nfumes that were new to those of his comrades who now gazed down on him.\n\n\"To think that one of our class could make such a beast of himself!\"\nsighed Dave Darrin.\n\n\"And on the morning of the very day we're to ship for the summer\ncruise,\" uttered Farley angrily.\n\n\"Oh, well\" growled Hallam, \"why not let this animal of lower grade sleep\njust where he is? Let him take what he has fairly brought upon himself!\"\n\n\"That's the very question that is agitating me,\" declared Dave Darrin,\nto whom these other members of the third class looked as a leader when\nthere was a point involving class honor.\n\nDave had became a leader through suffering.\n\nReaders of the preceding volume in this series, \"DAVE DARRIN'S FIRST\nYEAR AT ANNAPOLIS,\" will need no introduction to this fine specimen of\nspirited and honorable young American.\n\nReaders of that preceding volume will recall how Dave Darrin and Dan\nDalzell entered the United States Naval Academy, one appointed by a\nCongressman and the other by a United States Senator. Such readers will\nremember the difficult time that Dave and Dan had in getting through the\nwork of the first hard, grinding year. They will also recall how Dave\nDarrin, when accused of treachery to his classmates, patiently bided his\ntime until he, with the aid of some close friends, was able to\ndemonstrate his innocence. Our readers will also remember how two\nevil-minded members of the then fourth class plotted to increase Damn's\ndisgrace and to drive him out of the brigade; also how these two\nplotters, Midshipmen Henkel and Brimmer, were caught in their plotting\nand were themselves forced out of the brigade. Our readers know that\nbefore the end of the first year at the Naval Academy, Dave had fully\nreinstated himself in the esteem of his manly classmates, and how he\nquickly became the most popular and respected member of his class.\n\nIt was now only the day after the events whose narration closed the\npreceding volume.\n\nDave Darrin and Dalzell were first of all brought to notice in \"THE HIGH\nSCHOOL BOYS' SERIES.\" In their High School days, back in Gridley, these\ntwo had been famous members of Dick & Co., a sextette of youngsters who\nhad made a name for themselves in school athletics.\n\nDick Prescott and Greg Holmes, two other members of the sextette, had\nbeen appointed to the United States Military Academy at West Point,\nwhere they were serving in the corps of cadets and learning how to\nbecome Army officers in the not far distant future. All of the\nadventures of Dick and Greg are set forth in \"THE WEST POINT SERIES.\"\n\nThe two remaining members of famous old Dick & Co., Tom Reade and Harry\nHazelton, became civil engineers, and went West for their first taste of\nengineering work. Tom and Harry had some wonderful and startling\nadventures, as fully set forth in \"THE YOUNG ENGINEERS' SERIES.\"\n\nOn this early June day when we again encounter Dave Darrin and Dan\nDalzell in their handsome Naval uniforms, all members of the first,\nsecond and third classes were due to be aboard one of the three great\nbattleships that lay off the Yard at Annapolis at four p.m.\n\nThese three great battleships were the \"Massachusetts,\" the \"Iowa\" and\nthe \"Indiana.\" These three huge, turreted fighting craft had their full\ncrews aboard. Not one of the battleship commanders would allow a\n\"jackie\" ashore, except on business, through fear that many of the\n\"wilder\" ones might find the attractions on shore too alluring, and fail\nto return in time.\n\nWith the young midshipmen it was different. These young men were\nofficially and actually gentlemen, and could be trusted.\n\nYet here, in the back room of this laundry, was one who was apparently\nnot dependable.\n\nThis young midshipman's name was Pennington, and the fact was that he\nlay in deep stupor from the effects of smoking opium!\n\nIt had been a storekeeper, with a shop across the street, who had called\nthe attention of Dave and his four comrades to the probable fate of\nanother of their class.\n\n\"Chow Hop runs a laundry, but I have heard evil stories about a lot of\nyoung fools who flock to his back room and get a chance to 'hit' the\nopium pipe,\" the storekeeper had stated to Dave. \"One of your men, or at\nleast, one in a midshipman's uniform, went in there at eleven o'clock\nthis forenoon, and he hasn't been out since. It is now nearly two\no'clock and, I've been looking for some midshipmen to inform.\"\n\nSuch had been the storekeeper's careful statement. The merchants of\nAnnapolis always have a kindly feeling toward these fine young\nmidshipmen. The storekeeper's purpose was to enable them to help their\ncomrade out.\n\nSo the five had entered the laundry. The proprietor, Chow Hop, had\nattempted to bar their way to the rear room.\n\nBut Dave had seized the yellow man and had flung him aside.\n\nThe reader already knows what they discovered, and how it affected these\nyoung men.\n\n\"Bring that copper- chink in here, if you'll be so good,\"\ndirected Dave.\n\nDan and Hallam departed on the quest.\n\n\"You're wanted in there,\" proclaimed Dalzell, jerking a thumb over his\nshoulder.\n\n\"Me no sabby,\" replied Chow Hop, looking up briefly from his ironing\nboard.\n\n\"Get in there--do you hear?\" commanded Hallam, gripping the other's arm\nwith all his force.\n\n\"You lemme go chop-chop (quickly), or you get alle samee hurt--you\nsabby?\" scowled Chow Hop, using his free hand to raise a heavy flat-iron\nmenacingly.\n\nBut Dan Dalzell jumped in, giving the Chinaman's wrist a wrench that\ncaused him to drop the iron.\n\nThen, without a bit of ceremony, Dan grasped the Oriental by the\nshoulders, wheeled him about, while he protested in guttural tones, and\nbluntly kicked the yellow-faced one through the door into the inner\nroom.\n\nAt this summary proceeding both the Chinese helpers gripped their\nflat-irons firmly; and leaped forward to fight.\n\nIn an ugly temper the Chinaman is a bad man to oppose. But now this pair\nwere faced by a pair of quietly smiling midshipmen who were also\ndangerous when angry.\n\n\"You two, get back,\" ordered Dalzell, advancing fearlessly upon the\npair. \"If you don't, we'll drag you out into the street and turn you\nover to the policemen. You'sabby' that? You heathen are pretty likely\nto get into prison for this day's work!\"\n\nScowling for a moment, then muttering savagely, the two helpers slunk\nback to their ironing boards.\n\nYet, while Dan turned to go into the rear room, Hallam stood just where\nhe was, to keep an eye on two possible sources of swift trouble.\n\n\"Chow Hop,\" began Dave Damn sternly, as the proprietor made his flying\nappearance, \"You've done a pretty mean piece of work here\"--pointing to\nthe unconscious midshipman in the berth. \"Do you understand that you're\npretty likely to go to prison for this?\"\n\n\"Oh, that no maller,\" replied Chow, with a sullen grin. \"Him plenty\n'shipmen come here and smoke.\"\n\n\"You lie!\" hissed Dave, grasping the heathen by the collar and shaking\nhim until the latter's teeth rattled.\n\nThen Dave gave him a brief rest, though he still retained his hold on\nthe Chinaman's collar. But the yellow man began struggling again, and\nDave repeated the shaking.\n\nChow Hop had kept his hands up inside his wide sleeves. Now Farley\nleaped forward as he shouted:\n\n\"Look out, Darry! He has a knife!\"\n\nFarley attempted to seize the Chinaman's wrist, for the purpose of\ndisarming the yellow man, but Dave swiftly threw the Chinaman around out\nof Farley's reach. Then, with a lightning-like move, Dave knocked the\nknife from Chow Hop's hand.\n\n\"Pick that up and keep it for a curio, Farley,\" directed Dave coolly.\n\nIn another twinkling Darrin had run the Chinaman up against the wall.\n\nSmack! biff! thump!\n\nWith increasing force Dave's hard fist struck the heathen in the face.\n\n\"Now stand there and behave yourself,\" admonished Midshipman Dave,\ndropping his hold on the yellow man's collar, \"or we'll stop playing\nwith you and hurt you some.\"\n\nThe scowl on Chow Hop's face was ominous, but he stood still, glaring at\nDave.\n\n\"Chow, what can we do to bring this man out of his sleep!\" asked Dave\ncoolly, and almost in a friendly tone.\n\n\"Me no sabby,\" sulked the Chinaman.\n\n\"Yes, you do,\" retorted Dave warningly. \"Now, what can we do to get our\nfriend out of this!\"\n\n\"You allee same cally (carry) him out,\" retorted Chow, with a suspicion\nof a sulky grin.\n\n\"None of that, now, you yellow-face!\" glared Dave. \"How shall we get our\ncomrade out of this opium sleep!\"\n\n\"Me no sabby no way,\" insisted Chow.\n\n\"Oh, yes, you do!\" snapped Dave. \"But you won't tell. All right; we'll\nfind the way, and we'll punish you into the bargain. Dan, get a piece of\npaper from the other room.\"\n\nDalzell was quickly back with the desired item. On the paper Dave wrote\na name and a telephone number.\n\n\"It's near the end of the doctor's office hours,\" murmured Dave. \"Go to\na telephone and ask the doctor to meet you at the corner above. Tell him\nit's vastly important, and ask him to meet you on the jump.\"\n\n\"Shall I tell him what's up!\" asked Dan cautiously.\n\n\"Yes; you'd better. Then he'll be sure to bring the necessary remedies\nwith him.\"\n\nDan Dalzell was off like a shot.\n\nChow tried to edge around toward the door.\n\n\"Here, you get back there,\" cried Dave, seizing the Chinaman and\nslamming him back against the wall. \"Don't you move again, until we tell\nyou that you may--or it will be the worse for you.\"\n\nTen minutes passed ere Dan returned with Dr. Lawrence.\n\n\"You see the job that's cut out for you,\" said Darrin, pointing to the\nunconscious figure in the bunk. \"Can you do it, Doctor?\"\n\nThe medical man made a hasty examination of the unconscious midshipman\nbefore he answered briefly:\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Will it be a long job, Doctor?\"\n\n\"Fifteen minutes, probably.\"\n\n\"Oh, good, if you can do it in that time!\"\n\n\"Me go now?\" asked Chow, with sullen curiosity, as the medical man\nopened his medicine-case.\n\n\"Yes; if you don't try to leave the joint,\" agreed Dave. \"And I'm going\noutside with you.\"\n\nChow looked very much as though he did not care for company, but\nMidshipman Darrin kept at his side.\n\n\"Now, see here, Chow,\" warned Dave, \"this is the last day you sell opium\nfor white men to smoke!\"\n\n\"You heap too flesh (fresh)\" growled the Chinaman.\n\n\"It's the last day you'll sell opium to white men,\" insisted Dave, \"for,\nas soon as I'm through here I'm going to the police station to inform\nagainst you. They'll go through here like a twelve-inch shot.\"\n\n\"You alle same tell cop?\" grinned Chow, green hatred showing through his\nskin. \"Then I tell evelybody about you fliend in there.\"\n\n\"Do just as you please about that,\" retorted Dave with pretended\ncarelessness. \"For one thing, you don't know his name.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, I do,\" swaggered Chow impudently. \"Know heap 'bout him. His\nname alle same Pen'ton.\"\n\nSeizing a marking brush and a piece of paper, Chow Hop quickly wrote out\nPennington's name, correctly spelled. His ability to write English with\na good hand was one of Chow's great vanities, anyway.\n\n\"You go back to your ironing board, yellow-face,\" warned Darrin, and\nsomething in the young third classman's face showed Chow that it would\nbe wise to obey.\n\nThen Hallam drew Darrin to one side, to whisper earnestly in his ear:\n\n\"Look out, old man, or you will get Pen into an awful scrape!\"\n\n\"I shan't do it,\" maintained Darrin. \"If it happens it will have been\nPen's own work.\"\n\n\"You'd better let the chink go, just to save one of our class.\"\n\n\"Is a fellow who has turned opium fiend worth saving to the class!\"\ndemanded Dave, looking straight into Hallam's eyes.\n\n\"Well, er--er--\" stammered the other man.\n\n\"You see,\" smiled Dave, \"the doubt hits you just as hard as it does me!\"\n\n\"Oh, of course, a fellow who has turned opium fiend is no fellow ever to\nbe allowed to reach the bridge and the quarter-deck,\" admitted Hallam.\n\"But see here, are you going to report this affair to the commandant of\nmidshipmen, or to anyone else in authority?\"\n\n\"I've no occasion to report,\" replied Dave dryly. \"I am not in any way\nin command over Pennington. But I mean to persuade him to report himself\nfor what he has done!\"\n\n\"But that would ruin him!\" protested Hallam, aghast. \"He wouldn't even\nbe allowed to start on the cruise. He'd be railroaded home without loss\nof a moment.\"\n\n\"Yet you've just said that an opium-user isn't fit to go on in the\nbrigade,\" retorted Darrin.\n\n\"Hang it, it's hard to know what to do,\" rejoined Hallam, wrinkling his\nforehead. \"Of course we want to be just to Pen.\"\n\n\"It doesn't strike me as being just exactly a question of justice to\nPennington,\" Darrin went on earnestly. \"If this is anything it's a\nquestion of midshipman honor. We fellows are bound to see that all the\nunworthy ones are dropped from the service. Now, a fellow who has\nfastened the opium habit on himself isn't fit to go on, is he?\"\n\n\"Oh, say, but this is a hard one to settle!\" groaned Hallam.\n\n\"Then I'll take all the responsibility upon myself,\" said Dave promptly.\n\"I don't want to make any mistake, and I don't believe I'm going to.\nWait just a moment.\"\n\nGoing to the rear room, Dave faced his three comrades there with the\nquestion:\n\n\"You three are enough to take care of everything here for a few minutes,\naren't you?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" nodded Dan. \"What's up?\"\n\n\"Hallam and I are going for a brief walk.\"\n\nThen, stepping back into the front room, Darrin nodded to his classmate,\nwho followed him outside.\n\n\"Just come along, and say nothing about the matter on the street,\"\nrequested Dave. \"It might be overheard.\"\n\n\"Where are you going?\" questioned Hallam wonderingly.\n\n\"Wait and see, please.\"\n\nFrom Chow Hop's wretched establishment it was not far to the other\nbuilding that Dave had in mind as a destination.\n\nBut when they arrived, and stood at the foot of the steps, Hallam\nclutched Darrin's arm, holding him back.\n\n\"Why, see here, this is the police station!\"\n\n\"I know it,\" Dave replied calmly.\n\n\"But see here, you're not--\"\n\n\"I'm not going to drag you into anything that you'd object to,\" Darrin\ncontinued. \"Come along; all I want you for is as a witness to what I am\ngoing to say.\"\n\n\"Don't do it, old fel--\"\n\n\"I've thought that over, and I feel that I must,\" replied Dave firmly.\n\"Come along. Don't attract attention by standing here arguing.\"\n\nIn another instant the two midshipmen were going swiftly up the steps.\n\nThe chief of police received his two callers courteously. Dave told the\nofficial how their attention had been called to the fact that one of\ntheir number was in an opium joint. Dave named the place, but requested\nthe chief to wait a full hour before taking any action.\n\n\"That will give us a chance to get out a comrade who may have committed\nonly his first offense,\" Dave continued.\n\n\"If there's any opium being smoked in that place I'll surely close the\njoint out!\" replied the chief, bringing his fist down upon his desk.\n\"But I understand your reasons, Mr.--\"\n\n\"Darrin is my name, sir,\" replied Dave quietly.\n\n\"So, Mr. Darrin, I give you my word that I won't even start my\ninvestigations before this evening. And I'll keep all quiet about the\nmidshipman end of it.\"\n\n\"Thank you very much, sir,\" said Dave gratefully.\n\nAs the two midshipmen strolled slowly back in the direction of Chow\nHop's, Dave murmured:\n\n\"Now, you see why I took this step?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid not very clearly,\" replied Midshipman Hallam.\n\n\"That scoundrelly Chow made his boast that other midshipmen patronized\nhis place. I don't believe it. Such a vice wouldn't appeal to you, and\nit doesn't to me. But there are more than two hundred new plebes coming\nin just now, and many of these boys have never been away from home\nbefore. Some of them might foolishly seek the lure of a new vice, and\nmight find the habit fastened on them before they were aware of it.\nChow's vile den might spoil some good material for the quarter-deck,\nand, as a matter of midshipman honor, we're bound to see that the place\nis cleaned out right away.\"\n\n\"I guess, Darry, you come pretty near being right,\" assented Hallam,\nafter thinking for a few moments.\n\nBy the time they reached Chow Hop's again they found that Dr. Lawrence\nhad brought the unfortunate Pennington to. And a very scared and\nhumiliated midshipman it was who now stood up, a bit unsteadily, and\ntried to smooth down his uniform.\n\n\"How do you feel now?\" asked Dave.\n\n\"Awful!\" shuddered Pennington. \"And now see here, what are you fellows\ngoing to do? Blab, and see me driven out of the Navy?\"\n\n\"Don't do any talking in here,\" advised Dave, with a meaning look over\nhis shoulder at the yellow men in the outer room. \"Doctor, is our friend\nin shape to walk along with us now?\"\n\n\"He will be, in two or three minutes, after he drinks something I'm\ngoing to give him,\" replied the medical man, shaking a few drops from\neach of three vials into a glass of water. \"Here, young man, drink this\nslowly.\"\n\nThree minutes later the midshipmen left the place, Dave walking beside\nPennington and holding his arm lightly for the purpose of steadying him.\n\n\"How did this happen, Pen?\" queried Dave, when the six men of the third\nclass at last found themselves walking down Maryland Avenue. \"How long\nhave you been at this 'hop' trick?\"\n\n\"Never before to-day,\" replied Midshipman Pennington quickly.\n\n\"Pen, will you tell me that on your honor?\" asked Dave gravely.\n\nThe other midshipman flared up.\n\n\"Why must I give you my word of honor?\" he demanded defiantly. \"Isn't my\nplain word good enough?\"\n\n\"Your word of honor that you had never smoked opium before to-day would\nhelp to ease my mind a whole lot,\" replied Darrin. \"Come, unburden\nyourself, won't you, Pen?\"\n\n\"I'll tell you, Darry, just how it happened. To-day _was_ the first\ntime, on my word of honor, I came out into Annapolis with a raging\ntoothache. Now, you know how a fellow gets to hate to go before the\nmedical officers of the Academy with a tale about his teeth.\"\n\n\"Yes, I do,\" nodded Darrin. \"If a fellow is too much on the medical\nreport for trouble with his teeth, then it makes the surgeons look his\nmouth over with all the more caution, and in the end a fellow may get\ndropped from the brigade just because he has invited over zeal from the\ndentist. But what has all this to do with opium smoking?\"\n\n\"Just this,\" replied Pennington, hanging his head. \"I went into a drug\nstore and asked a clerk that I know what was the best thing for\ntoothache. He told me the best he knew was to smoke a pipe of opium, and\ntold me where to find Chow Hop, and what to say to the chink. And it's\nall a lie about opium helping a sore tooth,\" cried the wretched\nmidshipman, clapping a hand to his jaw, \"for there goes that fiendish\ntooth again! But say! You fellows are not going to leak about my little\nmishap?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Darrin with great promptness. \"You're going to do that\nyourself.\"\n\n\"What?\" gasped Midshipman Pennington in intense astonishment. \"What are\nyou talking about?\"\n\n\"You'll be wise to turn in a report, on what happened,\" pursued Dave,\n\"for it's likely to reach official ears, anyway, and you'll be better\noff if you make the first report on the subject.\"\n\n\"Why is it likely to reach official ears, if you fellows keep your\nmouths shut?\"\n\n\"You see,\" Darrin went on very quietly, \"I reported the joint at the\npolice station, and Chow Hop threatened that, if I did, he'd tell all he\nknew about everybody. So you'd better be first----\"\n\n\"You broke the game out to the police!\" gasped Pennington, staring\ndumfoundedly at his comrade. \"What on earth----\"\n\n\"I did it because I had more than one satisfactory reason for\nconsidering it my duty,\" interposed Dave, speaking quietly though\nfirmly.\n\n\"You--you--bag of wind!\" exploded Midshipman Pennington.\n\n\"I'll accept your apology when you've had time to think it all over,\"\nreplied Dave, with a smile, though there was a brief flash in his eyes.\n\n\"I'll make no apology to you--at any time, you--you--greaser!\"\n\nMarks for efficiency or good conduct, which increase a midshipman's\nstanding, are called \"grease-marks\" or \"grease\" in midshipman slang.\nHence a midshipman who is accused of currying favor with his officers in\norder to win \"grease\" is contemptuously termed a \"greaser.\"\n\n\"I don't want to talk with you any more, Mr. Darrin,\" Pennington went on\nbitterly, \"or walk with you, either. When I get over this toothache I'll\ncall you out--you greaser!\"\n\nBurning with indignation, Midshipman Pennington fell back to walk with\nHallam.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n\nDAVE'S PAP-SHEET ADVICE\n\nWhen our party reached the landing a lively scene lay before them.\n\nFully a hundred midshipmen, belonging to the first, second and third\nclasses, were waiting to be transported out to one or another of the\ngreat, gray battleships.\n\nSeveral launches were darting back and forth over the water. The baggage\nof the midshipmen had already been taken aboard the battleships. Only\nthe young men themselves were now awaited.\n\nNear-by stood a lieutenant of the Navy, who was directing the\nembarkation of the midshipmen of the different classes.\n\nFive minutes after our party arrived a launch from the \"Massachusetts\"\nlay in alongside the landing.\n\n\"Third classmen, this way!\" shouted the lieutenant. \"How many of you?\"\n\nTurning his eyes over the squad that had moved forward, the officer\ncontinued:\n\n\"Twenty-two. You can all crowd into this launch. Move quickly, young\ngentlemen!\"\n\nIn another couple of minutes the puffing launch was steaming away to the\nmassive battleship that lay out in the stream.\n\nDave stood well up in the bow. Once he barely overheard Pennington\nmutter to a comrade:\n\n\"The rascally greaser!\"\n\n\"That means me,\" Dave muttered under his breath. \"I won't take it up\nnow, or in any hurry. I'll wait until Pen has had time to see things\nstraight.\"\n\nAs soon as the launch lay alongside, the young midshipmen clambered\nnimbly up the side gangway, each raising his cap to the flag at the\nstern as he passed through the opening in the rail.\n\nHere stood an officer with an open book in his hand. To him each\nmidshipman reported, saluting, stated his name, and received his\nberthing.\n\n\"Hurry away to find your berthings, and get acquainted with the\nlocation,\" ordered this officer. \"Every midshipman will report on the\nquarter-deck promptly at five p.m. In the meantime, after locating your\nberthings, you are at liberty to range over the ship, avoiding the ward\nroom and the staterooms of officers.\"\n\nThe latest arrivals saluted. Then, under the guidance of messengers\nchosen from among the apprentice members of the crew, the young men\nlocated their berthings.\n\n\"I'm going to get mine changed, if I can,\" growled Pennington, wheeling\nupon Dave Darrin. \"I'm much too close to a greaser. I'm afraid I may get\nmy uniforms spotted, as well as my character.\"\n\n\"Stop that, Pen!\" warned Dave, stationing himself squarely before the\nangry Pennington. \"I don't know just how far you're responsible for what\nyou're saying now. To-morrow, if you make any such remarks to me, you'll\nhave to pay a mighty big penalty for them.\"\n\n\"You'll make me pay by going to the commandant and telling him all you\nknow, I suppose?\" sneered Pennington.\n\n\"You know better, Pen! Now, begin to practise keeping a civil tongue\nbehind your teeth!\"\n\nWith that, Darrin turned on his heel, seeking the deck.\n\nThis left \"Pen\" to conjecture as to whether he should report his\nmisadventure, and, if so, how best to go about it.\n\n\"See here, Hallam,\" began the worried midshipman, \"I begin to feel that\nit will be safer to turn in some kind of report on myself.\"\n\n\"Much safer,\" agreed Hallam. \"It will show good faith on your part if\nyou report yourself.\"\n\n\"And get me broken from the service, too, I suppose,\" growled the\nunhappy one.\n\n\"I hardly think it will, if you report yourself first,\" urged Hallam.\n\"But you'll be about certain to get your walking papers if you wait for\nthe first information to come from other sources.\"\n\n\"Hang it,\" groaned Pennington, \"I wish I could think, but my head aches\nas though it would split and my tooth is putting up more trouble than I\never knew there was in the world. And, in this racked condition, I'm to\ngo and put myself on the pap-sheet. In what way shall I do it, Hallam?\nCan't you suggest something?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" retorted Hallam with great energy. \"Go to the medical officer and\ntell him how your tooth troubles you. Tell him what you tried on shore.\nI'll go with you, if you want.\"\n\n\"Will you, old man? I'll be a thousand times obliged!\"\n\nSo the pair went off in search of the sick-bay, as the hospital part of\na battleship is called. The surgeon was not in his office adjoining, but\nthe hospital steward called him over one of the ship telephones,\ninforming him that a midshipman was suffering with an ulcerated tooth.\n\nDr. Mackenzie came at once, turned on a reflector light, and gazed into\nMidshipman Pennington's mouth.\n\n\"Have you tried to treat this tooth yourself, in any way?\" queried the\nship's surgeon.\n\n\"Yes, sir; I was so crazy with the pain, while in Annapolis, that I am\nafraid I did something that will get me into trouble,\" replied\nPennington, with a quiver in his voice.\n\n\"What was that?\" asked Dr. Mackenzie, glancing at him sharply. \"Did you\ntry the aid of liquor?\"\n\n\"Worse, I'm afraid, sir.\"\n\n\"Worse?\"\n\nPennington told of his experience with the opium pipe.\n\n\"That's no good whatever for a toothache, sir,\" growled Dr. Mackenzie.\n\"Besides, it's a serious breach of discipline. I shall have to report\nyou, Mr. Pennington.\"\n\n\"I expected it, sir,\" replied Pennington meekly.\n\n\"However, the report won't cure your toothache,\" continued Dr. Mackenzie\nin a milder tone. \"We'll attend to that first.\"\n\nThe surgeon busied himself with dissolving a drug in a small quantity of\nwater. This he took up in a hypodermic needle and injected into the\nlower jaw.\n\n\"The ache ought to stop in ten minutes, sir,\" continued the surgeon,\nturning to enter some memoranda in his record book.\n\nAfter that the surgeon called up the ship's commander over the 'phone,\nand made known Pennington's report.\n\n\"Mr. Pennington, Captain Scott directs that you report at his office\nimmediately,\" said the surgeon, as he turned away from the telephone.\n\n\"Very good, sir. Thank you, sir.\"\n\nBoth midshipmen saluted, then left the sick-bay.\n\n\"This is where you have to go up alone, I guess,\" hinted Midshipman\nHallam.\n\n\"I'm afraid so,\" sighed Pennington.\n\n\"However, I'll be on the quarter-deck, and, if I'm wanted, you can send\nthere for me.\"\n\n\"Thank you, old man. You're worth a brigade of Darrins--confound the\ngreasing meddler!\"\n\n\"Darrin acted according to his best lights on the subject of duty,\"\nremonstrated Mr. Hallam mildly.\n\n\"His best lights--bah!\" snarled Pennington. \"I'll take this all out of\nhim before I'm through with him!\"\n\nPennington reported to the battleship's commander. After some ten\nminutes a marine orderly found Hallam and directed him to go to Captain\nScott's office. Here Hallam repeated as much as was asked of him\nconcerning the doings of the afternoon. Incidentally, the fact of\nMidshipman Darrin's report to the police was brought out.\n\n\"Mr. Pennington, I shall send you at once, in a launch, over to the\ncommandant of cadets to report this matter in person to him,\" said\nCaptain Scott gravely. \"Mr. Hallam, you will go with Mr. Pennington.\"\n\nThen, after the two had departed, an apprentice messenger went through\nthe ship calling Dave's name. That young man was summoned to Captain\nScott's office.\n\n\"I am in possession of all the facts relating to the unfortunate affair\nof Midshipman Pennington, Mr. Darrin,\" began Captain Scott, after the\ninterchange of salutes. \"Will you tell me why you reported the affair to\nthe police?\"\n\n\"I went to the police, sir,\" Dave replied, \"because I was aware that\nmany members of the new fourth class are away from home for the first\ntime in their lives. I was afraid, sir, that possibly some of the new\nmidshipmen might, during one of their town-leaves, be tempted to try for\na new experience.\"\n\n\"A very excellent reason, Mr. Darrin, and I commend you heartily for it.\nI shall also report your exemplary conduct to the commandant of\nmidshipmen. You have, in my opinion, Mr. Darrin, displayed very good\njudgment, and you acted upon that judgment with promptness and decision.\nBut I am afraid,\" continued the Navy captain dryly, \"that you have done\nsomething that will make you highly unpopular, for a while, with some of\nthe members of your class.\"\n\n\"I hope not, sir,\" replied Dave.\n\n\"So do I,\" smiled Captain Scott \"I am willing to find myself a poor\nprophet. That is all, Mr. Darrin.\"\n\nOnce more saluting, Dave left the commanding officer's presence. Almost\nthe first classmate into whom he stumbled was Dan Dalzell.\n\n\"Well, from what quarter does the wind blow!\" murmured Dan.\n\nDarrin repeated the interview that he had just had.\n\n\"I'm afraid, Dave, little giant, that you've planted something of a mine\nunder yourself,\" murmured Dalzell.\n\n\"I feel as much convinced as ever, Danny boy, that I did just what I\nshould have done,\" replied Darrin seriously.\n\n\"And so does Captain Scott, and so will the commandant,\" replied Dan.\n\"But winning the commendation of your superior officers doesn't always\nimply that you'll get much praise from your classmates.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, you are quite right,\" smiled Dave. \"Still, I'd do the\nsame thing over again.\"\n\n\"Oh, of course you would,\" assented Dan. \"That's because you're Dave\nDarrin.\"\n\nHere a voice like a bass horn was heard.\n\n\"All third classmen report to the quarter-deck immediately!\"\n\nThis order was repeated in other parts of the ship. Midshipmen gathered\nwith a rush, Pennington and Hallam being the only members absent. As\nsoon as the third classmen, or \"youngsters,\" as they are called in\nmidshipman parlance, had formed, the orders were read off dividing them\ninto sections for practical instruction aboard ship during the cruise.\n\nDave's name was one of the first read off. He was assigned to duty as\nsection leader for the first section in electrical instruction. Dalzell,\nFarley, Hallam, Pennington and others were detailed as members of that\nsection.\n\nThe same section was also designated for steam instruction, Dalzell\nbeing made leader of the section in this branch.\n\nThe class was then dismissed. Somewhat later Pennington and Hallam\nreturned from their interview with the commandant.\n\nHallam at once sought out Dave.\n\n\"Darry, old man,\" murmured Hallam, \"Pen is as crazy as a hornet against\nyou. As he had taken the first step by sticking himself on the pap-sheet\n(placing himself on report), the commandant said he would make the\npunishment a lighter one.\"\n\n\"What did Pen get?\" queried Dave.\n\n\"Fifty demerits, with all the loss of privileges that fifty carry.\"\n\n\"He's lucky,\" declared Dave promptly. \"Had the report come from other\nsources, he would have been dismissed from the service.\"\n\n\"If Pen's lucky,\" rejoined Hallam, \"he doesn't seem to realize the fact.\nHe's calling you about everything.\"\n\n\"He can keep that up,\" flashed Dave, \"until his toothache leaves him.\nThen, if he tries to carry it any further, Pen will collide with one of\nmy fists!\"\n\nNot much later a call sounded summoning the youngsters to the\nmidshipmen's mess. Dave was glad to note that Pennington sat at some\ndistance from him at table.\n\nWhile the meal was in progress the \"Massachusetts\" and the other\nbattleships got under way. The midshipmen were on deck, an hour later,\nwhen the fleet came to anchor for the night, some miles down Chesapeake\nBay.\n\nBefore the youngsters were ordered to their berths that night Third\nClassman Pennington had found opportunity to do a good deal of talking\nto a few comrades who would listen to him.\n\nPennington was determined to stir up a hornet's nest for Dave Darrin.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n\nMIDSHIPMAN PENNINGTON GOES TOO FAR\n\nAt eight o'clock the following morning the various sections were formed\nand marched to the deck.\n\nDave reported:\n\n\"All present, sir.\"\n\nThe chief electrician was now summoned, and to him the section was\nturned over. This young man, Whittam, by name, was an enlisted man, but\na bright young sample of what the Navy can do for the boy who enlists as\nan apprentice.\n\n\"You will take your orders from Mr. Whittam as though he were an\nofficer,\" directed the officer, his words intended for all members of\nthe section, though he looked only at Darrin.\n\nDave saluted, then, as Chief Electrician Whittam turned to lead the way,\nDave called quietly:\n\n\"Section, left wheel--march!\"\n\nThey followed Whittam down into the dynamo room, an interesting spot for\na machinist.\n\n\"It's fine,\" muttered Dan, as he stared about him at the bright metal\nwork, the switch-board and the revolving machines. \"But I'm afraid I\ncouldn't learn the use and sense of all this in five years.\"\n\n\"Silence in the section,\" commanded Dave, turning around upon his chum.\n\nWhittam now began a short, preliminary talk upon the subjects in which\nthe midshipmen would be required to qualify.\n\n\"One of the first and most important requests I have to make,\" said\nWhittam presently, \"is that none of you touch the switches, except by\ndirection. None of you can guess the harm that might follow the careless\nand ignorant handling of a switch.\"\n\n\"It's pretty cheeky for an enlisted man to talk to midshipmen about\nignorance,\" whispered Pennington to Farley.\n\n\"Oh, I don't know--\" Farley started to reply, but Darrin's quiet voice\nbroke in with authority:\n\n\"Cease talking in section.\"\n\nFarley knew this to be a merited rebuke, and accepted it as such, but\nPennington's face went violently red.\n\n\"Confound that grease-spot-chaser,\" growled Pen. \"He'll be bound to take\nit out of me as long as the cruise lasts. But I'll get even with him. No\ncheap greaser is going to ride over me!\"\n\nThat morning none of the midshipmen were called upon to handle any of\nthe fascinating-looking machinery. Nearly the whole of this tour of\npractical instruction was taken up by the remarks of the chief\nelectrician. As he spoke, Whittam moved over to one piece or another of\nmechanism and explained its uses. Finally, he began to question the\nattentive young men, to see how much of his instruction they had\nabsorbed.\n\n\"This is a shame, to set an enlisted man up over us as quiz-master, just\nto see how little we know,\" growled Pennington; but this time he had the\ngood sense not to address his remark to anyone.\n\nPennington was not yet in good shape, after his harrowing experiences of\nthe day before.\n\nEre the tour of instruction was over, he began to shift somewhat\nuneasily.\n\nThen his attention began to wander.\n\nA brilliantly shining brass rod near him caught his eye. Something about\nthe glossy metal fascinated him.\n\nOnce or twice Pen put out his hand to touch the rod, but as quickly\nreconsidered and drew back his hand.\n\nAt last, however, the temptation proved too strong. He slid one hand\nalong the rail.\n\n\"Here, sir, don't handle that!\" rasped in the voice of Whittam.\n\nPennington drew back his hand, a flush mounting to his face.\n\n\"The fellow has no right to talk to a midshipman in that fashion!\"\nquivered Pennington to himself. \"But it was the fault of that low-minded\ngreaser Darrin, anyway. Darrin saw me, and he glanced swiftly at the\nchief electrician to draw attention to me.\"\n\nIt is only just to Pennington to state that he actually believed he had\nseen Dave do this. Darrin, however, was not guilty of the act. He had in\nno way sought to direct attention at Pennington.\n\nTowards the close of the tour the officer in whose department this\ninstruction fell passed through the dynamo room.\n\n\"Are there any breaches of conduct to be reported, Whittam?\" inquired\nthe officer, halting.\n\n\"Nothing worth mentioning, sir,\" replied the chief electrician.\n\n\"I asked you, Whittam, whether there had been any breaches of conduct,\"\nretorted the officer with some asperity.\n\n\"One midshipman, sir, after having been instructed to touch nothing,\nrested his hand on one of the brass rods.\"\n\n\"His name?\"\n\n\"I don't know the names of many of the young gentlemen yet, sir, so I\ndon't know the particular midshipman's name, sir.\"\n\n\"Then point him out to me,\" insisted the officer.\n\nThere was hardly any need to do so. Pennington's face, flushed with\nmortification, was sufficient identification. But the chief electrician\nstepped over, halting in front of the hapless one, and said:\n\n\"This is the young gentleman, sir.\"\n\n\"Your name, sir?\" demanded the officer.\n\n\"Pennington, sir.\"\n\n\"Mr. Pennington, you will place yourself on the report, sir, for\ndisobedience of orders,\" commanded the officer. \"Is this the only case,\nWhittam?\"\n\n\"The only case, sir.\"\n\nThe officer passed out of the dynamo room, leaving the unlucky one more\nthan ever angry with Darrin, whom he incorrectly charged with his\npresent trouble.\n\nThe recall sounding, Dave turned to Whittam, saying crisply but\npleasantly:\n\n\"Thank you for our instruction.\"\n\n\"He's thanking the fellow for my new scrape,\" growled Pennington\ninwardly.\n\nDave marched his section back to deck and dismissed it. Dan Dalzell, as\nsection leader in steam instruction, immediately re-formed it.\n\n\"You will report in the engine-room, Mr. Dalzell, to\nLieutenant-Commander Forman, who is chief engineer of this ship. He will\nassign you to an instructor.\"\n\n\"Aye, aye, sir,\" Dan replied, saluting. \"Section, right wheel--march!\"\n\nDan already knew where, down in the bowels of the great battleship, to\nfind the engine room.\n\nReaching that department, Dan halted his section.\n\n\"Section all present, sir,\" reported Dan, saluting a strange officer,\nwho, however, wore the insignia of a lieutenant-commander.\n\n\"Your name, sir?\" inquired the officer.\n\n\"Dalzell, sir.\"\n\n\"Let your section break ranks. Then you may all follow me, and keep your\neyes open, for you will go through one or two dark places.\"\n\n\"Aye, aye, sir. Section break ranks.\"\n\nLieutenant-Commander Forman led the way, with all the members of the\nsection wondering what was to be the nature of their first day's work in\nthe engineer department.\n\nDescending lower into the ship, the chief engineer led the young middies\nover a grating, and paused at the head of an iron ladder.\n\n\"Pass down in orderly fashion, single file,\" directed the chief\nengineer, halting. \"When at the foot of this ladder, cross a grating to\nport side, and then descend a second ladder, which you will find.\"\n\nAll the midshipmen went down the first ladder in silence. Dan, who had\npreceded the others, crossed the grating and found the second ladder.\n\nOnce more these youngsters descended. Pennington, as though by mere\naccident, succeeded in following Dave Darrin down the ladder.\n\nJust as they were near the bottom Dave felt a foot descend upon his\nshoulder, almost with a kick, and then rest there with a crushing\npressure.\n\nIt hurt keenly until Darrin was able to dodge out from under and\nhurriedly reach the bottom.\n\n\"Pardon, whoever you are,\" came a gruff voice.\n\nDave, with his shoulder crippled a good deal, and paining keenly, halted\nas soon as his foot had touched bottom. It was dark down there, though\nsome reflected light came from an incandescent light at a distance.\n\nDave waited, to peer into the face of the man who had stepped on his\nshoulder.\n\nIt was Pennington, of course!\n\n\"I'll take pains not to go down ahead of you again, or to follow you up\na ladder,\" grunted Darrin suspiciously.\n\n\"Oh, are you the man on whose shoulder my foot rested?\" asked\nPennington, with apparent curiosity.\n\n\"Didn't you know it!\" questioned Darrin, looking straight into the\nother's eyes.\n\nInstead of answering intelligibly, Pennington turned and walked away a\nfew feet.\n\n\"Perhaps that fellow thinks he's going to vent his spite on me in a lot\nof petty ways,\" murmured Dave. \"If that is the idea he has in his head,\nhe's going to wake up one of these days!\"\n\nFollowing the last midshipman came Lieutenant-Commander Forman.\n\n\"After me, gentlemen,\" directed the chief engineer. He turned down a\nnarrow passage, only a few feet long, and came out in the furnace room.\n\nHere huge fires glowed through the furnace doors. Four of the Navy's\nfiremen stood resting on their shovels. Instantly, on perceiving the\nchief engineer, however, the men stood at attention.\n\n\"Pass the word for the chief water tender,\" ordered the engineer,\nturning to one of the firemen.\n\nThe messenger soon came back with a pleasant-faced, stalwart man of\nforty.\n\n\"Heistand,\" ordered the chief engineer, \"give these members of the first\nsection, third: class, steam instruction, a thorough drill in firing.\"\n\n\"Aye, aye, sir,\" replied the chief water tender, saluting.\n\n\"Heistand's orders are mine, Mr. Dalzell,\" continued the\nlieutenant-commander, facing Dan. \"Preserve order in your section.\"\n\n\"Aye, aye, sir,\" replied Dan, saluting. Acknowledging this courtesy in\nkind, the chief engineer turned and left the furnace room.\n\nHeistand was presumably of German parentage, though he had no accent. He\nstruck the midshipmen as being a pleasant, wholesome fellow, though the\nwater tenders and firemen of the \"Massachusetts\" knew that he could be\nextremely strict and grim at need.\n\n\"You will now, young gentlemen,\" began Heistand, \"proceed to learn all\nabout priming a furnace, lighting, building, cleaning and generally\ntaking care of a fire. Two furnaces have been left idle for this\ninstruction.\"\n\nBut two of the regular firemen now remained in the room. These were\nordered to hustle out coal before boilers B and D. Then Heistand taught\nthe members of the section how to swing a shovel to the best advantage\nso as to get in a maximum of coal with the least effort. He also\nillustrated two or three incorrect ways of shoveling coal.\n\n\"The idea of making coal heavers out of us!\" growled a much-disgusted\nvoice.\n\nDan did not see who the speaker was, but his eyes flashed as he turned\nand rasped out:\n\n\"Silence in the section! Speak only to ask for information, and then at\nthe proper time.\"\n\n\"Another young autocrat!\" muttered a voice.\n\n\"Wait one moment, please, Heistand,\" begged Dan. Then, wheeling squarely\nabout, and facing all the members of the section, he declared with\nemphasis:\n\n\"If there's any more unauthorized talking I shall feel obliged to pass\nthe word above that discipline is in a bad way in this section.\"\n\nThen he wheeled about once more, facing the chief water tender.\n\n\"Now, young gentlemen,\" resumed the chief water tender, \"take your\nshovels and fill in lively under boilers B and D.\"\n\nThree or four times Heistand checked one or another of the midshipmen,\nto show him a more correct way of handling the shovel. Yet, in good\ntime, both furnaces were primed.\n\n\"Now, Mr. Dalzell, please detail four members of the section to follow\nme with their shovels and bring red coals from under another boiler.\"\n\nDan appointed himself, Darrin, Farley and Pennington.\n\nBurning coals were brought and thrown into each furnace, and in a little\nwhile roaring fires were going. These, though not needed for the\nhandling of the battleship, were permitted to burn for a while, Heistand\nexplaining to the section practically the uses of the water gauges and\nthe test cocks. By this time the midshipmen's white working clothes were\nliberally sprinkled with coal dust and somewhat smeared with oils.\n\n\"And now, young gentlemen, as we have no further use for these fires,\nyou will next learn how to haul them,\" announced Heistand.\n\nThis was interesting work, but hot and fast. The implements with which\nthe middies worked soon became red-hot at the end. Yet, as all entered\ninto this novel work with zest, the fires had soon been hauled out on to\nthe floor plates.\n\nJust as the last of this work was being done Pennington, as an apparent\naccident due to excess of zeal, dropped the red-hot end of his implement\nacross the toe of Darrin's left shoe.\n\nIn an instant the leather began to blaze. With swift presence of mind\nDave stepped his right foot on the flame, smothering it at once.\n\nBut he was \"mad clean through.\"\n\n\"See here, Pen,\" he muttered, in a low voice, his eyes blazing fiercely\ninto the other midshipman's, \"that is the last piece of impudence that\nwill be tolerated from you.\"\n\nMidshipman Pennington's lip curled disdainfully.\n\nDan had not seen the \"accident,\" but he was near enough to hear the\ntalking, and he caught Dave at it. So Dan ordered, impartially:\n\n\"Mr. Darrin, you will place yourself on report for unauthorized talking\nin section!\"\n\nDave flushed still more hotly, but said nothing.\n\nMidshipman Dalzell now marched the section from the furnace room, and\ndismissed it. It was near noon, and would soon be time for the middies\nto eat.\n\nDave hurried away, washed, changed his uniform, and then stepped away\nswiftly to place himself on the report.\n\n\"I was sorry to do that, old chum,\" murmured Dan, as he met Dave\nreturning. \"But of course I couldn't play favorites. What made you so\nfar forget yourself?\"\n\n\"A something that would have had the same effect on you,\" retorted Dave\ngrimly. Thereupon he described Pennington's two underhanded assaults\nthat morning.\n\n\"Humph!\" muttered Dalzell. \"That fellow Pen is bound to go the whole\nlimit with you.\"\n\n\"He won't go much further,\" declared Dave, his eyes flashing.\n\n\"And the chump ought to know it, too,\" mused Dan. \"The class history of\nthe last year should have taught him that. But see here, Dave, I don't\nbelieve Pen will do anything openly. He will construct a series of\nplausible accidents.\"\n\n\"There will be one thing about him that will be open, if he goes any\nfurther,\" retorted Dave, \"and that will be his face when he collides\nwith my fist.\"\n\n\"I hope I see that when it happens,\" grinned Dalzell. \"It's bound to be\nentertaining!\"\n\n\"Wait a second, then. Here comes Pennington now,\" murmured Dave Darrin\nin an undertone.\n\nPennington, in his immaculate blue uniform, like the chums, came\nstrolling along the passageway between decks.\n\nHe affected not to see the chums, and would have passed by. But Dave,\neyeing him closely, waited until Pen was barely three feet away. Then\nDarrin said tersely:\n\n\"Mr. Pennington, I wish an understanding with you.\"\n\n\"I don't want any with you,\" replied Pennington insolently, as he stared\nat Dave from under much-raised eyebrows. He would have gone by, but Dave\nsprang squarely in front of him.\n\n\"Just wait a moment!\" warned Dave rather imperiously, for he was aglow\nwith justifiable indignation.\n\n\"Well?\" demanded Pennington halting. \"Out with it, whatever you may\nthink you have to say.\"\n\n\"I have two things to speak about,\" replied Dave, trying to control his\nvoice. \"In the first place, while going down the ladders to the furnaces\nthis morning, you stepped on my shoulder.\"\n\n\"Well!\" insisted Pennington coldly.\n\n\"The second thing you did was, when hauling the fires, to drop red-hot\nmetal across one of my shoes, setting it on fire.\"\n\n\"Well?\" insisted Pennington more coldly.\n\n\"If you mean to contend that either one was an accident,\" resumed Dave,\n\"then--\"\n\nBut he found himself obliged to pause for a moment in order to steady\nhis voice.\n\n\"Well?\" asked Pennington with more insolence than ever.\n\n\"If you make such pretense in either case,\" tittered Dave Darrin, \"then\nyou're a liar!\"\n\n\"Fellow!\" sputtered Pennington, turning white with anger.\n\n\"I mean what I say, and I can back it up,\" muttered Darrin.\n\n\"Then I'll make you eat your words!\" roared Pennington.\n\nClenching his fists and with the boxer's attitude, Pen aimed two swift\nblows at Darrin.\n\nNeither blow reached, however, for Dave dodged out of the way. Then\nDarrin struck back, a straight, true, forceful blow that landed on the\nother midshipman's nose, knocking him down.\n\nPennington staggered somewhat when he rose, but he was quickly up, none\nthe less, and ready for anything that might happen.\n\nAll of a sudden Dan Dalzell felt his own heart going down into his\nshoes. One of the ship's officers had just entered the passageway, in\ntime to see what was going on.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n\nA LITTLE MEETING ASHORE\n\n\"Stop it, both of you,\" whispered Dan.\n\n\"Stand at attention, ready to salute the officer.\"\n\nPennington, with the blood flowing from his damaged nose, would have\nmade a most ludicrous figure saluting!\n\nThe instant that he saw such evidence as Pen's nose presented the\nofficer would be bound to make inquiries.\n\nThen, just as surely, his next step must be to Border the three before\nthe commandant of midshipmen.\n\nFighting carries with it a severe penalty. Even Dan was certain to be\nreported, through the mere fact of his presence there, as aiding in a\nfight. And those who aid are punished as severely as the principals\nthemselves.\n\nIt was a tense, fearsome instant, for midshipmen have been dismissed\nfrom the Naval Academy for this very offense.\n\nThe passage was not brilliantly lighted.\n\nThe on-coming officer, a lieutenant, junior grade, was looking at the\nfloor as he came along.\n\nSuddenly he paused, seemed lost in thought, then wheeled and walked back\nwhence he had come.\n\nDan breathed more easily. Dave heaved a sigh of relief.\n\nAs for Pennington, that midshipman had wheeled and was stealing rapidly\ndown the passageway, intent only on escape.\n\n\"That was the closest squeak we'll ever have without being ragged cold,\"\nmurmured Dalzell tremulously.\n\n\"Where is Pennington?\" demanded Dave, wheeling about after he had\nwatched the Naval lieutenant out of sight.\n\n\"Ducked out of sight, like a submarine,\" chuckled Dan.\n\nAt that moment the call for midshipmen's dinner formation sounded. Dave\nand Dan were ready.\n\nPennington showed up just after the line had started to march into the\nmidshipmen's mess tables.\n\nTo the inquiry of the officer in charge, Pen lamely explained that he\nhad bumped his nose into something hard in a poorly lighted passageway.\n\nThough the officer accepted the excuse, he smiled within himself.\n\n\"It wasn't iron or steel that bumped that young man's nose,\" thought the\nofficer.\n\n\"Oh, the middies haven't changed a lot since I boned at Annapolis!\"\n\nPennington's nose was no very lovely member of his face at that moment.\nIt had been struck hard, mashed rather flat, and now looked like a red\nbulb.\n\n\"Meet with an accident, Pen?\" asked Hallam curiously at table.\n\n\"Quit your kidding, please,\" requested Pennington sulkily.\n\nThat directed the curious glances of other middies at Pennington's new\nbulbous nose.\n\nThe young man was so brusque about it, however, that other table mates\nceased quizzing him.\n\nYet, as soon as the meal was over, many a youngster asked others of his\nclass for news regarding Pen. But none possessed it.\n\nDuring the brief rest that followed the meal, however, Midshipman\nPennington made it his business to try to meet Dave Darrin alone. He\nsucceeded, finding Dave staring off across the water at the port rail.\n\n\"Of course, Mr. Darrin,\" began the other midshipman, in a voice\nsuggestive of ice, \"you are aware that the incident of an hour ago\ncannot be allowed to pass unnoticed.\"\n\n\"I don't believe there's any danger of that,\" retorted Darrin, with an\nironical glance at Pennington's damaged-looking nose.\n\n\"Confound you, sir,\" hissed the other midshipman, \"don't you dare to be\ninsolent with me.\"\n\n\"Why, I had thought,\" observed Dave, \"that, of your own choice, the\nperiod of courtesies between us had passed.\"\n\n\"I shall call you out, Mr. Darrin!\"\n\n\"You'll find my hearing excellent,\" smiled Dave. \"I shall make but one\nstipulation.\"\n\n\"I'll do you the favor of asking what that stipulation is,\" sneered\nPennington.\n\n\"Why, after the narrow escape we had from being caught and reported, an\nhour or so ago, I shall ask that the fight be held where we are not so\nlikely to be caught at it. I don't care about being dropped from the\nNaval Academy, nor do I believe you do.\"\n\n\"It would be a good thing for the service, if one of us were to be\ndropped,\" sneered Pennington.\n\n\"Yes! Oh, well, you can easily procure writing materials from the\ncaptain's clerk,\" volunteered Dave generously. \"On a cruise, I believe,\na resignation is sent direct to the commandant of midshipmen.\"\n\nThis ridicule served only to fan the flame of Pennington's wrath.\n\n\"Darrin,\" he hissed, \"the Academy isn't big enough to hold us both!\"\n\n\"But I've already told you how to get out,\" protested Dave coolly.\n\n\"I don't intend to get out!\"\n\n\"No more do I,\" rejoined Dave. \"I won't even toss pennies with you to\nfind out who quits the service.\"\n\n\"Mr. Darrin, you are merely seeking to divert my mind from what I have\nsaid.\"\n\n\"What did you say--particularly?\"\n\n\"That you would have to fight me.\"\n\n\"I have already signified my entire willingness, Mr. Pennington. To that\nI really can add nothing.\"\n\nFourth classmen are always addressed as \"mister,\" and they must use the\nsame \"handle to the name\" when addressing upper classmen. But members of\nthe three upper classes resort to the use of \"mister,\" in addressing\nclassmates, only when they wish to be offensive or nearly so.\n\n\"I will send a friend to meet you,\" Pennington continued.\n\n\"Why, I thought,\" bantered Darrin ironically, \"that you were going to\nfight me yourself.\"\n\n\"So I am--be sure of it. I will amend my statement by saying that I will\nsend a second to see you.\"\n\n\"Save time by sending him to Dalzell.\"\n\n\"Very good, Mr. Darrin.\"\n\n\"Is that all you wished to say to me?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Very good, Mr. Pennington.\"\n\nWith two very stiff nods the midshipmen parted.\n\nPennington hastened at once in search of Hallam.\n\n\"Will you serve me, old man?\" queried Pennington.\n\n\"Sorry, but----\"\n\n\"Well, you see, Pen, not knowing all the facts of the case, I must admit\nthat all my sympathies are with Darrin.\"\n\n\"All your sympathies?\" echoed Pen, frowning.\n\n\"Well, nearly all, anyway. You see, I've known and observed Darrin for a\nfull year now, and I don't believe patient old Darry is the one to start\nany trouble.\"\n\n\"He called me a liar,\" protested Pennington.\n\n\"Did he?\" gasped Hallam.\n\n\"Well, he qualified the statement, but his way of saying it was as\noffensive as the direct lie could have been.\"\n\n\"So you're bent on fighting Darry?\"\n\n\"I am.\"\n\n\"Too bad!\" muttered Hallam, shaking his head.\n\n\"Are you anxious for your idol?\" asked Pen in a disagreeable tone.\n\n\"No, Penny; it's you that I'm concerned about in my own mind. You're\ngoing next to a very hard proposition. Darry is patient--almost as\npatient as the proverbial camel--but when he fights he fights! You'll be\nhammered to a pulp, Pen.\"\n\n\"Pooh!\"\n\n\"No one has yet beaten Darrin at a fist fight.\"\n\n\"There always has to be a first time, you know.\"\n\n\"And you think you're It?\"\n\n\"As far as Darrin is concerned--yes.\"\n\n\"Too bad--too bad!\" sighed Hallam. \"I'm afraid, Penny, that the heat in\nthe furnace room was too much for you this morning.\"\n\n\"Then you won't serve as one of my seconds?\"\n\n\"The honor is most regretfully declined,\" replied Hallam in a tone of\nmock sadness.\n\n\"You want to see Darrin win?\"\n\n\"If there has to be a fight, I do,\" replied Midshipman Hallam.\n\n\"Don't bet your money on him, anyway.\"\n\n\"I'm not a gambler, Penny, and I don't bet,\" replied Hallam, with a\ndignity that, somehow, ended the conversation.\n\nPennington had considerable difficulty, at first, in finding a second.\nAt last, however, he induced Decker and Briggs to represent him.\n\nThese two midshipmen went to see Dan Dalzell.\n\n\"Wait until I send for Mr. Farley,\" proposed Dalzell. He soon had that\nmidshipman, who was wholly willing to serve Darrin in any capacity.\n\n\"We're ready to have the fight this evening,\" proposed Midshipman\nDecker.\n\n\"We're not,\" retorted Dan, with vigor.\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"This forenoon Pennington deliberately stepped on Darrin's shoulder,\nwith such force as to lame it a good deal,\" replied Dan. \"Our man\ninsists that he has a right to rest his shoulder, and to wait until\nto-morrow.\"\n\n\"But to-morrow we have a short shore liberty at Hampton Roads,\"\nremonstrated Briggs.\n\n\"Yes; and during that shore liberty we can have the fight more safely\nthan on board ship,\" insisted Dalzell.\n\n\"But we intended to devote our shore leave to pleasure,\" objected\nDecker.\n\n\"You'll find plenty of pleasure, if you accept our proposition,\" urged\nDan dryly. \"At any rate, we won't hear of Darrin fighting before\nto-morrow. He must have to-night to rest that shoulder.\"\n\n\"All right; so be it,\" growled Decker, after a side glance at Briggs.\n\n\"On shore, at some point to be selected by the seconds?\" asked Dan\nDalzell.\n\n\"Yes; that's agreed.\"\n\nDetails as to whom to invite as referee and time-keeper were also\narranged.\n\n\"I suppose we'll have to use up our shore leave that way, then,\" grunted\nPennington, when told of the arrangement.\n\n\"There's one way you can save the day,\" grinned Decker.\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"Put Darrin to sleep in the first round, then hurriedly dress and leave,\nand enjoy your time on shore.\"\n\n\"But Darrin is a very able man with his fists,\" observed Pennington.\n\n\"Yes; but you're a mile bigger and heavier, and you're spry, too. You\nought to handle him with all the ease in the world.\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" muttered Pennington, who didn't intend to make the\nmistake of bragging in advance. \"I'll do my best, of course.\"\n\n\"Oh, you'll win out, if you're awake,\" predicted Midshipman Briggs\nconfidently.\n\nWhen the cadets were called, the following morning, they found the\nbattleship fleet at anchor in Hampton Roads.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n\nWHEN THE SECONDS WONDERED\n\nOne after another the launches sped ashore, carrying their swarms of\ndistinguished looking young midshipmen.\n\nThe fight party managed to get off all in the same boat, and on one of\nthe earliest trips.\n\nPennington was to have ordinary shore leave on the cruise, his fifty\ndemerits to be paid for by loss of privileges on his return to the Naval\nAcademy.\n\n\"Decker,\" proposed Dan, \"you and I can skip away and find a good place\nin no time. Then we can come back after the others.\"\n\n\"That's agreeable to me,\" nodded Midshipman Decker.\n\nIn twenty minutes the two seconds were back.\n\n\"We've found just the place,\" announced Decker. \"And it isn't more than\nthree minutes' walk from here. Will you all hurry along?\"\n\n\"The place\" turned out to be a barn that had not been used for a year or\nmore. The floor was almost immaculately clean. In consideration of two\ndollars handed him, the owner had agreed to display no curiosity, and\nnot to mention the affair to any one.\n\n\"How do you like it, Darry?\" asked Dan anxiously.\n\n\"It will suit me as well as any other place,\" responded Dave, slipping\noff his blouse, folding it neatly and putting it aside, his uniform cap\nfollowing.\n\n\"And you?\" asked Decker of his man.\n\n\"The floor's hard, but I don't expect to be the man to hit it,\" replied\nPennington.\n\nIn five minutes both midshipmen were attired for their \"affair.\" Between\nthem the different members of the party had smuggled ashore shoes, old\ntrousers and belts for the fighters.\n\nIt being a class affair, Remington, of the third class, had come along\nas referee, while Dawley; was to be the time-keeper.\n\n\"If the principals are ready, let them step forward,\" ordered Midshipman\nRemington, going to the middle of the floor. \"Now, I understand that\nthis is to be a finish fight; rounds, two minutes; rests, two minutes. I\nalso understand that the principals do not care to shake hands before\nthe call to mix up.\"\n\nDarrin and Pennington nodded their assent.\n\n\"Take your places, gentlemen,\" ordered the referee quickly. \"Are you\nready, gentlemen?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" came from both principals.\n\n\"Time!\"\n\nBoth men had their guards up. As the word left the referee's lips each\ntried two or three passes which the other blocked. Midshipman Pennington\nwas trying to take his opponent's \"measure.\"\n\nThen Dave ducked, darted, dodged and wheeled about. Pennington had to\nfollow him, and it made the latter angry.\n\n\"Stand up and fight, can't you,\" hissed Pen.\n\n\"Silence during the rounds, Mr. Pennington,\" admonished the referee\nquietly. \"Let the officials do all the talking that may be necessary.\"\n\nDave, as he dodged again, and came up unscathed, grinned broadly over\nthis rebuke. That grin made Pen angrier than anything else could have\ndone.\n\n\"I'll wipe that grin off his face!\" muttered Pennington angrily.\n\nAnd this very thing Pennington tried hard to do. He was quick on his own\nfeet, and for a few seconds he followed the dodging Darrin about,\nraining in blows that required all of Dave's adroitness to escape.\n\nDave's very success, however, made his opponent all the angrier. From\nannoyance, followed by excessive irritation, Pennington went into almost\nblind rage--and the man who does that, anywhere in life, must always pay\nfor it.\n\nSuddenly Dave swung his right in on the point of Pen's chin with a force\nthat jolted the larger midshipman. As part of the same movement,\nDarrin's left crashed against Pennington's nose.\n\nThen, out of chivalry, Dave dropped back, to give Pen a few moments, in\ncase he needed them, to get his wits back.\n\n\"Time!\" roared Dawley, and Pennington's seconds pounced upon him and\nbore him away to his corner.\n\n\"Now I know how that fellow Darrin wins his fights,\" growled Pennington\nin an undertone. \"He keeps on running away until he has the other man\ngasping for breath. Then Darrin jumps in and wins.\"\n\n\"The method doesn't much matter,\" commented Briggs dryly, as he and\nDecker worked over their man. \"It's the result that counts. Rush Darry\ninto a tight corner, Pen, and then slam him hard and sufficiently.\"\n\n\"Thanks, fellows; now I'm all right for the second round.\" muttered\nMidshipman Pennington.\n\nIn a few seconds more Dave and his opponent were hard at work.\n\nDave still used his footwork, and most cleverly. Yet, wherever he went,\nPen followed him nimbly. It didn't look so one sided now.\n\nThen Pennington, at last, managed to deliver one blow on Darrin's right\nshort ribs. It took a lot of Dave's spare wind; he raced about, seeking\nto regain his wind before allowing close quarters. But at last\nPennington closed in again, and, after a swift feint, tried to land the\nsame short-rib blow.\n\nDarrin was watching, and blocked. Then, his temples reddening with\nanger, Dave swung in a huge one that crashed in under Pennington's right\near.\n\n\"Time!\" shouted Dawley, just as Pen went to the floor in a heap. That\nsaved the larger midshipman from having to take the count. His seconds\nhad him ready at the call for the third round.\n\nNow, suddenly, Darrin seemed to change not only his tactics, but his\nwhole personality. To his opponent Dave seemed suddenly transformed into\na dancing demon.\n\nIt was about the same old footwork, but it was aggressive now, instead\nof being defensive.\n\nFirst, Dave landed a light tap on the already suffering nose. A few\nseconds later he landed on the point of Pen's chin, though not hard\nenough to send his man down. Then a rather light blow on the jaw, just\nunder Pen's right ear again. The larger midshipman was now thoroughly\nalarmed. He feared that Darrin could do whatever he willed, and shivered\nwith wonder as to when the knockout blow would come.\n\nThe truth was, Pennington was still putting up a better battle than he\nhimself realized, and Darrin was not disposed to take any foolish\nchances through rushing the affair. Thus, the third round ended.\n\nBy the time that they came up for the fourth round, after both men had\nundergone some vigorous handling by their respective seconds, Pennington\nwas a good deal revived and far more confident.\n\nDave's tactics were the same in the fourth round. Pennington didn't find\ntime to develop much in the way of tactics for himself, save to defend\nhimself.\n\nDuring the first minute no important blows were landed on either side.\nThen, suddenly, Dave darted in and under, and brought a right-arm hook\nagainst Pen's nose in a way that started that member to bleeding again,\nand with a steady flow.\n\nThat jarred the larger midshipman. He plunged in, heavily and blindly,\nblocking one of Darrin's blows by wrapping both arms around him.\n\n\"None of that, Mr. Pennington! Break away fast!\" ordered Midshipman\nRemington quickly.\n\nDave took a fair get away, not attempting to strike as the clinch was\nbroken. But an instant later Dave came back, dancing all around his\ndazed opponent, landing on the short ribs, on the breast bone, under\neither ear and finally on the tip of the chin.\n\nPen was sure that none of these blows had been delivered with the force\nthat Darrin could have sent in.\n\n\"Time!\" shouted Midshipman Dawley.\n\nThe principals retired to their corners, Pennington almost wholly afraid\nfrom the conviction that his antagonist was now merely playing with him\nto keep the interest going.\n\nSo Pennington was still rather badly scared when the two came together\nfor the fifth round.\n\n\"Get lively, now, gentlemen, if you can,\" begged Referee Remington.\n\"Finish this one way or the other, and let us get some of the benefits\nof our shore leave.\"\n\nPen started by putting more steam behind every blow. Dave, who had used\nup so much of his wind by his brilliant footwork, began to find it\nharder to keep the upper hand.\n\nTwice, however, he managed to land body blows. He was trying to drive in\na third when Pennington blocked, following this with a left-arm jab on\nDarrin's left jaw that sent the lighter man to the floor.\n\nInstantly Dawley began to count off the seconds.\n\n\"--seven, eight, nine, te----\"\n\nDave was up on his feet. Pen tried to make a quick rush, but Darrin\ndodged cleverly, them wheeled and faced his opponent as the latter\nwheeled about.\n\nAfter that there was less footwork. Both men stood up to it, as keenly\nalert as they could be, each trying to drive home heavy blows. While\nthey were still at it the call of time sounded.\n\n\"Don't let him put it over you, David, little giant!\" warned Dan, as the\nlatter and Farley vigorously massaged Darrin's muscles. \"He all but had\nyou, and there isn't any need of making Pen a present of the meeting.\"\n\n\"I tried to get him,\" muttered Dave in an undertone, \"and I shall go on\ntrying to the last. But Pennington is pretty nearly superior to anyone\nin my class.\"\n\n\"Just waltz in and show him,\" whispered Dalzell, as the call sounded.\n\nPennington entered the sixth round with more confidence. He began, at\nthe outset, to drive in heavy blows, nor did Dave do much dodging.\n\nBump! Twenty-five seconds only of this round had gone when Darrin landed\nhis right fist with fearful force upon the high point of Pennington's\njaw.\n\nDown went the larger midshipman again. This time he moaned. His eyes\nwere open, though they had a somewhat glassy look in them.\n\nDawley was counting off the seconds in measured tones.\n\n\"--seven, eight, nine--ten!\"\n\nPen had struggled to rise to his feet, but sank back with a gasp of\ndespair and rage.\n\n\"Mr. Pennington loses the count and the fight,\" announced Referee\nRemington coolly. \"I don't believe we're needed here, Dawley. The\nseconds can handle the wreck. Come along.\"\n\nAs the two officials of the meeting hustled out of the barn, Dalzell\ngave his attention to helping his chum, while Farley went over to offer\nhis services in getting the vanquished midshipman into shape.\n\n\"There were times when I could have closed both of Pennington's eyes,\"\nmurmured Dave to Dan. \"But I didn't want to give him any disfiguring\nmarks that would start questions on board ship.\"\n\n\"You had him whipped from the start,\" murmured Dan confidently, as he\nsprayed, then rubbed Dave's chest and arms.\n\n\"Maybe, but I'm not so sure of that,\" rejoined Darrin. \"That fellow\nisn't so easy a prize for any one in my class. There were times when I\nwas all but convinced that he had me.\"\n\n\"Oh, fairy tales!\" grunted Dan.\n\n\"Have it your own way, then, Danny boy!\"\n\nWhen Darrin and his seconds left the barn they went off to enjoy what\nremained of the shore leave. Pennington's seconds finally, at his own\nrequest, left him at an ice cream parlor, where he proposed to remain\nuntil he could return to the big, steel \"Massachusetts\" without exciting\nany wonder over the little time he had remained ashore. Pennington had\nstrength to walk about, but he was far from being in really good shape,\nand preferred to keep quiet.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n\nIN TROUBLE ON FOREIGN SOIL\n\nFrom Hampton Roads the Battleship Squadron, with the midshipmen on\nboard, sailed directly for Plymouth, England.\n\nDuring most of the voyage over slow cruising speed was used. By the time\nthat England's coast was sighted the third-class middies found they knew\nmuch more about a battleship than they had believed to be possible at\nthe start of the voyage.\n\nThey had served as firemen; they had mastered many of the electrical\ndetails of a battleship; they had received instruction and had \"stood\ntrick\" by the engines; there had been some drill with the smaller,\nrapid-fire guns, and finally, they had learned at least the rudiments of\n\"wig-wagging,\" as signaling by means of signal flags is termed.\n\nIt was just before the call to supper formation when England's coast\nloomed up. Most of the midshipmen stood at the rail, watching eagerly\nfor a better glimpse at the coast.\n\nSome of the midshipmen, especially those who came from wealthier\nfamilies, had been in England before entering the Naval Academy. These\nfortunate ones were questioned eagerly by their comrades.\n\nThe battleships were well in sight of Eastern King Point when the\nmidshipmen's call for supper formation sounded. Feeling that they would\nmuch have preferred to wait for their supper, the young men hastened\nbelow.\n\nAfter the line was formed it seemed to the impatient young men as though\nit had never taken so long to read the orders.\n\nYet there came one welcome order, to the effect that, immediately after\nthe morning meal, all midshipmen might go to the pay officer and draw\nten dollars, to be charged against their pay accounts.\n\n\"That ten dollars apiece looms up large David, little giant,\" murmured\nDan Dalzell, while the evening meal was in progress.\n\n\"We ought to have a lot of fun on it,\" replied Darrin, who was looking\nforward with greatest eagerness to his first visit to any foreign soil.\n\"But how much shore leave are we to have?\"\n\n\"Two days, the word is. We'll get it straight in the morning, at\nbreakfast formation.\"\n\nIn defiance of regulations, Midshipman Pennington, whose father was\nwealthy, had several hundred dollars concealed in his baggage. He had\nalready invited Hallam, Mossworth and Dickey to keep in his wake on\nshore, and these young men had gladly enough agreed.\n\n\"Say, but we're slackening speed!\" quivered Dalzell, when the meal was\nnearly finished.\n\n\"Headway has stopped,\" declared Darrin a few moments later.\n\n\"Listen, everyone!\" called Farley. \"Don't you hear the rattle of the\nanchor chains?\"\n\n\"Gentlemen, as we're forbidden to make too much racket,\" proposed\nirrepressible Dan, \"let us give three silent cheers for Old England!\"\n\nRising in his place, Dan raised his hand aloft, and brought it down, as\nhis lips silently formed a \"hurrah!\"\n\nThree times this was done, each time the lips of the midshipmen forming\na silent cheer.\n\nThen Dan, with a mighty swoop of his right arm, let his lips form the\nword that everyone knew to be \"tiger!\"\n\n\"Ugh-h-h!\" groaned Midshipman Reilly.\n\n\"Throw that irresponsible Fenian out!\" directed Dan, grinning.\n\nThen the midshipmen turned their attention to the remnants of the meal.\n\nBoom! sounded sharply overhead.\n\n\"There goes the twenty-one-gunner,\" announced Darrin.\n\nWhen a foreign battleship enters a fortified port the visiting fleet, or\nrather, its flagship, fires a national salute of twenty-one guns. After\na short interval following the discharge of the last gun, one of the\nforts on shore answers with twenty-one guns. This is one of the methods\nof observing the courtesies between nations by their respective fleets.\n\nEre all the guns had been fired from the flagship, the third classmen\nreceived the rising signal; the class marched out and was dismissed.\nInstantly a break was made for deck.\n\nThe midshipmen were in good time to see the smoke and hear the roar of\nguns from one of the forts on shore.\n\nIn the morning the commandant of cadets, as commanding officer of the\nsquadron, would go ashore with his aide and pay a formal call to the\nsenior military officer. Later in the day that English officer and one\nor two of his staff officers would return the call by coming out to the\nflagship. That accomplished, all the required courtesies would have been\nobserved.\n\nIt was still broad daylight, for in summer the English twilight is a\nlong one, and darkness does not settle down until late.\n\n\"Oh, if we were only going ashore to-night!\" murmured Hallam. There were\nmany others to echo the thought, but all knew that it could not be done.\n\n\"Couldn't we find a trick for slipping ashore after lights out?\" eagerly\nqueried Dickey, who was not noted as a \"greaser.\"\n\n\"Could we?\" quivered Hallam, who, with few demerits against him, felt\ninclined to take a chance.\n\nBut Pennington, to whom he appealed, shook his head.\n\n\"Too big a risk, Hally,\" replied Pen. \"And trebly dangerous, with that\ngreaser, Darrin, in the class.\"\n\n\"Oh, stow that,\" growled Hallam. \"Darrin is no greaser. You've got him\non your black books--that's all.\"\n\n\"He is a greaser, I tell you,\" cried Pennington fiercely.\n\nThere were a score of midshipmen in this group, and many of them nodded\napprovingly at Pennington's statement. Though still a class leader, Dave\nhad lost some of his popularity since his report to the police of\nAnnapolis.\n\nSo the middies turned in, that night, with unsatisfied dreams of shore\nlife in England.\n\nSoon after breakfast the next morning, however, every midshipman had\ndrawn his ten dollars, even to Pennington, who had no use for such a\ntrifling amount.\n\nAs fast as possible the launches ranged alongside at the side gangway,\ntaking off groups of midshipmen, everyone of whom had been cautioned to\nbe at dock in time to board a launch in season for supper formation.\n\nPennington and his party were among the first to land. They hurried\naway.\n\nIt was on the second trip of one of the launches that Dave, Dan and\nFarley made their get away. These three chums had agreed to stick\ntogether during the day. They landed at the Great Western Docks, to find\nthemselves surrounded by eager British cabbies.\n\n\"Are we going to take a cab and get more quickly and intelligently to\nthe best part of the town to see?\" asked Farley.\n\n\"I don't vote for it,\" replied Darrin. \"We have only five dollars apiece\nfor each of the two days we're to be ashore. I move that we put in the\nforenoon, anyway, in prowling about the town for ourselves. We'll learn\nmore than we would by riding.\"\n\n\"Come on, then,\" approved Dan.\n\nPlymouth is an old-fashioned English seaport that has been rather famous\never since the thirteenth century. Many parts of the town, including\nwhole streets, look as though the houses had been built since that time.\nThis is especially true of many of the streets near the water front.\n\nFor two hours the three middies roamed through the streets, often\nmeeting fellow classmen. Wherever the young midshipmen went many of the\nEnglish workmen and shopkeepers raised their hats in friendly salute of\nthe American uniform.\n\n\"We don't seem to run across Pen's gang anywhere,\" remarked Farley at\nlast.\n\n\"Oh, no,\" smiled Dave. \"That's a capitalistic crowd. They'll hit only\nthe high spots.\"\n\nNevertheless, these three poor-in-purse midshipmen enjoyed themselves\nhugely in seeing the quaint old town. At noon they found a real old\nEnglish chop house, where they enjoyed a famous meal.\n\n\"I wish we could slip some of these little mutton pies back with us!\"\nsighed Dan wistfully.\n\nIn the afternoon the three chums saw the newer market place, where all\nthree bought small souvenirs for their mothers at home. Darrin also\nsecured a little remembrance present for his sweetheart, Belle Meade.\n\nThe guild hall and some of the other famous buildings were visited.\n\nLater in the afternoon Dave began to inspect his watch every two or\nthree minutes.\n\n\"No need for us to worry, with Dave's eye glued to his watch,\" laughed\nDan.\n\n\"Come on, fellows,\" summoned Darrin finally. \"We haven't more than time\nnow to make the dock and get back to supper formation.\"\n\n\"Take a cab?\" asked Farley. \"You know, we've found that they're vastly\ncheaper than American cabs.\"\n\n\"No-o-o, not for me,\" decided Dave. \"We'll need the rest of our shore\nmoney to-morrow, and our legs are good and sturdy.\"\n\nYet even careful Dave, as it turned out, had allowed no more than time.\nThe chums reached the dock in time to see the launches half way between\nthe fleet and shore. Some forty other midshipmen stood waiting on the\ndock.\n\nAmong these were Pennington and his party, all looking highly satisfied\nwith their day's sport, as indeed they were.\n\nPennington's eyes gleamed when he caught sight of Darrin, Dalzell and\nFarley--for Pen had a scheme of his own in mind.\n\nNot far from Pennington stood a little Englishman with keen eyes and a\njovial face. Pen stepped over to him.\n\n\"There are the three midshipmen I was telling you about,\" whispered\nPennington, slipping a half sovereign into the Englishman's hand. \"You\nthoroughly understand your part in the joke, don't you?\"\n\n\"Don't h'I, though--just, sir!\" laughed the undersized Englishman, and\nstrolled away.\n\nDarrin and his friends were soon informed by classmates that the\nlaunches now making shore-ward were coming in on their last trip for\nmidshipmen.\n\n\"Well, we're here in plenty of time,\" sighed Dave contentedly.\n\n\"Oh, I knew we'd be, with you holding the watch,\" laughed Dan in his\nsatisfied way.\n\nAs the three stood apart they were joined by the undersized Englishman,\nwho touched his hat to them with a show of great respect.\n\n\"Young gentlemen,\" he inquired, \"h'I suppose, h'of course, you've 'ad a\nlook h'at the anchor h'of Sir Francis Drake's flagship, the time 'e went\nh'out h'and sank the great Spanish h'Armada?\"\n\n\"Why, no, my friend,\" replied Dave, looking at the man with interest.\n\"Is that here at Plymouth?\"\n\n\"H'assuredly, sir. H'and h'only a minute's walk h'over to that shed\nyonder, sir. H'if you'll come with me, young gentlemen, h'I'll show h'it\nto you. H'it's one of h'our biggest sights, h'and it's in me own\ncustody, at present. Come this way, young gentlemen.\"\n\n\"That sounds like something worth seeing,\" declared Dave to his\ncomrades. \"Come along. It'll take the launches at least six minutes to\nget in, and then they'll stay tied up here for another five minutes.\"\n\nWith only a single backward glance at the young midshipmen, the\nundersized Englishman was already leading the way.\n\nAt quickened pace the young midshipmen reached the shed that had been\nindicated. Their guide had already drawn a key from a pocket, and had\nunsnapped the heavy padlock.\n\n\"Step right in, young gentlemen, h'and h'I'll follow h'and show h'it to\nyou.\"\n\nUnsuspecting, the three middies stepped inside the darkened shed.\nSuddenly the door banged, and a padlock clicked outside.\n\n\"Here, stop that, you rascally joker!\" roared Dalzell, wheeling about.\n\"What does this mean?\"\n\n\"Big trouble!\" spoke Dave Darrin seriously and with a face from which\nthe color was fast receding.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n\nPENNINGTON GETS HIS WISH\n\n\"The scoundrel!\" gasped Farley, his face whiter than any of the others.\n\nDave was already at the door, trying to force it open. But he might\nalmost as well have tried to lift one of the twelve-inch guns of the\nbattleship \"Massachusetts.\"\n\n\"We're locked in--that's sure!\" gasped Dalzell, almost dazed by the\ncatastrophe.\n\n\"And what's more, we won't get out in a hurry, unless we can make some\nof our classmates hear,\" declared Dave.\n\nFor the next half minute they yelled themselves nearly hoarse, but no\nresponse came.\n\n\"What could have been that little cockney's purpose in playing this\nshabby trick on us?\" demanded Farley.\n\n\"Perhaps the cockney thinks we're admirals, with our pockets lined with\ngold. Perhaps he and some of his pals intend to rob us, later in the\nevening,\" proposed Dan, with a ghastly grin.\n\n\"Any gang would find something of a fight on their hands, then,\"\nmuttered Dave Darrin grimly.\n\nAll three were equally at a loss to think of any explanation for such a\n\"joke\" as this. Equally improbable did it seem that any thugs of the\ntown would expect to reap any harvest from robbing three midshipmen.\n\nDesperately they turned to survey their surroundings. The shed was an\nold one, yet strongly built. There were no windows, no other door save\nthat at which the three middies now stood baffled.\n\n\"Another good old yell,\" proposed Darrin.\n\nIt was given with a lusty will, but proved as fruitless as the former\none.\n\n\"We don't take the last launch back to ship,\" declared Farley, wild with\nrage.\n\n\"Which means a long string of demerits,\" said Dan.\n\n\"No shore leave to-morrow, either,\" groaned Darrin. \"Fellows, this\nmishap will affect our shore leave throughout all the cruise.\"\n\n\"We can explain it,\" suggested Farley with a hopefulness that he did not\nfeel at all.\n\n\"Of course we can,\" jeered Dave Darrin. \"But what officer is fool enough\nto believe such a cock-and-bull story as this one will seem? At the very\nleast, the commandant would believe that we had been playing some pretty\nstiff prank ourselves, in order to get treated in this fashion. No, no,\nfellows! We may just as well undeceive ourselves, and prepare to take\nthe full soaking of discipline that we're bound to get. If we attempted\nthis sort of explanation, we'd be lucky indeed to get through the affair\nwithout being tried by general court-martial for lying.\"\n\n\"Drake's anchor, indeed!\" exclaimed Dan in deep self disgust.\n\n\"We ought to have known better,\" grunted Farley, equally enraged with\nhimself. \"What on earth made us so absent-minded as to believe that a\npriceless relic would be kept in an old shed like this?\"\n\n\"We're sure enough idiots!\" groaned Dan.\n\n\"Hold on there, fellows,\" interrupted Dave Darrin. \"Vent all your anger\nright on me. I'm the great and only cause of this misfortune. It was I\nwho proposed that we take up that cockney's invitation. I'm the real and\nonly offender against decent good sense, and yet you both have to suffer\nwith me.\"\n\n\"Let's give another yell, bigger than before,\" suggested Dan weakly.\n\nThey did, but with no better result than before.\n\n\"The launches are away now, anyway, I guess,\" groaned Farley, after\nconsulting his watch.\n\n\"Yes, and we're up the tree with the commandant,\" grunted Dalzell\nbitterly.\n\n\"Yell again?\" asked Farley.\n\n\"No,\" retorted Dave, shaking his head. \"We've seen the uselessness of\nasking help from outside. Let's supply our own help. Now,\nthen--altogether! Shoulder the door!\"\n\nA savage assault they hurled upon the door. But they merely caused it to\nvibrate.\n\n\"We can't do it,\" gasped Dan, after the third trial.\n\nConsiderable daylight filtered in through the cracks at top, bottom and\none side of the door. Further back in the shed there was less light.\n\n\"Let's explore this old place in search of hope,\" begged Dave.\n\nTogether they started back, looking about keenly in what appeared to be\nan empty room.\n\n\"Say! Look at that!\" cried Dave suddenly.\n\nHe pointed to a solid looking, not very heavy ship's spar.\n\n\"What good will that thing do us?\" asked Farley rather dubiously.\n\n\"Let's see if we can raise it to our shoulders,\" proposed Dave Darrin\nradiantly. \"Then well find out!\"\n\n\"Hurrah!\" quivered Dan Dalzell, bending over the spar at the middle.\n\n\"Up with it!\" commanded Darrin, placing himself at the head of the spar.\nFarley took hold at the further end.\n\n\"Up with it!\" heaved Midshipman Darrin.\n\nRight up the spar went. It would have been a heavy job for three young\nmen of their size in civil life, but midshipmen are constantly\nundergoing the best sort of physical training.\n\n\"Now, then--a fast run and a hard bump!\" called Darrin.\n\nAt the door they rushed, bearing the spar as a battering ram.\n\nBump! The door shook and shivered.\n\n\"Once more may do it!\" cheered Darrin. \"Back.\"\n\nAgain they dashed the head of their battering ram against the door. It\ngave way, and, climbing through, they raced back to the pier.\n\nBut Dan, who had secured the lead, stopped with a groan, pointing out\nover the water.\n\n\"Not a bit of good, fellows! There go the launches, and we're the only\nfellows left! It's all up with our summer's fun!\"\n\n\"Is it, though?\" shouted Dave, spurting ahead. \"Come on and find out!\"\n\nAs they reached the front of the piers, down at the edge of a landing\nstage they espied a little steam tender.\n\n\"That boat has to take us out to the 'Massachusetts'!\" cried Darrin\ndesperately, as he plunged down the steps to the landing stage, followed\nby his two chums.\n\n[Illustration: The Three Midshipmen Raced Toward the Pier.]\n\n\"Who's the captain here?\" called Dave, racing across the landing stage\nto the tender's gangplank.\n\n\"I am, sir,\" replied a portly, red-faced Englishman, leaning out of the\nwheel-house window.\n\n\"What'll you charge to land us in haste aboard the American battleship\n'Massachusetts'?\" asked Darrin eagerly.\n\n\"Half a sov. will be about right, sir,\" replied the tender's skipper,\ntouching his cap at sight of the American Naval uniform.\n\n\"Good enough,\" glowed Dave, leaping aboard. \"Cast off as quickly as you\ncan, captain, or we'll be in a heap of trouble with our discipline\nofficers.\"\n\nThe English skipper was quick to act. He routed out two deckhands, who\nquickly cast off. Almost while the deckhands were doing this the skipper\nrang the engineer's bell.\n\n\"Come into the wheel-'ouse with me,\" invited the skipper pleasantly,\nwhich invitation the three middies accepted. \"Now, then, young\ngentlemen, 'ow did it 'appen that you missed your own launches.\"\n\n\"It was a mean trick--a scoundrelly one!\" cried Darrin resentfully. Then\nhe described just what had happened.\n\nThe skipper's own bronzed cheeks burned to a deeper color.\n\n\"I can 'ardly believe that an Englishman would play such a trick on\nyoung h'officers of a friendly power,\" he declared. \"But I told you,\nsir, the fare out to your ship would be half a sov. I lied. If a nasty\nlittle cockney played such a trick on you, it's my place, as a decent\nEnglishman, to take you out for nothing--and that's the fare.\"\n\n\"Oh, we'll gladly pay the half sov.\" protested Darrin.\n\n\"Not on this craft you can't, sir,\" replied the skipper firmly.\n\nLooking eagerly ahead, the three middies saw two of the launches go\nalong side of the \"Massachusetts\" and discharge passengers. As the\nsecond left the side gangway the Briton, who had been crowding on steam\nwell, ranged in along side.\n\n\"What craft is that, and what do you want?\" hailed the officer of the\ndeck, from above.\n\n\"The tender 'Lurline,' sir, with three of your gentlemen to put h'aboard\nof you, sir,\" the Briton bellowed through a window of the wheel-house.\n\n\"Very good, then. Come alongside,\" directed the officer of the deck.\n\nIn his most seamanlike style the Briton ranged alongside. Dave tried to\npress the fare upon the skipper, but he would have none of that. So the\nthree shook hands swiftly but heartily with him, then sprang across to\nthe side gangway, where they paused long enough to lift their caps to\nthis stranger and friend. The Briton lifted his own cap, waving it\nheartily, ere he fell off and turned about.\n\n\"You didn't get aboard any too soon, gentlemen,\" remarked the officer of\nthe deck, eyeing the three middies keenly as they came up over the side,\ndoffing their uniform caps to the colors. \"Hustle for the formation.\"\n\nMidshipman Pennington was chuckling deeply over the supposed fact that\nhe had at last succeeded in bringing Darrin in for as many demerits as\nDarrin had helped heap upon him.\n\n\"That'll break his heart as an avowed greaser,\" Pen told himself. \"With\nall the demerits Darrin will get, he'll have no heart for greasing the\nrest of this year. It's rough on Farley, but I'm not quite as sorry for\nDalzell, who, in his way, is almost as bad as Darrin. He's Darrin's\ncuckoo and shadow, anyway. Oh, I wish I could see Darrin's face now!\"\n\nThis last was uttered just as Midshipman Pennington stepped into line at\nthe supper formation.\n\n\"I wish I could see Darrin's face now!\" Pen repeated to himself.\n\nSeldom has a wish been more quickly gratified. For, just in the nick of\ntime to avoid being reported, Midshipmen Darrin, Dalzell and Farley came\ninto sight, falling into their respective places.\n\nAt that instant it was Midshipman Pennington's face, not Dave Darrin's,\nthat was really worth studying.\n\n\"Now how did the shameless greaser work this!\" Pennington pondered\nuneasily.\n\nBut, of course, he couldn't ask. He could only hope that, presently, he\nwould hear the whole story from some other man in the class.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n\nTHE TRAGEDY OF THE GALE\n\nThere is altogether too much to the summer practice cruise for it to be\nrelated in detail.\n\nNor would the telling of it prove interesting to the reader. When at\nsea, save on Sundays, the midshipman's day is one of hard toil.\n\nIt is no life for the indolent young man. He is routed out early in the\nmorning and put at hard work.\n\nOn a midshipman's first summer cruise what he learns is largely the work\nthat is done by the seamen, stokers, water tenders, electricians, the\nsignal men and others.\n\nYet he must learn every phase of all this work thoroughly, for some day,\nbefore he becomes an officer, he must be examined as to his knowledge of\nall this great mass of detail.\n\nIt is only when in port that some relaxation comes into the midshipman's\nlife. He has shore leave, and a large measure of liberty. Yet he must,\nat all times, show all possible respect for the uniform that he wears\nand the great nation that he represents. If a midshipman permits himself\nto be led into scrapes that many college boys regard as merely \"larks,\"\nhe is considered a disgrace to the Naval service.\n\nAlways, at home and abroad, the \"middy\" must maintain his own dignity\nand that of his country and service. Should he fail seriously, he is\nregarded by his superiors and by the Navy Department as being unfit to\ndefend the honor of his flag.\n\nThe wildest group from the summer practice fleet was that made up of\nPennington and his friends. Pen received more money in France from his\nfond but foolish father. Wherever Pennington's group went, they cut a\nwide swath of \"sport,\" though they did nothing actually dishonorable.\nYet they were guilty of many pranks which, had the midshipmen been\ncaught, would have resulted in demerits.\n\nPorts in France, Spain, Portugal and Italy were touched briefly. At some\nof these ports the midshipmen received much attention.\n\nBut at last the fleet turned back past Gibraltar, and stood on for the\nAzores, the last landing point before reaching home.\n\nWhen two nights out from Gibraltar a sharp summer gale overtook the\nfleet. Even the huge battleships labored heavily in the seas, the\n\"Massachusetts\" bringing up the rear.\n\nShe was in the same position when the morning broke. The midshipmen,\nafter breakfast, enjoyed a few minutes on the deck before going below\nfor duty in the engine rooms, the dynamo room, the \"stoke hole\" and\nother stations.\n\nSuddenly, from the stern rail, there went up the startled cry:\n\n\"Man overboard!\"\n\nIn an instant the marine sentry had tumbled two life-preservers over\ninto the water.\n\nWith almost the swiftness of telegraphy the cry had reached the bridge.\nWithout stopping to back the engine the big battleship's helm was thrown\nhard over, and the great steel fighting craft endeavored to find her own\nwake in the angry waters with a view to going back over it.\n\nSignal men broke out the news to the flagship. The other two great\nbattleships turned and headed back in the interests of humanity.\n\nIt seemed almost as though the entire fleet had been swung out of its\ncourse by pressure on an electric button.\n\nOfficers who were not on duty poured out. The captain was the first to\nreach the quarter-deck. He strode into the midst of a group of\nstricken-looking midshipmen.\n\n\"Who's overboard!\" demanded the commanding officer.\n\n\"Hallam, sir----\"\n\n\"And Darrin, sir----\"\n\n\"And Dalzell, sir----\"\n\n\"How many?\" demanded the captain sharply.\n\n\"Three, sir.\"\n\n\"How did so many fall overboard?\"\n\n\"Mr. Hallam was frolicking, sir,\" reported Midshipman Farley, \"and lost\nhis footing.\"\n\n\"But Mr. Darrin and Mr. Dalzell?\" inquired the captain sharply.\n\n\"As soon as they realized it, sir, Darrin and Dalzell leaped overboard\nto go to Hallam's rescue, sir.\"\n\n\"It's a wonder,\" muttered the captain, glancing shrewdly at the bronzed,\nfine young fellows around him, \"that not more of you went overboard as\nwell.\"\n\n\"Many of them would, sir,\" replied Farley, \"but an officer forward\nshouted: 'No more midshipmen go overboard,' So we stopped, sir.\"\n\nModest Mr. Farley did not mention the fact that he was running toward\nthe stern, intent on following his chums into the rough sea at the very\ninstant when the order reached him.\n\nThe captain, however, paused for no more information. He was now running\nforward to take the bridge beside the watch officer.\n\nThe midshipmen, too, hurried forward, mingling with the crew, as the big\nbattleship swung around and tried to find her wake.\n\nThe flagship had crowded on extra steam, and was fast coming over the\nseas.\n\nWith such a sea running, it was well nigh impossible to make out so\nsmall a thing as a head or a life-preserver, unless it could be observed\nat the instant when it crested a wave.\n\nMarine glasses were in use by every officer who had brought his pair to\nthe deck. Others rushed back to their cabins to get them.\n\nA lieutenant of the marine corps stood forward, close to a big group of\nsorrowing midshipmen.\n\n\"There are certain to be three vacancies in the Naval Academy,\" remarked\nthe lieutenant.\n\n\"Don't say that, sir,\" begged Farley, in a choking voice. \"The three\noverboard are among the finest fellows in the brigade!\"\n\n\"I don't want to discourage any of you young gentlemen,\" continued the\nmarine corps lieutenant. \"But there's just about one chance in a\nthousand that we shall be able to sight and pick up any one of the\nunlucky three. In the first place, it would take a wonderful swimmer to\nlive long in such a furious sea. In the second place, if all three are\nstill swimming, it will be almost out of the question to make out their\nheads among the huge waves. You've none of you seen a man overboard\nbefore in a big sea?\"\n\nSeveral of the mute, anxious midshipmen shook their heads.\n\n\"You'll realize the difficulties of the situation within the next few\nminutes,\" remarked the lieutenant. \"I am sorry to crush your hopes for\nyour classmates, but this is all a part of the day's work in the Navy.\"\n\nThe largest steam launches from all three of the battleships were being\nswiftly lowered. Officers and men were lowered with the launches. As the\nlaunch shoved off from each battleship tremendous cheers followed them.\n\n\"Stop all unnecessary noise!\" bellowed the watch officer from the bridge\nof the \"Massachusetts.\" \"You may drown out calls for help with your\nracket.\"\n\nWhile the three battleships went back over their courses in more stately\nfashion, the launches darted here and there, until it seemed as though\nthey must cover every foot within a square mile.\n\n\"I don't see how they can help finding the three,\" Farley declared\nhopefully.\n\n\"That is,\" put in another third classman, \"if any of the three are still\nafloat.\"\n\n\"Stow all talk of that sort,\" ordered Farley angrily.\n\nOther midshipmen joined in with their protests. When a man is overboard\nin an angry sea all hands left behind try to be optimists.\n\nWhen fifteen minutes had been spent in the search the onlooking but\nhelpless middies began to look worried.\n\nAt the end of half an hour some of them looked haggard. Farley's face\nwas pitiable to see.\n\nAt the end of an hour of constant but fruitless searching hardly any one\nfelt any hope of a rescue now.\n\nAll three midshipmen, the \"man overboard\" and his two willing, would-be\nrescuers, were silently conceded to be drowned.\n\nYet the hardest blow of all came when, at the end of an hour and a\nquarter, the flagship signaled the recall of the small boats.\n\nThen, indeed, all hope was given up. In an utter human silence, save for\nthe husky voicing of the necessary orders, the launches were hoisted on\nboard. Then the flagship flew the signal for resuming the voyage.\n\nThere were few dry eyes among the third class midshipmen when the\nbattleships fell in formation again and proceeded on their way.\n\nAs a result of more signals flown from the flagship, all unnecessary\nduties of midshipmen for the day were ordered suspended.\n\nIn the afternoon the chaplain on each battleship held funeral services\nover the three lost midshipmen. Officers, middies and crew attended on\nboard each vessel.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\n\nTHE DESPAIR OF THE \"RECALL\"\n\nDave Darrin stood within ten feet of Hallam when that latter midshipman\nhad lost his balance and fallen into the boiling sea.\n\nDave's spring to the stern rail was all but instantaneous. He was\noverboard, after his classmate, ere the marine had had time to leap to\nthe life buoys.\n\nOut of the corner of one eye Dan Dalzell saw the marine start on the\njump, but Dan was overboard, also, too soon to see exactly what the\nmarine sentry was doing.\n\nBoth daring midshipmen sank beneath the surface as they struck.\n\nAs Dan came up, however, his hand struck something solid and he clutched\nat it. It was one of the life buoys.\n\nAs he grasped it, and drew his head up a trifle, Dan saw another\nfloating within thirty feet of him. Swimming hard, and pushing, Dan\nsucceeded in reaching the other buoy. He now rested, holding on to both\nbuoys.\n\n\"Now, where's David, that little giant?\" muttered Dalzell, striving hard\nto see through the seething waters and over the tops of foam-crested\nwaves.\n\nAfter a few minutes Dan began to feel decidedly nervous.\n\n\"Yet Dave can't have gone down, for he's a better swimmer than I am,\"\nwas Dan's consoling thought.\n\nAt last Dalzell caught sight of another head. He could have cheered, but\nhe expended his breath on something more sensible.\n\n\"Dave!\" he shouted. \"Old Darry! This way! I have the life buoys.\"\n\nAt the same time, holding to both of them, but kicking frantically with\nhis feet, Dalzell managed slowly to push the buoys toward Dave.\n\nSoon after he had started, Dan did utter a cheer, even though it was\nchecked by an inrush of salt water that nearly strangled him.\n\nHe saw two heads. Dave Darrin was coming toward him, helping Hallam.\n\nThe wind carried the cheer faintly to Dave. He raised his head a little\nin the water, and caught sight of Dan and the buoys.\n\nSome three minutes it took the two chums to meet. Dave Darrin was all\nbut exhausted, for Hallam was now unconscious.\n\nAs Darrin clutched at the buoy he tried to shout, though the voice came\nweakly:\n\n\"Catch hold of Hallam. I'm down and----\"\n\nBut Dan understood, even before he heard. While Dave clutched at one of\nthe life buoys Dalzell shot out an arm, dragging Hallam in to safety.\n\nNow, it was Darrin who, with both arms, contrived to link the buoys\ntogether.\n\nAt last the youngsters had a chance to observe the fact that the\nbattleships had put about and were coming back.\n\n\"We'll soon be all right,\" sighed Dave contentedly, as soon as he could\nspeak. \"There are thirty-five hundred officers, middies and sailors of\nthe American Navy to look after our safety.\"\n\nFrom where they lay as they hung to the buoys the chums could even see\nthe launches lowered.\n\nDan, with some of the emergency lashing about the buoy, succeeded, after\na good deal of effort, and with some aid from Dave, in passing a cord\nabout Hallam and under the latter's armpits that secured that midshipman\nto one of the buoys. The next move of the chums was to lash the buoys\ntogether.\n\n\"Now,\" declared Dave, \"we can't lose. We can hang on and be safe here\nfor hours, if need be.\"\n\n\"But what a thundering long time it takes them to bring the battleships\naround to get to us!\" murmured Midshipman Dalzell in wonder.\n\n\"Be sure not an unnecessary second has been lost,\" rejoined Dave. \"We're\nlearning something practical now about the handling of big craft.\"\n\n\"I wonder if Hally's a goner?\" murmured Dan in an awe-struck voice.\n\n\"I don't believe it,\" Dave answered promptly. \"Once we get him back\naboard ship the medicos will do a little work over him and he'll sit up\nand want to know if dinner's ready.\"\n\nThen they fell silent, for, with the roar of wind and waters, it was\nnecessary for them to shout when they talked.\n\nAs the minutes went by slowly, the two conscious midshipmen found\nthemselves filled with amazement.\n\nA dozen times the launches darted by, not far away. It seemed impossible\nthat the keen, restless eyes of the seekers should not discover the\nimperiled ones.\n\nAt such times Dave and Dan shouted with all the power of their lusty\nyoung lungs.\n\nAlternately Dan and Dave tried the effect of rising as far as they could\nand frantically waving an arm. There was not a cap to wave among the\nthree of them.\n\n\"I'm beginning to feel discouraged,\" grunted Dave in disgust at last.\n\"They must have spent a full half day already looking for us.\"\n\n\"Merciful powers!\" gasped Dan at last, as they rode half way up the\n<DW72> of a big wave. \"I just caught sight of the'recall of boats'\nflying from the flagship!\"\n\n\"No!\" gasped Dave incredulously.\n\n\"Yes, I did!\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"They've failed and have given up the search,\" spoke Dan rather\ndespairingly.\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"We may as well face it,\" muttered Dan brokenly. \"They don't believe\nthat any of us has survived, and we've been abandoned.\"\n\n\"Then,\" spoke Dave Darrin very coolly, \"there's nothing left for us but\nto die like men of the American Navy.\"\n\n\"It seems heartless, needless,\" protested Dan.\n\n\"No,\" broke in Darrin. \"They've done their best. They're convinced that\nwe're lost. And I should think they would be, after all the time they've\nsearched for us--half a day, at least.\"\n\nDan said nothing, but tugged until he succeeded in bringing his watch up\nto the light.\n\n\"The blamed thing is water-logged,\" he uttered disgustedly.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"The hands point to less than half past nine!\"\n\nDarrin managed to get at his own watch.\n\n\"My timepiece doesn't call for half past nine, either,\" he announced.\n\n\"Can it be possible--\"\n\n\"Yes; the time has only seemed longer, I reckon,\" observed Dalzell.\n\n\"Well, we'll face it like men,\" proposed Dave.\n\n\"Of course,\" nodded Dan. \"At least, we're going down in the ocean, and\nwe wear the American Naval uniform. If there's any choice in deaths, I\nguess that's as good and manly a one as we could choose.\"\n\n\"Poor old Hally won't know much about it, anyway, I guess,\" remarked\nDarrin, who seemed unnaturally cool. Possibly he was a bit dazed by the\nstunning nature of the fate that seemed about to overtake them.\n\n\"Maybe the ships will go by us in their final get-away,\" proposed Dan\nDalzell very soberly.\n\n\"Not if I'm seaman enough to read the compass by what's visible of the\nsun,\" returned Midshipman Darrin.\n\n\"Then there's no help for it,\" answered Dan, choking slightly. \"I wonder\nif we could do anything for Hallam?\"\n\n\"We won't do anything to bring him to, anyway,\" muttered Darrin. \"Under\nthese circumstances I wouldn't do anything as mean as that to a dog!\"\n\n\"Maybe he's dead already, anyway,\" proposed Dan, now hopefully.\n\n\"I hope so,\" came from Darrin.\n\nNow they saw the not very distant battleships alter their courses and\nsteam slowly away.\n\nAll was now desolation over the angry sea, as the battleships gradually\nvanished. The two conscious midshipmen were now resolved to face the end\nbravely. That was all they could do for themselves and their flag.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\n\nTHE GRIM WATCH FROM THE WAVES\n\nBy the time that little more than the mastheads of the departing\nbattleships were visible, Hallam opened his eyes.\n\nIt would have seemed a vastly kinder fate had he been allowed to remain\nunconscious to the last.\n\nHallam had not been strangled by the inrush of water. In going\noverboard, this midshipman had struck the water with the back of his\nhead and had been stunned. In the absence of attention he had remained a\nlong time unconscious.\n\nEven now the hapless midshipman whose frollicking had been the cause of\nthe disaster, did not immediately regain his full senses.\n\n\"Why, we're all in the water,\" he remarked after a while.\n\n\"Yes,\" assented Darrin, trying to speak cheerfully.\n\nMidshipman Hallam remained silent for some moments before he next asked:\n\n\"How did it happen?\"\n\n\"Fell overboard,\" replied Dan laconically, failing to mention who it was\nwho had fallen over the stern.\n\nAgain a rather long silence on Hallam's part. Then, at last, he\nobserved:\n\n\"Funny how we all fell over at the same time.\"\n\nTo this neither of his classmates made any rejoinder.\n\n\"See here,\" shouted Hallam, after a considerable period of silent\nwondering, \"I remember it all now. I was fooling at the stern rail and I\ntoppled overboard.\"\n\nDan nodded without words.\n\n\"And you fellows jumped in after me,\" roared Hallam, both his mental and\nbodily powers now beginning to return. \"Didn't you?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" assented Darrin rather reluctantly.\n\n\"And what became of the fleet!\"\n\nDave and Dan looked at each other before the former replied:\n\n\"Oh, well, Hally, brace up! The ships searched for us a long time, and\nsome launches were put out after us. But they couldn't see our little\nheads above the big waves, and so----\"\n\n\"They've gone away and left us?\" queried Hallam, guessing at once. \"Now,\nfellows, I don't mind so much for myself, but it's fearful to think that\nI've dragged you into the same fate. It's awful! Why couldn't you have\nleft me to my fate?\"\n\n\"Would you have done a thing like that?\" demanded Dave dryly.\n\n\"Oh, well, I suppose not, but--but--well, I wish I had been left to pay\nthe price of my tomfoolery all alone. It would have served me right. But\nto drag you two into it--\"\n\nHallam could go no further. He was choking up with honest emotion.\n\n\"Don't bother about it, Hally,\" urged Dave. \"It's all in the day's work\nfor a sailor. We'll just take it as it comes, old fellow.\"\n\nTo not one of the trio did it occur to let go of the life buoys and sink\nas a means of ending misery. In the first place, human instinct holds to\nhope. In the second place, suicide is the resort of cowards.\n\n\"None of you happened to hide any food in his pockets at breakfast, I\ntake it?\" asked Dan grimly, at last.\n\nOf course they hadn't.\n\n\"Too bad,\" sighed Dan. \"I'm growing terribly hungry.\"\n\n\"Catch a fish,\" smiled back Darrin.\n\n\"And eat it raw?\" gasped Dalzell. \"Darry, you know my tastes better than\nthat.\"\n\n\"Then wait a few hours longer,\" proposed Dave, \"until even raw fish will\nbe a delicacy.\"\n\nHallam took no part in the chaffing. He was miserably conscious, all the\nwhile, that his own folly had been solely responsible for the present\nplight of these noble messmates.\n\nThus the time passed on. None kept any track of it; they realized only\nthat it was still daylight.\n\nThen suddenly Dave gave a gasp and raised one hand to point.\n\nHis two classmates turned and were able to make out the mastheads of a\ncraft in the distance.\n\nHow they strained their eyes! All three stared and stared, until they\nfelt tolerably certain that the craft was headed their way.\n\n\"They may see us!\" cried Hallam eagerly.\n\n\"Three battleships and as many launches failed to find us,\" retorted\nDan. \"And they were looking for us, too.\"\n\nAs the vessel came nearer and the hull became visible, it took on the\nappearance of a liner.\n\n\"Why, it looks as though she'd run right over us when she gets nearer,\"\ncried Dave, his eyes kindling with hope.\n\n\"Don't get too excited over it,\" urged Dan. \"For my part, I'm growing\nalmost accustomed to disappointments.\"\n\nAs the minutes passed and the liner came on and on, it looked still more\nas though she would run down the three middies.\n\n[Illustration: \"Look! They See Us!\"]\n\nAt last, however, the craft was passing, showing her port side, not very\nfar distant, to be sure.\n\nUniting their voices, the three midshipmen yelled with all their power,\neven though they knew that their desperate call for help could not carry\nthe distance over the subsiding gale.\n\nBoom! That shot came from the liner, and now her port rail was black\nwith people.\n\n\"They see us!\" cried Hallam joyously. \"Look! That craft is slowing up!\"\n\nOnce more came the cheers of encouragement, as the liner, now some\ndistance ahead, put off a heavy launch. A masthead lookout, who had\nfirst seen the midshipmen, was now signaling the way to the officer in\ncommand of the launch.\n\nUnable to see for himself, the officer in the launch depended wholly on\nthose masthead signals. So the launch steamed a somewhat zig-zag course\nover the waves. Yet, at last, it bore down straight upon the midshipmen.\n\nDarrin, Dalzell and Hallam now came very near to closing their eyes, to\nlessen the suspense.\n\nA short time more and all three were dragged in over the sides of the\nlaunch.\n\n\"Get those life buoys in, if you can,\" begged Dave, as he sank in the\nbottom of the launch. \"They are United States property entrusted to our\ncare.\"\n\nFrom officer and seamen alike a laugh went up at this request, but the\nlife buoys were caught with a boathook and drawn aboard.\n\nWhat rousing cheers greeted the returning launch, from the decks of the\nliner, \"Princess Irene\"! When the three midshipmen reached deck and it\nwas learned that they were midshipmen of the United States Navy, the\ncheering and interest were redoubled.\n\nBut the captain and the ship's doctor cut short any attempt at lionizing\nby rushing the midshipmen to a stateroom containing three berths. Here,\nunder the doctor's orders, the trio were stripped and rubbed down. Then\nthey were rolled into blankets, and hot coffee brought to them in their\nberths, while their wet clothing was sent below to one of the furnace\nrooms for hurried drying.\n\nAs soon as the medical man had examined them, the steamship's captain\nbegan to question them.\n\n\"Headed for the Azores, eh?\" demanded the ship's master. \"We ought to be\nable to sight your squadron before long.\"\n\nHe hastened out, to give orders to the deck officer.\n\nBy the time that the young midshipmen had been satisfactorily warmed,\nand their clothing had been dried, the ship's surgeon consented to their\ndressing. After this they were led to a private cabin where a satisfying\nmeal was served them.\n\n\"Oh, I don't know,\" murmured Dan, leaning back, with a contented sigh,\nafter the meal was over; \"there are worse things than what happened to\nus to-day!\"\n\nThe greater speed of the liner enabled her to sight the battleship\nsquadron something more than two hours afterward. Then the nearest\nvessel of the fleet was steered for directly.\n\nThe deck officers of the liner sent their heavy overcoats for the use of\nthe midshipmen, who, enveloped in these roomy garments, went out on deck\nto watch the pursuit of their own comrades.\n\nWithin another hour it was possible to signal, and from the \"Princess\nIrene's\" masthead the signal flags were broken out.\n\n\"Now, watch for excitement on board your own craft,\" smiled the liner's\ncommander, an Englishman.\n\nAs soon as the liner's signal had been read by the vessels of the\nsquadron a wild display of signal bunting swiftly broke out.\n\n\"Heaven be thanked!\" read one set of signal flags.\n\n\"We have officially buried the young men, but ask them to go on living,\"\nread another.\n\nWhile the most practical signal of all was:\n\n\"The 'Massachusetts' will fall astern of the squadron. Kindly stand by\nto receive her launch.\"\n\nIn a few minutes more the two vessels were close enough. Both stopped\nheadway. One of the big battleship's launches put off and steamed over,\nrolling and pitching on the waves.\n\nMost carefully indeed the three midshipmen climbed down a rope ladder\nand were received by an ensign from the \"Massachusetts,\" who next gave\nthe American Navy's profound thanks to the rescuers of the middies.\n\n\"Kindly lower that United States property that was in our care, sir!\"\nDave Darrin called up.\n\nThere was good-humored laughter above, and a look of amazement on Ensign\nWhite's face until the two buoys, attached to lines, were thrown down\nover the side.\n\n\"When your time comes you will make a very capable officer, I believe,\nMr. Darrin, judging by your care of government property,\" remarked\nEnsign White, working hard to keep down the laughter.\n\n\"I hope to do so, sir,\" Dave replied, saluting.\n\nThen away to the \"Massachusetts\" the launch bore, while the whole\nbattleship squadron cheered itself hoarse over the happy outcome of the\nday.\n\nDave, Dan and Hallam all had to do a tremendous amount of handshaking\namong their classmates when they had reached deck. Pennington was the\nonly one who did not come forward to hold his hand out to Darrin--a fact\nthat was noted at the time by many of the youngsters.\n\nTo the captain the trio recounted what had befallen them, as matter for\nofficial record.\n\n\"Mr. Darrin and Mr. Dalzell,\" announced the battleship's captain, \"I\nmust commend you both for wholly heroic conduct in going to the aid of\nyour classmate. And, Mr. Darrin, I am particularly interested in your\nincidental determination to preserve government property--the life buoys\nthat you brought back with you.\"\n\n\"It's possible I may need them again, sir,\" returned Dave, with a smile,\nthough he had no notion of prophetic utterance.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\n\nMIDSHIPMAN PENNINGTON'S ACCIDENT\n\nThe stop at the Azores was uneventful. It remained in the minds of the\nmidshipmen only as a pleasant recollection of a quaint and pretty place.\n\nOnce more the squadron set sail, and now the homeward-bound pennant was\nflying. The course lay straight across the Atlantic to the entrance of\nChesapeake Bay.\n\nOn the second night out the wind was blowing a little less than half a\ngale.\n\nDarkness had fallen when Dave, Dan, Farley and several other midshipmen\ngathered to talk in low tones at the stern rail.\n\nPresently all of them wandered away but Dave. He stood close to the\nrail, enjoying the bumping motion every time the descending stern hit\none of the rolling waves.\n\nPresently, thinking he saw a light astern, he raised himself, peering\nastern.\n\nAnother group of restless middies had sauntered up. Pennington, after a\nswift look at the pacing officer in charge here, and discovering that\nthe officer's back was turned, executed a series of swift cartwheels.\n\n\"Look out, Pen!\" called Midshipman Dwight, in a low, though sharp voice.\n\nJust too late the warning came.\n\nAs Pen leaped to his feet after the last turn, one of his hands struck\nDarrin forcefully.\n\nDave swayed, tried to clutch at something, then--\n\n\"O-o-o-oh!\" rang the first startled chorus.\n\nThen, instantly, on top of it, came the rousing hail:\n\n\"Man overboard--astern!\"\n\nFarley and Hallam were the first to reach the rail. But Lieutenant\nBurton was there almost as quickly.\n\n\"Haul back!\" commanded the lieutenant sternly. \"No one go overboard!\"\n\nThat held the middies in check, for in no place, more than in the Navy,\nare orders orders.\n\nClack! was the sound that followed the first cry. Like a flash the\nmarine sentry had thrown his rifle to the deck. A single bound carried\nhim to one of the night life buoys. This he released, and hurled far\nastern.\n\nAs the night buoy struck the water a long-burning red light was fused by\ncontact. The glow shone out over the waters.\n\nIn the meantime, the \"Massachusetts's\" speed was being slowed rapidly,\nand a boat's crew stood at quarters.\n\nThe boat put off quickly, guided by the glow of the red signal light on\nthe buoy. Ere the boat reached the buoy the coxswain made out the head\nand shoulders of a young man above the rim of the floating buoy.\n\nSoon after the boat lay alongside. Dave, with the coxswain's aid, pulled\nhimself into the small craft.\n\nRecovering the buoy, the coxswain flashed the red light three times.\nFrom the deck of the battleship came a cheering yell sent up from\nhundreds of throats.\n\nIn the meantime, however, while the boat was on its way to the buoy, a\npulsing scene had been enacted on board.\n\nFarley went straight up to Midshipman Pennington.\n\n\"Sir,\" demanded Farley hotly, \"why did you push Mr. Darrin over the\nrail.\"\n\nPennington looked at his questioner as one stunned.\n\n\"I--I did push Darrin over,\" admitted Pennington, \"but it was an\naccident.\"\n\n\"An easily contrived one, wasn't it?\" demanded Midshipman Farley, rather\ncynically.\n\n\"It was pure accident,\" contended Pennington, paling. \"Until it happened\nI hadn't the least idea in the world that I was going to send Mr. Darrin\nor anyone else overboard.\"\n\n\"Huh!\" returned Farley dubiously.\n\n\"Huh!\" quoth Hallam.\n\nDan Dalzell uttered not a word, but the gaze of his eyes was fixed\nangrily on Pennington.\n\nThat latter midshipman turned as white as a sheet. His hands worked as\nthough he were attempting to clutch at something to hold himself up.\n\n\"Surely, you fellows don't believe, do you--\" he stammered weakly, then\npaused.\n\n\"One thing we did notice, the other day,\" continued Farley briskly, \"was\nthat, when Darrin was rescued from the sea and returned to us, you were\nabout the only member of the class who didn't go up to him and\ncongratulate him on his marvelous escape.\"\n\n\"How could--\"\n\n\"Mr. Pennington, I haven't the patience to talk with you now,\" rejoined\nFarley, turning on his heel.\n\nAt that moment the yell started among the midshipmen nearer the rail.\nFarley, Dan, Hallam and others joined in the yell and rushed to better\npoints of vantage.\n\nPennington tried to join in the cheer, but his tongue seemed fixed to\nthe roof of his mouth. He stood clenching and unclenching his hands, his\nface an ashen gray in his deep humiliation.\n\n\"I don't care what one or two fellows may say,\" groaned Pennington. \"But\nI don't want the class to think such things of me.\"\n\nHe was the most miserable man on board as the small boat came alongside.\nThe boat, occupants and all, was hoisted up to the davits and swung\nin-board. To the officer of the deck, who stood near-by, Dave turned,\nwith a brisk salute.\n\n\"I beg to report that I've come aboard, sir,\" Darrin uttered.\n\n\"And very glad we are of it, Mr. Darrin,\" replied the officer. \"You will\ngo to your locker, change your clothing and then report to the captain,\nsir.\"\n\n\"Aye, aye, sir.\"\n\nWith another salute, Dave hastened below, followed by Dan Dalzell, who\nwas intent on attending him.\n\nTen minutes later Dave appeared at the door of the captain's cabin. Just\na few minutes after that he came out on deck.\n\nA crowd gathered about him, expressing their congratulations.\n\n\"Thank you all,\" laughed Dave, \"but don't make so much over a middy\ngetting a bath outside of the schedule.\"\n\nTo the rear hung Pennington, waiting his chance. At last, as the crowd\nthinned, Pennington made his way up to Dave.\n\n\"Mr. Darrin, I have to apologize for my nonsense, which was the means of\npushing you overboard. It was purely accidental, on my honor. I did not\neven know it was you at the stern, nor did I realize that my antics\nwould result in pushing any one overboard. I trust you will do me the\nhonor of believing my statement.\"\n\n\"Of course I believe it, Mr. Pennington,\" answered Darrin, opening his\neyes.\n\n\"There are some,\" continued Pennington, \"who have intimated to me their\nbelief that I did it on purpose. There may be others who half believe or\nsuspect that I might, or would, do such a thing.\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" retorted Dave promptly. \"There may be differences,\nsometimes, between classmates, but there isn't a midshipman in the Navy\nwho would deliberately try to drown a comrade. It's a preposterous\ninsult against midshipman honor. If I hear any one make a charge like\nthat, I'll call him out promptly.\"\n\n\"Some of your friends--I won't name them--insisted, or at least let me\nfeel the force of their suspicions.\"\n\n\"If any of my friends hinted at such a thing, it was done in the heat of\nthe moment,\" replied Dave heartily. \"Why, Mr. Pennington, such an act of\ndishonor is impossible to a man bred at Annapolis.\"\n\nDarrin fully believed what he said. On the spur of the moment he held\nout his hand to his enemy.\n\nPennington flushed deeply, for a moment, then put out his own hand,\ngiving Dave's a hearty, straightforward grasp.\n\n\"I was the first to imply the charge,\" broke in Farley quickly. \"I\nwithdraw it, and apologize to both of you.\"\n\nThere was more handshaking.\n\nDuring the next few days, while Darry and Pen did not become by any\nmeans intimate, they no longer made any effort to avoid each other, but\nspoke frankly when they met.\n\nThe remaining days of the voyage passed uneventfully enough, except for\na great amount of hard work that the middies performed as usual.\n\nOn the twenty-second of August they entered Chesapeake Bay. Once well\ninside, they came to anchor. There was considerable practice with the\nsub-caliber and other smaller guns. On the twenty-ninth of August the\nbattleship fleet returned to the familiar waters around Annapolis. The\nday after that the young men disembarked.\n\nThen came a hurried skeltering, for the first, second and third classmen\nwere entitled to leave during the month of September.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\n\nBACK IN THE HOME TOWN\n\nBack in the old, well-known streets of their home town, Gridley!\n\nDave and Dan, enjoying every minute of their month's leave, had already\ngreeted their parents, and had told them much of their life as\nmidshipmen.\n\nWhat hurt was the fact that the skipper of the \"Princess Irene\" had\nalready told the marine reporters in New York the thrilling story of how\nDave and Dan had nearly come to their own deaths rescuing Midshipman\nHallam.\n\nEveryone in Gridley, it seemed, had read that newspaper story. Darrin\nand Dalzell, before they had been home twelve hours, were weary of\nhearing their praises sung.\n\n\"There go two of the smartest, finest boys that old Gridley ever turned\nout,\" citizens would say, pointing after Dave and Dan. \"They're\nmidshipmen at Annapolis; going to be officers of the Navy one of these\ndays.\"\n\n\"But what's the matter with Dick Prescott and Greg Holmes? They're at\nWest Point.\"\n\n\"Oh, they're all right, too, of course. But Darrin and Dalzell----\"\n\nIt was the old circumstance of being \"the lions of the minute\" and of\nbeing on the spot.\n\nOn the first morning of his arrival home Dave Darrin went frankly and\nopenly to call on his old schoolgirl sweetheart, Belle Meade.\n\nDan, having no particular associations with the gentler sex, took a\nstroll around town to meet any old friends who might care to see him\nagain.\n\nDave was shown into the parlor at the Meade home. Soon after Belle came\nswiftly in, her face beaming with delight.\n\n\"Oh, but you're not in uniform!\" was her first disappointed comment.\n\n\"No,\" smiled Dave. \"I'm allowed every possible chance, for one month, to\nforget every detail of the big grind which for a short time I've left\nbehind.\"\n\n\"But you're the same old Dave,\" cried Belle, \"only bigger and manlier.\nAnd that magnificent work you and Dan did in jumping over-bo----\"\n\n\"Stop!\" begged Dave. \"You're a friend of mine, aren't you! Then don't\nadd to the pain that has been already inflicted on me. If I had had the\nnewspapers in mind I wouldn't have the nerve to---- But please let's not\ntalk about it anymore.\"\n\nThen the two young people seated themselves and spent a delightful hour\nin talking over all that had befallen them both since they had last met.\n\nBelle, too, through Laura Bentley, had some much later news of the old\nchums, Dick and Greg, now cadets at West Point.\n\nThis news, however, will be found in full in \"DICK PRESCOTT'S SECOND\nYEAR AT WEST POINT.\"\n\n\"What are your plans for this afternoon?\" Belle asked at last.\n\n\"That's what I want your help in making,\" Dave answered.\n\n\"Can you get hold of Dan?\"\n\n\"No trouble about that. But keeping hold of him may be more difficult,\"\nlaughed Dave.\n\n\"I was going to propose that you get Dan, call here and then we'll all\ngo over to Laura Bentley's. I know she'll be anxious to see us.\"\n\n\"Nothing could be better in the way of a plan,\" assented Dave. \"I'll pin\nDanny boy down to that. It would really seem like a slight on good old\nDick if we didn't make Laura an early call.\"\n\n\"I'll go to the telephone, now, and tell her that we're coming,\" cried\nBelle, rising quickly.\n\n\"Laura is delighted,\" she reported, on her return to the room. \"But\nDave, didn't you at least bring along a uniform, so that we could see\nwhat it looks like?\"\n\n\"I didn't,\" replied Dave, soberly, then added, quizzically:\n\n\"You've seen the district messenger boys on the street, haven't you?\"\n\n\"Yes, of course; but what--\"\n\n\"Our uniforms look very much like theirs,\" declared Dave.\n\n\"I'm afraid I can't undertake to believe you,\" Belle pouted.\n\n\"Well, anyway, you girls will soon have a chance to see our uniforms.\nJust as soon as our hops start, this fall, you and Laura will come down\nand gladden our hearts by letting us drag you, won't you!\"\n\n\"Drag us?\" repeated Belle, much mystified.\n\n\"Oh, that's middies' slang for escorting a pretty girl to a midshipman\nhop.\"\n\n\"You have a lot of slang, then, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Considerable,\" admitted Dave readily.\n\n\"What, then, is your slang for a pretty girl?\"\n\n\"Oh, we call her a queen.\"\n\n\"And a girl who is--who isn't--pretty?\"\n\n\"A gold brick,\" answered Dave unblushingly.\n\n\"A gold brick?\" gasped Belle. \"Dear me! 'Dragging a gold brick' to a hop\ndoesn't sound romantic, does it?\"\n\n\"It isn't,\" Darrin admitted.\n\n\"Yet you have invited me--\"\n\n\"Our class hasn't started in with its course of social compliments yet,\"\nlaughed Dave. \"Please go look in the glass. Or, if you won't believe the\nglass, then just wait and see how proud Dan and I are if we can lead you\nand Laura out on the dancing floor.\"\n\n\"But what horrid slang!\" protested Belle. \"The idea of calling a homely\ngirl a gold brick! And I thought you young men received more or less\ntraining in being gracious to the weaker sex.\"\n\n\"We do,\" Dave answered, \"as soon as we can find any use for the\naccomplishment. Fourth classmen, you know, are considered too young to\nassociate with girls. It's only now, when we've made a start in the\nthird class, that we're to be allowed to attend the hops at all.\"\n\n\"But why must you have to have such horrid names for girls who have not\nbeen greatly favored in the way of looks? It doesn't sound exactly\ngallant.\"\n\n\"Oh, well, you know,\" laughed Dave, \"we poor, despised, no-account\nmiddies must have some sort of sincere language to talk after we get our\nmasks off for the day. I suppose we like the privilege, for a few\nminutes in each day, of being fresh, like other young folks.\"\n\n\"What is your name for 'fresh' down at Annapolis!\" Belle wanted to know.\n\n\"Touge.\"\n\n\"And for being a bit worse than touge?\"\n\n\"Ratey.\"\n\n\"Which did they call you?\" demanded Belle.\n\nDave started, then sat up straight, staring at Miss Meade.\n\n\"I see that your tongue hasn't lost its old incisiveness,\" he laughed.\n\n\"Not among my friends,\" Belle replied lightly. \"But I can't get my mind\noff that uniform of yours that you didn't bring home. What would have\nhappened to you if you had been bold enough to do it?\"\n\n\"I guess I'd have 'frapped the pap,'\" hazarded Dave.\n\n\"And what on earth is 'frapping the pap'?\" gasped Belle.\n\n\"Oh, that's a brief way of telling about it when a midshipman gets stuck\non the conduct report.\"\n\n\"I'm going to buy a notebook,\" asserted Belle, \"and write down and\nclassify some of this jargon. I'd hate to visit a strange country, like\nAnnapolis, and find I didn't know the language. And, Dave, what sort of\nplace is Annapolis, anyway?\"\n\n\"Oh, it's a suburb of the Naval Academy,\" Dave answered.\n\n\"Is it dreadfully hard to keep one's place in his class there?\" asked\nBelle.\n\n\"Well, the average fellow is satisfied if he doesn't 'bust cold,'\" Dave\ninformed her.\n\n\"Gracious! What sort of explosion is 'busting cold'?\"\n\n\"Why, that means getting down pretty close to absolute zero in all\nstudies. When a fellow has the hard luck to bust cold the superintendent\nallows him all his time, thereafter, to go home and look up a more\nsuitable job than one in the Navy. And when a fellow bilges----\"\n\n\"Stop!\" begged Belle. \"Wait!\"\n\nShe fled from the room, to return presently bearing the prettiest hat\nthat Dave ever remembered having seen on her shapely young head. In one\nhand she carried a dainty parasol that she turned over to him.\n\n\"What's the cruise?\" asked Darrin, rising.\n\n\"I'm going out to get that notebook, now. Please don't talk any more\n'midshipman' to me until I get a chance to set the jargon down.\"\n\nAs she stood there, such a pretty and wholesome picture, David Darrin\nthought he never before had seen such a pretty girl, nor one dressed in\nsuch exquisite taste. Being a boy, it did not occur to him that Belle\nMeade had been engaged for weeks in designing this gown and others that\nshe meant to wear during his brief stay at home.\n\n\"What are you thinking of?\" asked Belle.\n\n\"What a pity it is that I am doomed to a short life,\" sighed Darrin.\n\n\"A short life? What do you mean?\" Belle asked.\n\n\"Why, I'm going to be assassinated, the first hop that you attend at the\nNaval Academy.\"\n\n\"So I'm a gold brick, am I?\" frowned Belle.\n\n\"You--a--gold brick?\" stammered Dave. \"Why, you--oh, go look in the\nglass!\"\n\n\"Who will assassinate you?\"\n\n\"A committee made up from among the fellows whose names I don't write\ndown on your dance card. And there are hundreds of them at Annapolis.\nYou can't dance with them all.\"\n\n\"I don't intend to,\" replied Belle, with a toss of her head. \"I'll\naccept, as partners, only those who appear to me the handsomest and most\ndistinguished looking of the midshipmen. No one else can write his name\non my card.\"\n\n\"Dear girl, I'm afraid you don't understand our way of making up dance\ncards at Crabtown.\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"Crabtown. That's our local name for Annapolis.\"\n\n\"Gracious! Let me get out quickly and get that notebook!\"\n\n\"At midshipmen's hops the fellow who drags the----\"\n\n\"Gold brick,\" supplied Belle, resignedly.\n\n\"No--not for worlds! You're no gold brick, Belle, and you know it, even\nthough you do refuse to go to the mirror. But the fellow who drags any\nfemme--\"\n\n\"Please--?\"\n\n\"'Femme' stands for girl. The fellow who drags any femme makes up her\ndance card for her.\"\n\n\"And she hasn't a word to say about it?\"\n\n\"Not as a rule.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" cried Belle, dramatically.\n\nShe moved toward the door. Dave, who could not take his eyes from her\npretty face, managed, somehow, to delay her.\n\n\"Belle, there's something--\" he began.\n\n\"Good gracious! Where? What?\" she cried, looking about her keenly.\n\n\"It's something I want to say--must say,\" Dave went on with more of an\neffort than anyone but himself could guess.\n\n\"Tell me, as we're going down the street,\" invited Belle.\n\n\"_Wha-a-at?_\" choked Dave. \"Well, I guess not!\"\n\nHe faced her, resting both hands lightly on her shoulders.\n\n\"Belle, we were pretty near sweethearts in the High School, I think,\" he\nwent on, huskily, but looking her straight in the eyes. \"At least, that\nwas my hope, and I hope, most earnestly, that it's going to continue.\nBelle, I am a long way from my real career, yet. It will be five years,\nyet, before I have any right to marry. But I want to look forward, all\nthe time, to the sweet belief that my schoolgirl sweetheart is going to\nbecome my wife one of these days. I want that as a goal to work for,\nalong with my commission in the Navy. But to this much I agree: if you\nsay 'yes' now, and find later that you have made a mistake, you will\ntell me so frankly.\"\n\n\"Poor boy!\" murmured Belle, looking at him fully. \"You've been a plebe\nuntil lately, and you haven't been allowed to see any girls. I'm not\ngoing to take advantage of you as heartlessly as that.\"\n\nYet something in her eyes gave the midshipman hope.\n\n\"Belle,\" he continued eagerly, \"don't trifle with me. Tell me--will you\nmarry me some day?\"\n\nThen there was a little more talk and--well, it's no one's business.\n\n\"But we're not so formally engaged,\" Belle warned him, \"that you\n\n### Summary:\n\n"}

(Wilson) Oliphant\n\n\n\n\nI\n\n\nShe was very old, and therefore it was very hard for her to make up her\nmind to die. I am aware that this is not at all the general view, but\nthat it is believed, as old age must be near death, that it prepares the\nsoul for that inevitable event. It is not so, however, in many cases. In\nyouth we are still so near the unseen out of which we came, that death is\nrather pathetic than tragic,--a thing that touches all hearts, but to\nwhich, in many cases, the young hero accommodates himself sweetly and\ncourageously. And amid the storms and burdens of middle life there are\nmany times when we would fain push open the door that stands ajar, and\nbehind which there is ease for all our pains, or at least rest, if\nnothing more. But age, which has gone through both these phases, is apt,\nout of long custom and habit, to regard the matter from a different view.\nAll things that are violent have passed out of its life,--no more strong\nemotions, such as rend the heart; no great labors, bringing after them\nthe weariness which is unto death; but the calm of an existence which is\nenough for its needs, which affords the moderate amount of comfort and\npleasure for which its being is now adapted, and of which there seems no\nreason that there should ever be any end. To passion, to joy, to anguish,\nan end must come; but mere gentle living, determined by a framework of\ngentle rules and habits--why should that ever be ended? When a soul has\ngot to this retirement and is content in it, it becomes very hard to die;\nhard to accept the necessity of dying, and to accustom one's self to the\nidea, and still harder to consent to carry it out.\n\nThe woman who is the subject of the following narrative was in this\nposition. She had lived through almost everything that is to be found in\nlife. She had been beautiful in her youth, and had enjoyed all the\ntriumphs of beauty; had been intoxicated with flattery, and triumphant in\nconquest, and mad with jealousy and the bitterness of defeat when it\nbecame evident that her day was over. She had never been a bad woman, or\nfalse, or unkind; but she had thrown herself with all her heart into\nthose different stages of being, and had suffered as much as she enjoyed,\naccording to the unfailing usage of life. Many a day during these storms\nand victories, when things went against her, when delights did not\nsatisfy her, she had thrown out a cry into the wide air of the universe\nand wished to die. And then she had come to the higher table-land of\nlife, and had borne all the spites of fortune,--had been poor and rich,\nand happy and sorrowful; had lost and won a hundred times over; had sat\nat feasts, and kneeled by deathbeds, and followed her best-beloved to the\ngrave, often, often crying out to God above to liberate her, to make an\nend of her anguish, for that her strength was exhausted and she could\nbear no more. But she had borne it and lived through all; and now had\narrived at a time when all strong sensations are over, when the soul is\nno longer either triumphant or miserable, and when life itself, and\ncomfort and ease, and the warmth of the sun, and of the fireside, and the\nmild beauty of home were enough for her, and she required no more. That\nis, she required very little more, a useful routine of hours and rules, a\nplay of reflected emotion, a pleasant exercise of faculty, making her\nfeel herself still capable of the best things in life--of interest in her\nfellow-creatures, kindness to them, and a little gentle intellectual\noccupation, with books and men around. She had not forgotten anything in\nher life,--not the excitements and delights of her beauty, nor love, nor\ngrief, nor the higher levels she had touched in her day. She did not\nforget the dark day when her first-born was laid in the grave, nor that\ntriumphant and brilliant climax of her life when every one pointed to her\nas the mother of a hero. All these things were like pictures hung in the\nsecret chambers of her mind, to which she could go back in silent\nmoments, in the twilight seated by the fire, or in the balmy afternoon,\nwhen languor and sweet thoughts are over the world. Sometimes at such\nmoments there would be heard from her a faint sob, called forth, it was\nquite as likely, by the recollection of the triumph as by that of the\ndeathbed. With these pictures to go back upon at her will she was never\ndull, but saw herself moving through the various scenes of her life with\na continual sympathy, feeling for herself in all her troubles,--sometimes\napproving, sometimes judging that woman who had been so pretty, so happy,\nso miserable, and had gone through everything that life can go through.\nHow much that is, looking back upon it!--passages so hard that the wonder\nwas how she could survive them; pangs so terrible that the heart would\nseem at its last gasp, but yet would revive and go on.\n\nBesides these, however, she had many mild pleasures.  She had a pretty\nhouse full of things which formed a graceful _entourage_ suitable, as\nshe felt, for such a woman as she was, and in which she took pleasure for\ntheir own beauty,--soft chairs and couches, a fireplace and lights\nwhich were the perfection of tempered warmth and illumination.  She had a\ncarriage, very comfortable and easy, in which, when the weather was\nsuitable, she went out; and a pretty garden and lawns, in which, when she\npreferred staying at home, she could have her little walk, or sit out\nunder the trees.  She had books in plenty, and all the newspapers, and\neverything that was needful to keep her within the reflection of the busy\nlife which she no longer cared to encounter in her own person.  The post\nrarely brought her painful letters; for all those impassioned interests\nwhich bring pain had died out, and the sorrows of others, when they were\ncommunicated to her, gave her a luxurious sense of sympathy, yet\nexemption. She was sorry for them; but such catastrophes could touch her\nno more: and often she had pleasant letters, which afforded her something\nto talk and think about, and discuss as if it concerned her,--and yet did\nnot concern her,--business which could not hurt her if it failed, which\nwould please her if it succeeded. Her letters, her papers, her books,\neach coming at its appointed hour, were all instruments of pleasure. She\ncame down-stairs at a certain hour, which she kept to as if it had been\nof the utmost importance, although it was of no importance at all: she\ntook just so much good wine, so many cups of tea. Her repasts were as\nregular as clockwork--never too late, never too early. Her whole life\nwent on velvet, rolling smoothly along, without jar or interruption,\nblameless, pleasant, kind. People talked of her old age as a model of old\nage, with no bitterness or sourness in it. And, indeed, why should she\nhave been sour or bitter? It suited her far better to be kind. She was in\nreality kind to everybody, liking to see pleasant faces about her. The\npoor had no reason to complain of her; her servants were very\ncomfortable; and the one person in her house who was nearer to her own\nlevel, who was her companion and most important minister, was very\ncomfortable too. This was a young woman about twenty, a very distant\nrelation, with \"no claim,\" everybody said, upon her kind mistress and\nfriend,--the daughter of a distant cousin.  How very few think anything\nat all of such a tie! but Lady Mary had taken her young namesake when she\nwas a child, and she had grown up as it were at her godmother's\nfootstool, in the conviction that the measured existence of the old was\nthe rule of life, and that her own trifling personality counted for\nnothing, or next to nothing, in its steady progress.  Her name was Mary\ntoo--always called \"little Mary\" as having once been little, and not yet\nvery much in the matter of size.  She was one of the pleasantest things\nto look at of all the pretty things in Lady Mary's rooms, and she had the\nmost sheltered, peaceful, and pleasant life that could be conceived.  The\nonly little thorn in her pillow was, that whereas in the novels, of which\nshe read a great many, the heroines all go and pay visits and have\nadventures, she had none, but lived constantly at home.  There was\nsomething much more serious in her life, had she known, which was that\nshe had nothing, and no power of doing anything for herself; that she had\nall her life been accustomed to a modest luxury which would make poverty\nvery hard to her; and that Lady Mary was over eighty, and had made no\nwill. If she did not make any will, her property would all go to her\ngrandson, who was so rich already that her fortune would be but as a drop\nin the ocean to him; or to some great-grandchildren of whom she knew very\nlittle,--the descendants of a daughter long ago dead who had married an\nAustrian, and who were therefore foreigners both in birth and name. That\nshe should provide for little Mary was therefore a thing which nature\ndemanded, and which would hurt nobody. She had said so often; but she\ndeferred the doing of it as a thing for which there was no hurry. For why\nshould she die? There seemed no reason or need for it. So long as she\nlived, nothing could be more sure, more happy and serene, than little\nMary's life; and why should she die? She did not perhaps put this into\nwords; but the meaning of her smile, and the manner in which she put\naside every suggestion about the chances of the hereafter away from her,\nsaid it more clearly than words. It was not that she had any\nsuperstitious fear about the making of a will. When the doctor or the\nvicar or her man of business, the only persons who ever talked to her on\nthe subject, ventured periodically to refer to it, she assented\npleasantly,--yes, certainly, she must do it--some time or other.\n\n\"It is a very simple thing to do,\" the lawyer said.  \"I will save you all\ntrouble; nothing but your signature will be wanted--and that you give\nevery day.\"\n\n\"Oh, I should think nothing of the trouble!\" she said.\n\n\"And it would liberate your mind from all care, and leave you free to\nthink of things more important still,\" said the clergyman.\n\n\"I think I am very free of care,\" she replied.\n\nThen the doctor added bluntly, \"And you will not die an hour the sooner\nfor having made your will.\"\n\n\"Die!\" said Lady Mary, surprised.  And then she added, with a smile, \"I\nhope you don't think so little of me as to believe I would be kept back\nby that?\"\n\nThese gentlemen all consulted together in despair, and asked each other\nwhat should be done. They thought her an egotist--a cold-hearted old\nwoman, holding at arm's length any idea of the inevitable. And so she\ndid; but not because she was cold-hearted,--because she was so accustomed\nto living, and had survived so many calamities, and gone on so long--so\nlong; and because everything was so comfortably arranged about her--all\nher little habits so firmly established, as if nothing could interfere\nwith them. To think of the day arriving which should begin with some\nother formula than that of her maid's entrance drawing aside the\ncurtains, lighting the cheerful fire, bringing her a report of the\nweather; and then the little tray, resplendent with snowy linen and\nshining silver and china, with its bouquet of violets or a rose in the\nseason, the newspaper carefully dried and cut, the letters,--every detail\nwas so perfect, so unchanging, regular as the morning. It seemed\nimpossible that it should come to an end. And then when she came\ndownstairs, there were all the little articles upon her table always\nready to her hand; a certain number of things to do, each at the\nappointed hour; the slender refreshments it was necessary for her to\ntake, in which there was a little exquisite variety--but never any change\nin the fact that at eleven and at three and so forth something had to be\ntaken. Had a woman wanted to abandon the peaceful life which was thus\nsupported and carried on, the very framework itself would have resisted.\nIt was impossible (almost) to contemplate the idea that at a given moment\nthe whole machinery must stop.  She was neither without heart nor without\nreligion, but on the contrary a good woman, to whom many gentle thoughts\nhad been given at various portions of her career.  But the occasion\nseemed to have passed for that as well as other kinds of emotion. The\nmere fact of living was enough for her. The little exertion which it was\nwell she was required to make produced a pleasant weariness. It was a\nduty much enforced upon her by all around her, that she should do nothing\nwhich would exhaust or fatigue.  \"I don't want you to think,\" even the\ndoctor would say; \"you have done enough of thinking in your time.\"  And\nthis she accepted with great composure of spirit. She had thought and\nfelt and done much in her day; but now everything of the kind was over.\nThere was no need for her to fatigue herself; and day followed day, all\nwarm and sheltered and pleasant.  People died, it is true, now and then,\nout of doors; but they were mostly young people, whose death might have\nbeen prevented had proper care been taken,--who were seized with violent\nmaladies, or caught sudden infections, or were cut down by accident; all\nwhich things seemed natural. Her own contemporaries were very few, and\nthey were like herself--living on in something of the same way. At\neighty-five all people under seventy are young; and one's contemporaries\nare very, very few.\n\nNevertheless these men did disturb her a little about her will. She had\nmade more than one will in the former days during her active life; but\nall those to whom she had bequeathed her possessions were dead. She had\nsurvived them all, and inherited from many of them; which had been a hard\nthing in its time. One day the lawyer had been more than ordinarily\npressing. He had told her stories of men who had died intestate, and left\ntrouble and penury behind them to those whom they would have most wished\nto preserve from all trouble. It would not have become Mr. Furnival to\nsay brutally to Lady Mary, \"This is how you will leave your godchild when\nyou die.\" But he told her story after story, many of them piteous enough.\n\n\"People think it is so troublesome a business,\" he said, \"when it is\nnothing at all--the most easy matter in the world. We are getting so\nmuch less particular nowadays about formalities. So long as the\ntestator's intentions are made quite apparent--that is the chief matter,\nand a very bad thing for us lawyers.\"\n\n\"I dare say,\" said Lady Mary, \"it is unpleasant for a man to think of\nhimself as 'the testator.' It is a very abstract title, when you come to\nthink of it.\"\n\n\"Pooh'\" said Mr. Furnival, who had no sense of humor.\n\n\"But if this great business is so very simple,\" she went on, \"one could\ndo it, no doubt, for one's self?\"\n\n\"Many people do, but it is never advisable,\" said the lawyer. \"You will\nsay it is natural for me to tell you that. When they do, it should be as\nsimple as possible. I give all my real property, or my personal property,\nor my share in so-and-so, or my jewels, or so forth, to--whoever it may\nbe. The fewer words the better,--so that nobody may be able to read\nbetween the lines, you know,--and the signature attested by two\nwitnesses; but they must not be witnesses that have any interest; that\nis, that have anything left to them by the document they witness.\"\n\nLady Mary put up her hand defensively, with a laugh. It was still a most\ndelicate hand, like ivory, a little yellowed with age, but fine, the\nveins standing out a little upon it, the finger-tips still pink. \"You\nspeak,\" she said, \"as if you expected me to take the law in my own hands.\nNo, no, my old friend; never fear, you shall have the doing of it.\"\n\n\"Whenever you please, my dear lady--whenever you please. Such a thing\ncannot be done an hour too soon. Shall I take your instructions now?\"\n\nLady Mary laughed, and said, \"You were always a very keen man for\nbusiness. I remember your father used to say, Robert would never neglect\nan opening.\"\n\n\"No,\" he said, with a peculiar look. \"I have always looked after my\nsix-and-eightpences; and in that case it is true, the pounds take care of\nthemselves.\"\n\n\"Very good care,\" said Lady Mary; and then she bade her young companion\nbring that book she had been reading, where there was something she\nwanted to show Mr. Furnival. \"It is only a case in a novel, but I am sure\nit is bad law; give me your opinion,\" she said.\n\nHe was obliged to be civil, very civil. Nobody is rude to the Lady Marys\nof life; and besides, she was old enough to have an additional right to\nevery courtesy. But while he sat over the novel, and tried with\nunnecessary vehemence to make her see what very bad law it was, and\nglanced from her smiling attention to the innocent sweetness of the girl\nbeside her, who was her loving attendant, the good man's heart was sore.\nHe said many hard things of her in his own mind as he went away.\n\n\"She will die,\" he said bitterly. \"She will go off in a moment when\nnobody is looking for it, and that poor child will be left destitute.\"\n\nIt was all he could do not to go back and take her by her fragile old\nshoulders and force her to sign and seal at once. But then he knew very\nwell that as soon as he found himself in her presence, he would of\nnecessity be obliged to subdue his impatience, and be once more civil,\nvery civil, and try to suggest and insinuate the duty which he dared not\nforce upon her. And it was very clear that till she pleased she would\ntake no hint. He supposed it must be that strange reluctance to part with\ntheir power which is said to be common to old people, or else that horror\nof death, and determination to keep it at arm's length, which is also\ncommon. Thus he did as spectators are so apt to do, he forced a meaning\nand motive into what had no motive at all, and imagined Lady Mary, the\nkindest of women, to be of purpose and intention risking the future of\nthe girl whom she had brought up, and whom she loved,--not with passion,\nindeed, or anxiety, but with tender benevolence; a theory which was as\nfalse as anything could be.\n\nThat evening in her room, Lady Mary, in a very cheerful mood, sat\nby a little bright unnecessary fire, with her writing-book before her,\nwaiting till she should be sleepy. It was the only point in which she\nwas a little hard upon her maid, who in every other respect was the\nbest-treated of servants. Lady Mary, as it happened, had often no\ninclination for bed till the night was far advanced. She slept little, as\nis common enough at her age. She was in her warm wadded dressing-gown, an\narticle in which she still showed certain traces (which were indeed\nvisible in all she wore) of her ancient beauty, with her white hair\nbecomingly arranged under a cap of cambric and lace. At the last moment,\nwhen she had been ready to step into bed, she had changed her mind, and\ntold Jervis that she would write a letter or two first. And she had\nwritten her letters, but still felt no inclination to sleep. Then there\nfluttered across her memory somehow the conversation she had held with\nMr. Furnival in the morning. It would be amusing, she thought, to cheat\nhim out of some of those six-and-eightpences he pretended to think so\nmuch of. It would be still more amusing, next time the subject of her\nwill was recurred to, to give his arm a little tap with her fan, and say,\n\"Oh, that is all settled, months ago.\" She laughed to herself at this,\nand took out a fresh sheet of paper. It was a little jest that pleased\nher.\n\n\"Do you think there is any one up yet, Jervis, except you and me?\" she\nsaid to the maid. Jervis hesitated a little, and then said that she\nbelieved Mr. Brown had not gone to bed yet; for he had been going over\nthe cellar, and was making up his accounts. Jervis was so explanatory\nthat her mistress divined what was meant. \"I suppose I have been spoiling\nsport, keeping you here,\" she said good-humoredly; for it was well known\nthat Miss Jervis and Mr. Brown were engaged, and that they were only\nwaiting (everybody knew but Lady Mary, who never suspected it) the death\nof their mistress, to set up a lodging-house in Jermyn Street, where they\nfully intended to make their fortune. \"Then go,\" Lady Mary said, \"and\ncall Brown. I have a little business paper to write, and you must both\nwitness my signature.\" She laughed to herself a little as she said this,\nthinking how she would steel a march on Mr. Furnival. \"I give, and\nbequeath,\" she said to herself playfully, after Jervis had hurried away.\nShe fully intended to leave both of these good servants something, but\nthen she recollected that people who are interested in a will cannot sign\nas witnesses. \"What does it matter?\" she said to herself gayly; \"If it\never should be wanted, Mary would see to that.\" Accordingly she dashed\noff, in her pretty, old-fashioned handwriting, which was very angular and\npointed, as was the fashion in her day, and still very clear, though\nslightly tremulous, a few lines, in which, remembering playfully Mr.\nFurnival's recommendation of \"few words,\" she left to little Mary all she\npossessed, adding, by the prompting of that recollection about the\nwitnesses, \"She will take care of the servants.\" It filled one side only\nof the large sheet of notepaper, which was what Lady Mary habitually\nused. Brown, introduced timidly by Jervis, and a little overawed by the\nsolemnity of the bedchamber, came in and painted solidly his large\nsignature after the spidery lines of his mistress. She had folded down\nthe paper, so that neither saw what it was.\n\n\"Now I will go to bed,\" Lady Mary said, when Brown had left the room.\n\"And Jervis, you must go to bed too.\"\n\n\"Yes, my lady,\" said Jervis.\n\n\"I don't approve of courtship at this hour.\"\n\n\"No, my lady,\" Jervis replied, deprecating and disappointed.\n\n\"Why cannot he tell his tale in daylight?\"\n\n\"Oh, my lady, there's no tale to tell,\" cried the maid. \"We are not of\nthe gossiping sort, my lady, neither me nor Mr. Brown.\" Lady Mary\nlaughed, and watched while the candles were put out, the fire made a\npleasant flicker in the room,--it was autumn and still warm, and it was\n\"for company\" and cheerfulness that the little fire was lit; she liked to\nsee it dancing and flickering upon the walls,--and then closed her eyes\namid an exquisite softness of comfort and luxury, life itself bearing her\nup as softly, filling up all the crevices as warmly, as the downy pillow\nupon which she rested her still beautiful old head.\n\nIf she had died that night! The little sheet of paper that meant so much\nlay openly, innocently, in her writing-book, along with the letters she\nhad written, and looking of as little importance as they. There was\nnobody in the world who grudged old Lady Mary one of those pretty placid\ndays of hers. Brown and Jervis, if they were sometimes a little\nimpatient, consoled each other that they were both sure of something in\nher will, and that in the mean time it was a very good place. And all the\nrest would have been very well content that Lady Mary should live\nforever. But how wonderfully it would have simplified everything, and how\nmuch trouble and pain it would have saved to everybody, herself included,\ncould she have died that night!\n\nBut naturally, there was no question of dying on that night. When she was\nabout to go downstairs, next day, Lady Mary, giving her letters to be\nposted, saw the paper she had forgotten lying beside them. She had\nforgotten all about it, but the sight of it made her smile. She folded\nit up and put it in an envelope while Jervis went down-stairs with the\nletters; and then, to carry out her joke, she looked round her to see\nwhere she would put it. There was an old Italian cabinet in the room,\nwith a secret drawer, which it was a little difficult to open,--almost\nimpossible for any one who did not know the secret. Lady Mary looked\nround her, smiled, hesitated a little, and then walked across the room\nand put the envelope in the secret drawer. She was still fumbling with it\nwhen Jervis came back; but there was no connection in Jervis's mind, then\nor ever after, between the paper she had signed and this old cabinet,\nwhich was one of the old lady's toys. She arranged Lady Mary's shawl,\nwhich had dropped off her shoulders a little in her unusual activity,\nand took up her book and her favorite cushion, and all the little\nparaphernalia that moved with her, and gave her lady her arm to go\ndown-stairs; where little Mary had placed her chair just at the right\nangle, and arranged the little table, on which there were so many little\nnecessaries and conveniences, and was standing smiling, the prettiest\nobject of all, the climax of the gentle luxury and pleasantness, to\nreceive her godmother, who had been her providence all her life.\n\nBut what a pity! oh, what a pity, that she had not died that night!\n\n\n\n\nII.\n\n\nLife went on after this without any change. There was never any change in\nthat delightful house; and if it was years, or months, or even days, the\nyoungest of its inhabitants could scarcely tell, and Lady Mary could not\ntell at all. This was one of her little imperfections,--a little mist\nwhich hung, like the lace about her head, over her memory. She could not\nremember how time went, or that there was any difference between one day\nand another. There were Sundays, it was true, which made a kind of gentle\nmeasure of the progress of time; but she said, with a smile, that she\nthought it was always Sunday--they came so close upon each other. And\ntime flew on gentle wings, that made no sound and left no reminders. She\nhad her little ailments like anybody, but in reality less than anybody,\nseeing there was nothing to fret her, nothing to disturb the even tenor\nof her days. Still there were times when she took a little cold, or got a\nchill, in spite of all precautions, as she went from one room to another.\nShe came to be one of the marvels of the time,--an old lady who had seen\neverybody worth seeing for generations back; who remembered as distinctly\nas if they had happened yesterday, great events that had taken place\nbefore the present age began at all, before the great statesmen of our\ntime were born; and in full possession of all her faculties, as everybody\nsaid, her mind as clear as ever, her intelligence as active, reading\neverything, interested in everything, and still beautiful, in extreme old\nage. Everybody about her, and in particular all the people who helped to\nkeep the thorns from her path, and felt themselves to have a hand in her\npreservation, were proud of Lady Mary and she was perhaps a little, a\nvery little, delightfully, charmingly, proud of herself. The doctor,\nbeguiled by professional vanity, feeling what a feather she was in his\ncap, quite confident that she would reach her hundredth birthday, and\nwith an ecstatic hope that even, by grace of his admirable treatment and\nher own beautiful constitution, she might (almost) solve the problem and\nlive forever, gave up troubling about the will which at a former period\nhe had taken so much interest in. \"What is the use?\" he said; \"she will\nsee us all out.\" And the vicar, though he did not give in to this, was\noverawed by the old lady, who knew everything that could be taught her,\nand to whom it seemed an impertinence to utter commonplaces about duty,\nor even to suggest subjects of thought. Mr. Furnival was the only man who\ndid not cease his representations, and whose anxiety about the young\nMary, who was so blooming and sweet in the shadow of the old, did not\ndecrease. But the recollection of the bit of paper in the secret drawer\nof the cabinet, fortified his old client against all his attacks. She had\nintended it only as a jest, with which some day or other to confound him,\nand show how much wiser she was than he supposed. It became quite a\npleasant subject of thought to her, at which she laughed to herself. Some\nday, when she had a suitable moment, she would order him to come with all\nhis formalities, and then produce her bit of paper, and turn the laugh\nagainst him. But oddly, the very existence of that little document kept\nher indifferent even to the laugh. It was too much trouble; she only\nsmiled at him, and took no more notice, amused to think how astonished\nhe would be,--when, if ever, he found it out.\n\nIt happened, however, that one day in the early winter the wind changed\nwhen Lady Mary was out for her drive; at least they all vowed the wind\nchanged. It was in the south, that genial quarter, when she set out, but\nturned about in some uncomfortable way, and was a keen northeaster when\nshe came back. And in the moment of stepping from the carriage, she\ncaught a chill. It was the coachman's fault, Jervis said, who allowed the\nhorses to make a step forward when Lady Mary was getting out, and kept\nher exposed, standing on the step of the carriage, while he pulled them\nup; and it was Jervis's fault, the footman said, who was not clever\nenough to get her lady out, or even to throw a shawl round her when she\nperceived how the weather had changed. It is always some one's fault, or\nsome unforeseen, unprecedented change, that does it at the last. Lady\nMary was not accustomed to be ill, and did not bear it with her usual\ngrace. She was a little impatient at first, and thought they were making\nan unnecessary fuss. But then there passed a few uncomfortable feverish\ndays, when she began to look forward to the doctor's visit as the only\nthing there was any comfort in. Afterwards she passed a night of a very\nagitating kind. She dozed and dreamed, and awoke and dreamed again. Her\nlife seemed all to run into dreams,--a strange confusion was about her,\nthrough which she could define nothing. Once waking up, as she supposed,\nshe saw a group round her bed, the doctor,--with a candle in his hand,\n(how should the doctor be there in the middle of the night?) holding her\nhand or feeling her pulse; little Mary at one side, crying,--why should\nthe child cry?--and Jervis, very, anxious, pouring something into a\nglass. There were other faces there which she was sure must have come out\nof a dream,--so unlikely was it that they should be collected in her\nbedchamber,--and all with a sort of halo of feverish light about them; a\nmagnified and mysterious importance. This strange scene, which she did\nnot understand, seemed to make itself visible all in a moment out of the\ndarkness, and then disappeared again as suddenly as it came.\n\n\n\n\nIII.\n\n\nWhen she woke again, it was morning; and her first waking consciousness\nwas, that she must be much better. The choking sensation in her throat\nwas altogether gone. She had no desire to cough--no difficulty in\nbreathing. She had a fancy, however, that she must be still dreaming,\nfor she felt sure that some one had called her by her name, \"Mary.\"\nNow all who could call her by her Christian name were dead years ago;\ntherefore it must be a dream. However, in a short time it was\nrepeated,--\"Mary, Mary! get up; there is a great deal to do.\" This voice\nconfused her greatly. Was it possible that all that was past had been\nmere fancy, that she had but dreamed those long, long years,--maturity\nand motherhood, and trouble and triumph, and old age at the end of all?\nIt seemed to her possible that she might have dreamed the rest,--for she\nhad been a girl much given to visions,--but she said to herself that she\nnever could have dreamed old age. And then with a smile she mused, and\nthought that it must be the voice that was a dream; for how could she\nget up without Jervis, who had never appeared yet to draw the curtains or\nmake the fire? Jervis perhaps had sat up late. She remembered now to have\nseen her that time in the middle of the night by her bedside; so that it\nwas natural enough, poor thing, that she should be late. Get up! who was\nit that was calling to her so? She had not been so called to, she who had\nalways been a great lady, since she was a girl by her mother's side.\n\"Mary, Mary!\" It was a very curious dream. And what was more curious\nstill was, that by-and-by she could not keep still any longer, but got up\nwithout thinking any more of Jervis, and going out of her room came all\nat once into the midst of a company of people, all very busy; whom she\nwas much surprised to find, at first, but whom she soon accustomed\nherself to, finding the greatest interest in their proceedings, and\ncurious to know what they were doing. They, for their part, did not seem\nat all surprised by her appearance, nor did any one stop to explain, as\nwould have been natural; but she took this with great composure, somewhat\nastonished, perhaps, being used, wherever she went, to a great many\nobservances and much respect, but soon, very soon, becoming used to it.\nThen some one repeated what she had heard before. \"It is time you got\nup,--for there is a great deal to do.\"\n\n\"To do,\" she said, \"for me?\" and then she looked round upon them with\nthat charming smile which had subjugated so many. \"I am afraid,\" she\nsaid, \"you will find me of very little use. I am too old now, if ever I\ncould have done much, for work.\"\n\n\"Oh no, you are not old,--you will do very well,\" some one said.\n\n\"Not old!\"--Lady Mary felt a little offended in spite of herself.\n\"Perhaps I like flattery as well as my neighbors,\" she said with dignity,\n\"but then it must be reasonable. To say I am anything but a very old\nwoman--\"\n\nHere she paused a little, perceiving for the first time, with surprise,\nthat she was standing and walking without her stick or the help of any\none's arm, quite freely and at her ease, and that the place in which she\nwas had expanded into a great place like a gallery in a palace, instead\nof the room next her own into which she had walked a few minutes ago; but\nthis discovery did not at all affect her mind, or occupy her except with\nthe most passing momentary surprise.\n\n\"The fact is, I feel a great deal better and stronger,\" she said.\n\n\"Quite well, Mary, and stronger than ever you were before?\"\n\n\"Who is it that calls me Mary? I have had nobody for a long time to call\nme Mary; the friends of my youth are all dead. I think that you must be\nright, although the doctor, I feel sure, thought me very bad last night.\nI should have got alarmed if I had not fallen asleep again.\"\n\n\"And then woke up well?\"\n\n\"Quite well: it is wonderful, but quite true. You seem to know a great\ndeal about me.\"\n\n\"I know everything about you. You have had a very pleasant life, and do\nyou think you have made the best of it? Your old age has been very\npleasant.\"\n\n\"Ah! you acknowledge that I am old, then?\" cried Lady Mary with a smile.\n\n\"You are old no longer, and you are a great lady no longer. Don't you see\nthat something has happened to you? It is seldom that such a great change\nhappens without being found out.\"\n\n\"Yes; it is true I have got better all at once. I feel an extraordinary\nrenewal of strength. I seem to have left home without knowing it; none of\nmy people seem near me. I feel very much as if I had just awakened from a\nlong dream. Is it possible,\" she said, with a wondering look, \"that I\nhave dreamed all my life, and after all am just a girl at home?\" The idea\nwas ludicrous, and she laughed. \"You see I am very much improved indeed,\"\nshe said.\n\nShe was still so far from perceiving the real situation, that some one\ncame towards her out of the group of people about--some one whom she\nrecognized--with the evident intention of explaining to her how it was.\nShe started a little at the sight of him, and held out her hand, and\ncried: \"You here! I am very glad to see you--doubly glad, since I was\ntold a few days ago that you had--died.\"\n\nThere was something in this word as she herself pronounced it that\ntroubled her a little. She had never been one of those who are afraid of\ndeath. On the contrary, she had always taken a great interest in it, and\nliked to hear everything that could be told her on the subject. It gave\nher now, however, a curious little thrill of sensation, which she did not\nunderstand: she hoped it was not superstition.\n\n\"You have guessed rightly,\" he said, \"quite right. That is one of the\nwords with a false meaning, which is to us a mere symbol of something we\ncannot understand. But you see what it means now.\"\n\nIt was a great shock, it need not be concealed. Otherwise, she had been\nquite pleasantly occupied with the interest of something new, into which\nshe had walked so easily out of her own bedchamber, without any trouble,\nand with the delightful new sensation of health and strength. But when it\nflashed upon her that she was not to go back to her bedroom again, nor\nhave any of those cares and attentions which had seemed necessary to\nexistence, she was very much startled and shaken. Died? Was it possible\nthat she personally had died? She had known it was a thing that happened\nto everybody; but yet--And it was a solemn matter, to be prepared for,\nand looked forward to, whereas--\"If you mean that I too--\" she said,\nfaltering a little; and then she added, \"it is very surprising,\" with a\ntrouble in her mind which yet was not all trouble. \"If that is so, it is\na thing well over. And it is very wonderful how much disturbance people\ngive themselves about it--if this is all.\"\n\n\"This is not all, however,\" her friend said; \"you have an ordeal before\nyou which you will not find pleasant. You are going to think about your\nlife, and all that was imperfect in it, and which might have been done\nbetter.\"\n\n\"We are none of us perfect,\" said Lady Mary, with a little of that\nnatural resentment with which one hears one's self accused,--however\nready one may be to accuse one's self.\n\n\"Permit me,\" said he, and took her hand and led her away without further\nexplanation. The people about were so busy with their own occupations\nthat they took very little notice; neither did she pay much attention to\nthe manner in which they were engaged. Their looks were friendly when\nthey met her eye, and she too felt friendly, with a sense of brotherhood.\nBut she had always been a kind woman. She wanted to step aside and help,\non more than one occasion, when it seemed to her that some people in her\nway had a task above their powers; but this her conductor would not\npermit. And she endeavored to put some questions to him as they went\nalong, with still less success.\n\n\"The change is very confusing,\" she said; \"one has no standard to judge\nby. I should like to know something about--the kind of people--and\nthe--manner of life.\"\n\n\"For a time,\" he said, \"you will have enough to do, without troubling\nyourself about that.\"\n\nThis naturally produced an uneasy sensation in her mind. \"I suppose,\" she\nsaid, rather timidly, \"that we are not in--what we have been accustomed\nto call heaven?\"\n\n\"That is a word,\" he said, \"which expresses rather a condition than a\nplace.\"\n\n\"But there must be a place--in which that condition can exist.\" She had\nalways been fond of discussions of this kind, and felt encouraged to find\nthat they were still practicable. \"It cannot be the--Inferno; that is\nclear, at least,\" she added, with the sprightliness which was one of her\ncharacteristics; \"perhaps--Purgatory? since you infer I have something to\nendure.\"\n\n\"Words are interchangeable,\" he said: \"that means one thing to one of us\nwhich to another has a totally different signification.\" There was\nsomething so like his old self in this, that she laughed with an\nirresistible sense of amusement.\n\n\"You were always fond of the oracular,\" she said. She was conscious that\non former occasions, if he made such a speech to her, though she would\nhave felt the same amusement, she would not have expressed it so frankly.\nBut he did not take it at all amiss. And her thoughts went on in other\ndirections. She felt herself saying over to herself the words of the old\nnorth-country dirge, which came to her recollection she knew not how--\n\nIf hosen and shoon thou gavest nane,\nThe whins shall prick thee intil the bane.\n\nWhen she saw that her companion heard her, she asked, \"Is that true?\"\n\nHe shook his head a little. \"It is too matter of fact,\" he said, \"as I\nneed hardly tell you. Hosen and shoon are good, but they do not always\nsufficiently indicate the state of the heart.\"\n\nLady Mary had a consciousness, which was pleasant to her, that so far as\nthe hosen and shoon went, she had abundant means of preparing herself for\nthe pricks of any road, however rough; but she had no time to indulge\nthis pleasing reflection, for she was shortly introduced into a great\nbuilding, full of innumerable rooms, in one of which her companion left\nher.\n\n\n\n\nIV.\n\n\nThe door opened, and she felt herself free to come out. How long she had\nbeen there, or what passed there, is not for any one to say. She came out\ntingling and smarting--if such words can be used--with an intolerable\nrecollection of the last act of her life. So intolerable was it that all\nthat had gone before, and all the risings up of old errors and visions\nlong dead, were forgotten in the sharp and keen prick of this, which was\nnot over and done like the rest. No one had accused her, or brought\nbefore her judge the things that were against her. She it was who had\ndone it all,--she, whose memory did not spare her one fault, who\nremembered everything. But when she came to that last frivolity of her\nold age, and saw for the first time how she had played with the future\nof the child whom she had brought up, and abandoned to the hardest\nfate,--for nothing, for folly, for a jest,--the horror and bitterness of\nthe thought filled her mind to overflowing. In the first anguish of that\nrecollection she had to go forth, receiving no word of comfort in respect\nto it, meeting only with a look of sadness and compassion, which went to\nher very heart. She came forth as if she had been driven away, but not by\nany outward influence, by the force of her own miserable sensations. \"I\nwill write,\" she said to herself, \"and tell them; I will go--\" And then\nshe stopped short, remembering that she could neither go nor write,--that\nall communication with the world she had left was closed. Was it all\nclosed? Was there no way in which a message could reach those who\nremained behind? She caught the first passer-by whom she passed, and\naddressed him piteously. \"Oh, tell me,--you have been longer here than\nI,--cannot one send a letter, a message, if it were only a single word?\"\n\n\"Where?\" he said, stopping and listening; so that it began to seem\npossible to her that some such expedient might still be within her reach.\n\n\"It is to England,\" she said, thinking he meant to ask as to which\nquarter of the world.\n\n\"Ah,\" he said, shaking his head, \"I fear that it is impossible.\"\n\n\"But it is to set something right, which out of mere inadvertence, with\nno ill meaning,\"--No, no (she repeated to herself), no ill-meaning--none!\n\"Oh sir, for charity! tell me how I can find a way. There must--there\nmust be some way.\"\n\nHe was greatly moved by the sight of her distress. \"I am but a stranger\nhere,\" he said; \"I may be wrong. There are others who can tell you\nbetter; but\"--and he shook his head sadly--\"most of us would be so\nthankful, if we could, to send a word, if it were only a single word, to\nthose we have left behind, that I fear, I fear--\"\n\n\"Ah!\" cried Lady Mary, \"but that would be only for the tenderness;\nwhereas this is for justice and for pity, and to do away with a great\nwrong which I did before I came here.\"\n\n\"I am very sorry for you,\" he said; but shook his head once more as he\nwent away. She was more careful next time, and chose one who had the look\nof much experience and knowledge of the place. He listened to her very\ngravely, and answered yes, that he was one of the officers, and could\ntell her whatever she wanted to know; but when she told him what she\nwanted, he too shook his head. \"I do not say it cannot be done,\" he said.\n\"There are some cases in which it has been successful, but very few. It\nhas often been attempted. There is no law against it. Those who do it do\nit at their own risk. They suffer much, and almost always they fail.\"\n\n\"No, oh no! You said there were some who succeeded. No one can be more\nanxious than I. I will give--anything--everything I have in the world!\"\n\nHe gave her a smile, which was very grave nevertheless, and full of pity.\n\"You forget,\" he said, \"that you have nothing to give; and if you had,\nthat there is no one here to whom it would be of any value.\"\n\nThough she was no longer old and weak, yet she was still a woman, and she\nbegan to weep, in the terrible failure and contrariety of all things; but\nyet she would not yield. She cried: \"There must be some one here who\nwould do it for love. I have had people who loved me in my time. I must\nhave some here who have not forgotten me. Ah! I know what you would say.\nI lived so long I forgot them all, and why should they remember me?\"\n\nHere she was touched on the arm, and looking round, saw close to her the\nface of one whom, it was very true, she had forgotten. She remembered him\nbut dimly after she had looked long at him. A little group had gathered\nabout her, with grieved looks, to see her distress. He who had touched\nher was the spokesman of them all.\n\n\"There is nothing I would not do,\" he said, \"for you and for love.\"\nAnd then they all sighed, surrounding her, and added, \"But it is\nimpossible--impossible!\"\n\nShe stood and gazed at them, recognizing by degrees faces that she knew,\nand seeing in all that look of grief and sympathy which makes all human\nsouls brothers. Impossible was not a word that had been often said to be\nin her life; and to come out of a world in which everything could be\nchanged, everything communicated in the twinkling of an eye, and find a\ndead blank before her and around her, through which not a word could go,\nwas more terrible than can be said in words. She looked piteously upon\nthem, with that anguish of helplessness which goes to every heart, and\ncried, \"What is impossible? To send a word--only a word--to set right\nwhat is wrong? Oh, I understand,\" she said, lifting up her hands. \"I\nunderstand that to send messages of comfort must not be; that the people\nwho love you must bear it, as we all have done in our time, and trust\nto God for consolation. But I have done a wrong! Oh, listen, listen to\nme, my friends. I have left a child, a young creature, unprovided\nfor--without any one to help her. And must that be? Must she bear it, and\nI bear it, forever, and no means, no way of setting it right? Listen to\nme! I was there last night,--in the middle of the night I was still\nthere,--and here this morning. So it must be easy to come--only a short\nway; and two words would be enough,--only two words!\"\n\nThey gathered closer and closer round her, full of compassion. \"It is\neasy to come,\" they said, \"but not to go.\"\n\nAnd one added, \"It will not be forever; comfort yourself. When she comes\nhere, or to a better place, that will seem to you only as a day.\n\n\"But to her,\" cried Lady Mary,--\"to her it will be long years--it will be\ntrouble and sorrow; and she will think I took no thought for her; and she\nwill be right,\" the penitent said with a great and bitter cry.\n\nIt was so terrible that they were all silent, and said not a\nword,--except the man who had loved her, who put his hand upon her arm,\nand said, \"We are here for that; this is the fire that purges us,--to see\nat last what we have done, and the true aspect of it, and to know the\ncruel wrong, yet never be able to make amends.\"\n\nShe remembered then that this was a man who had neglected all lawful\naffections, and broken the hearts of those who trusted him for her sake;\nand for a moment she forgot her own burden in sorrow for his.\n\nIt was now that he who had called himself one of the officers came\nforward again; for the little crowd had gathered round her so closely\nthat he had been shut out. He said, \"No one can carry your message for\nyou; that is not permitted. But there is still a possibility. You\nmay have permission to go yourself. Such things have been done, though\nthey have not often been successful. But if you will--\"\n\nShe shivered when she heard him; and it became apparent to her why no one\ncould be found to go,--for all her nature revolted from that step, which\nit was evident must be the most terrible which could be thought of. She\nlooked at him with troubled, beseeching eyes, and the rest all looked at\nher, pitying and trying to soothe her.\n\n\"Permission will not be refused,\" he said, \"for a worthy cause.\"\n\nUpon which the others all spoke together, entreating her. \"Already,\" they\ncried, \"they have forgotten you living. You are to them one who is dead.\nThey will be afraid of you if they can see you. Oh, go not back! Be\ncontent to wait,--to wait; it is only a little while. The life of man is\nnothing; it appears for a little time, and then it vanishes away. And\nwhen she comes here she will know,--or in a better place.\" They sighed as\nthey named the better place; though some smiled too, feeling perhaps\nmore near to it.\n\nLady Mary listened to them all, but she kept her eyes upon the face of\nhim who offered her this possibility. There passed through her mind a\nhundred stories she had heard of those who had _gone back_. But not one\nthat spoke of them as welcome, as received with joy, as comforting those\nthey loved. Ah no! was it not rather a curse upon the house to which they\ncame? The rooms were shut up, the houses abandoned, where they were\nsupposed to appear. Those whom they had loved best feared and fled them.\nThey were a vulgar wonder,--a thing that the poorest laughed at, yet\nfeared. Poor, banished souls! it was because no one would listen to them\nthat they had to linger and wait, and come and go. She shivered, and in\nspite of her longing and her repentance, a cold dread and horror took\npossession of her. She looked round upon her companions for comfort, and\nfound none.\n\n\"Do not go,\" they said; \"do not go. We have endured like you. We wait\ntill all things are made clear.\"\n\nAnd another said, \"All will be made clear. It is but for a time.\"\n\nShe turned from one to another, and back again to the first speaker,--he\nwho had authority.\n\nHe said, \"It is very rarely successful; it <DW44>s the course of your\npenitence. It is an indulgence, and it may bring harm and not good but if\nthe meaning is generous and just, permission will be given, and you may\ngo.\"\n\nThen all the strength of her nature rose in her. She thought of the child\nforsaken, and of the dark world round her, where she would find so few\nfriends; and of the home shut up in which she had lived her young and\npleasant life; and of the thoughts that must rise in her heart, as though\nshe were forsaken and abandoned of God and man. Then Lady Mary turned to\nthe man who had authority. She said, \"If he whom I saw to-day will give\nme his blessing, I will go--\" and they all pressed round her, weeping and\nkissing her hands.\n\n\"He will not refuse his blessing,\" they said; \"but the way is terrible,\nand you are still weak. How can you encounter all the misery of it? He\ncommands no one to try that dark and dreadful way.\"\n\n\"I will try,\" Lady Mary said.\n\n\n\n\nV.\n\n\nThe night which Lady Mary had been conscious of, in a momentary glimpse\nfull of the exaggeration of fever, had not indeed been so expeditious\nas she believed. The doctor, it is true, had been pronouncing her\ndeath-warrant when she saw him holding her wrist, and wondered what he\ndid there in the middle of the night; but she had been very ill before\nthis, and the conclusion of her life had been watched with many tears.\nThen there had risen up a wonderful commotion in the house, of which\nlittle Mary, her godchild, was very little sensible. Had she left any\nwill, any instructions, the slightest indication of what she wished to be\ndone after her death? Mr. Furnival, who had been very anxious to be\nallowed to see her, even in the last days of her illness, said\nemphatically, no. She had never executed any will, never made any\ndisposition of her affairs, he said, almost with bitterness, in the\ntone of one who is ready to weep with vexation and distress. The vicar\ntook a more hopeful view. He said it was impossible that so considerate\na person could have done this, and that there must, he was sure, be\nfound somewhere, if close examination was made, a memorandum, a\nletter,--something which should show what she wished; for she must have\nknown very well, notwithstanding all flatteries and compliments upon her\ngood looks, that from day to day her existence was never to be calculated\nupon. The doctor did not share this last opinion. He said that there was\nno fathoming the extraordinary views that people took of their own case;\nand that it was quite possible, though it seemed incredible, that Lady\nMary might really be as little expectant of death, on the way to\nninety, as a girl of seventeen; but still he was of opinion that she\nmight have left a memorandum somewhere.\n\nThese three gentlemen were in the foreground of affairs; because she had\nno relations to step in and take the management. The earl, her grandson,\nwas abroad, and there were only his solicitors to interfere on his\nbehalf, men to whom Lady Mary's fortune was quite unimportant, although\nit was against their principles to let anything slip out of their hands\nthat could aggrandize their client; but who knew nothing about the\ncircumstances,--about little Mary, about the old lady's peculiarities, in\nany way. Therefore the persons who had surrounded her in her life, and\nMr. Furnival, her man of business, were the persons who really had the\nmanagement of everything. Their wives interfered a little too, or rather\nthe one wife who only could do so,--the wife of the vicar, who came in\nbeneficently at once, and took poor little Mary, in her first desolation,\nout of the melancholy house. Mrs. Vicar did this without any hesitation,\nknowing very well that, in all probability, Lady Mary had made no will,\nand consequently that the poor girl was destitute. A great deal is said\nabout the hardness of the world, and the small consideration that is\nshown for a destitute dependent in such circumstances. But this is not\ntrue; and, as a matter of fact, there is never, or very rarely, such\nprofound need in the world, without a great deal of kindness and much\npity. The three gentlemen all along had been entirely in Mary's interest.\nThey had not expected legacies from the old lady, or any advantage to\nthemselves. It was of the girl that they had thought. And when now they\nexamined everything and inquired into all her ways and what she had done,\nit was of Mary they were thinking. But Mr. Furnival was very certain of\nhis point. He knew that Lady Mary had made no will; time after time he\nhad pressed it upon her. He was very sure, even while he examined her\nwriting-table, and turned out all the drawers, that nothing would be\nfound. The little Italian cabinet had _chiffons_ in its drawers,\nfragments of old lace, pieces of ribbon, little nothings of all sorts.\nNobody thought of the secret drawer; and if they had thought of it, where\ncould a place have been found less likely? If she had ever made a will,\nshe could have had no reason for concealing it. To be sure, they did\nnot reason in this way, being simply unaware of any place of concealment\nat all. And Mary knew nothing about this search they were making. She did\nnot know how she was herself \"left.\" When the first misery of grief was\nexhausted, she began, indeed, to have troubled thoughts in her own\nmind,--to expect that the vicar would speak to her, or Mr. Furnival send\nfor her, and tell her what she was to do. But nothing was said to her.\nThe vicar's wife had asked her to come for a long visit; and the anxious\npeople, who were forever talking over this subject and consulting what\nwas best for her, had come to no decision as yet, as to what must be said\nto the person chiefly concerned. It was too heart-rending to have to put\nthe real state of affairs before her.\n\nThe doctor had no wife; but he had an anxious mother, who, though she\nwould not for the world have been unkind to the poor girl, yet was very\nanxious that she should be disposed of and out of her son's way. It is\ntrue that the doctor was forty and Mary only eighteen,--but what then?\nMatches of that kind were seen every day; and his heart was so soft to\nthe child that his mother never knew from one day to another what might\nhappen. She had naturally no doubt at all that Mary would seize the first\nhand held out to her; and as time went on, held many an anxious\nconsultation with the vicar's wife on the subject. \"You cannot have her\nwith you forever,\" she said. \"She must know one time or another how she\nis left, and that she must learn to do something for herself.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said the vicar's wife, \"how is she to be told? It is heart-rending\nto look at her and to think,--nothing but luxury all her life, and now,\nin a moment, destitution. I am very glad to have her with me: she is a\ndear little thing, and so nice with the children. And if some good\nman would only step in--\"\n\nThe doctor's mother trembled; for that a good man should step in was\nexactly what she feared. \"That is a thing that can never be depended\nupon,\" she said; \"and marriages made out of compassion are just as bad as\nmercenary marriages. Oh no, my dear Mrs. Bowyer, Mary has a great deal of\ncharacter. You should put more confidence in her than that. No doubt she\nwill be much cast down at first, but when she knows, she will rise to the\noccasion and show what is in her.\"\n\n\"Poor little thing! what is in a girl of eighteen, and one that has lain\non the roses and fed on the lilies all her life? Oh, I could find it in\nmy heart to say a great deal about old Lady Mary that would not be\npleasant! Why did she bring her up so if she did not mean to provide for\nher? I think she must have been at heart a wicked old woman.\"\n\n\"Oh no! we must not say that. I dare say, as my son says, she always\nmeant to do it sometime-\"\n\n\"Sometime! how long did she expect to live, I wonder?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the doctor's mother, \"it is wonderful how little old one\nfeels sometimes within one's self, even when one is well up in years.\"\nShe was of the faction of the old, instead of being like Mrs. Bowyer, who\nwas not much over thirty, of the faction of the young. She could make\nexcuses for Lady Mary; but she thought that it was unkind to bring the\npoor little girl here in ignorance of her real position, and in the way\nof men who, though old enough to know better, were still capable of\nfolly,--as what man is not, when a girl of eighteen is concerned? \"I\nhope,\" she added, \"that the earl will do something for her. Certainly he\nought to, when he knows all that his grandmother did, and what her\nintentions must have been. He ought to make her a little allowance; that\nis the least he can do,--not, to be sure, such a provision as we all\nhoped Lady Mary was going to make for her, but enough to live upon. Mr.\nFurnival, I believe, has written to him to that effect.\"\n\n\"Hush!\" cried the vicar's wife; indeed she had been making signs to the\nother lady, who stood with her back to the door, for some moments. Mary\nhad come in while this conversation was going on. She had not paid any\nattention to it; and yet her ear had been caught by the names of Lady\nMary, and the earl, and Mr. Furnival. For whom was it that the earl\nshould make an allowance enough to live upon? whom Lady Mary had not\nprovided for, and whom Mr. Furnival had written about? When she sat down\nto the needle-work in which she was helping Mrs. Vicar, it was not to be\nsupposed that she should not ponder these words,--for some time very\nvaguely, not perceiving the meaning of them; and then with a start she\nwoke up to perceive that there must be something meant, some one,--even\nsome one she knew. And then the needle dropped out of the girl's hand,\nand the pinafore she was making fell on the floor. Some one! it must be\nherself they meant! Who but she could be the subject of that earnest\nconversation? She began to remember a great many conversations as\nearnest, which had been stopped when she came into the room, and the\nlooks of pity which had been bent upon her. She had thought in her\ninnocence that this was because she had lost her godmother, her\nprotectress,--and had been very grateful for the kindness of her friends.\nBut now another meaning came into everything. Mrs. Bowyer had accompanied\nher visitor to the door, still talking, and when she returned her face\nwas very grave. But she smiled when she met Mary's look, and said\ncheerfully,--\n\n\"How kind of you, my dear, to make all those pinafores for me! The little\nones will not know themselves. They never were so fine before.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mrs. Bowyer,\" cried the girl, \"I have guessed something! and I want\nyou to tell me! Are you keeping me for charity, and is it I that am\nleft--without any provision, and that Mr. Furnival has written--\"\n\nShe could not finish her sentence, for it was very bitter to her, as may\nbe supposed.\n\n\"I don't know what you mean, my dear,\" cried the vicar's wife.\n\"Charity,--well, I suppose that is the same as love,--at least it is so in\nthe 13th chapter of 1st Corinthians. You are staying with us, I hope, for\nlove, if that is what you mean.\"\n\nUpon which she took the girl in her arms and kissed her, and cried, as\nwomen must. \"My dearest,\" she said, \"as you have guessed the worst, it is\nbetter to tell you. Lady Mary--I don't know why; oh, I don't wish to\nblame her--has left no will; and, my dear, my dear, you who have been\nbrought up in luxury, you have not a penny.\" Here the vicar's wife gave\nMary a closer hug, and kissed her once more. \"We love you all the\nbetter,--if that was possible,\" she said.\n\nHow many thoughts will fly through a girl's mind while her head rests on\nsome kind shoulder, and she is being consoled for the first calamity that\nhas touched her life! She was neither ungrateful nor unresponsive; but\nas Mrs. Bowyer pressed her close to her kind breast and cried over her,\nMary did not cry, but thought,--seeing in a moment a succession of\nscenes, and realizing in a moment so complete a new world, that all her\npain was quelled by the hurry and rush in her brain as her forces rallied\nto sustain her. She withdrew from her kind support after a moment, with\neyes tearless and shining, the color mounting to her face, and not a sign\nof discouragement in her, nor yet of sentiment, though she grasped her\nkind friend's hands with a pressure which her innocent small fingers\nseemed incapable of giving. \"One has read of such things--in books,\" she\nsaid, with a faint courageous smile; \"and I suppose they happen,--in\nlife.\"\n\n\"Oh, my dear, too often in life. Though how people can be so cruel, so\nindifferent, so careless of the happiness of those they love--\"\n\nHere Mary pressed her friend's hands till they hurt, and cried, \"Not\ncruel, not indifferent. I cannot hear a word--\"\n\n\"Well, dear, it is like you to feel so,--I knew you would; and I will not\nsay a word. Oh, Mary, if she ever thinks of such things now--\"\n\n\"I hope she will not--I hope she cannot!\" cried the girl, with once more\na vehement pressure of her friend's hands.\n\n\"What is that?\" Mrs. Bowyer said, looking round. \"It is somebody in the\nnext room, I suppose. No, dear, I hope so too, for she would not be happy\nif she remembered. Mary, dry your eyes, my dear. Try not to think of\nthis. I am sure there is some one in the next room. And you must try not\nto look wretched, for all our sakes--\"\n\n\"Wretched!\" cried Mary, springing up. \"I am not wretched.\" And she turned\nwith a countenance glowing and full of courage to the door. But there was\nno one there,--no visitor lingering in the smaller room as sometimes\nhappened.\n\n\"I thought I heard some one come in,\" said the vicar's wife. \"Didn't you\nhear something, Mary? I suppose it is because I am so agitated with all\nthis, but I could have sworn I heard some one come in.\"\n\n\"There is nobody,\" said Mary, who, in the shock of the calamity which had\nso suddenly changed the world to her, was perfectly calm. She did not\nfeel at all disposed to cry or \"give way.\" It went to her head with a\nthrill of pain, which was excitement as well, like a strong stimulant\nsuddenly applied; and she added, \"I should like to go out a little, if\nyou don't mind, just to get used to the idea.\"\n\n\"My dear, I will get my hat in a moment--\"\n\n\"No, please. It is not unkindness; but I must think it over by\nmyself,--by myself,\" Mary cried. She hurried away, while Mrs. Bowyer took\nanother survey of the outer room, and called the servant to know who had\nbeen calling. Nobody had been calling, the maid said; but her mistress\nstill shook her head.\n\n\"It must have been some one who does not ring, who just opens the door,\"\nshe said to herself. \"That is the worst of the country. It might be Mrs.\nBlunt, or Sophia Blackburn, or the curate, or half-a-dozen people,--and\nthey have just gone away when they heard me crying. How could I help\ncrying? But I wonder how much they heard, whoever it was.\"\n\n\n\n\nVI.\n\n\nIt was winter, and snow was on the ground.\n\nLady Mary found herself on the road that led through her own village,\ngoing home. It was like a picture of a wintry night,--like one of those\npictures that please the children at Christmas. A little snow sprinkled\non the roofs, just enough to define them, and on the edges of the roads;\nevery cottage window showing a ruddy glimmer in the twilight; the men\ncoming home from their work; the children, tied up in comforters and\ncaps, stealing in from the slides, and from the pond, where they were\nforbidden to go; and, in the distance, the trees of the great House\nstanding up dark, turning the twilight into night. She had a curious\nenjoyment in it, simple like that of a child, and a wish to talk to some\none out of the fullness of her heart. She overtook, her step being far\nlighter than his, one of the men going home from his work, and spoke to\nhim, telling him with a smile not to be afraid; but he never so much as\nraised his head, and went plodding on with his heavy step, not knowing\nthat she had spoken to him. She was startled by this; but said to\nherself, that the men were dull, that their perceptions were confused,\nand that it was getting dark; and went on, passing him quickly. His\nbreath made a cloud in the air as he walked, and his heavy plodding steps\nsounded into the frosty night. She perceived that her own were invisible\nand inaudible, with a curious momentary sensation, half of pleasure, half\nof pain. She felt no cold, and she saw through the twilight as clearly as\nif it had been day. There was no fatigue or sense of weakness in her; but\nshe had the strange, wistful feeling of an exile returning after long\nyears, not knowing how he may find those he had left. At one of the first\nhouses in the village there was a woman standing at her door, looking out\nfor her children; one who knew Lady Mary well. She stopped quite\ncheerfully to bid her good evening, as she had done in her vigorous days,\nbefore she grew old. It was a little experiment, too. She thought it\npossible that Catherine would scream out, and perhaps fly from her; but\nsurely would be easily reassured when she heard the voice she knew, and\nsaw by her one who was no ghost, but her own kind mistress. But Catherine\ntook no notice when she spoke; she did not so much as turn her head. Lady\nMary stood by her patiently, with more and more of that wistful desire to\nbe recognized. She put her hand timidly upon the woman's arm, who was\nthinking of nothing but her boys, and calling to them, straining her eyes\nin the fading light. \"Don't be afraid, they are coming, they are safe,\"\nshe said, pressing Catherine's arm. But the woman never moved. She took\nno notice. She called to a neighbor who was passing, to ask if she had\nseen the children, and the two stood and talked in the dim air, not\nconscious of the third who stood between them, looking from one to\nanother, astonished, paralyzed. Lady Mary had not been prepared for this;\nshe could not believe it even now. She repeated their names more and more\nanxiously, and even plucked at their sleeves to call their attention. She\nstood as a poor dependent sometimes stands, wistful, civil, trying to say\nsomething that will please, while they talked and took no notice; and\nthen the neighbor passed on, and Catherine went into her house. It is\nhard to be left out in the cold when others go into their cheerful\nhouses; but to be thus left outside of life, to speak and not be heard,\nto stand unseen, astounded, unable to secure any attention! She had\nthought they would be frightened, but it was not they who were\nfrightened. A great panic seized the woman who was no more of this world.\nShe had almost rejoiced to find herself back walking so lightly, so\nstrongly, finding everything easy that had been so hard; and yet but a\nfew minutes had passed, and she knew never more to be deceived, that she\nwas no longer of this world. What if she should be condemned to wander\nforever among familiar places that knew her no more, appealing for a\nlook, a word, to those who could no longer see her, or hear her cry, or\nknow of her presence? Terror seized upon her, a chill and pang of fear\nbeyond description. She felt an impulse to fly wildly into the dark,\ninto the night, like a lost creature; to find again somehow, she could\nnot tell how, the door out of which she had come, and beat upon it wildly\nwith her hands, and implore to be taken home. For a moment she stood\nlooking round her, lost and alone in the wide universe; no one to speak\nto her, no one to comfort her; outside of life altogether. Other rustic\nfigures, slow-stepping, leisurely, at their ease, went and came, one at a\ntime; but in this place, where every stranger was an object of curiosity,\nno one cast a glance at her. She was as if she had never been.\n\nPresently she found herself entering her own house. It was all shut and\nsilent,--not a window lighted along the whole front of the house which\nused to twinkle and glitter with lights. It soothed her somewhat to see\nthis, as if in evidence that the place had changed with her. She went in\nsilently, and the darkness was as day to her. Her own rooms were all shut\nup, yet were open to her steps, which no external obstacle could limit.\nThere was still the sound of life below stairs, and in the housekeeper's\nroom a cheerful party gathered round the fire. It was then that she\nturned first, with some wistful human attraction, towards the warmth and\nlight rather than to the still places in which her own life had been\npassed. Mrs. Prentiss, the housekeeper, had her daughter with her on a\nvisit, and the daughter's baby lay asleep in a cradle placed upon two\nchairs, outside the little circle of women round the table, one of whom\nwas Jervis, Lady Mary's maid. Jervis sat and worked and cried, and mixed\nher words with little sobs. \"I never thought as I should have had to take\nanother place,\" she said. \"Brown and me, we made sure of a little\nsomething to start upon. He's been here for twenty years, and so have\nyou, Mrs. Prentiss; and me, as nobody can say I wasn't faithful night and\nday.\"\n\n\"I never had that confidence in my lady to expect anything,\" Prentiss\nsaid.\n\n\"Oh, mother, don't say that: many and many a day you've said, 'When my\nlady dies--'\"\n\n\"And we've all said it,\" said Jervis. \"I can't think how she did it, nor\nwhy she did it; for she was a kind lady, though appearances is against\nher.\"\n\n\"She was one of them, and I've known a many, as could not abide to see a\ngloomy face,\" said the housekeeper. \"She kept us all comfortable for the\nsake of being comfortable herself, but no more.\"\n\n\"Oh, you are hard upon my lady!\" cried Jervis, \"and I can't bear to hear\na word against her, though it's been an awful disappointment to me.\"\n\n\"What's you or me, or any one,\" cried Mrs. Prentiss, \"in comparison of\nthat poor little thing that can't work for her living like we can; that\nis left on the charity of folks she don't belong to? I'd have forgiven my\nlady anything, if she'd done what was right by Miss Mary. You'll get a\nplace, and a good place; and me, they'll leave me here when the new folks\ncome as have taken the house. But what will become of her, the darling?\nand not a penny, nor a friend, nor one to look to her? Oh, you selfish\nold woman! oh, you heart of stone! I just hope you are feeling it where\nyou're gone,\" the housekeeper cried.\n\nBut as she said this, the woman did not know who was looking at her with\nwide, wistful eyes, holding out her hands in appeal, receiving every word\nas if it had been a blow,--though she knew it was useless. Lady Mary\ncould not help it. She cried out to them, \"Have pity upon me! Have pity\nupon me! I am not cruel, as you think,\" with a keen anguish in her voice,\nwhich seemed to be sharp enough to pierce the very air and go up to the\nskies. And so, perhaps, it did; but never touched the human atmosphere in\nwhich she stood a stranger. Jervis was threading her needle when her\nmistress uttered that cry; but her hand did not tremble, nor did the\nthread deflect a hair's-breadth from the straight line. The young mother\nalone seemed to be moved by some faint disturbance. \"Hush!\" she said, \"is\nhe waking?\"--looking towards the cradle. But as the baby made no further\nsound, she too, returned to her sewing; and they sat bending their heads\nover their work round the table, and continued their talk. The room was\nvery comfortable, bright, and warm, as Lady Mary had liked all her rooms\nto be. The warm firelight danced upon the walls; the women talked in\ncheerful tones. She stood outside their circle, and looked at them with a\nwistful face. Their notice would have been more sweet to her, as she\nstood in that great humiliation, than in other times the look of a queen.\n\n\"But what is the matter with baby?\" the mother said, rising hastily.\n\nIt was with no servile intention of securing a look from that little\nprince of life that she who was not of this world had stepped aside\nforlorn, and looked at him in his cradle. Though she was not of this\nworld, she was still a woman, and had nursed her children in her arms.\nShe bent over the infant by the soft impulse of nature, tenderly, with no\ninterested thought. But the child saw her; was it possible? He turned his\nhead towards her, and flickered his baby hands, and cooed with that\nindescribable voice that goes to every woman's heart. Lady Mary felt such\na thrill of pleasure go through her, as no incident had given her for\nlong years. She put out her arms to him as his mother snatched him from\nhis little bed; and he, which was more wonderful, stretched towards her\nin his innocence, turning away from them all.\n\n\"He wants to go to some one,\" cried the mother. \"Oh look, look, for God's\nsake! Who is there that the child sees?\"\n\n\"There's no one there,--not a soul. Now dearie, dearie, be reasonable.\nYou can see for yourself there's not a creature,\" said the grandmother.\n\n\"Oh, my baby, my baby! He sees something we can't see,\" the young woman\ncried. \"Something has happened to his father, or he's going to be taken\nfrom me!\" she said, holding the child to her in a sudden passion. The\nother women rushed to her to console her,--the mother with reason, and\nJervis with poetry. \"It's the angels whispering, like the song says.\" Oh,\nthe pang that was in the heart of the other whom they could not hear! She\nstood wondering how it could be,--wondering with an amazement beyond\nwords, how all that was in her heart, the love and the pain, and the\nsweetness and bitterness, could all be hidden,--all hidden by that air in\nwhich the women stood so clear! She held out her hands, she spoke to\nthem, telling who she was, but no one paid any attention; only the little\ndog Fido, who had been basking by the fire, sprang up, looked at her, and\nretreating slowly backwards till he reached the wall, sat down there and\nlooked at her again, with now and then a little bark of inquiry. The dog\nsaw her. This gave her a curious pang of humiliation, yet pleasure. She\nwent away out of that little centre of human life in a great excitement\nand thrill of her whole being. The child had seen her, and the dog; but,\noh heavens! how was she to work out her purpose by such auxiliaries as\nthese?\n\nShe went up to her old bedchamber with unshed tears heavy about her eyes,\nand a pathetic smile quivering on her mouth. It touched her beyond\nmeasure that the child should have that confidence in her. \"Then God is\nstill with me,\" she said to herself. Her room, which had been so warm and\nbright, lay desolate in the stillness of the night; but she wanted no\nlight, for the darkness was no darkness to her. She looked round her for\na little, wondering to think how far away from her now was this scene of\nher old life, but feeling no pain in the sight of it,--only a kind\nindulgence for the foolish simplicity which had taken so much pride in\nall these infantile elements of living. She went to the little Italian\ncabinet which stood against the wall, feeling now at least that she could\ndo as she would,--that here there was no blank of human unconsciousness\nto stand in her way. But she was met by something that baffled and vexed\nher once more. She felt the polished surface of the wood under her hand,\nand saw all the pretty ornamentation, the inlaid-work, the delicate\ncarvings, which she knew so well; they swam in her eyes a little, as if\nthey were part of some phantasmagoria about her, existing only in her\nvision. Yet the smooth surface resisted her touch; and when she withdrew\na step from it, it stood before her solidly and square, as it had stood\nalways--a glory to the place. She put forth her hands upon it, and could\nhave traced the waving lines of the exquisite work, in which some artist\nsoul had worked itself out in the old times; but though she thus saw it\nand felt, she could not with all her endeavors find the handle of the\ndrawer, the richly-wrought knob of ivory, the little door that opened\ninto the secret place. How long she stood by it, attempting again and\nagain to find what was as familiar to her as her own hand, what was\nbefore her, visible in every line, what she felt with fingers which began\nto tremble, she could not tell. Time did not count with her as with\ncommon men. She did not grow weary, or require refreshment or rest, like\nthose who were still of this world. Put at length her head grew giddy and\nher heart failed. A cold despair took possession of her soul. She could\ndo nothing, then,--nothing; neither by help of man, neither by use of her\nown faculties, which were greater and clearer than ever before. She sank\ndown upon the floor at the foot of that old toy, which had pleased her in\nthe softness of her old age, to which she had trusted the fortunes of\nanother; by which, in wantonness and folly she had sinned, she had\nsinned! And she thought she saw standing round her companions in the land\nshe had left, saying, \"It is impossible, impossible!\" with infinite pity\nin their eyes; and the face of him who had given her permission to come,\nyet who had said no word to her to encourage her in what was against\nnature. And there came into her heart a longing to fly, to get home, to\nbe back in the land where her fellows were, and her appointed place. A\nchild lost, how pitiful that is! without power to reason and divine how\nhelp will come; but a soul lost, outside of one method of existence,\nwithdrawn from the other, knowing no way to retrace its steps, nor how\nhelp can come! There had been no bitterness in passing from earth to the\nland where she had gone; but now there came upon her soul, in all the\npower of her new faculties, the bitterness of death. The place which was\nhers she had forsaken and left, and the place that had been hers knew her\nno more.\n\n\n\n\nVII.\n\n\nMary, when she left her kind friend in the vicarage, went out and took a\nlong walk. She had received a shock so great that it took all sensation\nfrom her, and threw her into the seething and surging of an excitement\naltogether beyond her control. She could not think until she had got\nfamiliar with the idea, which indeed had been vaguely shaping itself in\nher mind ever since she had emerged from the first profound gloom and\nprostration of the shadow of death. She had never definitely thought of\nher position before,--never even asked herself what was to become of her\nwhen Lady Mary died. She did not see, any more than Lady Mary did, why\nshe should ever die; and girls, who have never wanted anything in their\nlives, who have had no sharp experience to enlighten them, are slow to\nthink upon such subjects. She had not expected anything; her mind had not\nformed any idea of inheritance; and it had not surprised her to hear of\nthe earl, who was Lady Mary's natural heir, nor to feel herself separated\nfrom the house in which all her previous life had been passed. But there\nhad been gradually dawning upon her a sense that she had come to a crisis\nin her life, and that she must soon be told what was to become of her. It\nwas not so urgent as that she should ask any questions; but it began to\nappear very clearly in her mind that things were not to be with her as\nthey had been. She had heard the complaints and astonishment of the\nservants, to whom Lady Mary had left nothing, with resentment,--Jervis,\nwho could not marry and take her lodging-house, but must wait until she\nhad saved more money, and wept to think, after all her devotion, of\nhaving to take another place; and Mrs. Prentiss, the housekeeper, who was\ncynical, and expounded Lady Mary's kindness to her servants to be the\nissue of a refined selfishness; and Brown, who had sworn subdued oaths,\nand had taken the liberty of representing himself to Mary as \"in the same\nbox\" with herself. Mary had been angry, very angry at all this; and she\nhad not by word or look given any one to understand that she felt herself\n\"in the same box.\" But yet she had been vaguely anxious, curious,\ndesiring to know. And she had not even begun to think what she should do.\nThat seemed a sort of affront to her godmother's memory, at all events,\nuntil some one had made it clear to her. But now, in a moment, with her\nfirst consciousness of the importance of this matter in the sight of\nothers, a consciousness of what it was to herself, came into her mind. A\nchange of everything,--a new life,--a new world; and not only so, but a\nseverance from the old world,--a giving up of everything that had been\nmost near and pleasant to her.\n\nThese thoughts were driven through her mind like the snowflakes in a\nstorm. The year had slid on since Lady Mary's death. Winter was beginning\nto yield to spring; the snow was over, and the great cold. And other\nchanges had taken place. The great house had been let, and the family who\nhad taken it had been about a week in possession. Their coming had\ninflicted a wound upon Mary's heart; but everybody had urged upon her the\nidea that it was much better the house should be let for a time, \"till\neverything was settled.\" When all was settled, things would be different.\nMrs. Vicar did not say, \"You can then do what you please,\" but she did\nconvey to Mary's mind somehow a sort of inference that she would have\nsomething to do it with. And when Mary had protested. \"It shall never be\nlet again with my will,\" the kind woman had said tremulously, \"Well, my\ndear!\" and had changed the subject. All these things now came to Mary's\nmind. They had been afraid to tell her; they had thought it would be so\nmuch to her,--so important, such a crushing blow. To have nothing,--to be\ndestitute; to be written about by Mr. Furnival to the earl; to have her\ncase represented,--Mary felt herself stung by such unendurable\nsuggestions into an energy--a determination--of which her soft young life\nhad known nothing. No one should write about her, or ask charity for her,\nshe said to herself. She had gone through the woods and round the park,\nwhich was not large, and now she could not leave these beloved precincts\nwithout going to look at the house. Up to this time she had not had the\ncourage to go near the house; but to the commotion and fever of her mind\nevery violent sensation was congenial, and she went up the avenue now\nalmost gladly, with a little demonstration to herself of energy and\ncourage. Why not that as well as all the rest?\n\nIt was once more twilight, and the dimness favored her design. She wanted\nto go there unseen, to look up at the windows with their alien lights,\nand to think of the time when Lady Mary sat behind the curtains, and\nthere was nothing but tenderness and peace throughout the house. There\nwas a light in every window along the entire front, a lavishness of\nfirelight and lamplight which told of a household in which there were\nmany inhabitants. Mary's mind was so deeply absorbed, and perhaps her\neyes so dim with tears that she could scarcely see what was before her,\nwhen the door opened suddenly and a lady came out. \"I will go myself,\"\nshe said in an agitated tone to some one behind her. \"Don't get yourself\nlaughed at,\" said a voice from within. The sound of the voices roused\nthe young spectator. She looked with a little curiosity, mixed with\nanxiety, at the lady who had come out of the house, and who started, too,\nwith a gesture of alarm, when she saw Mary move in the dark. \"Who are\nyou?\" she cried out in a trembling voice, \"and what do you want here?\"\n\nThen Mary made a step or two forward and said, \"I must ask your pardon if\nI am trespassing. I did not know there was any objection--\" This stranger\nto make an objection! It brought something like a tremulous laugh to\nMary's lips.\n\n\"Oh, there is no objection,\" said the lady, \"only we have been a little\nput out. I see now; you are the young lady who--you are the young lady\nthat--you are the one that--suffered most.\"\n\n\"I am Lady Mary's goddaughter,\" said the girl. \"I have lived here all my\nlife.\"\n\n\"Oh, my dear, I have heard all about you,\" the lady cried. The people who\nhad taken the house were merely rich people; they had no other\ncharacteristic; and in the vicarage, as well as in the other houses\nabout, it was said, when they were spoken of, that it was a good thing\nthey were not people to be visited, since nobody could have had the heart\nto visit strangers in Lady Mary's house. And Mary could not but feel a\nkeen resentment to think that her story, such as it was, the story which\nshe had only now heard in her own person, should be discussed by such\npeople. But the speaker had a look of kindness, and, so far as could be\nseen, of perplexity and fretted anxiety in her face, and had been in a\nhurry, but stopped herself in order to show her interest. \"I wonder,\" she\nsaid impulsively, \"that you can come here and look at the place again,\nafter all that has passed.\"\n\n\"I never thought,\" said Mary, \"that there could be--any objection.\"\n\n\"Oh, how can you think I mean that?--how can you pretend to think so?\"\ncried the other, impatiently. \"But after you have been treated so\nheartlessly, so unkindly,--and left, poor thing! they tell me, without a\npenny, without any provision--\"\n\n\"I don't know you,\" cried Mary, breathless with quick rising passion. \"I\ndon't know what right you can have to meddle with my affairs.\"\n\nThe lady stared at her for a moment without speaking, and then she said,\nall at once, \"That is quite true,--but it is rude as well; for though I\nhave no right to meddle with your affairs, I did it in kindness, because\nI took an interest in you from all I have heard.\"\n\nMary was very accessible to such a reproach and argument. Her face\nflushed with a sense of her own churlishness. \"I beg your pardon,\" she\nsaid; \"I am sure you mean to be kind.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the stranger, \"that is perhaps going too far on the other\nside, for you can't even see my face, to know what I mean. But I do mean\nto be kind, and I am very sorry for you. And though I think you've been\ntreated abominably, all the same I like you better for not allowing any\none to say so. And now, do you know where I was going? I was going to the\nvicarage,--where you are living, I believe,--to see if the vicar, or his\nwife, or you, or all of you together, could do a thing for me.\"\n\n\"Oh, I am sure Mrs. Bowyer--\" said Mary, with a voice much less assured\nthan her words.\n\n\"You must not be too sure, my dear. I know she doesn't mean to call upon\nme, because my husband is a city man. That is just as she pleases. I am\nnot very fond of city men myself. But there's no reason why I should\nstand on ceremony when I want something, is there? Now, my dear, I want\nto know--Don't laugh at me. I am not superstitious, so far as I am aware;\nbut--Tell me, in your time was there ever any disturbance, any appearance\nyou couldn't understand, any--Well, I don't like the word ghost. It's\ndisrespectful, if there's anything of the sort: and it's vulgar if there\nisn't. But you know what I mean. Was there anything--of that sort--in\nyour time?\"\n\nIn your time! Poor Mary had scarcely realized yet that her time was over.\nHer heart refused to allow it when it was thus so abruptly brought before\nher, but she obliged herself to subdue these rising rebellions, and to\nanswer, though with some _hauteur_, \"There is nothing of the kind that I\never heard of. There is no superstition or ghost in our house.\"\n\nShe thought it was the vulgar desire of new people to find a conventional\nmystery, and it seemed to Mary that this was a desecration of her home.\nMrs. Turner, however (for that was her name), did not receive the\nintimation as the girl expected, but looked at her very gravely, and\nsaid, \"That makes it a great deal more serious,\" as if to herself. She\npaused and then added, \"You see, the case is this. I have a little girl\nwho is our youngest, who is just my husband's idol. She is a sweet little\nthing, though perhaps I should not say it. Are you fond of children? Then\nI almost feel sure you would think so too. Not a moping child at all, or\ntoo clever, or anything to alarm one. Well, you know, little Connie,\nsince ever we came in, has seen an old lady walking about the house.\"\n\n\"An old lady!\" said Mary, with an involuntary smile.\n\n\"Oh, yes. I laughed too, the first time. I said it would be old Mrs.\nPrentiss, or perhaps the char-woman, or some old lady from the village\nthat had been in the habit of coming in the former people's time. But the\nchild got very angry. She said it was a real lady. She would not allow me\nto speak. Then we thought perhaps it was some one who did not know the\nhouse was let, and had walked in to look at it; but nobody would go on\ncoming like that with all the signs of a large family in the house. And\nnow the doctor says the child must be low, that the place perhaps doesn't\nagree with her, and that we must send her away. Now I ask you, how could\nI send little Connie away, the apple of her father's eye? I should have\nto go with her, of course, and how could the house get on without me?\nNaturally we are very anxious. And this afternoon she has seen her again,\nand sits there crying because she says the dear old lady looks so sad. I\njust seized my hat, and walked out, to come to you and your friends at\nthe vicarage, to see if you could help me. Mrs. Bowyer may look down upon\na city person,--I don't mind that; but she is a mother, and surely she\nwould feel for a mother,\" cried the poor lady vehemently, putting up her\nhands to her wet eyes.\n\n\"Oh, indeed, indeed she would! I am sure now that she will call\ndirectly. We did not know what a--\" Mary stopped herself in saying,\n\"what a nice woman you are,\" which she thought would be rude, though poor\nMrs. Turner would have liked it. But then she shook her head and added,\n\"What could any of us do to help you? I have never heard of any old lady.\nThere never was anything--I know all about the house, everything that has\never happened, and Prentiss will tell you. There is nothing of that\nkind,--indeed, there is nothing. You must have--\" But here Mary stopped\nagain; for to suggest that a new family, a city family, should have\nbrought an apparition of their own with them, was too ridiculous an idea\nto be entertained.\n\n\"Miss Vivian,\" said Mrs. Turner, \"will you come back with me and speak to\nthe child?\"\n\nAt this Mary faltered a little. \"I have never been there--since\nthe--funeral,\" she said.\n\nThe good woman laid a kind hand upon her shoulder, caressing and\nsoothing. \"You were very fond of her--in spite of the way she has used\nyou?\"\n\n\"Oh, how dare you, or any one, to speak of her so! She used me as if I\nhad been her dearest child. She was more kind to me than a mother. There\nis no one in the world like her!\" Mary cried.\n\n\"And yet she left you without a penny. Oh, you must be a good girl to\nfeel for her like that. She left you without--What are you going to do,\nmy dear? I feel like a friend. I feel like a mother to you, though you\ndon't know me. You mustn't think it is only curiosity. You can't stay\nwith your friends for ever,--and what are you going to do?\"\n\nThere are some cases in which it is more easy to speak to a stranger\nthan to one's dearest and oldest friend. Mary had felt this when she\nrushed out, not knowing how to tell the vicar's wife that she must leave\nher, and find some independence for herself. It was, however, strange to\nrush into such a discussion with so little warning, and Mary's pride was\nvery sensitive. She said, \"I am not going to burden my friends,\" with a\nlittle indignation; but then she remembered how forlorn she was, and her\nvoice softened. \"I must do something,--but I don't know what I am good\nfor,\" she said, trembling, and on the verge of tears.\n\n\"My dear, I have heard a great deal about you,\" said the stranger; \"it is\nnot rash, though it may look so. Come back with me directly, and see\nConnie. She is a very interesting little thing, though I say it; it is\nwonderful sometimes to hear her talk. You shall be her governess, my\ndear. Oh, you need not teach her anything,--that is not what I mean. I\nthink, I am sure, you will be the saving of her, Miss Vivian; and such a\nlady as you are, it will be everything for the other girls to live with\nyou. Don't stop to think, but just come with me. You shall have whatever\nyou please, and always be treated like a lady. Oh, my dear, consider my\nfeelings as a mother, and come; oh, come to Connie! I know you will save\nher; it is an inspiration. Come back! Come back with me!\"\n\nIt seemed to Mary too like an inspiration. What it cost her to cross that\nthreshold and walk in a stranger, to the house which had been all her\nlife as her own, she never said to any one. But it was independence; it\nwas deliverance from entreaties and remonstrances without end. It was a\nkind of setting right, so far as could be, of the balance which had got\nso terribly wrong. No writing to the earl now; no appeal to friends;\nanything in all the world,--much more, honest service and kindness,--must\nbe better than that.\n\n\n\n\nVIII.\n\n\n\"Tell the young lady all about it, Connie,\" said her mother.\n\nBut Connie was very reluctant to tell. She was very shy, and clung to her\nmother, and hid her face in her ample dress; and though presently she was\nbeguiled by Mary's voice, and in a short time came to her side, and clung\nto her as she had clung to Mrs. Turner, she still kept her secret to\nherself. They were all very kind to Mary, the elder girls standing round\nin a respectful circle looking at her, while their mother exhorted them\nto \"take a pattern\" by Miss Vivian. The novelty, the awe which she\ninspired, the real kindness about her, ended in overcoming in Mary's\nyoung mind the first miserable impression of such a return to her home.\nIt gave her a kind of pleasure to write to Mrs. Bowyer that she had found\nemployment, and had thought it better to accept it at once. \"Don't be\nangry with me; and I think you will understand me,\" she said. And then\nshe gave herself up to the strange new scene.\n\nThe \"ways\" of the large simple-minded family, homely, yet kindly, so\ntransformed Lady Mary's graceful old rooms that they no longer looked the\nsame place. And when Mary sat down with them at the big heavy-laden\ntable, surrounded with the hum of so large a party, it was impossible for\nher to believe that everything was not new about her. In no way could the\nsaddening recollections of a home from which the chief figure had\ndisappeared, have been more completely broken up. Afterwards Mrs. Turner\ntook her aside, and begged to know which was Mary's old room, \"for I\nshould like to put you there, as if nothing had happened.\" \"Oh, do not\nput me there!\" Mary cried, \"so much has happened.\" But this seemed a\nrefinement to the kind woman, which it was far better for her young guest\nnot to \"yield\" to. The room Mary had occupied had been next to her\ngodmother's, with a door between, and when it turned out that Connie,\nwith an elder sister, was in Lady Mary's room, everything seemed\nperfectly arranged in Mrs. Turner's eyes. She thought it was\nprovidential,--with a simple belief in Mary's powers that in other\ncircumstances would have been amusing. But there was no amusement in\nMary's mind when she took possession of the old room \"as if nothing\nhad happened.\" She sat by the fire for half the night, in an agony of\nsilent recollection and thought, going over the last days of her\ngodmother's life, calling up everything before her, and realizing as she\nhad never realized till now, the lonely career on which she was setting\nout, the subjection to the will and convenience of strangers in which\nhenceforth her life must be passed. This was a kind woman who had opened\nher doors to the destitute girl; but notwithstanding, however great the\ntorture to Mary, there was no escaping this room which was haunted by the\nsaddest recollections of her life. Of such things she must no longer\ncomplain,--nay, she must think of nothing but thanking the mistress of\nthe house for her thoughtfulness, for the wish to be kind, which so often\nexceeds the performance.\n\nThe room was warm and well lighted; the night was very calm and\nsweet outside, nothing had been touched or changed of all her little\ndecorations, the ornaments which had been so delightful to her\ngirlhood. A large photograph of Lady Mary held the chief place over the\nmantel-piece, representing her in the fullness of her beauty,--a\nphotograph which had been taken from the picture painted ages ago by a\nRoyal Academician. It fortunately was so little like Lady Mary in her old\nage that, save as a thing which had always hung there, and belonged to\nher happier life, it did not affect the girl; but no picture was\nnecessary to bring before her the well-remembered figure. She could not\nrealize that the little movements she heard on the other side of the door\nwere any other than those of her mistress, her friend, her mother; for\nall these names Mary lavished upon her in the fullness of her heart. The\nblame that was being cast upon Lady Mary from all sides made this child\nof her bounty but more deeply her partisan, more warm in her adoration.\nShe would not, for all the inheritances of the world, have acknowledged\neven to herself that Lady Mary was in fault. Mary felt that she would\nrather a thousand times be poor and have to gain her daily bread, than\nthat she who had nourished and cherished her should have been forced in\nher cheerful old age to think, before she chose to do so, of parting and\nfarewell and the inevitable end.\n\nShe thought, like every young creature in strange and painful\ncircumstances, that she would be unable to sleep, and did indeed lie\nawake and weep for an hour or more, thinking of all the changes that had\nhappened; but sleep overtook her before she knew, while her mind was\nstill full of these thoughts; and her dreams were endless, confused, full\nof misery and longing. She dreamed a dozen times over that she heard\nLady Mary's soft call through the open door,--which was not open, but\nshut closely and locked by the sisters who now inhabited the next room;\nand once she dreamed that Lady Mary came to her bedside and stood there\nlooking at her earnestly, with the tears flowing from her eyes. Mary\nstruggled in her sleep to tell her benefactress how she loved her, and\napproved of all she had done, and wanted nothing,--but felt herself\nbound as by a nightmare, so that she could not move or speak, or even put\nout a hand to dry those tears which it was intolerable to her to see;\nand woke with the struggle, and the miserable sensation of seeing her\ndearest friend weep and being unable to comfort her. The moon was shining\ninto the room, throwing part of it into a cold, full light, while\nblackness lay in all corners. The impression of her dream was so strong\nthat Mary's eyes turned instantly to the spot where in her dream her\ngodmother had stood. To be sure, there was nobody there; but as her\nconsciousness returned, and with it the sweep of painful recollection,\nthe sense of change, the miserable contrast between the present and the\npast,--sleep fled from her eyes. She fell into the vividly awake\ncondition which is the alternative of broken sleep, and gradually, as she\nlay, there came upon her that mysterious sense of another presence in the\nroom which is so subtle and indescribable. She neither saw anything nor\nheard anything, and yet she felt that some one was there.\n\nShe lay still for some time and held her breath, listening for a\nmovement, even for the sound of breathing,--scarcely alarmed, yet sure\nthat she was not alone. After a while she raised herself on her pillow,\nand in a low voice asked, \"Who is there? is any one there?\" There was no\nreply, no sound of any description, and yet the conviction grew upon her.\nHer heart began to beat, and the blood to mount to her head. Her own\nbeing made so much sound, so much commotion, that it seemed to her she\ncould not hear anything save those beatings and pulsings. Yet she was not\nafraid. After a time, however, the oppression became more than she could\nbear. She got up and lit her candle, and searched through the familiar\nroom; but she found no trace that any one had been there. The furniture\nwas all in its usual order. There was no hiding-place where any human\nthing could find refuge. When she had satisfied herself, and was about to\nreturn to bed, suppressing a sensation which must, she said to herself,\nbe altogether fantastic, she was startled by a low knocking at the door\nof communication. Then she heard the voice of the elder girl. \"Oh, Miss\nVivian what is it? Have you seen anything?\" A new sense of anger,\ndisdain, humiliation, swept through Mary's mind. And if she had seen\nanything, she said to herself, what was that to those strangers? She\nreplied, \"No, nothing; what should I see?\" in a tone which was almost\nhaughty, in spite of herself.\n\n\"I thought it might be--the ghost. Oh, please, don't be angry. I thought\nI heard this door open, but it is locked. Oh! perhaps it is very silly,\nbut I am so frightened, Miss Vivian.\"\n\n\"Go back to bed,\" said Mary; \"there is no--ghost. I am going to sit up\nand write some--letters. You will see my light under the door.\"\n\n\"Oh, thank you,\" cried the girl.\n\nMary remembered what a consolation and strength in all wakefulness had\nbeen the glimmer of the light under her godmother's door. She smiled to\nthink that she herself, so desolate as she was, was able to afford this\ninnocent comfort to another girl, and then sat down and wept quietly,\nfeeling her solitude and the chill about her, and the dark and the\nsilence. The moon had gone behind a cloud. There seemed no light but her\nsmall miserable candle in earth and heaven. And yet that poor little\nspeck of light kept up the heart of another,--which made her smile again\nin the middle of her tears. And by-and-by the commotion in her head and\nheart calmed down, and she too fell asleep.\n\nNext day she heard all the floating legends that were beginning to rise\nin the house. They all arose from Connie's questions about the old lady\nwhom she had seen going up-stairs before her, the first evening after the\nnew family's arrival. It was in the presence of the doctor,--who had come\nto see the child, and whose surprise at finding Mary there was almost\nludicrous,--that she heard the story, though much against his will.\n\n\"There can be no need for troubling Miss Vivian about it,\" he said, in a\ntone which was almost rude. But Mrs. Turner was not sensitive.\n\n\"When Miss Vivian has just come like a dear, to help us with Connie!\" the\ngood woman cried. \"Of course she must hear it, doctor, for otherwise, how\ncould she know what to do?\"\n\n\"Is it true that you have come here--_here?_ to help--Good heavens, Miss\nMary, _here?_\"\n\n\"Why not here?\" Mary said, smiling as but she could. \"I am Connie's\ngoverness, doctor.\"\n\nHe burst out into that suppressed roar which serves a man instead of\ntears, and jumped up from his seat, clenching his fist. The clenched fist\nwas to the intention of the dead woman whose fault this was; and if it\nhad ever entered the doctor's mind, as his mother supposed, to marry this\nforlorn child, and thus bestow a home upon her whether she would or no,\nno doubt he would now have attempted to carry out that plan. But as no\nsuch thing had occurred to him, the doctor only showed his sense of the\nintolerable by look and gesture. \"I must speak to the vicar. I must see\nFurnival. It can't be permitted,\" he cried.\n\n\"Do you think I shall not be kind to her, doctor?\" cried Mrs. Turner.\n\"Oh, ask her! she is one that understands. She knows far better than\nthat. We're not fine people, doctor, but we're kind people. I can say\nthat for myself. There is nobody in this house but will be good to her,\nand admire her, and take an example by her. To have a real lady with the\ngirls, that is what I would give anything for; and as she wants taking\ncare of, poor dear, and petting, and an 'ome--\" Mary, who would not hear\nany more, got up hastily, and took the hand of her new protectress, and\nkissed her, partly out of gratitude and kindness, partly to stop her\nmouth, and prevent the saying of something which it might have been still\nmore difficult to support. \"You are a real lady yourself, dear Mrs.\nTurner,\" she cried. (And this notwithstanding the one deficient letter:\nbut many people who are much more dignified than Mrs. Turner--people who\nbehave themselves very well in every other respect--say \"'ome.\")\n\n\"Oh, my dear, I don't make any pretensions,\" the good woman cried, but\nwith a little shock of pleasure which brought the tears to her eyes.\n\nAnd then the story was told. Connie had seen the lady walk up-stairs, and\nhad thought no harm. The child supposed it was some one belonging to the\nhouse. She had gone into the room which was now Connie's room; but as\nthat had a second door, there was no suspicion caused by the fact that\nshe was not found there a little time after, when the child told her\nmother what she had seen. After this, Connie had seen the same lady\nseveral times, and once had met her face to face. The child declared that\nshe was not at all afraid. She was a pretty old lady, with white hair and\ndark eyes. She looked a little sad, but smiled when Connie stopped and\nstared at her,--not angry at all, but rather pleased,--and looked for a\nmoment as if she would speak. That was all. Not a word about a ghost was\nsaid in Connie's hearing. She had already told it all to the doctor, and\nhe had pretended to consider which of the old ladies in the neighborhood\nthis could be. In Mary's mind, occupied as it was by so many important\nmatters, there had been up to this time no great question about Connie's\napparition; now she began to listen closely, not so much from real\ninterest as from a perception that the doctor, who was her friend, did\nnot want her to hear. This naturally aroused her attention at once. She\nlistened to the child's description with growing eagerness, all the more\nbecause the doctor opposed. \"Now that will do, Miss Connie,\" he said; \"it\nis one of the old Miss Murchisons, who are always so fond of finding out\nabout their neighbors. I have no doubt at all on that subject. She wants\nto find you out in your pet naughtiness, whatever it is, and tell me.\"\n\n\"I am sure it is not for that,\" cried Connie. \"Oh, how can you be so\ndisagreeable? I know she is not a lady who would tell. Besides, she\nis not thinking at all about me. She was either looking for something she\nhad lost, or,--oh, I don't know what it was!--and when she saw me she\njust smiled. She is not dressed like any of the people here. She had got\nno cloak on, or bonnet, or anything that is common, but a beautiful white\nshawl and a long dress, and it gives a little sweep when she walks,--oh\nno! not like your rustling, mamma; but all soft, like water,--and it\nlooks like lace upon her head, tied here,\" said Connie, putting her\nhands to her chin, \"in such a pretty, large, soft knot.\" Mary had\ngradually risen as this description went on, starting a little at first,\nlooking up, getting upon her feet. The color went altogether out of her\nface,--her eyes grew to twice their natural size. The doctor put out his\nhand without looking at her, and laid it on her arm with a strong,\nemphatic pressure. \"Just like some one you have seen a picture of,\" he\nsaid.\n\n\"Oh no. I never saw a picture that was so pretty,\" said the child.\n\n\"Doctor, why do you ask her any more? don't you see, don't you see, the\nchild has seen--\"\n\n\"Miss Mary, for God's sake, hold your tongue; it is folly, you know. Now,\nmy little girl, tell me. I know this old lady is the very image of that\npretty old lady with the toys for good children, who was in the last\nChristmas number?\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Connie, pausing a little. \"Yes, I remember; it was a very\npretty picture,--mamma put it up in the nursery. No, she is not like\nthat, not at all, much prettier; and then _my_ lady is sorry about\nsomething,--except when she smiles at me. She has her hair put up like\nthis, and this,\" the child went on, twisting her own bright locks.\n\n\"Doctor, I can't bear any more.\"\n\n\"My dear, you are mistaken, it is all a delusion. She has seen a picture.\nI think now, Mrs. Turner, that my little patient had better run away and\nplay. Take a good run through the woods, Miss Connie, with your brother,\nand I will send you some physic which will not be at all nasty, and we\nshall hear no more of your old lady. My dear Miss Vivian, if you will but\nhear reason! I have known such cases a hundred times. The child has seen\na picture, and it has taken possession of her imagination. She is a\nlittle below par, and she has a lively imagination; and she has learned\nsomething from Prentiss, though probably she does not remember that. And\nthere it is! a few doses of quinine, and she will see visions no more.\"\n\n\"Doctor,\" cried Mary, \"how can you speak so to me? You dare not look me\nin the face. You know you dare not: as if you did not know as well as I\ndo! Oh, why does that child see her, and not me?\"\n\n\"There it is,\" he said, with a broken laugh. \"Could anything show better\nthat it is a mere delusion? Why, in the name of all that is reasonable,\nshould this stranger child see her, if it was anything, and not you?\"\n\nMrs. Turner looked from one to another with wondering eyes. \"You know\nwhat it is?\" she said. \"Oh, you know what it is? Doctor, doctor, is it\nbecause my Connie is so delicate? Is it a warning? Is it--\"\n\n\"Oh, for heaven's sake! You will drive me mad, you ladies. Is it this,\nand is it that? It is nothing, I tell you. The child is out of sorts,\nand she has seen some picture that has caught her fancy,--and she thinks\nshe sees--I'll send her a bottle,\" he cried, jumping up, \"that will put\nan end to all that.\"\n\n\"Doctor, don't go away, tell me rather what I must do--if she is looking\nfor something! Oh, doctor, think if she were unhappy, if she were kept\nout of her sweet rest!\"\n\n\"Miss Mary, for God's sake, be reasonable. You ought never to have heard\na word.\"\n\n\"Doctor, think! if it should be anything we can do. Oh, tell me, tell me!\nDon't go away and leave me; perhaps we can find out what it is.\"\n\n\"I will have nothing to do with your findings out. It is mere delusion.\nPut them both to bed, Mrs. Turner; put them all to bed!--as if there was\nnot trouble enough!\"\n\n\"What is it?\" cried Connie's mother; \"is it a warning! Oh, for the love\nof God, tell me, is that what comes before a death?\"\n\nWhen they were all in this state of agitation, the vicar and his wife\nwere suddenly shown into the room. Mrs. Bowyer's eyes flew to Mary, but\nshe was too well bred a woman not to pay her respects first to the lady\nof the house, and there were a number of politenesses exchanged, very\nbreathlessly on Mrs. Turner's part, before the new-comers were free to\nshow the real occasion of their visit. \"Oh, Mary, what did you mean by\ntaking such a step all in a moment? How could you come here, of all\nplaces in the world? And how could you leave me without a word?\" the\nvicar's wife said, with her lips against Mary's cheek. She had already\nperceived, without dwelling upon it, the excitement in which all the\nparty were. This was said while the vicar was still making his bow to his\nnew parishioner, who knew very well that her visitors had not intended to\ncall; for the Turners were dissenters, to crown all their misdemeanors,\nbeside being city people and _nouveaux riches_.\n\n\"Don't ask me any questions just now,\" said Mary, clasping almost\nhysterically her friend's hand.\n\n\"It was providential. Come and hear what the child has seen.\" Mrs.\nTurner, though she was so anxious, was too polite not to make a fuss\nabout getting chairs for all her visitors. She postponed her own trouble\nto this necessity, and trembling, sought the most comfortable seat for\nMrs. Bowyer, the largest and most imposing for the vicar himself. When\nshe had established them in a little circle, and done her best to draw\nMary, too, into a chair, she sat down quietly, her mind divided between\nthe cares of courtesy and the alarms of an anxious mother. Mary stood at\nthe table and waited till the commotion was over. The new-comers thought\nshe was going to explain her conduct in leaving them; and Mrs. Bowyer, at\nleast, who was critical in point of manners, shivered a little, wondering\nif perhaps (though she could not find it in her heart to blame Mary) her\nproceedings were in perfect taste.\n\n\"The little girl,\" Mary said, beginning abruptly. She had been standing\nby the table, her lips apart, her countenance utterly pale, her mind\nevidently too much absorbed to notice anything. \"The little girl has seen\nseveral times a lady going up-stairs. Once she met her and saw her\nface, and the lady smiled at her; but her face was sorrowful, and the\nchild thought she was looking for something. The lady was old, with\nwhite hair done up upon her forehead, and lace upon her head. She was\ndressed--\" here Mary's voice began to be interrupted from time to time by\na brief sob--\"in a long dress that made a soft sound when she walked, and\na white shawl, and the lace tied under her chin in a large soft knot--\"\n\n\"Mary, Mary!\" Mrs. Bowyer had risen and stood behind the girl, in whose\nslender throat the climbing sorrow was almost visible, supporting her,\ntrying to stop her. \"Mary, Mary!\" she cried; \"oh, my darling, what are\nyou thinking of? Francis! doctor! make her stop, make her stop.\"\n\n\"Why should she stop?\" said Mrs. Turner, rising, too, in her agitation.\n\"Oh, is it a warning, is it a warning? for my child has seen it,--Connie\nhas seen it.\"\n\n\"Listen to me, all of you,\" said Mary, with an effort. \"You all know--who\nthat is. And she has seen her,--the little girl--\"\n\nNow the others looked at each other, exchanging a startled look.\n\n\"My dear people,\" cried the doctor, \"the case is not the least unusual.\nNo, no, Mrs. Turner, it is no warning,--it is nothing of the sort. Look\nhere, Bowyer; you'll believe me. The child is very nervous and sensitive.\nShe has evidently seen a picture somewhere of our dear old friend. She\nhas heard the story somehow,--oh, perhaps in some garbled version from\nPrentiss, or--of course they've all been talking of it. And the child is\none of those creatures with its nerves all on the surface,--and a little\nbelow par in health, in need of iron and quinine, and all that sort of\nthing. I've seen a hundred such cases,\" cried the doctor, \"--a thousand\nsuch; but now, of course, we'll have a fine story made of it, now that\nit's come into the ladies' hands.\"\n\nHe was much excited with this long speech; but it cannot be said that any\none paid much attention to him. Mrs. Bowyer was holding Mary in her arms,\nuttering little cries and sobs over her, and looking anxiously at her\nhusband. The vicar sat down suddenly in his chair, with the air of a man\nwho has judgment to deliver without the least idea what to say; while\nMary, freeing herself unconsciously from her friend's restraining\nembrace, stood facing them all with a sort of trembling defiance; and\nMrs. Turner kept on explaining nervously that,--\"no, no, her Connie was\nnot excitable, was not oversensitive, had never known what a delusion\nwas.\"\n\n\"This is very strange,\" the vicar said.\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Bowyer,\" cried Mary, \"tell me what I am to do!--think if she\ncannot rest, if she is not happy, she that was so good to everybody, that\nnever could bear to see any one in trouble. Oh, tell me, tell me what I\nam to do! It is you that have disturbed her with all you have been\nsaying. Oh, what can I do, what can I do to give her rest?\"\n\n\"My dear Mary! my dear Mary!\" they all cried, in different tones of\nconsternation; and for a few minutes no one could speak. Mrs. Bowyer, as\nwas natural, said something, being unable to endure the silence; but\nneither she nor any of the others knew what it was she said. When it was\nevident that the vicar must speak, all were silent, waiting for him; and\nthough it now became imperative that something in the shape of a judgment\nmust be delivered, yet he was as far as ever from knowing what to say.\n\n\"Mary,\" he said, with a little tremulousness of voice, \"it is quite\nnatural that you should ask me; but, my dear, I am not at all prepared to\nanswer. I think you know that the doctor, who ought to know best about\nsuch matters--\"\n\n\"Nay, not I. I only know about the physical; the other,--if there is\nanother,--that's your concern.\"\n\n\"Who ought to know best,\" repeated Mr. Bowyer; \"for every body will tell\nyou, my dear, that the mind is so dependent upon the body. I suppose he\nmust be right. I suppose it is just the imagination of a nervous child\nworking upon the data which have been given,--the picture; and then, as\nyou justly remind me, all we have been saying--\"\n\n\"How could the child know what we have been saying, Francis?\"\n\n\"Connie has heard nothing that any one has been saying; and there is no\npicture.\"\n\n\"My dear lady, you hear what the doctor says. If there is no picture, and\nshe has heard nothing, I suppose, then, your premises are gone, and the\nconclusion falls to the ground.\"\n\n\"What does it matter about premises?\" cried the vicar's wife; \"here is\nsomething dreadful that has happened. Oh, what nonsense that is about\nimagination; children have no imagination. A dreadful thing has happened.\nIn heaven's name, Francis, tell this poor child what she is to do.\"\n\n\"My dear,\" said the vicar again, \"you are asking me to believe in\npurgatory,--nothing less. You are asking me to contradict the church's\nteaching. Mary, you must compose yourself. You must wait till this\nexcitement has passed away.\"\n\n\"I can see by her eyes that she did not sleep last night,\" the doctor\nsaid, relieved. \"We shall have her seeing visions too, if we don't take\ncare.\"\n\n\"And, my dear Mary,\" said the vicar, \"if you will think of it, it is\nderogatory to the dignity of--of our dear friends who have passed away.\nHow can we suppose that one of the blessed would come down from heaven,\nand walk about her own house, which she had just left, and show herself\nto a--to a--little child who had never seen her before.\"\n\n\"Impossible,\" said the doctor. \"I told you so; a stranger--that had no\nconnection with her, knew nothing about her--\"\n\n\"Instead of,\" said the vicar, with a slight tremor, \"making herself\nknown, if that was permitted, to--to me, for example, or our friend\nhere.\"\n\n\"That sounds reasonable, Mary,\" said Mrs. Bowyer; \"don't you think so, my\ndear? If she had come to one of us, or to yourself, my darling, I should\nnever have wondered, after all that has happened. But to this little\nchild--\"\n\n\"Whereas there is nothing more likely--more consonant with all the\nteachings of science--than that the little thing should have this\nhallucination, of which you ought never to have heard a word. You are the\nvery last person--\"\n\n\"That is true,\" said the vicar, \"and all the associations of the place\nmust be overwhelming. My dear, we must take her away with us. Mrs.\nTurner, I am sure, is very kind, but it cannot be good for Mary to be\nhere.\"\n\n\"No, no! I never thought so,\" said Mrs. Bowyer. \"I never intended--dear\nMrs. Turner, we all appreciate your motives. I hope you will let us see\nmuch of you, and that we may become very good friends. But Mary--it is\nher first grief, don't you know?\" said the vicar's wife, with the tears\nin her eyes; \"she has always been so much cared for, so much thought of\nall her life--and then all at once! You will not think that we\nmisunderstand your kind motives; but it is more than she can bear. She\nmade up her mind in a hurry, without thinking. You must not be annoyed if\nwe take her away.\"\n\nMrs. Turner had been looking from one to another while this dialogue went\non. She said now, a little wounded, \"I wished only to do what was kind;\nbut, perhaps I was thinking most of my own child. Miss Vivian must do\nwhat she thinks best.\"\n\n\"You are all kind--too kind,\" Mary cried; \"but no one must say another\nword, please. Unless Mrs. Turner should send me away, until I know what\nthis all means, it is my place to stay here.\"\n\n\n\n\nIX.\n\n\nIt was Lady Mary who had come into the vicarage that afternoon when Mrs.\nBowyer supposed some one had called. She wandered about to a great many\nplaces in these days, but always returned to the scenes in which her life\nhad been passed, and where alone her work could be done, if it could be\ndone at all. She came in and listened while the tale of her own\ncarelessness and heedlessness was told, and stood by while her favorite\nwas taken to another woman's bosom for comfort, and heard everything and\nsaw everything. She was used to it by this time; but to be nothing is\nhard, even when you are accustomed to it; and though she knew that they\nwould not hear her, what could she do but cry out to them as she stood\nthere unregarded? \"Oh, have pity upon me!\" Lady Mary said; and the pang\nin her heart was so great that the very atmosphere was stirred, and the\nair could scarcely contain her and the passion of her endeavor to make\nherself known, but thrilled like a harp-string to her cry. Mrs. Bowyer\nheard the jar and tingle in the inanimate world, but she thought only\nthat it was some charitable visitor who had come in, and gone softly away\nagain at the sound of tears.\n\nAnd if Lady Mary could not make herself known to the poor cottagers who\nhad loved her, or to the women who wept for her loss while they blamed\nher, how was she to reveal herself and her secret to the men who, if they\nhad seen her, would have thought her an hallucination? Yes, she tried\nall, and even went a long journey over land and sea to visit the earl,\nwho was her heir, and awake in him an interest in her child. And she\nlingered about all these people in the silence of the night, and tried to\nmove them in dreams, since she could not move them waking. It is more\neasy for one who is no more of this world, to be seen and heard in sleep;\nfor then those who are still in the flesh stand on the borders of the\nunseen, and see and hear things which, waking, they do not understand.\nBut, alas! when they woke, this poor wanderer discovered that her friends\nremembered no more what she had said to them in their dreams.\n\nPresently, however, when she found Mary established in her old home, in\nher old room, there came to her a new hope. For there is nothing in the\nworld so hard to believe, or to be convinced of, as that no effort, no\ndevice, will ever make you known and visible to those you love. Lady Mary\nbeing little altered in her character, though so much in her being, still\nbelieved that if she could but find the way, in a moment,--in the\ntwinkling of an eye, all would be revealed and understood. She went to\nMary's room with this new hope strong in her heart. When they were alone\ntogether in that nest of comfort which she had herself made beautiful for\nher child,--two hearts so full of thought for each other,--what was there\nin earthly bonds which could prevent them from meeting? She went into the\nsilent room, which was so familiar and dear, and waited like a mother\nlong separated from her child, with a faint doubt trembling on the\nsurface of her mind, yet a quaint, joyful confidence underneath in the\nforce of nature. A few words would be enough,--a moment, and all would be\nright. And then she pleased herself with fancies of how, when that was\ndone, she would whisper to her darling what has never been told to flesh\nand blood; and so go home proud, and satisfied, and happy in the\naccomplishment of all she had hoped.\n\nMary came in with her candle in her hand, and closed the door between her\nand all external things. She looked round wistful with that strange\nconsciousness which she had already experienced, that some one was there.\nThe other stood so close to her that the girl could not move without\ntouching her. She held up her hands, imploring, to the child of her love.\nShe called to her, \"Mary, Mary!\" putting her hands upon her, and gazed\ninto her face with an intensity and anguish of eagerness which might have\ndrawn the stars out of the sky. And a strange tumult was in Mary's bosom.\nShe stood looking blankly round her, like one who is blind with open\neyes, and saw nothing; and strained her ears like a deaf man, but heard\nnothing. All was silence, vacancy, an empty world about her. She sat\ndown at her little table, with a heavy sigh. \"The child can see her, but\nshe will not come to me,\" Mary said, and wept.\n\nThen Lady Mary turned away with a heart full of despair. She went quickly\nfrom the house, out into the night. The pang of her disappointment was so\nkeen, that she could not endure it. She remembered what had been said to\nher in the place from whence she came, and how she had been entreated to\nbe patient and wait. Oh, had she but waited and been patient! She sat\ndown upon the ground, a soul forlorn, outside of life, outside of all\nthings, lost in a world which had no place for her. The moon shone, but\nshe made no shadow in it; the rain fell upon her, but did not hurt her;\nthe little night breeze blew without finding any resistance in her. She\nsaid to herself, \"I have failed. What am I, that I should do what they\nall said was impossible? It was my pride, because I have had my own way\nall my life. But now I have no way and no place on earth, and what I have\nto tell them will never, never be known. Oh, my little Mary, a servant\nin her own house! And a word would make it right!--but never, never can\nshe hear that word. I am wrong to say never; she will know when she is in\nheaven. She will not live to be old and foolish, like me. She will go up\nthere early, and then she will know. But I, what will become of me?--for\nI am nothing here, I cannot go back to my own place.\"\n\nA little moaning wind rose up suddenly in the middle of the dark night,\nand carried a faint wail, like the voice of some one lost, to the windows\nof the great house. It woke the children and Mary, who opened her eyes\nquickly in the dark, wondering if perhaps now the vision might come to\nher. But the vision had come when she could not see it, and now returned\nno more.\n\n\n\n\nX.\n\n\nOn the other side, however, visions which had nothing sacred in them\nbegan to be heard of, and \"Connie's ghost,\" as it was called in the\nhouse, had various vulgar effects. A housemaid became hysterical, and\nannounced that she too had seen the lady, of whom she gave a description,\nexaggerated from Connie's, which all the household were ready to swear\nshe had never heard. The lady, whom Connie had only seen passing, went to\nBetsey's room in the middle of the night, and told her, in a hollow and\nterrible voice, that she could not rest, opening a series of\ncommunications by which it was evident all the secrets of the unseen\nworld would soon be disclosed. And following upon this, there came a sort\nof panic in the house; noises were heard in various places, sounds of\nfootsteps pacing, and of a long robe sweeping about the passages; and\nLady Mary's costumes, and the head-dress which was so peculiar, which all\nher friends had recognized in Connie's description, grew into something\nportentous under the heavier hand of the foot-boy and the kitchen-maid.\nMrs. Prentiss, who had remained, as a special favor to the new people,\nwas deeply indignant and outraged by this treatment of her mistress. She\nappealed to Mary with mingled anger and tears.\n\n\"I would have sent the hussy away at an hour's notice, if I had the power\nin my hands,\" she cried, \"but, Miss Mary, it's easily seen who is a real\nlady and who is not. Mrs. Turner interferes herself in everything, though\nshe likes it to be supposed that she has a housekeeper.\"\n\n\"Dear Prentiss, you must not say Mrs. Turner is not a lady. She has far\nmore delicacy of feeling than many ladies,\" cried Mary.\n\n\"Yes, Miss Mary, dear, I allow that she is very nice to you; but who\ncould help that? and to hear my lady's name--that might have her faults,\nbut who was far above anything of the sort--in every mouth, and her\ncostume, that they don't know how to describe, and to think that _she_\nwould go and talk to the like of Betsy Barnes about what is on her mind!\nI think sometimes I shall break my, heart, or else throw up my place,\nMiss Mary,\" Prentiss said, with tears.\n\n\"Oh, don't do that; oh, don't leave me, Prentiss!\" Mary said, with an\ninvoluntary cry of dismay.\n\n\"Not if you mind, not if you mind, dear,\" the housekeeper cried. And then\nshe drew close to the young lady with an anxious look. \"You haven't seen\nanything?\" she said. \"That would be only natural, Miss Mary. I could well\nunderstand she couldn't rest in her grave,--if she came and told it all\nto you.\"\n\n\"Prentiss, be silent,\" cried Mary; \"that ends everything between you and\nme, if you say such a word. There has been too much said already,--oh,\nfar too much! as if I only loved her for what she was to leave me.\"\n\n\"I did not mean that, dear,\" said Prentiss; \"but--\"\n\n\"There is no but; and everything she did was right,\" the girl cried with\nvehemence. She shed hot and bitter tears over this wrong which all her\nfriends did to Lady Mary's memory. \"I am glad it was so,\" she said to\nherself when she was alone, with youthful extravagance. \"I am glad it was\nso; for now no one can think that I loved her for anything but herself.\"\n\nThe household, however, was agitated by all these rumors and inventions.\nAlice, Connie's elder sister, declined to sleep any longer in that which\nbegan to be called the haunted room. She, too, began to think she saw\nsomething, she could not tell what, gliding out of the room as it began\nto get dark, and to hear sighs and moans in the corridors. The servants,\nwho all wanted to leave, and the villagers, who avoided the grounds after\nnightfall, spread the rumor far and near that the house was haunted.\n\n\n\n\nXI.\n\n\nIn the meantime, Connie herself was silent, and saw no more of the lady.\nHer attachment to Mary grew into one of those visionary passions which\nlittle girls so often form for young women. She followed her so-called\ngoverness wherever she went, hanging upon her arm when she could, holding\nher dress when no other hold was possible,--following her everywhere,\nlike her shadow. The vicarage, jealous and annoyed at first, and all the\nneighbors indignant too, to see Mary transformed into a dependent of the\ncity family, held out as long as possible against the good-nature of Mrs.\nTurner, and were revolted by the spectacle of this child claiming poor\nMary's attention wherever she moved. But by-and-by all these strong\nsentiments softened, as was natural. The only real drawback was, that\namid all these agitations Mary lost her bloom. She began to droop and\ngrow pale under the observation of the watchful doctor, who had never\nbeen otherwise than dissatisfied with the new position of affairs, and\nbetook himself to Mrs. Bowyer for sympathy and information. \"Did you ever\nsee a girl so fallen off?\" he said. \"Fallen off, doctor! I think she is\nprettier and prettier every day.\" \"Oh,\" the poor man cried, with a\nstrong breathing of impatience, \"You ladies think of nothing, but\nprettiness!--was I talking of prettiness? She must have lost a stone\nsince she went back there. It is all very well to laugh,\" the doctor\nadded, growing red with suppressed anger, \"but I can tell you that is the\ntrue test.

H. F. CARY, M.A.\n\n\n\n\n\nHELL\n\n\nCantos 1 - 34\n\n\n\nCANTO I\n\n\nIN the midway of this our mortal life,\nI found me in a gloomy wood, astray\nGone from the path direct: and e'en to tell\nIt were no easy task, how savage wild\nThat forest, how robust and rough its growth,\nWhich to remember only, my dismay\nRenews, in bitterness not far from death.\nYet to discourse of what there good befell,\nAll else will I relate discover'd there.\nHow first I enter'd it I scarce can say,\nSuch sleepy dullness in that instant weigh'd\nMy senses down, when the true path I left,\nBut when a mountain's foot I reach'd, where clos'd\nThe valley, that had pierc'd my heart with dread,\nI look'd aloft, and saw his shoulders broad\nAlready vested with that planet's beam,\nWho leads all wanderers safe through every way.\n\nThen was a little respite to the fear,\nThat in my heart's recesses deep had lain,\nAll of that night, so pitifully pass'd:\nAnd as a man, with difficult short breath,\nForespent with toiling,'scap'd from sea to shore,\nTurns to the perilous wide waste, and stands\nAt gaze; e'en so my spirit, that yet fail'd\nStruggling with terror, turn'd to view the straits,\nThat none hath pass'd and liv'd.  My weary frame\nAfter short pause recomforted, again\nI journey'd on over that lonely steep,\n\nThe hinder foot still firmer.  Scarce the ascent\nBegan, when, lo! a panther, nimble, light,\nAnd cover'd with a speckled skin, appear'd,\nNor, when it saw me, vanish'd, rather strove\nTo check my onward going; that ofttimes\nWith purpose to retrace my steps I turn'd.\n\nThe hour was morning's prime, and on his way\nAloft the sun ascended with those stars,\nThat with him rose, when Love divine first mov'd\nThose its fair works: so that with joyous hope\nAll things conspir'd to fill me, the gay skin\nOf that swift animal, the matin dawn\nAnd the sweet season.  Soon that joy was chas'd,\nAnd by new dread succeeded, when in view\nA lion came, 'gainst me, as it appear'd,\n\nWith his head held aloft and hunger-mad,\nThat e'en the air was fear-struck.  A she-wolf\nWas at his heels, who in her leanness seem'd\nFull of all wants, and many a land hath made\nDisconsolate ere now.  She with such fear\nO'erwhelmed me, at the sight of her appall'd,\nThat of the height all hope I lost.  As one,\nWho with his gain elated, sees the time\nWhen all unwares is gone, he inwardly\nMourns with heart-griping anguish; such was I,\nHaunted by that fell beast, never at peace,\nWho coming o'er against me, by degrees\nImpell'd me where the sun in silence rests.\n\nWhile to the lower space with backward step\nI fell, my ken discern'd the form one of one,\nWhose voice seem'd faint through long disuse of speech.\nWhen him in that great desert I espied,\n\"Have mercy on me!\" cried I out aloud,\n\"Spirit! or living man! what e'er thou be!\"\n\nHe answer'd: \"Now not man, man once I was,\nAnd born of Lombard parents, Mantuana both\nBy country, when the power of Julius yet\nWas scarcely firm.  At Rome my life was past\nBeneath the mild Augustus, in the time\nOf fabled deities and false.  A bard\nWas I, and made Anchises' upright son\nThe subject of my song, who came from Troy,\nWhen the flames prey'd on Ilium's haughty towers.\nBut thou, say wherefore to such perils past\nReturn'st thou?  wherefore not this pleasant mount\nAscendest, cause and source of all delight?\"\n\"And art thou then that Virgil, that well-spring,\nFrom which such copious floods of eloquence\nHave issued?\"  I with front abash'd replied.\n\"Glory and light of all the tuneful train!\nMay it avail me that I long with zeal\nHave sought thy volume, and with love immense\nHave conn'd it o'er.  My master thou and guide!\nThou he from whom alone I have deriv'd\nThat style, which for its beauty into fame\nExalts me.  See the beast, from whom I fled.\nO save me from her, thou illustrious sage!\"\n\n\"For every vein and pulse throughout my frame\nShe hath made tremble.\"  He, soon as he saw\nThat I was weeping, answer'd, \"Thou must needs\nAnother way pursue, if thou wouldst'scape\nFrom out that savage wilderness.  This beast,\nAt whom thou criest, her way will suffer none\nTo pass, and no less hindrance makes than death:\nSo bad and so accursed in her kind,\nThat never sated is her ravenous will,\nStill after food more craving than before.\nTo many an animal in wedlock vile\nShe fastens, and shall yet to many more,\nUntil that greyhound come, who shall destroy\nHer with sharp pain.  He will not life support\nBy earth nor its base metals, but by love,\nWisdom, and virtue, and his land shall be\nThe land 'twixt either Feltro.  In his might\nShall safety to Italia's plains arise,\nFor whose fair realm, Camilla, virgin pure,\nNisus, Euryalus, and Turnus fell.\nHe with incessant chase through every town\nShall worry, until he to hell at length\nRestore her, thence by envy first let loose.\nI for thy profit pond'ring now devise,\nThat thou mayst follow me, and I thy guide\nWill lead thee hence through an eternal space,\nWhere thou shalt hear despairing shrieks, and see\nSpirits of old tormented, who invoke\nA second death; and those next view, who dwell\nContent in fire, for that they hope to come,\nWhene'er the time may be, among the blest,\nInto whose regions if thou then desire\nT' ascend, a spirit worthier then I\nMust lead thee, in whose charge, when I depart,\nThou shalt be left: for that Almighty King,\nWho reigns above, a rebel to his law,\nAdjudges me, and therefore hath decreed,\nThat to his city none through me should come.\nHe in all parts hath sway; there rules, there holds\nHis citadel and throne.  O happy those,\nWhom there he chooses!\"  I to him in few:\n\"Bard! by that God, whom thou didst not adore,\nI do beseech thee (that this ill and worse\nI may escape) to lead me, where thou saidst,\nThat I Saint Peter's gate may view, and those\nWho as thou tell'st, are in such dismal plight.\"\n\nOnward he mov'd, I close his steps pursu'd.\n\n\n\n\nCANTO II\n\nNOW was the day departing, and the air,\nImbrown'd with shadows, from their toils releas'd\nAll animals on earth; and I alone\nPrepar'd myself the conflict to sustain,\nBoth of sad pity, and that perilous road,\nWhich my unerring memory shall retrace.\n\nO Muses!  O high genius! now vouchsafe\nYour aid!  O mind! that all I saw hast kept\nSafe in a written record, here thy worth\nAnd eminent endowments come to proof.\n\nI thus began: \"Bard! thou who art my guide,\nConsider well, if virtue be in me\nSufficient, ere to this high enterprise\nThou trust me.  Thou hast told that Silvius' sire,\nYet cloth'd in corruptible flesh, among\nTh' immortal tribes had entrance, and was there\nSensible present.  Yet if heaven's great Lord,\nAlmighty foe to ill, such favour shew'd,\nIn contemplation of the high effect,\nBoth what and who from him should issue forth,\nIt seems in reason's judgment well deserv'd:\nSith he of Rome, and of Rome's empire wide,\nIn heaven's empyreal height was chosen sire:\nBoth which, if truth be spoken, were ordain'd\nAnd'stablish'd for the holy place, where sits\nWho to great Peter's sacred chair succeeds.\nHe from this journey, in thy song renown'd,\nLearn'd things, that to his victory gave rise\nAnd to the papal robe.  In after-times\nThe chosen vessel also travel'd there,\nTo bring us back assurance in that faith,\nWhich is the entrance to salvation's way.\nBut I, why should I there presume?  or who\nPermits it?  not, Aeneas I nor Paul.\nMyself I deem not worthy, and none else\nWill deem me.  I, if on this voyage then\nI venture, fear it will in folly end.\nThou, who art wise, better my meaning know'st,\nThan I can speak.\"  As one, who unresolves\nWhat he hath late resolv'd, and with new thoughts\nChanges his purpose, from his first intent\nRemov'd; e'en such was I on that dun coast,\nWasting in thought my enterprise, at first\nSo eagerly embrac'd.  \"If right thy words\nI scan,\" replied that shade magnanimous,\n\"Thy soul is by vile fear assail'd, which oft\nSo overcasts a man, that he recoils\nFrom noblest resolution, like a beast\nAt some false semblance in the twilight gloom.\nThat from this terror thou mayst free thyself,\nI will instruct thee why I came, and what\nI heard in that same instant, when for thee\nGrief touch'd me first.  I was among the tribe,\nWho rest suspended, when a dame, so blest\nAnd lovely, I besought her to command,\nCall'd me; her eyes were brighter than the star\nOf day; and she with gentle voice and soft\nAngelically tun'd her speech address'd:\n\"O courteous shade of Mantua! thou whose fame\nYet lives, and shall live long as nature lasts!\nA friend, not of my fortune but myself,\nOn the wide desert in his road has met\nHindrance so great, that he through fear has turn'd.\nNow much I dread lest he past help have stray'd,\nAnd I be ris'n too late for his relief,\nFrom what in heaven of him I heard.  Speed now,\nAnd by thy eloquent persuasive tongue,\nAnd by all means for his deliverance meet,\nAssist him.  So to me will comfort spring.\nI who now bid thee on this errand forth\nAm Beatrice; from a place I come\n\n(Note: Beatrice.  I use this word, as it is\npronounced in the Italian, as consisting of four\nsyllables, of which the third is a long one.)\n\nRevisited with joy.  Love brought me thence,\nWho prompts my speech.  When in my Master's sight\nI stand, thy praise to him I oft will tell.\"\n\nShe then was silent, and I thus began:\n\"O Lady! by whose influence alone,\nMankind excels whatever is contain'd\nWithin that heaven which hath the smallest orb,\nSo thy command delights me, that to obey,\nIf it were done already, would seem late.\nNo need hast thou farther to speak thy will;\nYet tell the reason, why thou art not loth\nTo leave that ample space, where to return\nThou burnest, for this centre here beneath.\"\n\nShe then: \"Since thou so deeply wouldst inquire,\nI will instruct thee briefly, why no dread\nHinders my entrance here.  Those things alone\nAre to be fear'd, whence evil may proceed,\nNone else, for none are terrible beside.\nI am so fram'd by God, thanks to his grace!\nThat any suff'rance of your misery\nTouches me not, nor flame of that fierce fire\nAssails me.  In high heaven a blessed dame\nBesides, who mourns with such effectual grief\nThat hindrance, which I send thee to remove,\nThat God's stern judgment to her will inclines.\"\nTo Lucia calling, her she thus bespake:\n\"Now doth thy faithful servant need thy aid\nAnd I commend him to thee.\"  At her word\nSped Lucia, of all cruelty the foe,\nAnd coming to the place, where I abode\nSeated with Rachel, her of ancient days,\nShe thus address'd me: \"Thou true praise of God!\nBeatrice! why is not thy succour lent\nTo him, who so much lov'd thee, as to leave\nFor thy sake all the multitude admires?\nDost thou not hear how pitiful his wail,\nNor mark the death, which in the torrent flood,\nSwoln mightier than a sea, him struggling holds?\"\n\"Ne'er among men did any with such speed\nHaste to their profit, flee from their annoy,\nAs when these words were spoken, I came here,\nDown from my blessed seat, trusting the force\nOf thy pure eloquence, which thee, and all\nWho well have mark'd it, into honour brings.\"\n\n\"When she had ended, her bright beaming eyes\nTearful she turn'd aside; whereat I felt\nRedoubled zeal to serve thee.  As she will'd,\nThus am I come: I sav'd thee from the beast,\nWho thy near way across the goodly mount\nPrevented.  What is this comes o'er thee then?\nWhy, why dost thou hang back?  why in thy breast\nHarbour vile fear?  why hast not courage there\nAnd noble daring?  Since three maids so blest\nThy safety plan, e'en in the court of heaven;\nAnd so much certain good my words forebode.\"\n\nAs florets, by the frosty air of night\nBent down and clos'd, when day has blanch'd their leaves,\nRise all unfolded on their spiry stems;\nSo was my fainting vigour new restor'd,\nAnd to my heart such kindly courage ran,\nThat I as one undaunted soon replied:\n\"O full of pity she, who undertook\nMy succour! and thou kind who didst perform\nSo soon her true behest!  With such desire\nThou hast dispos'd me to renew my voyage,\nThat my first purpose fully is resum'd.\nLead on: one only will is in us both.\nThou art my guide, my master thou, and lord.\"\n\nSo spake I; and when he had onward mov'd,\nI enter'd on the deep and woody way.\n\n\n\n\nCANTO III\n\n\"THROUGH me you pass into the city of woe:\nThrough me you pass into eternal pain:\nThrough me among the people lost for aye.\nJustice the founder of my fabric mov'd:\nTo rear me was the task of power divine,\nSupremest wisdom, and primeval love.\nBefore me things create were none, save things\nEternal, and eternal I endure.\n\n\"All hope abandon ye who enter here.\"\n\nSuch characters in colour dim I mark'd\nOver a portal's lofty arch inscrib'd:\nWhereat I thus: \"Master, these words import\nHard meaning.\"  He as one prepar'd replied:\n\"Here thou must all distrust behind thee leave;\nHere be vile fear extinguish'd. We are come\nWhere I have told thee we shall see the souls\nTo misery doom'd, who intellectual good\nHave lost.\"  And when his hand he had stretch'd forth\nTo mine, with pleasant looks, whence I was cheer'd,\nInto that secret place he led me on.\n\nHere sighs with lamentations and loud moans\nResounded through the air pierc'd by no star,\nThat e'en I wept at entering.  Various tongues,\nHorrible languages, outcries of woe,\nAccents of anger, voices deep and hoarse,\nWith hands together smote that swell'd the sounds,\nMade up a tumult, that for ever whirls\nRound through that air with solid darkness stain'd,\nLike to the sand that in the whirlwind flies.\n\nI then, with error yet encompass'd, cried:\n\"O master!  What is this I hear?  What race\nAre these, who seem so overcome with woe?\"\n\nHe thus to me: \"This miserable fate\nSuffer the wretched souls of those, who liv'd\nWithout or praise or blame, with that ill band\nOf angels mix'd, who nor rebellious prov'd\nNor yet were true to God, but for themselves\nWere only.  From his bounds Heaven drove them forth,\nNot to impair his lustre, nor the depth\nOf Hell receives them, lest th' accursed tribe\nShould glory thence with exultation vain.\"\n\nI then: \"Master! what doth aggrieve them thus,\nThat they lament so loud?\"  He straight replied:\n\"That will I tell thee briefly.  These of death\nNo hope may entertain: and their blind life\nSo meanly passes, that all other lots\nThey envy.  Fame of them the world hath none,\nNor suffers; mercy and justice scorn them both.\nSpeak not of them, but look, and pass them by.\"\n\nAnd I, who straightway look'd, beheld a flag,\nWhich whirling ran around so rapidly,\nThat it no pause obtain'd: and following came\nSuch a long train of spirits, I should ne'er\nHave thought, that death so many had despoil'd.\n\nWhen some of these I recogniz'd, I saw\nAnd knew the shade of him, who to base fear\nYielding, abjur'd his high estate.  Forthwith\nI understood for certain this the tribe\nOf those ill spirits both to God displeasing\nAnd to his foes.  These wretches, who ne'er lived,\nWent on in nakedness, and sorely stung\nBy wasps and hornets, which bedew'd their cheeks\nWith blood, that mix'd with tears dropp'd to their feet,\nAnd by disgustful worms was gather'd there.\n\nThen looking farther onwards I beheld\nA throng upon the shore of a great stream:\nWhereat I thus: \"Sir! grant me now to know\nWhom here we view, and whence impell'd they seem\nSo eager to pass o'er, as I discern\nThrough the blear light?\"  He thus to me in few:\n\"This shalt thou know, soon as our steps arrive\nBeside the woeful tide of Acheron.\"\n\nThen with eyes downward cast and fill'd with shame,\nFearing my words offensive to his ear,\nTill we had reach'd the river, I from speech\nAbstain'd.  And lo! toward us in a bark\nComes on an old man hoary white with eld,\n\nCrying, \"Woe to you wicked spirits! hope not\nEver to see the sky again.  I come\nTo take you to the other shore across,\nInto eternal darkness, there to dwell\nIn fierce heat and in ice.  And thou, who there\nStandest, live spirit! get thee hence, and leave\nThese who are dead.\"  But soon as he beheld\nI left them not, \"By other way,\" said he,\n\"By other haven shalt thou come to shore,\nNot by this passage; thee a nimbler boat\nMust carry.\"  Then to him thus spake my guide:\n\"Charon! thyself torment not: so 't is will'd,\nWhere will and power are one: ask thou no more.\"\n\nStraightway in silence fell the shaggy cheeks\nOf him the boatman o'er the livid lake,\nAround whose eyes glar'd wheeling flames.  Meanwhile\nThose spirits, faint and naked, color chang'd,\nAnd gnash'd their teeth, soon as the cruel words\nThey heard.  God and their parents they blasphem'd,\nThe human kind, the place, the time, and seed\nThat did engender them and give them birth.\n\nThen all together sorely wailing drew\nTo the curs'd strand, that every man must pass\nWho fears not God.  Charon, demoniac form,\nWith eyes of burning coal, collects them all,\nBeck'ning, and each, that lingers, with his oar\nStrikes.  As fall off the light autumnal leaves,\nOne still another following, till the bough\nStrews all its honours on the earth beneath;\n\nE'en in like manner Adam's evil brood\nCast themselves one by one down from the shore,\nEach at a beck, as falcon at his call.\n\nThus go they over through the umber'd wave,\nAnd ever they on the opposing bank\nBe landed, on this side another throng\nStill gathers.  \"Son,\" thus spake the courteous guide,\n\"Those, who die subject to the wrath of God,\nAll here together come from every clime,\nAnd to o'erpass the river are not loth:\nFor so heaven's justice goads them on, that fear\nIs turn'd into desire.  Hence ne'er hath past\nGood spirit.  If of thee Charon complain,\nNow mayst thou know the import of his words.\"\n\nThis said, the gloomy region trembling shook\nSo terribly, that yet with clammy dews\nFear chills my brow.  The sad earth gave a blast,\nThat, lightening, shot forth a vermilion flame,\nWhich all my senses conquer'd quite, and I\nDown dropp'd, as one with sudden slumber seiz'd.\n\n\n\n\nCANTO IV\n\nBROKE the deep slumber in my brain a crash\nOf heavy thunder, that I shook myself,\nAs one by main force rous'd.  Risen upright,\nMy rested eyes I mov'd around, and search'd\nWith fixed ken to know what place it was,\nWherein I stood.  For certain on the brink\nI found me of the lamentable vale,\nThe dread abyss, that joins a thund'rous sound\nOf plaints innumerable.  Dark and deep,\nAnd thick with clouds o'erspread, mine eye in vain\nExplor'd its bottom, nor could aught discern.\n\n\"Now let us to the blind world there beneath\nDescend;\" the bard began all pale of look:\n\"I go the first, and thou shalt follow next.\"\n\nThen I his alter'd hue perceiving, thus:\n\"How may I speed, if thou yieldest to dread,\nWho still art wont to comfort me in doubt?\"\n\nHe then: \"The anguish of that race below\nWith pity stains my cheek, which thou for fear\nMistakest.  Let us on.  Our length of way\nUrges to haste.\"  Onward, this said, he mov'd;\nAnd ent'ring led me with him on the bounds\nOf the first circle, that surrounds th' abyss.\nHere, as mine ear could note, no plaint was heard\nExcept of sighs, that made th' eternal air\nTremble, not caus'd by tortures, but from grief\nFelt by those multitudes, many and vast,\nOf men, women, and infants.  Then to me\nThe gentle guide: \"Inquir'st thou not what spirits\nAre these, which thou beholdest?  Ere thou pass\nFarther, I would thou know, that these of sin\nWere blameless; and if aught they merited,\nIt profits not, since baptism was not theirs,\nThe portal to thy faith.  If they before\nThe Gospel liv'd, they serv'd not God aright;\nAnd among such am I. For these defects,\nAnd for no other evil, we are lost;\"\n\n\"Only so far afflicted, that we live\nDesiring without hope.\"  So grief assail'd\nMy heart at hearing this, for well I knew\nSuspended in that Limbo many a soul\nOf mighty worth.  \"O tell me, sire rever'd!\nTell me, my master!\"  I began through wish\nOf full assurance in that holy faith,\nWhich vanquishes all error; \"say, did e'er\nAny, or through his own or other's merit,\nCome forth from thence, whom afterward was blest?\"\n\nPiercing the secret purport of my speech,\nHe answer'd: \"I was new to that estate,\nWhen I beheld a puissant one arrive\nAmongst us, with victorious trophy crown'd.\nHe forth the shade of our first parent drew,\nAbel his child, and Noah righteous man,\nOf Moses lawgiver for faith approv'd,\nOf patriarch Abraham, and David king,\nIsrael with his sire and with his sons,\nNor without Rachel whom so hard he won,\nAnd others many more, whom he to bliss\nExalted.  Before these, be thou assur'd,\nNo spirit of human kind was ever sav'd.\"\n\nWe, while he spake, ceas'd not our onward road,\nStill passing through the wood; for so I name\nThose spirits thick beset.  We were not far\nOn this side from the summit, when I kenn'd\nA flame, that o'er the darken'd hemisphere\nPrevailing shin'd.  Yet we a little space\nWere distant, not so far but I in part\nDiscover'd, that a tribe in honour high\nThat place possess'd.  \"O thou, who every art\nAnd science valu'st! who are these, that boast\nSuch honour, separate from all the rest?\"\n\nHe answer'd: \"The renown of their great names\nThat echoes through your world above, acquires\nFavour in heaven, which holds them thus advanc'd.\"\nMeantime a voice I heard: \"Honour the bard\nSublime! his shade returns that left us late!\"\nNo sooner ceas'd the sound, than I beheld\nFour mighty spirits toward us bend their steps,\nOf semblance neither sorrowful nor glad.\n\nWhen thus my master kind began: \"Mark him,\nWho in his right hand bears that falchion keen,\nThe other three preceding, as their lord.\nThis is that Homer, of all bards supreme:\nFlaccus the next in satire's vein excelling;\nThe third is Naso; Lucan is the last.\nBecause they all that appellation own,\nWith which the voice singly accosted me,\nHonouring they greet me thus, and well they judge.\"\n\nSo I beheld united the bright school\nOf him the monarch of sublimest song,\nThat o'er the others like an eagle soars.\nWhen they together short discourse had held,\nThey turn'd to me, with salutation kind\nBeck'ning me; at the which my master smil'd:\nNor was this all; but greater honour still\nThey gave me, for they made me of their tribe;\nAnd I was sixth amid so learn'd a band.\n\nFar as the luminous beacon on we pass'd\nSpeaking of matters, then befitting well\nTo speak, now fitter left untold.  At foot\nOf a magnificent castle we arriv'd,\nSeven times with lofty walls begirt, and round\nDefended by a pleasant stream.  O'er this\nAs o'er dry land we pass'd.  Next through seven gates\nI with those sages enter'd, and we came\nInto a mead with lively verdure fresh.\n\nThere dwelt a race, who slow their eyes around\nMajestically mov'd, and in their port\nBore eminent authority; they spake\nSeldom, but all their words were tuneful sweet.\n\nWe to one side retir'd, into a place\nOpen and bright and lofty, whence each one\nStood manifest to view.  Incontinent\nThere on the green enamel of the plain\nWere shown me the great spirits, by whose sight\nI am exalted in my own esteem.\n\nElectra there I saw accompanied\nBy many, among whom Hector I knew,\nAnchises' pious son, and with hawk's eye\nCaesar all arm'd, and by Camilla there\nPenthesilea.  On the other side\nOld King Latinus, seated by his child\nLavinia, and that Brutus I beheld,\nWho Tarquin chas'd, Lucretia, Cato's wife\nMarcia, with Julia and Cornelia there;\nAnd sole apart retir'd, the Soldan fierce.\n\nThen when a little more I rais'd my brow,\nI spied the master of the sapient throng,\nSeated amid the philosophic train.\nHim all admire, all pay him rev'rence due.\nThere Socrates and Plato both I mark'd,\nNearest to him in rank; Democritus,\nWho sets the world at chance, Diogenes,\nWith Heraclitus, and Empedocles,\nAnd Anaxagoras, and Thales sage,\nZeno, and Dioscorides well read\nIn nature's secret lore.  Orpheus I mark'd\nAnd Linus, Tully and moral Seneca,\nEuclid and Ptolemy, Hippocrates,\nGalenus, Avicen, and him who made\nThat commentary vast, Averroes.\n\nOf all to speak at full were vain attempt;\nFor my wide theme so urges, that ofttimes\nMy words fall short of what bechanc'd.  In two\nThe six associates part.  Another way\nMy sage guide leads me, from that air serene,\nInto a climate ever vex'd with storms:\nAnd to a part I come where no light shines.\n\n\n\n\nCANTO V\n\nFROM the first circle I descended thus\nDown to the second, which, a lesser space\nEmbracing, so much more of grief contains\nProvoking bitter moans.  There, Minos stands\nGrinning with ghastly feature: he, of all\nWho enter, strict examining the crimes,\n\nGives sentence, and dismisses them beneath,\nAccording as he foldeth him around:\nFor when before him comes th' ill fated soul,\nIt all confesses; and that judge severe\nOf sins, considering what place in hell\nSuits the transgression, with his tail so oft\nHimself encircles, as degrees beneath\nHe dooms it to descend.  Before him stand\nAlways a num'rous throng; and in his turn\nEach one to judgment passing, speaks, and hears\nHis fate, thence downward to his dwelling hurl'd.\n\n\"O thou! who to this residence of woe\nApproachest?\"  when he saw me coming, cried\nMinos, relinquishing his dread employ,\n\"Look how thou enter here; beware in whom\nThou place thy trust; let not the entrance broad\nDeceive thee to thy harm.\"  To him my guide:\n\"Wherefore exclaimest?  Hinder not his way\nBy destiny appointed; so 'tis will'd\nWhere will and power are one.  Ask thou no more.\"\n\nNow 'gin the rueful wailings to be heard.\nNow am I come where many a plaining voice\nSmites on mine ear.  Into a place I came\nWhere light was silent all.  Bellowing there groan'd\nA noise as of a sea in tempest torn\nBy warring winds.  The stormy blast of hell\nWith restless fury drives the spirits on\nWhirl'd round and dash'd amain with sore annoy.\n\nWhen they arrive before the ruinous sweep,\nThere shrieks are heard, there lamentations, moans,\nAnd blasphemies 'gainst the good Power in heaven.\n\nI understood that to this torment sad\nThe carnal sinners are condemn'd, in whom\nReason by lust is sway'd.  As in large troops\nAnd multitudinous, when winter reigns,\nThe starlings on their wings are borne abroad;\nSo bears the tyrannous gust those evil souls.\nOn this side and on that, above, below,\nIt drives them: hope of rest to solace them\nIs none, nor e'en of milder pang.  As cranes,\nChanting their dol'rous notes, traverse the sky,\nStretch'd out in long array: so I beheld\nSpirits, who came loud wailing, hurried on\nBy their dire doom.  Then I: \"Instructor! who\nAre these, by the black air so scourg'd?\"--\"The first\n'<DW41> those, of whom thou question'st,\" he replied,\n\"O'er many tongues was empress.  She in vice\nOf luxury was so shameless, that she made\nLiking be lawful by promulg'd decree,\nTo clear the blame she had herself incurr'd.\nThis is Semiramis, of whom 'tis writ,\nThat she succeeded Ninus her espous'd;\nAnd held the land, which now the Soldan rules.\nThe next in amorous fury slew herself,\nAnd to Sicheus' ashes broke her faith:\nThen follows Cleopatra, lustful queen.\"\n\nThere mark'd I Helen, for whose sake so long\nThe time was fraught with evil; there the great\nAchilles, who with love fought to the end.\nParis I saw, and Tristan; and beside\nA thousand more he show'd me, and by name\nPointed them out, whom love bereav'd of life.\n\nWhen I had heard my sage instructor name\nThose dames and knights of antique days, o'erpower'd\nBy pity, well-nigh in amaze my mind\nWas lost; and I began: \"Bard! willingly\nI would address those two together coming,\nWhich seem so light before the wind.\"  He thus:\n\"Note thou, when nearer they to us approach.\"\n\n\"Then by that love which carries them along,\nEntreat; and they will come.\"  Soon as the wind\nSway'd them toward us, I thus fram'd my speech:\n\"O wearied spirits! come, and hold discourse\nWith us, if by none else restrain'd.\"  As doves\nBy fond desire invited, on wide wings\nAnd firm, to their sweet nest returning home,\nCleave the air, wafted by their will along;\nThus issu'd from that troop, where Dido ranks,\nThey through the ill air speeding; with such force\nMy cry prevail'd by strong affection urg'd.\n\n\"O gracious creature and benign! who go'st\nVisiting, through this element obscure,\nUs, who the world with bloody stain imbru'd;\nIf for a friend the King of all we own'd,\nOur pray'r to him should for thy peace arise,\nSince thou hast pity on our evil plight.\n()f whatsoe'er to hear or to discourse\nIt pleases thee, that will we hear, of that\nFreely with thee discourse, while e'er the wind,\nAs now, is mute.  The land, that gave me birth,\nIs situate on the coast, where Po descends\nTo rest in ocean with his sequent streams.\n\n\"Love, that in gentle heart is quickly learnt,\nEntangled him by that fair form, from me\nTa'en in such cruel sort, as grieves me still:\nLove, that denial takes from none belov'd,\nCaught me with pleasing him so passing well,\nThat, as thou see'st, he yet deserts me not.\n\n\"Love brought us to one death: Caina waits\nThe soul, who spilt our life.\"  Such were their words;\nAt hearing which downward I bent my looks,\nAnd held them there so long, that the bard cried:\n\"What art thou pond'ring?\"  I in answer thus:\n\"Alas! by what sweet thoughts, what fond desire\nMust they at length to that ill pass have reach'd!\"\n\nThen turning, I to them my speech address'd.\nAnd thus began: \"Francesca! your sad fate\nEven to tears my grief and pity moves.\nBut tell me; in the time of your sweet sighs,\nBy what, and how love granted, that ye knew\nYour yet uncertain wishes?\"  She replied:\n\"No greater grief than to remember days\nOf joy, when mis'ry is at hand!  That kens\nThy learn'd instructor.  Yet so eagerly\nIf thou art bent to know the primal root,\nFrom whence our love gat being, I will do,\nAs one, who weeps and tells his tale.  One day\nFor our delight we read of Lancelot,\nHow him love thrall'd.  Alone we were, and no\nSuspicion near us.  Ofttimes by that reading\nOur eyes were drawn together, and the hue\nFled from our alter'd cheek.  But at one point\nAlone we fell.  When of that smile we read,\nThe wished smile, rapturously kiss'd\nBy one so deep in love, then he, who ne'er\nFrom me shall separate, at once my lips\nAll trembling kiss'd.  The book and writer both\nWere love's purveyors.  In its leaves that day\nWe read no more.\"  While thus one spirit spake,\nThe other wail'd so sorely, that heartstruck\nI through compassion fainting, seem'd not far\nFrom death, and like a corpse fell to the ground.\n\nCANTO VI\n\nMY sense reviving, that erewhile had droop'd\nWith pity for the kindred shades, whence grief\nO'ercame me wholly, straight around I see\nNew torments, new tormented souls, which way\nSoe'er I move, or turn, or bend my sight.\nIn the third circle I arrive, of show'rs\nCeaseless, accursed, heavy, and cold, unchang'd\nFor ever, both in kind and in degree.\nLarge hail, discolour'd water, sleety flaw\nThrough the dun midnight air stream'd down amain:\nStank all the land whereon that tempest fell.\n\nCerberus, cruel monster, fierce and strange,\nThrough his wide threefold throat barks as a dog\nOver the multitude immers'd beneath.\nHis eyes glare crimson, black his unctuous beard,\nHis belly large, and claw'd the hands, with which\nHe tears the spirits, flays them, and their limbs\nPiecemeal disparts.  Howling there spread, as curs,\nUnder the rainy deluge, with one side\nThe other screening, oft they roll them round,\nA wretched, godless crew.  When that great worm\nDescried us, savage Cerberus, he op'd\nHis jaws, and the fangs show'd us; not a limb\nOf him but trembled.  Then my guide, his palms\nExpanding on the ground, thence filled with earth\nRais'd them, and cast it in his ravenous maw.\n\nE'en as a dog, that yelling bays for food\nHis keeper, when the morsel comes, lets fall\nHis fury, bent alone with eager haste\nTo swallow it; so dropp'd the loathsome cheeks\nOf demon Cerberus, who thund'ring stuns\nThe spirits, that they for deafness wish in vain.\n\nWe, o'er the shades thrown prostrate by the brunt\nOf the heavy tempest passing, set our feet\nUpon their emptiness, that substance seem'd.\n\nThey all along the earth extended lay\nSave one, that sudden rais'd himself to sit,\nSoon as that way he saw us pass.  \"O thou!\"\nHe cried, \"who through the infernal shades art led,\nOwn, if again thou know'st me.  Thou wast fram'd\nOr ere my frame was broken.\"  I replied:\n\"The anguish thou endur'st perchance so takes\nThy form from my remembrance, that it seems\nAs if I saw thee never.  But inform\nMe who thou art, that in a place so sad\nArt set, and in such torment, that although\nOther be greater, more disgustful none\nCan be imagin'd.\"  He in answer thus:\n\n\"Thy city heap'd with envy to the brim,\nAy that the measure overflows its bounds,\nHeld me in brighter days.  Ye citizens\nWere wont to name me Ciacco.  For the sin\nOf glutt'ny, damned vice, beneath this rain,\nE'en as thou see'st, I with fatigue am worn;\nNor I sole spirit in this woe: all these\nHave by like crime incurr'd like punishment.\"\n\nNo more he said, and I my speech resum'd:\n\"Ciacco! thy dire affliction grieves me much,\nEven to tears.  But tell me, if thou know'st,\nWhat shall at length befall the citizens\nOf the divided city; whether any just one\nInhabit there: and tell me of the cause,\nWhence jarring discord hath assail'd it thus?\"\n\nHe then: \"After long striving they will come\nTo blood; and the wild party from the woods\nWill chase the other with much injury forth.\nThen it behoves, that this must fall, within\nThree solar circles; and the other rise\nBy borrow'd force of one, who under shore\nNow rests.  It shall a long space hold aloof\nIts forehead, keeping under heavy weight\nThe other oppress'd, indignant at the load,\nAnd grieving sore.  The just are two in number,\nBut they neglected.  Av'rice, envy, pride,\nThree fatal sparks, have set the hearts of all\nOn fire.\"  Here ceas'd the lamentable sound;\nAnd I continu'd thus: \"Still would I learn\nMore from thee, farther parley still entreat.\nOf Farinata and Tegghiaio say,\nThey who so well deserv'd, of Giacopo,\nArrigo, Mosca, and the rest, who bent\nTheir minds on working good.  Oh! tell me where\nThey bide, and to their knowledge let me come.\nFor I am press'd with keen desire to hear,\nIf heaven's sweet cup or poisonous drug of hell\nBe to their lip assign'd.\"   He answer'd straight:\n\"These are yet blacker spirits.  Various crimes\nHave sunk them deeper in the dark abyss.\nIf thou so far descendest, thou mayst see them.\nBut to the pleasant world when thou return'st,\nOf me make mention, I entreat thee, there.\nNo more I tell thee, answer thee no more.\"\n\nThis said, his fixed eyes he turn'd askance,\nA little ey'd me, then bent down his head,\nAnd'midst his blind companions with it fell.\n\nWhen thus my guide: \"No more his bed he leaves,\nEre the last angel-trumpet blow.  The Power\nAdverse to these shall then in glory come,\nEach one forthwith to his sad tomb repair,\nResume his fleshly vesture and his form,\nAnd hear the eternal doom re-echoing rend\nThe vault.\"  So pass'd we through that mixture foul\nOf spirits and rain, with tardy steps; meanwhile\nTouching, though slightly, on the life to come.\nFor thus I question'd: \"Shall these tortures, Sir!\nWhen the great sentence passes, be increas'd,\nOr mitigated, or as now severe?\"\n\nHe then: \"Consult thy knowledge; that decides\nThat as each thing to more perfection grows,\nIt feels more sensibly both good and pain.\nThough ne'er to true perfection may arrive\nThis race accurs'd, yet nearer then than now\nThey shall approach it.\"  Compassing that path\nCircuitous we journeyed, and discourse\nMuch more than I relate between us pass'd:\nTill at the point, where the steps led below,\nArriv'd, there Plutus, the great foe, we found.\n\n\n\n\nCANTO VII\n\n\"AH me!  O Satan!  Satan!\" loud exclaim'd\nPlutus, in accent hoarse of wild alarm:\nAnd the kind sage, whom no event surpris'd,\nTo comfort me thus spake: \"Let not thy fear\nHarm thee, for power in him, be sure, is none\nTo hinder down this rock thy safe descent.\"\nThen to that sworn lip turning, \"Peace!\"  he cried,\n\n\"Curs'd wolf! thy fury inward on thyself\nPrey, and consume thee!  Through the dark profound\nNot without cause he passes.  So 't is will'd\nOn high, there where the great Archangel pour'd\nHeav'n's vengeance on the first adulterer proud.\"\n\nAs sails full spread and bellying with the wind\nDrop suddenly collaps'd, if the mast split;\nSo to the ground down dropp'd the cruel fiend.\n\nThus we, descending to the fourth steep ledge,\nGain'd on the dismal shore, that all the woe\nHems in of all the universe.  Ah me!\nAlmighty Justice! in what store thou heap'st\nNew pains, new troubles, as I here beheld!\nWherefore doth fault of ours bring us to this?\n\nE'en as a billow, on Charybdis rising,\nAgainst encounter'd billow dashing breaks;\nSuch is the dance this wretched race must lead,\nWhom more than elsewhere numerous here I found,\nFrom one side and the other, with loud voice,\nBoth roll'd on weights by main forge of their breasts,\nThen smote together, and each one forthwith\nRoll'd them back voluble, turning again,\nExclaiming these, \"Why holdest thou so fast?\"\nThose answering, \"And why castest thou away?\"\nSo still repeating their despiteful song,\nThey to the opposite point on either hand\nTravers'd the horrid circle: then arriv'd,\nBoth turn'd them round, and through the middle space\nConflicting met again.  At sight whereof\nI, stung with grief, thus spake: \"O say, my guide!\nWhat race is this?  Were these, whose heads are shorn,\nOn our left hand, all sep'rate to the church?\"\n\nHe straight replied: \"In their first life these all\nIn mind were so distorted, that they made,\nAccording to due measure, of their wealth,\nNo use.  This clearly from their words collect,\nWhich they howl forth, at each extremity\nArriving of the circle, where their crime\nContrary' in kind disparts them.  To the church\nWere separate those, that with no hairy cowls\nAre crown'd, both Popes and Cardinals, o'er whom\nAv'rice dominion absolute maintains.\"\n\nI then: \"Mid such as these some needs must be,\nWhom I shall recognize, that with the blot\nOf these foul sins were stain'd.\"  He answering thus:\n\"Vain thought conceiv'st thou.  That ignoble life,\nWhich made them vile before, now makes them dark,\nAnd to all knowledge indiscernible.\nForever they shall meet in this rude shock:\nThese from the tomb with clenched grasp shall rise,\nThose with close-shaven locks.  That ill they gave,\nAnd ill they kept, hath of the beauteous world\nDepriv'd, and set them at this strife, which needs\nNo labour'd phrase of mine to set if off.\nNow may'st thou see, my son! how brief, how vain,\nThe goods committed into fortune's hands,\nFor which the human race keep such a coil!\nNot all the gold, that is beneath the moon,\nOr ever hath been, of these toil-worn souls\nMight purchase rest for one.\"  I thus rejoin'd:\n\n\"My guide! of thee this also would I learn;\nThis fortune, that thou speak'st of, what it is,\nWhose talons grasp the blessings of the world?\"\n\nHe thus: \"O beings blind! what ignorance\nBesets you?  Now my judgment hear and mark.\nHe, whose transcendent wisdom passes all,\nThe heavens creating, gave them ruling powers\nTo guide them, so that each part shines to each,\nTheir light in equal distribution pour'd.\nBy similar appointment he ordain'd\nOver the world's bright images to rule.\nSuperintendence of a guiding hand\nAnd general minister, which at due time\nMay change the empty vantages of life\nFrom race to race, from one to other's blood,\nBeyond prevention of man's wisest care:\nWherefore one nation rises into sway,\nAnother languishes, e'en as her will\nDecrees, from us conceal'd, as in the grass\nThe serpent train.  Against her nought avails\nYour utmost wisdom.  She with foresight plans,\nJudges, and carries on her reign, as theirs\nThe other powers divine.  Her changes know\nNore intermission: by necessity\nShe is made swift, so frequent come who claim\nSuccession in her favours.  This is she,\nSo execrated e'en by those, whose debt\nTo her is rather praise; they wrongfully\nWith blame requite her, and with evil word;\nBut she is blessed, and for that recks not:\nAmidst the other primal beings glad\nRolls on her sphere, and in her bliss exults.\nNow on our way pass we, to heavier woe\nDescending: for each star is falling now,\nThat mounted at our entrance, and forbids\nToo long our tarrying.\"  We the circle cross'd\nTo the next steep, arriving at a well,\nThat boiling pours itself down to a foss\nSluic'd from its source.  Far murkier was the wave\nThan sablest grain: and we in company\nOf the' inky waters, journeying by their side,\nEnter'd, though by a different track, beneath.\nInto a lake, the Stygian nam'd, expands\nThe dismal stream, when it hath reach'd the foot\nOf the grey wither'd cliffs.  Intent I stood\nTo gaze, and in the marish sunk descried\nA miry tribe, all naked, and with looks\nBetok'ning rage.  They with their hands alone\nStruck not, but with the head, the breast, the feet,\nCutting each other piecemeal with their fangs.\n\nThe good instructor spake; \"Now seest thou, son!\nThe souls of those, whom anger overcame.\nThis too for certain know, that underneath\nThe water dwells a multitude, whose sighs\nInto these bubbles make the surface heave,\nAs thine eye tells thee wheresoe'er it turn.\"\nFix'd in the slime they say: \"Sad once were we\nIn the sweet air made gladsome by the sun,\nCarrying a foul and lazy mist within:\nNow in these murky settlings are we sad.\"\nSuch dolorous strain they gurgle in their throats.\nBut word distinct can utter none.\"  Our route\nThus compass'd we, a segment widely stretch'd\nBetween the dry embankment, and the core\nOf the loath'd pool, turning meanwhile our eyes\nDownward on those who gulp'd its muddy lees;\nNor stopp'd, till to a tower's low base we came.\n\n\n\n\nCANTO VIII\n\nMY theme pursuing, I relate that ere\nWe reach'd the lofty turret's base, our eyes\nIts height ascended, where two cressets hung\nWe mark'd, and from afar another light\nReturn the signal, so remote, that scarce\nThe eye could catch its beam.  I turning round\nTo the deep source of knowledge, thus inquir'd:\n\"Say what this means?  and what that other light\nIn answer set?  what agency doth this?\"\n\n\"There on the filthy waters,\" he replied,\n\"E'en now what next awaits us mayst thou see,\nIf the marsh-gender'd fog conceal it not.\"\n\nNever was arrow from the cord dismiss'd,\nThat ran its way so nimbly through the air,\nAs a small bark, that through the waves I spied\nToward us coming, under the sole sway\nOf one that ferried it, who cried aloud:\n\"Art thou arriv'd, fell spirit?\"--\"Phlegyas, Phlegyas,\nThis time thou criest in vain,\" my lord replied;\n\"No longer shalt thou have us, but while o'er\nThe slimy pool we pass.\"  As one who hears\nOf some great wrong he hath sustain'd, whereat\nInly he pines; so Phlegyas inly pin'd\nIn his fierce ire.  My guide descending stepp'd\nInto the skiff, and bade me enter next\nClose at his side; nor till my entrance seem'd\nThe vessel freighted.  Soon as both embark'd,\nCutting the waves, goes on the ancient prow,\nMore deeply than with others it is wont.\n\nWhile we our course o'er the dead channel held.\nOne drench'd in mire before me came, and said;\n\"Who art thou, that thou comest ere thine hour?\"\n\nI answer'd: \"Though I come, I tarry not;\nBut who art thou, that art become so foul?\"\n\n\"One, as thou seest, who mourn:\" he straight replied.\n\nTo which I thus: \"In mourning and in woe,\nCurs'd spirit! tarry thou.g I know thee well,\nE'en thus in filth disguis'd.\"  Then stretch'd he forth\nHands to the bark; whereof my teacher sage\nAware, thrusting him back: \"Away! down there;\n\n\"To the' other dogs!\" then, with his arms my neck\nEncircling, kiss'd my cheek, and spake: \"O soul\nJustly disdainful! blest was she in whom\nThou was conceiv'd!  He in the world was one\nFor arrogance noted; to his memory\nNo virtue lends its lustre; even so\nHere is his shadow furious.  There above\nHow many now hold themselves mighty kings\nWho here like swine shall wallow in the mire,\nLeaving behind them horrible dispraise!\"\n\nI then: \"Master! him fain would I behold\nWhelm'd in these dregs, before we quit the lake.\"\n\nHe thus: \"Or ever to thy view the shore\nBe offer'd, satisfied shall be that wish,\nWhich well deserves completion.\"  Scarce his words\nWere ended, when I saw the miry tribes\nSet on him with such violence, that yet\nFor that render I thanks to God and praise\n\"To Filippo Argenti:\" cried they all:\nAnd on himself the moody Florentine\nTurn'd his avenging fangs.  Him here we left,\nNor speak I of him more.  But on mine ear\nSudden a sound of lamentation smote,\nWhereat mine eye unbarr'd I sent abroad.\n\nAnd thus the good instructor: \"Now, my son!\nDraws near the city, that of Dis is nam'd,\nWith its grave denizens, a mighty throng.\"\n\nI thus: \"The minarets already, Sir!\nThere certes in the valley I descry,\nGleaming vermilion, as if they from fire\nHad issu'd.\"  He replied: \"Eternal fire,\nThat inward burns, shows them with ruddy flame\nIllum'd; as in this nether hell thou seest.\"\n\nWe came within the fosses deep, that moat\nThis region comfortless.  The walls appear'd\nAs they were fram'd of iron.  We had made\nWide circuit, ere a place we reach'd, where loud\nThe mariner cried vehement: \"Go forth!\nThe' entrance is here!\"  Upon the gates I spied\nMore than a thousand, who of old from heaven\nWere hurl'd.  With ireful gestures, \"Who is this,\"\nThey cried, \"that without death first felt, goes through\nThe regions of the dead?\"  My sapient guide\nMade sign that he for secret parley wish'd;\nWhereat their angry scorn abating, thus\nThey spake: \"Come thou alone; and let him go\nWho hath so hardily enter'd this realm.\nAlone return he by his witless way;\nIf well he know it, let him prove.  For thee,\nHere shalt thou tarry, who through clime so dark\nHast been his escort.\" Now bethink thee, reader!\nWhat cheer was mine at sound of those curs'd words.\nI did believe I never should return.\n\n\"O my lov'd guide! who more than seven times\nSecurity hast render'd me, and drawn\nFrom peril deep, whereto I stood expos'd,\nDesert me not,\" I cried, \"in this extreme.\nAnd if our onward going be denied,\nTogether trace we back our steps with speed.\"\n\nMy liege, who thither had conducted me,\nReplied: \"Fear not: for of our passage none\nHath power to disappoint us, by such high\nAuthority permitted.  But do thou\nExpect me here; meanwhile thy wearied spirit\nComfort, and feed with kindly hope, assur'd\nI will not leave thee in this lower world.\"\n\nThis said, departs the sire benevolent,\nAnd quits me.  Hesitating I remain\nAt war 'twixt will and will not in my thoughts.\n\nI could not hear what terms he offer'd them,\nBut they conferr'd not long, for all at once\nTo trial fled within.  Clos'd were the gates\nBy those our adversaries on the breast\nOf my liege lord: excluded he return'd\nTo me with tardy steps.  Upon the ground\nHis eyes were bent, and from his brow eras'd\nAll confidence, while thus with sighs he spake:\n\"Who hath denied me these abodes of woe?\"\nThen thus to me: \"That I am anger'd, think\nNo ground of terror: in this trial I\nShall vanquish, use what arts they may within\nFor hindrance.  This their insolence, not new,\nErewhile at gate less secret they display'd,\nWhich still is without bolt; upon its arch\nThou saw'st the deadly scroll: and even now\nOn this side of its entrance, down the steep,\nPassing the circles, unescorted, comes\nOne whose strong might can open us this land.\"\n\n\n\n\nCANTO IX\n\nTHE hue, which coward dread on my pale cheeks\nImprinted, when I saw my guide turn back,\nChas'd that from his which newly they had worn,\nAnd inwardly restrain'd it.  He, as one\nWho listens, stood attentive: for his eye\nNot far could lead him through the sable air,\nAnd the thick-gath'ring cloud.  \"It yet behooves\nWe win this fight\"--thus he began--\"if not--\nSuch aid to us is offer'd.--Oh, how long\nMe seems it, ere the promis'd help arrive!\"\n\nI noted, how the sequel of his words\nClok'd their beginning; for the last he spake\nAgreed not with the first.  But not the less\nMy fear was at his saying; sith I drew\nTo import worse perchance, than that he held,\nHis mutilated speech.  \"Doth ever any\nInto this rueful concave's extreme depth\nDescend, out of the first degree, whose pain\nIs deprivation merely of sweet hope?\"\n\nThus I inquiring. \"Rarely,\" he replied,\n\"It chances, that among us any makes\nThis journey, which I wend.  Erewhile 'tis true\nOnce came I here beneath, conjur'd by fell\nErictho, sorceress, who compell'd the shades\nBack to their bodies.  No long space my flesh\nWas naked of me, when within these walls\nShe made me enter, to draw forth a spirit\nFrom out of Judas' circle.  Lowest place\nIs that of all, obscurest, and remov'd\nFarthest from heav'n's all-circling orb.  The road\nFull well I know: thou therefore rest secure.\nThat lake, the noisome stench exhaling, round\nThe city' of grief encompasses, which now\nWe may not enter without rage.\"  Yet more\nHe added: but I hold it not in mind,\nFor that mine eye toward the lofty tower\nHad drawn me wholly, to its burning top.\nWhere in an instant I beheld uprisen\nAt once three hellish furies stain'd with blood:\nIn limb and motion feminine they seem'd;\nAround them greenest hydras twisting roll'd\nTheir volumes; adders and cerastes crept\nInstead of hair, and their fierce temples bound.\n\nHe knowing well the miserable hags\nWho tend the queen of endless woe, thus spake:\n\n\"Mark thou each dire Erinnys. To the left\nThis is Megaera; on the right hand she,\nWho wails, Alecto; and Tisiphone\nI' th' midst.\"  This said, in silence he remain'd\nTheir breast they each one clawing tore; themselves\nSmote with their palms, and such shrill clamour rais'd,\nThat to the bard I clung, suspicion-bound.\n\"Hasten Medusa: so to adamant\nHim shall we change;\" all looking down exclaim'd.\n\"E'en when by Theseus' might assail'd, we took\nNo ill revenge.\"  \"Turn thyself round, and keep\nThy count'nance hid; for if the Gorgon dire\nBe shown, and thou shouldst view it, thy return\nUpwards would be for ever lost.\"  This said,\nHimself my gentle master turn'd me round,\nNor trusted he my hands, but with his own\nHe also hid me.  Ye of intellect\nSound and entire, mark well the lore conceal'd\nUnder close texture of the mystic strain!\n\nAnd now there came o'er the perturbed waves\nLoud-crashing, terrible, a sound that made\nEither shore tremble, as if of a wind\nImpetuous, from conflicting vapours sprung,\nThat 'gainst some forest driving all its might,\nPlucks off the branches, beats them down and hurls\nAfar; then onward passing proudly sweeps\nIts whirlwind rage, while beasts and shepherds fly.\n\nMine eyes he loos'd, and spake: \"And now direct\nThy visual nerve along that ancient foam,\nThere, thickest where the smoke ascends.\" As frogs\nBefore their foe the serpent, through the wave\nPly swiftly all, till at the ground each one\nLies on a heap; more than a thousand spirits\nDestroy'd, so saw I fleeing before one\nWho pass'd with unwet feet the Stygian sound.\nHe, from his face removing the gross air,\nOft his left hand forth stretch'd, and seem'd alone\nBy that annoyance wearied.  I perceiv'd\nThat he was sent from heav'n, and to my guide\nTurn'd me, who signal made that I should stand\nQuiet, and bend to him. Ah me! how full\nOf noble anger seem'd he!  To the gate\nHe came, and with his wand touch'd it, whereat\nOpen without impediment it flew.\n\n\"Outcasts of heav'n!  O abject race and scorn'd!\"\nBegan he on the horrid grunsel standing,\n\"Whence doth this wild excess of insolence\nLodge in you? wherefore kick you 'gainst that will\nNe'er frustrate of its end, and which so oft\nHath laid on you enforcement of your pangs?\nWhat profits at the fays to but the horn?\nYour Cerberus, if ye remember, hence\nBears still, peel'd of their hair, his throat and maw.\"\n\nThis said, he turn'd back o'er the filthy way,\nAnd syllable to us spake none, but wore\nThe semblance of a man by other care\nBeset, and keenly press'd, than thought of him\nWho in his presence stands.  Then we our steps\nToward that territory mov'd, secure\nAfter the hallow'd words.  We unoppos'd\nThere enter'd; and my mind eager to learn\nWhat state a fortress like to that might hold,\nI soon as enter'd throw mine eye around,\nAnd see on every part wide-stretching space\nReplete with bitter pain and torment ill.\n\nAs where Rhone stagnates on the plains of Arles,\nOr as at Pola, near Quarnaro's gulf,\nThat closes Italy and laves her bounds,\nThe place is all thick spread with sepulchres;\nSo was it here, save what in horror here\nExcell'd: for'midst the graves were scattered flames,\nWherewith intensely all throughout they burn'd,\nThat iron for no craft there hotter needs.\n\nTheir lids all hung suspended, and beneath\nFrom them forth issu'd lamentable moans,\nSuch as the sad and tortur'd well might raise.\n\nI thus: \"Master! say who are these, interr'd\nWithin these vaults, of whom distinct we hear\nThe dolorous sighs?\"  He answer thus return'd:\n\n\"The arch-heretics are here, accompanied\nBy every sect their followers; and much more,\nThan thou believest, tombs are freighted: like\nWith like is buried; and the monuments\nAre different in degrees of heat.\"  This said,\nHe to the right hand turning, on we pass'd\nBetwixt the afflicted and the ramparts high.\n\n\n\n\nCANTO X\n\nNOW by a secret pathway we proceed,\nBetween the walls, that hem the region round,\nAnd the tormented souls: my master first,\nI close behind his steps.  \"Virtue supreme!\"\nI thus began; \"who through these ample orbs\nIn circuit lead'st me, even as thou will'st,\nSpeak thou, and satisfy my wish.  May those,\nWho lie within these sepulchres, be seen?\nAlready all the lids are rais'd, and none\nO'er them keeps watch.\"  He thus in answer spake\n\"They shall be closed all, what-time they here\nFrom Josaphat return'd shall come, and bring\nTheir bodies, which above they now have left.\nThe cemetery on this part obtain\nWith Epicurus all his followers,\nWho with the body make the spirit die.\nHere therefore satisfaction shall be soon\nBoth to the question ask'd, and to the wish,\nWhich thou conceal'st in silence.\"  I replied:\n\"I keep not, guide belov'd! from thee my heart\nSecreted, but to shun vain length of words,\nA lesson erewhile taught me by thyself.\"\n\n\"O Tuscan! thou who through the city of fire\nAlive art passing, so discreet of speech!\nHere please thee stay awhile. Thy utterance\nDeclares the place of thy nativity\nTo be that noble land, with which perchance\nI too severely dealt.\"  Sudden that sound\nForth issu'd from a vault, whereat in fear\nI somewhat closer to my leader's side\nApproaching, he thus spake: \"What dost thou?  Turn.\nLo, Farinata, there! who hath himself\nUplifted: from his girdle upwards all\nExpos'd behold him.\"  On his face was mine\nAlready fix'd; his breast and forehead there\nErecting, seem'd as in high scorn he held\nE'en hell.  Between the sepulchres to him\nMy guide thrust me with fearless hands and prompt,\nThis warning added: \"See thy words be clear!\"\n\nHe, soon as there I stood at the tomb's foot,\nEy'd me a space, then in disdainful mood\nAddress'd me: \"Say, what ancestors were thine?\"\n\nI, willing to obey him, straight reveal'd\nThe whole, nor kept back aught: whence he, his brow\nSomewhat uplifting, cried: \"Fiercely were they\nAdverse to me, my party, and the blood\nFrom whence I sprang: twice therefore I abroad\nScatter'd them.\"  \"Though driv'n out, yet they each time\nFrom all parts,\" answer'd I, \"return'd; an art\nWhich yours have shown, they are not skill'd to learn.\"\n\nThen, peering forth from the unclosed jaw,\nRose from his side a shade, high as the chin,\nLeaning, methought, upon its knees uprais'd.\nIt look'd around, as eager to explore\nIf there were other with me; but perceiving\nThat fond imagination quench'd, with tears\nThus spake: \"If thou through this blind prison go'st.\nLed by thy lofty genius and profound,\nWhere is my son? and wherefore not with thee?\"\n\nI straight replied: \"Not of myself I come,\nBy him, who there expects me, through this clime\nConducted, whom perchance Guido thy son\nHad in contempt.\"  Already had his words\nAnd mode of punishment read me his name,\nWhence I so fully answer'd.  He at once\nExclaim'd, up starting, \"How! said'st thou he HAD?\nNo longer lives he?  Strikes not on his eye\nThe blessed daylight?\"  Then of some delay\nI made ere my reply aware, down fell\nSupine, not after forth appear'd he more.\n\nMeanwhile the other, great of soul, near whom\nI yet was station'd, chang'd not count'nance stern,\nNor mov'd the neck, nor bent his ribbed side.\n\"And if,\" continuing the first discourse,\n\"They in this art,\" he cried, \"small skill have shown,\nThat doth torment me more e'en than this bed.\nBut not yet fifty times shall be relum'd\nHer aspect, who reigns here Queen of this realm,\nEre thou shalt know the full weight of that art.\nSo to the pleasant world mayst thou return,\nAs thou shalt tell me, why in all their laws,\nAgainst my kin this people is so fell?\"\n\n\"The slaughter and great havoc,\" I replied,\n\"That colour'd Arbia's flood with crimson stain--\nTo these impute, that in our hallow'd dome\nSuch orisons ascend.\"  Sighing he shook\nThe head, then thus resum'd: \"In that affray\nI stood not singly, nor without just cause\nAssuredly should with the rest have stirr'd;\nBut singly there I stood, when by consent\nOf all, Florence had to the ground been raz'd,\nThe one who openly forbad the deed.\"\n\n\"So may thy lineage find at last repose,\"\nI thus adjur'd him, \"as thou solve this knot,\nWhich now involves my mind.  If right I hear,\nYe seem to view beforehand, that which time\nLeads with him, of the present uninform'd.\"\n\n\"We view, as one who hath an evil sight,\"\nHe answer'd, \"plainly, objects far remote:\nSo much of his large spendour yet imparts\nThe' Almighty Ruler; but when they approach\nOr actually exist, our intellect\nThen wholly fails, nor of your human state\nExcept what others bring us know we aught.\nHence therefore mayst thou understand, that all\nOur knowledge in that instant shall expire,\nWhen on futurity the portals close.\"\n\nThen conscious of my fault, and by remorse\nSmitten, I added thus: \"Now shalt thou say\nTo him there fallen, that his offspring still\nIs to the living join'd; and bid him know,\nThat if from answer silent I abstain'd,\n'Twas that my thought was occupied intent\nUpon that error, which thy help hath solv'd.\"\n\nBut now my master summoning me back\nI heard, and with more eager haste besought\nThe spirit to inform me, who with him\nPartook his lot.  He answer thus return'd:\n\n\"More than a thousand with me here are laid\nWithin is Frederick, second of that name,\nAnd the Lord Cardinal, and of the rest\nI speak not.\"  He, this said, from sight withdrew.\nBut I my steps towards the ancient bard\nReverting, ruminated on the words\nBetokening me such ill.  Onward he mov'd,\nAnd thus in going question'd: \"Whence the' amaze\nThat holds thy senses wrapt?\"  I satisfied\nThe' inquiry, and the sage enjoin'd me straight:\n\"Let thy safe memory store what thou hast heard\nTo thee importing harm; and note thou this,\"\nWith his rais'd finger bidding me take heed,\n\n\"When thou shalt stand before her gracious beam,\nWhose bright eye all surveys, she of thy life\nThe future tenour will to thee unfold.\"\n\nForthwith he to the left hand turn'd his feet:\nWe left the wall, and tow'rds the middle space\nWent by a path, that to a valley strikes;\nWhich e'en thus high exhal'd its noisome steam.\n\n\n\n\nCANTO XI\n\nUPON the utmost verge of a high bank,\nBy craggy rocks environ'd round, we came,\nWhere woes beneath more cruel yet were stow'd:\nAnd here to shun the horrible excess\nOf fetid exhalation, upward cast\nFrom the profound abyss, behind the lid\nOf a great monument we stood retir'd,\n\nWhereon this scroll I mark'd: \"I have in charge\nPope Anastasius, whom Photinus drew\nFrom the right path.--Ere our descent behooves\nWe make delay, that somewhat first the sense,\nTo the dire breath accustom'd, afterward\nRegard it not.\"  My master thus; to whom\nAnswering I spake: \"Some compensation find\nThat the time past not wholly lost.\"  He then:\n\"Lo! how my thoughts e'en to thy wishes tend!\nMy son! within these rocks,\" he thus began,\n\"Are three close circles in gradation plac'd,\nAs these which now thou leav'st. Each one is full\nOf spirits accurs'd; but that the sight alone\nHereafter may suffice thee, listen how\nAnd for what cause in durance they abide.\n\n\"Of all malicious act abhorr'd in heaven,\nThe end is injury; and all such end\nEither by force or fraud works other's woe\nBut fraud, because of man peculiar evil,\nTo God is more displeasing; and beneath\nThe fraudulent are therefore doom'd to' endure\nSeverer pang.  The violent occupy\nAll the first circle; and because to force\nThree persons are obnoxious, in three rounds\nHach within other sep'rate is it fram'd.\nTo God, his neighbour, and himself, by man\nForce may be offer'd; to himself I say\nAnd his possessions, as thou soon shalt hear\nAt full.  Death, violent death, and painful wounds\nUpon his neighbour he inflicts; and wastes\nBy devastation, pillage, and the flames,\nHis substance.  Slayers, and each one that smites\nIn malice, plund'rers, and all robbers, hence\nThe torment undergo of the first round\nIn different herds.  Man can do violence\nTo himself and his own blessings: and for this\nHe in the second round must aye deplore\nWith unavailing penitence his crime,\nWhoe'er deprives himself of life and light,\nIn reckless lavishment his talent wastes,\nAnd sorrows there where he should dwell in joy.\nTo God may force be offer'd, in the heart\nDenying and blaspheming his high power,\nAnd nature with her kindly law contemning.\nAnd thence the inmost round marks with its seal\nSodom and Cahors, and all such as speak\nContemptuously' of the Godhead in their hearts.\n\n\"Fraud, that in every conscience leaves a sting,\nMay be by man employ'd on one, whose trust\nHe wins, or on another who withholds\nStrict confidence.  Seems as the latter way\nBroke but the bond of love which Nature makes.\nWhence in the second circle have their nest\nDissimulation, witchcraft, flatteries,\nTheft, falsehood, simony, all who seduce\nTo lust, or set their honesty at pawn,\nWith such vile scum as these.  The other way\nForgets both Nature's general love, and that\nWhich thereto added afterwards gives birth\nTo special faith.  Whence in the lesser circle,\nPoint of the universe, dread seat of Dis,\nThe traitor is eternally consum'd.\"\n\nI thus: \"Instructor, clearly thy discourse\nProceeds, distinguishing the hideous chasm\nAnd its inhabitants with skill exact.\nBut tell me this: they of the dull, fat pool,\nWhom the rain beats, or whom the tempest drives,\nOr who with tongues so fierce conflicting meet,\nWherefore within the city fire-illum'd\nAre not these punish'd, if God's wrath be on them?\nAnd if it be not, wherefore in such guise\nAre they condemned?\"  He answer thus return'd:\n\"Wherefore in dotage wanders thus thy mind,\nNot so accustom'd? or what other thoughts\nPossess it?  Dwell not in thy memory\nThe words, wherein thy ethic page describes\nThree dispositions adverse to Heav'n's will,\nIncont'nence, malice, and mad brutishness,\nAnd how incontinence the least offends\nGod, and least guilt incurs?  If well thou note\nThis judgment, and remember who they are,\nWithout these walls to vain repentance doom'd,\nThou shalt discern why they apart are plac'd\nFrom these fell spirits, and less wreakful pours\nJustice divine on them its vengeance down.\"\n\n\"O Sun! who healest all imperfect sight,\nThou so content'st me, when thou solv'st my doubt,\nThat ignorance not less than knowledge charms.\nYet somewhat turn thee back,\" I in these words\nContinu'd, \"where thou saidst, that usury\nOffends celestial Goodness; and this knot\nPerplex'd unravel.\"  He thus made reply:\n\"Philosophy, to an attentive ear,\nClearly points out, not in one part alone,\nHow imitative nature takes her course\nFrom the celestial mind and from its art:\nAnd where her laws the Stagyrite unfolds,\nNot many leaves scann'd o'er, observing well\nThou shalt discover, that your art on her\nObsequious follows, as the learner treads\nIn his instructor's step, so that your art\nDeserves the name of second in descent\nFrom God.  These two, if thou recall to mind\nCreation's holy book, from the beginning\nWere the right source of life and excellence\nTo human kind.  But in another path\nThe usurer walks; and Nature in herself\nAnd in her follower thus he sets at nought,\nPlacing elsewhere his hope.  But follow now\nMy steps on forward journey bent; for now\nThe Pisces play with undulating glance\nAlong the' horizon, and the Wain lies all\nO'er the north-west; and onward there a space\nIs our steep passage down the rocky height.\"\n\n\n\n\nCANTO XII\n\nTHE place where to descend the precipice\nWe came, was rough as Alp, and on its verge\nSuch object lay, as every eye would shun.\n\nAs is that ruin, which Adice's stream\nOn this side Trento struck, should'ring the wave,\nOr loos'd by earthquake or for lack of prop;\nFor from the mountain's summit, whence it mov'd\nTo the low level, so the headlong rock\nIs shiver'd, that some passage it might give\nTo him who from above would pass; e'en such\nInto the chasm was that descent: and there\nAt point of the disparted ridge lay stretch'd\nThe infamy of Crete, detested brood\nOf the feign'd heifer: and at sight of us\nIt gnaw'd itself, as one with rage distract.\n\nTo him my guide exclaim'd: \"Perchance thou deem'st\nThe King of Athens here, who, in the world\nAbove, thy death contriv'd.  Monster! avaunt!\nHe comes not tutor'd by thy sister's art,\nBut to behold your torments is he come.\"\n\nLike to a bull, that with impetuous spring\nDarts, at the moment when the fatal blow\nHath struck him, but unable to proceed\nPlunges on either side; so saw I plunge\nThe Minotaur; whereat the sage exclaim'd:\n\"Run to the passage! while he storms, 't is well\nThat thou descend.\"  Thus down our road we took\nThrough those dilapidated crags, that oft\nMov'd underneath my feet, to weight like theirs\nUnus'd.  I pond'ring went, and thus he spake:\n\n\"Perhaps thy thoughts are of this ruin'd steep,\nGuarded by the brute violence, which I\nHave vanquish'd now. Know then, that when I erst\nHither descended to the nether hell,\nThis rock was not yet fallen.  But past doubt\n(If well I mark) not long ere He arrived,\nWho carried off from Dis the mighty spoil\nOf the highest circle, then through all its bounds\nSuch trembling seiz'd the deep concave and foul,\nI thought the universe was thrill'd with love,\nWhereby, there are who deem, the world hath oft\nBeen into chaos turn'd: and in that point,\nHere, and elsewhere, that old rock toppled down.\nBut fix thine eyes beneath: the river of blood\nApproaches, in the which all those are steep'd,\nWho have by violence injur'd.\"  O blind lust!\nO foolish wrath! who so dost goad us on\nIn the brief life, and in the eternal then\nThus miserably o'erwhelm us.  I beheld\nAn ample foss, that in a bow was bent,\nAs circling all the plain; for so my guide\nHad told.  Between it and the rampart's base\nOn trail ran Centaurs, with keen arrows arm'd,\nAs to the chase they on the earth were wont.\n\nAt seeing us descend they each one stood;\nAnd issuing from the troop, three sped with bows\nAnd missile weapons chosen first; of whom\nOne cried from far: \"Say to what pain ye come\nCondemn'd, who down this steep have journied?  Speak\nFrom whence ye stand, or else the bow I draw.\"\n\nTo whom my guide: \"Our answer shall be made\nTo Chiron, there, when nearer him we come.\nIll was thy mind, thus ever quick and rash.\"\n\nThen me he touch'd, and spake: \"Nessus is this,\nWho for the fair Deianira died,\nAnd wrought himself revenge for his own fate.\nHe in the midst, that on his breast looks down,\nIs the great Chiron who Achilles nurs'd;\nThat other Pholus, prone to wrath.\"  Around\nThe foss these go by thousands, aiming shafts\nAt whatsoever spirit dares emerge\nFrom out the blood, more than his guilt allows.\n\nWe to those beasts, that rapid strode along,\nDrew near, when Chiron took an arrow forth,\nAnd with the notch push'd back his shaggy beard\nTo the cheek-bone, then his great mouth to view\nExposing, to his fellows thus exclaim'd:\n\"Are ye aware, that he who comes behind\nMoves what he touches?  The feet of the dead\nAre not so wont.\"  My trusty guide, who now\nStood near his breast, where the two natures join,\nThus made reply: \"He is indeed alive,\nAnd solitary so must needs by me\nBe shown the gloomy vale, thereto induc'd\nBy strict necessity, not by delight.\nShe left her joyful harpings in the sky,\nWho this new office to my care consign'd.\nHe is no robber, no dark spirit I.\nBut by that virtue, which empowers my step\nTo treat so wild a path, grant us, I pray,\nOne of thy band, whom we may trust secure,\nWho to the ford may lead us, and convey\nAcross, him mounted on his back; for he\nIs not a spirit that may walk the air.\"\n\nThen on his right breast turning, Chiron thus\nTo Nessus spake: \"Return, and be their guide.\nAnd if ye chance to cross another troop,\nCommand them keep aloof.\"  Onward we mov'd,\nThe faithful escort by our side, along\nThe border of the crimson-seething flood,\nWhence from those steep'd within loud shrieks arose.\n\nSome there I mark'd, as high as to their brow\nImmers'd, of whom the mighty Centaur thus:\n\"These are the souls of tyrants, who were given\nTo blood and rapine.  Here they wail aloud\nTheir merciless wrongs.  Here Alexander dwells,\nAnd Dionysius fell, who many a year\nOf woe wrought for fair Sicily.  That brow\nWhereon the hair so jetty clust'ring hangs,\nIs Azzolino; that with flaxen locks\nObizzo' of Este, in the world destroy'd\nBy his foul step-son.\"  To the bard rever'd\nI turned me round, and thus he spake; \"Let him\nBe to thee now first leader, me but next\nTo him in rank.\"  Then farther on a space\nThe Centaur paus'd, near some, who at the throat\nWere extant from the wave; and showing us\nA spirit by itself apart retir'd,\nExclaim'd: \"He in God's bosom smote the heart,\nWhich yet is honour'd on the bank of Thames.\"\n\nA race I next espied, who held the head,\nAnd even all the bust above the stream.\n'Midst these I many a face remember'd well.\nThus shallow more and more the blood became,\nSo that at last it but imbru'd the feet;\nAnd there our passage lay athwart the foss.\n\n\"As ever on this side the boiling wave\nThou seest diminishing,\" the Centaur said,\n\"So on the other, be thou well assur'd,\nIt lower still and lower sinks its bed,\nTill in that part it reuniting join,\nWhere 't is the lot of tyranny to mourn.\nThere Heav'n's stern justice lays chastising hand\nOn Attila, who was the scourge of earth,\nOn Sextus, and on Pyrrhus, and extracts\nTears ever by the seething flood unlock'd\nFrom the Rinieri, of Corneto this,\nPazzo the other nam'd, who fill'd the ways\nWith violence and war.\"  This said, he turn'd,\nAnd quitting us, alone repass'd the ford.\n\n\n\n\nCANTO XIII\n\nERE Nessus yet had reach'd the other bank,\nWe enter'd on a forest, where no track\nOf steps had worn a way.  Not verdant there\nThe foliage, but of dusky hue; not light\nThe boughs and tapering, but with knares deform'd\nAnd matted thick: fruits there were none, but thorns\nInstead, with venom fill'd. Less sharp than these,\nLess intricate the brakes, wherein abide\nThose animals, that hate the cultur'd fields,\nBetwixt Corneto and Cecina's stream.\n\nHere the brute Harpies make their nest, the same\nWho from the Strophades the Trojan band\nDrove with dire boding of their future woe.\nBroad are their pennons, of the human form\nTheir neck and count'nance, arm'd with talons keen\nThe feet, and the huge belly fledge with wings\nThese sit and wail on the drear mystic wood.\n\nThe kind instructor in these words began:\n\"Ere farther thou proceed, know thou art now\nI' th' second round, and shalt be, till thou come\nUpon the horrid sand: look therefore well\nAround thee, and such things thou shalt behold,\nAs would my speech discredit.\"  On all sides\nI heard sad plainings breathe, and none could see\nFrom whom they might have issu'd.  In amaze\nFast bound I stood.  He, as it seem'd, believ'd,\nThat I had thought so many voices came\nFrom some amid those thickets close conceal'd,\nAnd thus his speech resum'd: \"If thou lop off\nA single twig from one of those ill plants,\nThe thought thou hast conceiv'd shall vanish quite.\"\n\nThereat a little stretching forth my hand,\nFrom a great wilding gather'd I a branch,\nAnd straight the trunk exclaim'd: \"Why pluck'st thou me?\"\n\nThen as the dark blood trickled down its side,\nThese words it added: \"Wherefore tear'st me thus?\nIs there no touch of mercy in thy breast?\nMen once were we, that now are rooted here.\nThy hand might well have spar'd us, had we been\nThe souls of serpents.\"  As a brand yet green,\nThat burning at one end from the' other sends\nA groaning sound, and hisses with the wind\nThat forces out its way, so burst at once,\nForth from the broken splinter words and blood.\n\nI, letting fall the bough, remain'd as one\nAssail'd by terror, and the sage replied:\n\"If he, O injur'd spirit! could have believ'd\nWhat he hath seen but in my verse describ'd,\nHe never against thee had stretch'd his hand.\nBut I, because the thing surpass'd belief,\nPrompted him to this deed, which even now\nMyself I rue.  But tell me, who thou wast;\nThat, for this wrong to do thee some amends,\nIn the upper world (for thither to return\nIs granted him) thy fame he may revive.\"\n\n\"That pleasant word of thine,\" the trunk replied\n\"Hath so inveigled me, that I from speech\nCannot refrain, wherein if I indulge\nA little longer, in the snare detain'd,\nCount it not grievous.  I it was, who held\nBoth keys to Frederick's heart, and turn'd the wards,\nOpening and shutting, with a skill so sweet,\nThat besides me, into his inmost breast\nScarce any other could admittance find.\nThe faith I bore to my high charge was such,\nIt cost me the life-blood that warm'd my veins.\nThe harlot, who ne'er turn'd her gloating eyes\nFrom Caesar's household, common vice and pest\nOf courts, 'gainst me inflam'd the minds of all;\nAnd to Augustus they so spread the flame,\nThat my glad honours chang'd to bitter woes.\nMy soul, disdainful and disgusted, sought\nRefuge in death from scorn, and I became,\nJust as I was, unjust toward myself.\nBy the new roots, which fix this stem, I swear,\nThat never faith I broke to my liege lord,\nWho merited such honour; and of you,\nIf any to the world indeed return,\nClear he from wrong my memory, that lies\nYet prostrate under envy's cruel blow.\"\n\nFirst somewhat pausing, till the mournful words\nWere ended, then to me the bard began:\n\"Lose not the time; but speak and of him ask,\nIf more thou wish to learn.\"  Whence I replied:\n\"Question thou him again of whatsoe'er\nWill, as thou think'st, content me; for no power\nHave I to ask, such pity' is at my heart.\"\n\nHe thus resum'd; \"So may he do for thee\nFreely what thou entreatest, as thou yet\nBe pleas'd, imprison'd Spirit! to declare,\nHow in these gnarled joints the soul is tied;\nAnd whether any ever from such frame\nBe loosen'd, if thou canst, that also tell.\"\n\nThereat the trunk breath'd hard, and the wind soon\nChang'd into sounds articulate like these;\n\n\"Briefly ye shall be answer'd.  When departs\nThe fierce soul from the body, by itself\nThence torn asunder, to the seventh gulf\nBy Minos doom'd, into the wood it falls,\nNo place assign'd, but wheresoever chance\nHurls it, there sprouting, as a grain of spelt,\nIt rises to a sapling, growing thence\nA savage plant.  The Harpies, on its leaves\nThen feeding, cause both pain and for the pain\nA vent to grief.  We, as the rest, shall come\nFor our own spoils, yet not so that with them\nWe may again be clad; for what a man\nTakes from himself it is not just he have.\nHere we perforce shall drag them; and throughout\nThe dismal glade our bodies shall be hung,\nEach on the wild thorn of his wretched shade.\"\n\nAttentive yet to listen to the trunk\nWe stood, expecting farther speech, when us\nA noise surpris'd, as when a man perceives\nThe wild boar and the hunt approach his place\nOf station'd watch, who of the beasts and boughs\nLoud rustling round him hears.  And lo! there came\nTwo naked, torn with briers, in headlong flight,\nThat they before them broke each fan o' th' wood.\n\"Haste now,\" the foremost cried, \"now haste thee death!\"\n\nThe' other, as seem'd, impatient of delay\nExclaiming, \"Lano! not so bent for speed\nThy sinews, in the lists of Toppo's field.\"\nAnd then, for that perchance no longer breath\nSuffic'd him, of himself and of a bush\nOne group he made.  Behind them was the wood\nFull of black female mastiffs, gaunt and fleet,\nAs greyhounds that have newly slipp'd the leash.\nOn him, who squatted down, they stuck their fangs,\nAnd having rent him piecemeal bore away\nThe tortur'd limbs.  My guide then seiz'd my hand,\nAnd led me to the thicket, which in vain\nMourn'd through its bleeding wounds: \"O Giacomo\nOf Sant' Andrea! what avails it thee,\"\nIt cried, \"that of me thou hast made thy screen?\nFor thy ill life what blame on me recoils?\"\n\nWhen o'er it he had paus'd, my master spake:\n\"Say who wast thou, that at so many points\nBreath'st out with blood thy lamentable speech?\"\n\nHe answer'd: \"Oh, ye spirits: arriv'd in time\nTo spy the shameful havoc, that from me\nMy leaves hath sever'd thus, gather them up,\nAnd at the foot of their sad parent-tree\nCarefully lay them.  In that city' I dwelt,\nWho for the Baptist her first patron chang'd,\nWhence he for this shall cease not with his art\nTo work her woe: and if there still remain'd not\nOn Arno's passage some faint glimpse of him,\nThose citizens, who rear'd once more her walls\nUpon the ashes left by Attila,\nHad labour'd without profit of their toil.\nI slung the fatal noose from my own roof.\"\n\n\n\n\nCANTO XIV\n\nSOON as the charity of native land\nWrought in my bosom, I the scatter'd leaves\nCollected, and to him restor'd, who now\nWas hoarse with utt'rance.  To the limit thence\nWe came, which from the third the second round\nDivides, and where of justice is display'd\nContrivance horrible.  Things then first seen\nClearlier to manifest, I tell how next\nA plain we reach'd, that from its sterile bed\nEach plant repell'd. The mournful wood waves round\nIts garland on all sides, as round the wood\nSpreads the sad foss.  There, on the very edge,\nOur steps we stay'd.  It was an area wide\nOf arid sand and thick, resembling most\nThe soil that erst by Cato's foot was trod.\n\nVengeance of Heav'n!  Oh! how shouldst thou be fear'd\nBy all, who read what here my eyes beheld!\n\nOf naked spirits many a flock I saw,\nAll weeping piteously, to different laws\nSubjected: for on the' earth some lay supine,\nSome crouching close were seated, others pac'd\nIncessantly around; the latter tribe,\nMore numerous, those fewer who beneath\nThe torment lay, but louder in their grief.\n\nO'er all the sand fell slowly wafting down\nDilated flakes of fire, as flakes of snow\nOn Alpine summit, when the wind is hush'd.\nAs in the torrid Indian clime, the son\nOf Ammon saw upon his warrior band\nDescending, solid flames, that to the ground\nCame down: whence he bethought him with his troop\nTo trample on the soil; for easier thus\nThe vapour was extinguish'd, while alone;\nSo fell the eternal fiery flood, wherewith\nThe marble glow'd underneath, as under stove\nThe viands, doubly to augment the pain.\n\nUnceasing was the play of wretched hands,\nNow this, now that way glancing, to shake off\nThe heat, still falling fresh.  I thus began:\n\"Instructor! thou who all things overcom'st,\nExcept the hardy demons, that rush'd forth\nTo stop our entrance at the gate, say who\nIs yon huge spirit, that, as seems, heeds not\nThe burning, but lies writhen in proud scorn,\nAs by the sultry tempest immatur'd?\"\n\nStraight he himself, who was aware I ask'd\nMy guide of him, exclaim'd: \"Such as I was\nWhen living, dead such now I am.  If Jove\nWeary his workman out, from whom in ire\nHe snatch'd the lightnings, that at my last day\nTransfix'd me, if the rest be weary out\nAt their black smithy labouring by turns\nIn Mongibello, while he cries aloud;\n\"Help, help, good Mulciber!\" as erst he cried\nIn the Phlegraean warfare, and the bolts\nLaunch he full aim'd at me with all his might,\nHe never should enjoy a sweet revenge.\"\n\nThen thus my guide, in accent higher rais'd\nThan I before had heard him: \"Capaneus!\nThou art more punish'd, in that this thy pride\nLives yet unquench'd: no torrent, save thy rage,\nWere to thy fury pain proportion'd full.\"\n\nNext turning round to me with milder lip\nHe spake: \"This of the seven kings was one,\nWho girt the Theban walls with siege, and held,\nAs still he seems to hold, God in disdain,\nAnd sets his high omnipotence at nought.\nBut, as I told him, his despiteful mood\nIs ornament well suits the breast that wears it.\nFollow me now; and look thou set not yet\nThy foot in the hot sand, but to the wood\nKeep ever close.\"  Silently on we pass'd\nTo where there gushes from the forest's bound\nA little brook, whose crimson'd wave yet lifts\nMy hair with horror.  As the rill, that runs\nFrom Bulicame, to be portion'd out\nAmong the sinful women; so ran this\nDown through the sand, its bottom and each bank\nStone-built, and either margin at its side,\nWhereon I straight perceiv'd our passage lay.\n\n\"Of all that I have shown thee, since that gate\nWe enter'd first, whose threshold is to none\nDenied, nought else so worthy of regard,\nAs is this river, has thine eye discern'd,\nO'er which the flaming volley all is quench'd.\"\n\nSo spake my guide; and I him thence besought,\nThat having giv'n me appetite to know,\nThe food he too would give, that hunger crav'd.\n\n\"In midst of ocean,\" forthwith he began,\n\"A desolate country lies, which Crete is nam'd,\nUnder whose monarch in old times the world\nLiv'd pure and chaste.  A mountain rises there,\nCall'd Ida, joyous once with leaves and streams,\nDeserted now like a forbidden thing.\nIt was the spot which Rhea, Saturn's spouse,\nChose for the secret cradle of her son;\nAnd better to conceal him, drown'd in shouts\nHis infant cries.  Within the mount, upright\nAn ancient form there stands and huge, that turns\nHis shoulders towards Damiata, and at Rome\nAs in his mirror looks.  Of finest gold\nHis head is shap'd, pure silver are the breast\nAnd arms; thence to the middle is of brass.\nAnd downward all beneath well-temper'd steel,\nSave the right foot of potter's clay, on which\nThan on the other more erect he stands,\nEach part except the gold, is rent throughout;\nAnd from the fissure tears distil, which join'd\nPenetrate to that cave.  They in their course\nThus far precipitated down the rock\nForm Acheron, and Styx, and Phlegethon;\nThen by this straiten'd channel passing hence\nBeneath, e'en to the lowest depth of all,\nForm there Cocytus, of whose lake (thyself\nShall see it) I here give thee no account.\"\n\nThen I to him: \"If from our world this sluice\nBe thus deriv'd; wherefore to us but now\nAppears it at this edge?\"  He straight replied:\n\"The place, thou know'st, is round; and though great part\nThou have already pass'd, still to the left\nDescending to the nethermost, not yet\nHast thou the circuit made of the whole orb.\nWherefore if aught of new to us appear,\nIt needs not bring up wonder in thy looks.\"\n\nThen I again inquir'd: \"Where flow the streams\nOf Phlegethon and Lethe? for of one\nThou tell'st not, and the other of that shower,\nThou say'st, is form'd.\"  He answer thus return'd:\n\"Doubtless thy questions all well pleas'd I hear.\nYet the red seething wave might have resolv'd\nOne thou proposest.  Lethe thou shalt see,\nBut not within this hollow, in the place,\nWhither to lave themselves the spirits go,\nWhose blame hath been by penitence remov'd.\"\nHe added: \"Time is now we quit the wood.\nLook thou my steps pursue: the margins give\nSafe passage, unimpeded by the flames;\nFor over them all vapour is extinct.\"\n\n\n\n\nCANTO XV\n\nOne of the solid margins bears us now\nEnvelop'd in the mist, that from the stream\nArising, hovers o'er, and saves from fire\nBoth piers and water.  As the Flemings rear\nTheir mound, 'twixt Ghent and Bruges, to chase back\nThe ocean, fearing his tumultuous tide\nThat drives toward them, or the Paduans theirs\nAlong the Brenta, to defend their towns\nAnd castles, ere the genial warmth be felt\nOn Chiarentana's top; such were the mounds,\nSo fram'd, though not in height or bulk to these\nMade equal, by the master, whosoe'er\nHe was, that rais'd them here.  We from the wood\nWere not so far remov'd, that turning round\nI might not have discern'd it, when we met\nA troop of spirits, who came beside the pier.\n\nThey each one ey'd us, as at eventide\nOne eyes another under a new moon,\nAnd toward us sharpen'd their sight as keen,\nAs an old tailor at his needle's eye.\n\nThus narrowly explor'd by all the tribe,\nI was agniz'd of one, who by the skirt\nCaught me, and cried, \"What wonder have we here!\"\n\nAnd I, when he to me outstretch'd his arm,\nIntently fix'd my ken on his parch'd looks,\nThat although smirch'd with fire, they hinder'd not\nBut I remember'd him; and towards his face\nMy hand inclining, answer'd: \"Sir!  Brunetto!\n\n\"And art thou here?\"  He thus to me: \"My son!\nOh let it not displease thee, if Brunetto\nLatini but a little space with thee\nTurn back, and leave his fellows to proceed.\"\n\nI thus to him replied: \"Much as I can,\nI thereto pray thee; and if thou be willing,\nThat I here seat me with thee, I consent;\nHis leave, with whom I journey, first obtain'd.\"\n\n\"O son!\" said he, \"whoever of this throng\nOne instant stops, lies then a hundred years,\nNo fan to ventilate him, when the fire\nSmites sorest.  Pass thou therefore on.  I close\nWill at thy garments walk, and then rejoin\nMy troop, who go mourning their endless doom.\"\n\nI dar'd not from the path descend to tread\nOn equal ground with him, but held my head\nBent down, as one who walks in reverent guise.\n\n\"What chance or destiny,\" thus he began,\n\"Ere the last day conducts thee here below?\nAnd who is this, that shows to thee the way?\"\n\n\"There up aloft,\" I answer'd, \"in the life\nSerene, I wander'd in a valley lost,\nBefore mine age had to its fullness reach'd.\nBut yester-morn I left it: then once more\nInto that vale returning, him I met;\nAnd by this path homeward he leads me back.\"\n\n\"If thou,\" he answer'd, \"follow but thy star,\nThou canst not miss at last a glorious haven:\nUnless in fairer days my judgment err'd.\nAnd if my fate so early had not chanc'd,\nSeeing the heav'ns thus bounteous to thee, I\nHad gladly giv'n thee comfort in thy work.\nBut that ungrateful and malignant race,\nWho in old times came down from Fesole,\nAy and still smack of their rough mountain-flint,\nWill for thy good deeds shew thee enmity.\nNor wonder; for amongst ill-savour'd crabs\nIt suits not the sweet fig-tree lay her fruit.\nOld fame reports them in the world for blind,\nCovetous, envious, proud.  Look to it well:\nTake heed thou cleanse thee of their ways.  For thee\nThy fortune hath such honour in reserve,\nThat thou by either party shalt be crav'd\nWith hunger keen: but be the fresh herb far\nFrom the goat's tooth.  The herd of Fesole\nMay of themselves make litter, not touch the plant,\nIf any such yet spring on their rank bed,\nIn which the holy seed revives, transmitted\nFrom those true Romans, who still there remain'd,\nWhen it was made the nest of so much ill.\"\n\n\"Were all my wish fulfill'd,\" I straight replied,\n\"Thou from the confines of man's nature yet\nHadst not been driven forth; for in my mind\nIs fix'd, and now strikes full upon my heart\nThe dear, benign, paternal image, such\nAs thine was, when so lately thou didst teach me\nThe way for man to win eternity;\nAnd how I priz'd the lesson, it behooves,\nThat, long as life endures, my tongue should speak,\nWhat of my fate thou tell'st, that write I down:\nAnd with another text to comment on\nFor her I keep it, the celestial dame,\nWho will know all, if I to her arrive.\nThis only would I have thee clearly note:\nThat so my conscience have no plea against me;\nDo fortune as she list, I stand prepar'd.\nNot new or strange such earnest to mine ear.\nSpeed fortune then her wheel, as likes her best,\nThe clown his mattock; all things have their course.\"\n\nThereat my sapient guide upon his right\nTurn'd himself back, then look'd at me and spake:\n\"He listens to good purpose who takes note.\"\n\nI not the less still on my way proceed,\nDiscoursing with Brunetto, and inquire\nWho are most known and chief among his tribe.\n\n\"To know of some is well;\" thus he replied,\n\"But of the rest silence may best beseem.\nTime would not serve us for report so long.\nIn brief I tell thee, that all these were clerks,\nMen of great learning and no less renown,\nBy one same sin polluted in the world.\nWith them is Priscian, and Accorso's son\nFrancesco herds among that wretched throng:\nAnd, if the wish of so impure a blotch\nPossess'd thee, him thou also might'st have seen,\nWho by the servants' servant was transferr'd\nFrom Arno's seat to Bacchiglione, where\nHis ill-strain'd nerves he left.  I more would add,\nBut must from farther speech and onward way\nAlike desist, for yonder I behold\nA mist new-risen on the sandy plain.\nA company, with whom I may not sort,\nApproaches.  I commend my TREASURE to thee,\nWherein I yet survive; my sole request.\"\n\nThis said he turn'd, and seem'd as one of those,\nWho o'er Verona's champain try their speed\nFor the green mantle, and of them he seem'd,\nNot he who loses but who gains the prize.\n\n\n\n\nCANTO XVI\n\nNOW came I where the water's din was heard,\nAs down it fell into the other round,\nResounding like the hum of swarming bees:\nWhen forth together issu'd from a troop,\nThat pass'd beneath the fierce tormenting storm,\nThree spirits, running swift.  They towards us came,\nAnd each one cried aloud, \"Oh do thou stay!\nWhom by the fashion of thy garb we deem\nTo be some inmate of our evil land.\"\n\nAh me! what wounds I mark'd upon their limbs,\nRecent and old, inflicted by the flames!\nE'en the remembrance of them grieves me yet.\n\nAttentive to their cry my teacher paus'd,\nAnd turn'd to me his visage, and then spake;\n\"Wait now! our courtesy these merit well:\nAnd were 't not for the nature of the place,\nWhence glide the fiery darts, I should have said,\nThat haste had better suited thee than them.\"\n\nThey, when we stopp'd, resum'd their ancient wail,\nAnd soon as they had reach'd us, all the three\nWhirl'd round together in one restless wheel.\nAs naked champions, smear'd with slippery oil,\nAre wont intent to watch their place of hold\nAnd vantage, ere in closer strife they meet;\nThus each one, as he wheel'd, his countenance\nAt me directed, so that opposite\nThe neck mov'd ever to the twinkling feet.\n\n\"If misery of this drear wilderness,\"\nThus one began, \"added to our sad cheer\nAnd destitute, do call forth scorn on us\nAnd our entreaties, let our great renown\nIncline thee to inform us who thou art,\nThat dost imprint with living feet unharm'd\nThe soil of Hell.  He, in whose track thou see'st\nMy steps pursuing, naked though he be\nAnd reft of all, was of more high estate\nThan thou believest; grandchild of the chaste\nGualdrada, him they Guidoguerra call'd,\nWho in his lifetime many a noble act\nAchiev'd, both by his wisdom and his sword.\nThe other, next to me that beats the sand,\nIs Aldobrandi, name deserving well,\nIn the' upper world, of honour; and myself\nWho in this torment do partake with them,\nAm Rusticucci, whom, past doubt, my wife\nOf savage temper, more than aught beside\nHath to this evil brought.\"  If from the fire\nI had been shelter'd, down amidst them straight\nI then had cast me, nor my guide, I deem,\nWould have restrain'd my going; but that fear\nOf the dire burning vanquish'd the desire,\nWhich made me eager of their wish'd embrace.\n\nI then began: \"Not scorn, but grief much more,\nSuch as long time alone can cure, your doom\nFix'd deep within me, soon as this my lord\nSpake words, whose tenour taught me to expect\nThat such a race, as ye are, was at hand.\nI am a countryman of yours, who still\nAffectionate have utter'd, and have heard\nYour deeds and names renown'd.  Leaving the gall\nFor the sweet fruit I go, that a sure guide\nHath promis'd to me.  But behooves, that far\nAs to the centre first I downward tend.\"\n\n\"So may long space thy spirit guide thy limbs,\"\nHe answer straight return'd; \"and so thy fame\nShine bright, when thou art gone; as thou shalt tell,\nIf courtesy and valour, as they wont,\nDwell in our city, or have vanish'd clean?\nFor one amidst us late condemn'd to wail,\nBorsiere, yonder walking with his peers,\nGrieves us no little by the news he brings.\"\n\n\"An upstart multitude and sudden gains,\nPride and excess, O Florence! have in thee\nEngender'd, so that now in tears thou mourn'st!\"\nThus cried I with my face uprais'd, and they\nAll three, who for an answer took my words,\nLook'd at each other, as men look when truth\nComes to their ear.  \"If thou at other times,\"\nThey all at once rejoin'd, \"so easily\nSatisfy those, who question, happy thou,\nGifted with words, so apt to speak thy thought!\nWherefore if thou escape this darksome clime,\nReturning to behold the radiant stars,\nWhen thou with pleasure shalt retrace the past,\nSee that of us thou speak among mankind.\"\n\nThis said, they broke the circle, and so swift\nFled, that as pinions seem'd their nimble feet.\n\nNot in so short a time might one have said\n\"Amen,\" as they had vanish'd. Straight my guide\nPursu'd his track.  I follow'd; and small space\nHad we pass'd onward, when the water's sound\nWas now so near at hand, that we had scarce\nHeard one another's speech for the loud din.\n\nE'en as the river, that holds on its course\nUnmingled, from the mount of Vesulo,\nOn the left side of Apennine, toward\nThe east, which Acquacheta higher up\nThey call, ere it descend into the vale,\nAt Forli by that name no longer known,\nRebellows o'er Saint Benedict, roll'd on\nFrom the' Alpine summit down a precipice,\nWhere space enough to lodge a thousand spreads;\nThus downward from a craggy steep we found,\nThat this dark wave resounded, roaring loud,\nSo that the ear its clamour soon had stunn'd.\n\nI had a cord that brac'd my girdle round,\nWherewith I erst had thought fast bound to take\nThe painted leopard.  This when I had all\nUnloosen'd from me (so my master bade)\nI gather'd up, and stretch'd it forth to him.\nThen to the right he turn'd, and from the brink\nStanding few paces distant, cast it down\nInto the deep abyss.  \"And somewhat strange,\"\nThus to myself I spake, \"signal so strange\nBetokens, which my guide with earnest eye\nThus follows.\"  Ah! what caution must men use\nWith those who look not at the deed alone,\nBut spy into the thoughts with subtle skill!\n\n\"Quickly shall come,\" he said, \"what I expect,\nThine eye discover quickly, that whereof\nThy thought is dreaming.\"  Ever to that truth,\nWhich but the semblance of a falsehood wears,\nA man, if possible, should bar his lip;\nSince, although blameless, he incurs reproach.\nBut silence here were vain; and by these notes\nWhich now I sing, reader!  I swear to thee,\nSo may they favour find to latest times!\nThat through the gross and murky air I spied\nA shape come swimming up, that might have quell'd\nThe stoutest heart with wonder, in such guise\nAs one returns, who hath been down to loose\nAn anchor grappled fast against some rock,\nOr to aught else that in the salt wave lies,\nWho upward springing close draws in his feet.\n\n\n\n\nCANTO XVII\n\n\"LO! the fell monster with the deadly sting!\nWho passes mountains, breaks through fenced walls\nAnd firm embattled spears, and with his filth\nTaints all the world!\"  Thus me my guide address'd,\nAnd beckon'd him, that he should come to shore,\nNear to the stony causeway's utmost edge.\n\nForthwith that image vile of fraud appear'd,\nHis head and upper part expos'd on land,\nBut laid not on the shore his bestial train.\nHis face the semblance of a just man's wore,\nSo kind and gracious was its outward cheer;\nThe rest was serpent all: two shaggy claws\nReach'd to the armpits, and the back and breast,\nAnd either side, were painted o'er with nodes\nAnd orbits.  Colours variegated more\nNor Turks nor Tartars e'er on cloth of state\nWith interchangeable embroidery wove,\nNor spread Arachne o'er her curious loom.\nAs ofttimes a light skiff, moor'd to the shore,\nStands part in water, part upon the land;\nOr, as where dwells the greedy German boor,\nThe beaver settles watching for his prey;\nSo on the rim, that fenc'd the sand with rock,\nSat perch'd the fiend of evil.  In the void\nGlancing, his tail upturn'd its venomous fork,\nWith sting like scorpion's arm'd.  Then thus my guide:\n\"Now need our way must turn few steps apart,\nFar as to that ill beast, who couches there.\"\n\nThereat toward the right our downward course\nWe shap'd, and, better to escape the flame\nAnd burning marle, ten paces on the verge\nProceeded.  Soon as we to him arrive,\nA little further on mine eye beholds\nA tribe of spirits, seated on the sand\nNear the wide chasm.  Forthwith my master spake:\n\"That to the full thy knowledge may extend\nOf all this round contains, go now, and mark\nThe mien these wear: but hold not long discourse.\nTill thou returnest, I with him meantime\nWill parley, that to us he may vouchsafe\nThe aid of his strong shoulders.\"  Thus alone\nYet forward on the' extremity I pac'd\nOf that seventh circle, where the mournful tribe\nWere seated.  At the eyes forth gush'd their pangs.\nAgainst the vapours and the torrid soil\nAlternately their shifting hands they plied.\nThus use the dogs in summer still to ply\nTheir jaws and feet by turns, when bitten sore\nBy gnats, or flies, or gadflies swarming round.\n\nNoting the visages of some, who lay\nBeneath the pelting of that dolorous fire,\nOne of them all I knew not; but perceiv'd,\nThat pendent from his neck each bore a pouch\nWith colours and with emblems various mark'd,\nOn which it seem'd as if their eye did feed.\n\nAnd when amongst them looking round I came,\nA yellow purse I saw with azure wrought,\nThat wore a lion's countenance and port.\nThen still my sight pursuing its career,\nAnother I beheld, than blood more red.\nA goose display of whiter wing than curd.\nAnd one, who bore a fat and azure swine\nPictur'd on his white scrip, addressed me thus:\n\"What dost thou in this deep?  Go now and know,\nSince yet thou livest, that my neighbour here\nVitaliano on my left shall sit.\nA Paduan with these Florentines am I.\nOfttimes they thunder in mine ears, exclaiming\n'O haste that noble knight! he who the pouch\nWith the three beaks will bring!'\"  This said, he writh'd\nThe mouth, and loll'd the tongue out, like an ox\nThat licks his nostrils.  I, lest longer stay\nHe ill might brook, who bade me stay not long,\nBackward my steps from those sad spirits turn'd.\n\nMy guide already seated on the haunch\nOf the fierce animal I found; and thus\nHe me encourag'd.  \"Be thou stout; be bold.\nDown such a steep flight must we now descend!\nMount thou before: for that no power the tail\nMay have to harm thee, I will be i' th' midst.\"\n\nAs one, who hath an ague fit so near,\nHis nails already are turn'd blue, and he\nQuivers all o'er, if he but eye the shade;\nSuch was my cheer at hearing of his words.\nBut shame soon interpos'd her threat, who makes\nThe servant bold in presence of his lord.\n\nI settled me upon those shoulders huge,\nAnd would have said, but that the words to aid\nMy purpose came not, \"Look thou clasp me firm!\"\n\nBut he whose succour then not first I prov'd,\nSoon as I mounted, in his arms aloft,\nEmbracing, held me up, and thus he spake:\n\"Geryon! now move thee! be thy wheeling gyres\nOf ample circuit, easy thy descent.\nThink on th' unusual burden thou sustain'st.\"\n\nAs a small vessel, back'ning out from land,\nHer station quits; so thence the monster loos'd,\nAnd when he felt himself at large, turn'd round\nThere where the breast had been, his forked tail.\nThus, like an eel, outstretch'd at length he steer'd,\nGath'ring the air up with retractile claws.\n\nNot greater was the dread when Phaeton\nThe reins let drop at random, whence high heaven,\nWhereof signs yet appear, was wrapt in flames;\nNor when ill-fated Icarus perceiv'd,\nBy liquefaction of the scalded wax,\nThe trusted pennons loosen'd from his loins,\nHis sire exclaiming loud, \"Ill way thou keep'st!\"\nThan was my dread, when round me on each part\nThe air I view'd, and other object none\nSave the fell beast.  He slowly sailing, wheels\nHis downward motion, unobserv'd of me,\nBut that the wind, arising to my face,\nBreathes on me from below.  Now on our right\nI heard the cataract beneath us leap\nWith hideous crash; whence bending down to' explore,\nNew terror I conceiv'd at the steep plunge:\n\nFor flames I saw, and wailings smote mine ear:\nSo that all trembling close I crouch'd my limbs,\nAnd then distinguish'd, unperceiv'd before,\nBy the dread torments that on every side\nDrew nearer, how our downward course we wound.\n\nAs falcon, that hath long been on the wing,\nBut lure nor bird hath seen, while in despair\nThe falconer cries, \"Ah me! thou stoop'st to earth!\"\nWearied descends, and swiftly down the sky\nIn many an orbit wheels, then lighting sits\nAt distance from his lord in angry mood;\nSo Geryon lighting places us on foot\nLow down at base of the deep-furrow'd rock,\nAnd, of his burden there discharg'd, forthwith\nSprang forward, like an arrow from the string.\n\n\n\n\nCANTO XVIII\n\nTHERE is a place within the depths of hell\nCall'd Malebolge, all of rock dark-stain'd\nWith hue ferruginous, e'en as the steep\nThat round it circling winds.  Right in the midst\nOf that abominable region, yawns\nA spacious gulf profound, whereof the frame\nDue time shall tell.  The circle, that remains,\nThroughout its round, between the gulf and base\nOf the high craggy banks, successive forms\nTen trenches, in its hollow bottom sunk.\n\nAs where to guard the walls, full many a foss\nBegirds some stately castle, sure defence\nAffording to the space within, so here\nWere model'd these; and as like fortresses\nE'en from their threshold to the brink without,\nAre flank'd with bridges; from the rock's low base\nThus flinty paths advanc'd, that 'cross the moles\nAnd dikes, struck onward far as to the gulf,\nThat in one bound collected cuts them off.\nSuch was the place, wherein we found ourselves\nFrom Geryon's back dislodg'd. The bard to left\nHeld on his way, and I behind him mov'd.\n\nOn our right hand new misery I saw,\nNew pains, new executioners of wrath,\nThat swarming peopled the first chasm.  Below\nWere naked sinners.  Hitherward they came,\nMeeting our faces from the middle point,\nWith us beyond but with a larger stride.\nE'en thus the Romans, when the year returns\nOf Jubilee, with better speed to rid\nThe thronging multitudes, their means devise\nFor such as pass the bridge; that on one side\nAll front toward the castle, and approach\nSaint Peter's fane, on th' other towards the mount.\n\nEach divers way along the grisly rock,\nHorn'd demons I beheld, with lashes huge,\nThat on their back unmercifully smote.\nAh! how they made them bound at the first stripe!\n\nNone for the second waited nor the third.\n\nMeantime as on I pass'd, one met my sight\nWhom soon as view'd; \"Of him,\" cried I, \"not yet\nMine eye hath had his fill.\"  With fixed gaze\nI therefore scann'd him.  Straight the teacher kind\nPaus'd with me, and consented I should walk\nBackward a space, and the tormented spirit,\nWho thought to hide him, bent his visage down.\nBut it avail'd him nought; for I exclaim'd:\n\"Thou who dost cast thy eye upon the ground,\nUnless thy features do belie thee much,\nVenedico art thou.  But what brings thee\nInto this bitter seas'ning?\" He replied:\n\"Unwillingly I answer to thy words.\nBut thy clear speech, that to my mind recalls\nThe world I once inhabited, constrains me.\nKnow then 'twas I who led fair Ghisola\nTo do the Marquis' will, however fame\nThe shameful tale have bruited.  Nor alone\nBologna hither sendeth me to mourn\nRather with us the place is so o'erthrong'd\nThat not so many tongues this day are taught,\nBetwixt the Reno and Savena's stream,\nTo answer SIPA in their country's phrase.\nAnd if of that securer proof thou need,\nRemember but our craving thirst for gold.\"\n\nHim speaking thus, a demon with his thong\nStruck, and exclaim'd, \"Away! corrupter! here\nWomen are none for sale.\"  Forthwith I join'd\nMy escort, and few paces thence we came\nTo where a rock forth issued from the bank.\nThat easily ascended, to the right\nUpon its splinter turning, we depart\nFrom those eternal barriers. When arriv'd,\nWhere underneath the gaping arch lets pass\nThe scourged souls: \"Pause here,\" the teacher said,\n\"And let these others miserable, now\nStrike on thy ken, faces not yet beheld,\nFor that together they with us have walk'd.\"\n\nFrom the old bridge we ey'd the pack, who came\nFrom th' other side towards us, like the rest,\nExcoriate from the lash.  My gentle guide,\nBy me unquestion'd, thus his speech resum'd:\n\"Behold that lofty shade, who this way tends,\nAnd seems too woe-begone to drop a tear.\nHow yet the regal aspect he retains!\nJason is he, whose skill and prowess won\nThe ram from Colchos. To the Lemnian isle\nHis passage thither led him, when those bold\nAnd pitiless women had slain all their males.\nThere he with tokens and fair witching words\nHypsipyle beguil'd, a virgin young,\nWho first had all the rest herself beguil'd.\nImpregnated he left her there forlorn.\nSuch is the guilt condemns him to this pain.\nHere too Medea's inj'ries are avenged.\nAll bear him company, who like deceit\nTo his have practis'd.  And thus much to know\nOf the first vale suffice thee, and of those\nWhom its keen torments urge.\"  Now had we come\nWhere, crossing the next pier, the straighten'd path\nBestrides its shoulders to another arch.\n\nHence in the second chasm we heard the ghosts,\nWho jibber in low melancholy sounds,\nWith wide-stretch'd nostrils snort, and on themselves\nSmite with their palms.  Upon the banks a scurf\nFrom the foul steam condens'd, encrusting hung,\nThat held sharp combat with the sight and smell.\n\nSo hollow is the depth, that from no part,\nSave on the summit of the rocky span,\nCould I distinguish aught.  Thus far we came;\nAnd thence I saw, within the foss below,\nA crowd immers'd in ordure, that appear'd\nDraff of the human body.  There beneath\nSearching with eye inquisitive, I mark'd\nOne with his head so grim'd, 't were hard to deem,\nIf he were clerk or layman.  Loud he cried:\n\"Why greedily thus bendest more on me,\nThan on these other filthy ones, thy ken?\"\n\n\"Because if true my mem'ry,\" I replied,\n\"I heretofore have seen thee with dry locks,\nAnd thou Alessio art of Lucca sprung.\nTherefore than all the rest I scan thee more.\"\n\nThen beating on his brain these words he spake:\n\"Me thus low down my flatteries have sunk,\nWherewith I ne'er enough could glut my tongue.\"\n\nMy leader thus: \"A little further stretch\nThy face, that thou the visage well mayst note\nOf that besotted, sluttish courtezan,\nWho there doth rend her with defiled nails,\nNow crouching down, now risen on her feet.\n\n\"Thais is this, the harlot, whose false lip\nAnswer'd her doting paramour that ask'd,\n'Thankest me much!'--'Say rather wondrously,'\nAnd seeing this here satiate be our view.\"\n\n\n\n\nCANTO XIX\n\nWOE to thee, Simon Magus! woe to you,\nHis wretched followers! who the things of God,\nWhich should be wedded unto goodness, them,\nRapacious as ye are, do prostitute\nFor gold and silver in adultery!\nNow must the trumpet sound for you, since yours\nIs the third chasm.  Upon the following vault\nWe now had mounted, where the rock impends\nDirectly o'er the centre of the foss.\n\nWisdom Supreme! how wonderful the art,\nWhich thou dost manifest in heaven, in earth,\nAnd in the evil world, how just a meed\nAllotting by thy virtue unto all!\n\nI saw the livid stone, throughout the sides\nAnd in its bottom full of apertures,\nAll equal in their width, and circular each,\nNor ample less nor larger they appear'd\nThan in Saint John's fair dome of me belov'd\nThose fram'd to hold the pure baptismal streams,\nOne of the which I brake, some few years past,\nTo save a whelming infant; and be this\nA seal to undeceive whoever doubts\nThe motive of my deed.  From out the mouth\nOf every one, emerg'd a sinner's feet\nAnd of the legs high upward as the calf\nThe rest beneath was hid.  On either foot\nThe soles were burning, whence the flexile joints\nGlanc'd with such violent motion, as had snapt\nAsunder cords or twisted withs.  As flame,\nFeeding on unctuous matter, glides along\nThe surface, scarcely touching where it moves;\nSo here, from heel to point, glided the flames.\n\n\"Master! say who is he, than all the rest\nGlancing in fiercer agony, on whom\nA ruddier flame doth prey?\"  I thus inquir'd.\n\n\"If thou be willing,\" he replied, \"that I\nCarry thee down, where least the <DW72> bank falls,\nHe of himself shall tell thee and his wrongs.\"\n\nI then: \"As pleases thee to me is best.\nThou art my lord; and know'st that ne'er I quit\nThy will: what silence hides that knowest thou.\"\nThereat on the fourth pier we came, we turn'd,\nAnd on our left descended to the depth,\nA narrow strait and perforated close.\nNor from his side my leader set me down,\nTill to his orifice he brought, whose limb\nQuiv'ring express'd his pang.  \"Whoe'er thou art,\nSad spirit! thus revers'd, and as a stake\nDriv'n in the soil!\"  I in these words began,\n\"If thou be able, utter forth thy voice.\"\n\nThere stood I like the friar, that doth shrive\nA wretch for murder doom'd, who e'en when fix'd,\nCalleth him back, whence death awhile delays.\n\nHe shouted: \"Ha! already standest there?\nAlready standest there, O Boniface!\nBy many a year the writing play'd me false.\nSo early dost thou surfeit with the wealth,\nFor which thou fearedst not in guile to take\nThe lovely lady, and then mangle her?\"\n\nI felt as those who, piercing not the drift\nOf answer made them, stand as if expos'd\nIn mockery, nor know what to reply,\nWhen Virgil thus admonish'd: \"Tell him quick,\nI am not he, not he, whom thou believ'st.\"\n\nAnd I, as was enjoin'd me, straight replied.\n\nThat heard, the spirit all did wrench his feet,\nAnd sighing next in woeful accent spake:\n\"What then of me requirest?  If to know\nSo much imports thee, who I am, that thou\nHast therefore down the bank descended, learn\nThat in the mighty mantle I was rob'd,\nAnd of a she-bear was indeed the son,\nSo eager to advance my whelps, that there\nMy having in my purse above I stow'd,\nAnd here myself.  Under my head are dragg'd\nThe rest, my predecessors in the guilt\nOf simony.  Stretch'd at their length they lie\nAlong an opening in the rock.  'Midst them\nI also low shall fall, soon as he comes,\nFor whom I took thee, when so hastily\nI question'd.  But already longer time\nHath pass'd, since my souls kindled, and I thus\nUpturn'd have stood, than is his doom to stand\nPlanted with fiery feet.  For after him,\nOne yet of deeds more ugly shall arrive,\nFrom forth the west, a shepherd without law,\nFated to cover both his form and mine.\nHe a new Jason shall be call'd, of whom\nIn Maccabees we read; and favour such\nAs to that priest his king indulgent show'd,\nShall be of France's monarch shown to him.\"\n\nI know not if I here too far presum'd,\nBut in this strain I answer'd: \"Tell me now,\nWhat treasures from St. Peter at the first\nOur Lord demanded, when he put the keys\nInto his charge?  Surely he ask'd no more\nBut, Follow me!  Nor Peter nor the rest\nOr gold or silver of Matthias took,\nWhen lots were cast upon the forfeit place\nOf the condemned soul.  Abide thou then;\nThy punishment of right is merited:\nAnd look thou well to that ill-gotten coin,\nWhich against Charles thy hardihood inspir'd.\nIf reverence of the keys restrain'd me not,\nWhich thou in happier time didst hold, I yet\nSeverer speech might use.  Your avarice\nO'ercasts the world with mourning, under foot\nTreading the good, and raising bad men up.\nOf shepherds, like to you, th' Evangelist\nWas ware, when her, who sits upon the waves,\nWith kings in filthy whoredom he beheld,\nShe who with seven heads tower'd at her birth,\nAnd from ten horns her proof of glory drew,\nLong as her spouse in virtue took delight.\nOf gold and silver ye have made your god,\nDiff'ring wherein from the idolater,\nBut he that worships one, a hundred ye?\nAh, Constantine! to how much ill gave birth,\nNot thy conversion, but that plenteous dower,\nWhich the first wealthy Father gain'd from thee!\"\n\nMeanwhile, as thus I sung, he, whether wrath\nOr conscience smote him, violent upsprang\nSpinning on either sole.  I do believe\nMy teacher well was pleas'd, with so compos'd\nA lip, he listen'd ever to the sound\nOf the true words I utter'd.  In both arms\nHe caught, and to his bosom lifting me\nUpward retrac'd the way of his descent.\n\nNor weary of his weight he press'd me close,\nTill to the summit of the rock we came,\nOur passage from the fourth to the fifth pier.\nHis cherish'd burden there gently he plac'd\nUpon the rugged rock and steep, a path\nNot easy for the clamb'ring goat to mount.\n\nThence to my view another vale appear'd\n\n\n\n\nCANTO XX\n\nAND now the verse proceeds to torments new,\nFit argument of this the twentieth strain\nOf the first song, whose awful theme records\nThe spirits whelm'd in woe.  Earnest I look'd\nInto the depth, that open'd to my view,\nMoisten'd with tears of anguish, and beheld\nA tribe, that came along the hollow vale,\nIn silence weeping: such their step as walk\nQuires chanting solemn litanies on earth.\n\nAs on them more direct mine eye descends,\nEach wondrously seem'd to be revers'd\nAt the neck-bone, so that the countenance\nWas from the reins averted: and because\nNone might before him look, they were compell'd\nTo' advance with backward gait.  Thus one perhaps\nHath been by force of palsy clean transpos'd,\nBut I ne'er saw it nor believe it so.\n\nNow, reader! think within thyself, so God\nFruit of thy reading give thee! how I long\nCould keep my visage dry, when I beheld\nNear me our form distorted in such guise,\nThat on the hinder parts fall'n from the face\nThe tears down-streaming roll'd.  Against a rock\nI leant and wept, so that my guide exclaim'd:\n\"What, and art thou too witless as the rest?\nHere pity most doth show herself alive,\nWhen she is dead.  What guilt exceedeth his,\nWho with Heaven's judgment in his passion strives?\nRaise up thy head, raise up, and see the man,\nBefore whose eyes earth gap'd in Thebes, when all\nCried out, 'Amphiaraus, whither rushest?\n'Why leavest thou the war?'  He not the less\nFell ruining far as to Minos down,\nWhose grapple none eludes.  Lo! how he makes\nThe breast his shoulders, and who once too far\nBefore him wish'd to see, now backward looks,\nAnd treads reverse his path.  Tiresias note,\nWho semblance chang'd, when woman he became\nOf male, through every limb transform'd, and then\nOnce more behov'd him with his rod to strike\nThe two entwining serpents, ere the plumes,\nThat mark'd the better sex, might shoot again.\n\n\"Aruns, with more his belly facing, comes.\nOn Luni's mountains'midst the marbles white,\nWhere delves Carrara's hind, who wons beneath,\nA cavern was his dwelling, whence the stars\nAnd main-sea wide in boundless view he held.\n\n\"The next, whose loosen'd tresses overspread\nHer bosom, which thou seest not (for each hair\nOn that side grows) was Manto, she who search'd\nThrough many regions, and at length her seat\nFix'd in my native land, whence a short space\nMy words detain thy audience.  When her sire\nFrom life departed, and in servitude\nThe city dedicate to Bacchus mourn'd,\nLong time she went a wand'rer through the world.\nAloft in Italy's delightful land\nA lake there lies, at foot of that proud Alp,\nThat o'er the Tyrol locks Germania in,\nIts name Benacus, which a thousand rills,\nMethinks, and more, water between the vale\nCamonica and Garda and the height\nOf Apennine remote.  There is a spot\nAt midway of that lake, where he who bears\nOf Trento's flock the past'ral staff, with him\nOf Brescia, and the Veronese, might each\nPassing that way his benediction give.\nA garrison of goodly site and strong\nPeschiera stands, to awe with front oppos'd\nThe Bergamese and Brescian, whence the shore\nMore <DW72> each way descends.  There, whatsoev'er\nBenacus' bosom holds not, tumbling o'er\nDown falls, and winds a river flood beneath\nThrough the green pastures.

To shun\nAll human converse, here she with her slaves\nPlying her arts remain'd, and liv'd, and left\nHer body tenantless.  Thenceforth the tribes,\nWho round were scatter'd, gath'ring to that place\nAssembled; for its strength was great, enclos'd\nOn all parts by the fen.  On those dead bones\nThey rear'd themselves a city, for her sake,\nCalling it Mantua, who first chose the spot,\nNor ask'd another omen for the name,\nWherein more numerous the people dwelt,\nEre Casalodi's madness by deceit\nWas wrong'd of Pinamonte.  If thou hear\nHenceforth another origin assign'd\nOf that my country, I forewarn thee now,\nThat falsehood none beguile thee of the truth.\"\n\nI answer'd: \"Teacher, I conclude thy words\nSo certain, that all else shall be to me\nAs embers lacking life.  But now of these,\nWho here proceed, instruct me, if thou see\nAny that merit more especial note.\nFor thereon is my mind alone intent.\"\n\nHe straight replied: \"That spirit, from whose cheek\nThe beard sweeps o'er his shoulders brown, what time\nGraecia was emptied of her males, that scarce\nThe cradles were supplied, the seer was he\nIn Aulis, who with Calchas gave the sign\nWhen first to cut the cable.  Him they nam'd\nEurypilus: so sings my tragic strain,\nIn which majestic measure well thou know'st,\nWho know'st it all.  That other, round the loins\nSo slender of his shape, was Michael Scot,\nPractis'd in ev'ry slight of magic wile.\n\n\"Guido Bonatti see: Asdente mark,\nWho now were willing, he had tended still\nThe thread and cordwain; and too late repents.\n\n\"See next the wretches, who the needle left,\nThe shuttle and the spindle, and became\nDiviners: baneful witcheries they wrought\nWith images and herbs.  But onward now:\nFor now doth Cain with fork of thorns confine\nOn either hemisphere, touching the wave\nBeneath the towers of Seville.  Yesternight\nThe moon was round.  Thou mayst remember well:\nFor she good service did thee in the gloom\nOf the deep wood.\"  This said, both onward mov'd.\n\n\n\n\nCANTO XXI\n\nTHUS we from bridge to bridge, with other talk,\nThe which my drama cares not to rehearse,\nPass'd on; and to the summit reaching, stood\nTo view another gap, within the round\nOf Malebolge, other bootless pangs.\n\nMarvelous darkness shadow'd o'er the place.\n\nIn the Venetians' arsenal as boils\nThrough wintry months tenacious pitch, to smear\nTheir unsound vessels; for th' inclement time\nSea-faring men restrains, and in that while\nHis bark one builds anew, another stops\nThe ribs of his, that hath made many a voyage;\nOne hammers at the prow, one at the poop;\nThis shapeth oars, that other cables twirls,\nThe mizen one repairs and main-sail rent\nSo not by force of fire but art divine\nBoil'd here a glutinous thick mass, that round\nLim'd all the shore beneath.  I that beheld,\nBut therein nought distinguish'd, save the surge,\nRais'd by the boiling, in one mighty swell\nHeave, and by turns subsiding and fall.  While there\nI fix'd my ken below, \"Mark! mark!\" my guide\nExclaiming, drew me towards him from the place,\nWherein I stood.  I turn'd myself as one,\nImpatient to behold that which beheld\nHe needs must shun, whom sudden fear unmans,\nThat he his flight delays not for the view.\nBehind me I discern'd a devil black,\nThat running, up advanc'd along the rock.\nAh! what fierce cruelty his look bespake!\nIn act how bitter did he seem, with wings\nBuoyant outstretch'd and feet of nimblest tread!\nHis shoulder proudly eminent and sharp\nWas with a sinner charg'd; by either haunch\nHe held him, the foot's sinew griping fast.\n\n\"Ye of our bridge!\" he cried, \"keen-talon'd fiends!\nLo! one of Santa Zita's elders!  Him\nWhelm ye beneath, while I return for more.\nThat land hath store of such.  All men are there,\nExcept Bonturo, barterers: of 'no'\nFor lucre there an 'aye' is quickly made.\"\n\nHim dashing down, o'er the rough rock he turn'd,\nNor ever after thief a mastiff loos'd\nSped with like eager haste.  That other sank\nAnd forthwith writing to the surface rose.\nBut those dark demons, shrouded by the bridge,\nCried \"Here the hallow'd visage saves not: here\nIs other swimming than in Serchio's wave.\nWherefore if thou desire we rend thee not,\nTake heed thou mount not o'er the pitch.\"  This said,\nThey grappled him with more than hundred hooks,\nAnd shouted: \"Cover'd thou must sport thee here;\nSo, if thou canst, in secret mayst thou filch.\"\n\nE'en thus the cook bestirs him, with his grooms,\nTo thrust the flesh into the caldron down\nWith flesh-hooks, that it float not on the top.\n\nMe then my guide bespake: \"Lest they descry,\nThat thou art here, behind a craggy rock\nBend low and screen thee; and whate'er of force\nBe offer'd me, or insult, fear thou not:\nFor I am well advis'd, who have been erst\nIn the like fray.\"  Beyond the bridge's head\nTherewith he pass'd, and reaching the sixth pier,\nBehov'd him then a forehead terror-proof.\n\nWith storm and fury, as when dogs rush forth\nUpon the poor man's back, who suddenly\nFrom whence he standeth makes his suit; so rush'd\nThose from beneath the arch, and against him\nTheir weapons all they pointed.  He aloud:\n\"Be none of you outrageous: ere your time\nDare seize me, come forth from amongst you one,\n\n\"Who having heard my words, decide he then\nIf he shall tear these limbs.\"  They shouted loud,\n\"Go, Malacoda!\"  Whereat one advanc'd,\nThe others standing firm, and as he came,\n\"What may this turn avail him?\" he exclaim'd.\n\n\"Believ'st thou, Malacoda!  I had come\nThus far from all your skirmishing secure,\"\nMy teacher answered, \"without will divine\nAnd destiny propitious?  Pass we then\nFor so Heaven's pleasure is, that I should lead\nAnother through this savage wilderness.\"\n\nForthwith so fell his pride, that he let drop\nThe instrument of torture at his feet,\nAnd to the rest exclaim'd: \"We have no power\nTo strike him.\"  Then to me my guide: \"O thou!\nWho on the bridge among the crags dost sit\nLow crouching, safely now to me return.\"\n\nI rose, and towards him moved with speed: the fiends\nMeantime all forward drew: me terror seiz'd\nLest they should break the compact they had made.\nThus issuing from Caprona, once I saw\nTh' infantry dreading, lest his covenant\nThe foe should break; so close he hemm'd them round.\n\nI to my leader's side adher'd, mine eyes\nWith fixt and motionless observance bent\nOn their unkindly visage.  They their hooks\nProtruding, one the other thus bespake:\n\"Wilt thou I touch him on the hip?\"  To whom\nWas answer'd: \"Even so; nor miss thy aim.\"\n\nBut he, who was in conf'rence with my guide,\nTurn'd rapid round, and thus the demon spake:\n\"Stay, stay thee, Scarmiglione!\"  Then to us\nHe added: \"Further footing to your step\nThis rock affords not, shiver'd to the base\nOf the sixth arch.  But would you still proceed,\nUp by this cavern go: not distant far,\nAnother rock will yield you passage safe.\nYesterday, later by five hours than now,\nTwelve hundred threescore years and six had fill'd\nThe circuit of their course, since here the way\nWas broken.  Thitherward I straight dispatch\nCertain of these my scouts, who shall espy\nIf any on the surface bask.  With them\nGo ye: for ye shall find them nothing fell.\nCome Alichino forth,\" with that he cried,\n\"And Calcabrina, and Cagnazzo thou!\nThe troop of ten let Barbariccia lead.\nWith Libicocco Draghinazzo haste,\nFang'd Ciriatto, Grafflacane fierce,\nAnd Farfarello, and mad Rubicant.\nSearch ye around the bubbling tar.

(Wilson) Oliphant\n\n\n\n\nA LITTLE PILGRIM.\n\n\n\n\nI.\n\nIN THE UNSEEN.\n\n\nShe had been talking of dying only the evening before, with a friend, and\nhad described her own sensations after a long illness when she had been\nat the point of death. \"I suppose,\" she said, \"that I was as nearly gone\nas any one ever was to come back again. There was no pain in it, only a\nsense of sinking down, down--through the bed as if nothing could hold me\nor give me support enough--but no pain.\" And then they had spoken of\nanother friend in the same circumstances, who also had come back from the\nvery verge, and who described her sensations as those of one floating\nupon a summer sea without pain or suffering, in a lovely nook of the\nMediterranean, blue as the sky. These soft and soothing images of the\npassage which all men dread had been talked over with low voices, yet\nwith smiles and a grateful sense that \"the warm precincts of the cheerful\nday\" were once more familiar to both. And very cheerfully she went to\nrest that night, talking of what was to be done on the morrow, and fell\nasleep sweetly in her little room, with its shaded light and curtained\nwindow, and little pictures on the dim walls. All was quiet in the house:\nsoft breathing of the sleepers, soft murmuring of the spring wind\noutside, a wintry moon very clear and full in the skies, a little town\nall hushed and quiet, everything lying defenceless, unconscious, in the\nsafe keeping of God.\n\nHow soon she woke no one can tell. She woke and lay quite still, half\nroused, half hushed, in that soft languor that attends a happy waking.\nShe was happy always, in the peace of a heart that was humble and\nfaithful and pure, but yet had been used to wake to a consciousness of\nlittle pains and troubles, such as even to her meekness were sometimes\nhard to bear. But on this morning there were none of these. She lay in a\nkind of hush of happiness and ease, not caring to make any further\nmovement, lingering over the sweet sensation of that waking. She had no\ndesire to move nor to break the spell of the silence and peace. It was\nstill very early, she supposed, and probably it might be hours yet before\nany one came to call her. It might even be that she should sleep again.\nShe had no wish to move, she lay at such luxurious ease and calm. But by\nand by, as she came to full possession of her waking senses, it appeared\nto her that there was some change in the atmosphere, in the scene. There\nbegan to steal into the air about her, the soft dawn as of a summer\nmorning, the lovely blueness of the first opening of daylight before the\nsun. It could not be the light of the moon, which she had seen before she\nwent to bed; and all was so still, that it could not be the bustling,\nwintry day which comes at that time of the year late, to find the world\nawake before it. This was different; it was like the summer dawn, a soft\nsuffusion of light growing every moment. And by and by it occurred to\nher that she was not in the little room where she had lain down. There\nwere no dim walls or roof, her little pictures were all gone, the\ncurtains at her window. The discovery gave her no uneasiness in that\ndelightful calm. She lay still to think of it all, to wonder, yet\nundisturbed. It half amused her that these things should be changed, but\ndid not rouse her yet with any shock of alteration. The light grew fuller\nand fuller round, growing into day, clearing her eyes from the sweet mist\nof the first waking. Then she raised herself upon her arm. She was not in\nher room, she was in no scene she knew. Indeed it was scarcely a scene at\nall, nothing but light, so soft and lovely, that it soothed and caressed\nher eyes. She thought all at once of a summer morning when she was a\nchild, when she had woke in the deep night which yet was day, early, so\nearly that the birds were scarcely astir, and had risen up with a\ndelicious sense of daring and of being all alone in the mystery of the\nsunrise, in the unawakened world which lay at her feet to be explored, as\nif she were Eve just entering upon Eden. It was curious how all those\nchildish sensations, long forgotten, came back to her as she found\nherself so unexpectedly out of her sleep in the open air and light. In\nthe recollection of that lovely hour, with a smile at herself, so\ndifferent as she now knew herself to be, she was moved to rise and look a\nlittle more closely about her, and see where she was.\n\nWhen I call her a little Pilgrim, I do not mean that she was a child; on\nthe contrary, she was not even young. She was little by nature, with as\nlittle flesh and blood as was consistent with mortal life; and she was\none of those who are always little for love. The tongue found diminutives\nfor her, the heart kept her in a perpetual youth. She was so modest and\nso gentle, that she always came last, so long as there was any one whom\nshe could put before her. But this little body, and the soul which was\nnot little, and the heart which was big and great, had known all the\nround of sorrows that fill a woman's life, without knowing any of its\nwarmer blessings. She had nursed the sick, she had entertained the weary,\nshe had consoled the dying. She had gone about the world, which had no\nprize or recompense for her, with a smile. Her little presence had been\nalways bright. She was not clever; you might have said she had no mind at\nall; but so wise and right and tender a heart, that it was as good as\ngenius. This is to let you know what this little Pilgrim had been.\n\nShe rose up, and it was strange how like she felt to the child she\nremembered in that still summer morning so many years ago. Her little\nbody, which had been worn and racked with pain, felt as light and\nunconscious of itself as then. She took her first step forward with the\nsame sense of pleasure, yet of awe, suppressed delight and daring and\nwild adventure, yet perfect safety. But then the recollection of the\nlittle room in which she had fallen asleep came quickly, strangely over\nher, confusing her mind. \"I must be dreaming, I suppose,\" she said to\nherself, regretfully; for it was all so sweet that she wished it to be\ntrue. Her movement called her attention to herself, and she found that\nshe was dressed, not in her night-dress, as she had lain down, but in a\ndress she did not know. She paused for a moment to look at it, and\nwonder. She had never seen it before; she did not make out how it was\nmade, or what stuff it was, but it fell so pleasantly about her, it was\nso soft and light, that in her confused state she abandoned that subject\nwith only an additional sense of pleasure. And now the atmosphere became\nmore distinct to her. She saw that under her feet was a greenness as of\nclose velvet turf, both cool and warm, cool and soft to touch, but with\nno damp in it, as might have been at that early hour, and with flowers\nshowing here and there. She stood looking round her, not able to identify\nthe landscape because she was still confused a little, and then walked\nsoftly on, all the time afraid lest she should awake and lose the\nsweetness of it all, and the sense of rest and happiness. She felt so\nlight, so airy, as if she could skim across the field like any child. It\nwas bliss enough to breathe and move, with every organ so free. After\nmore than fifty years of hard service in the world, to feel like this,\neven in a dream! She smiled to herself at her own pleasure; and then once\nmore, yet more potently, there came back upon her the appearance of her\nroom in which she had fallen asleep. How had she got from there to here?\nHad she been carried away in her sleep, or was it only a dream, and would\nshe by and by find herself between the four dim walls again? Then this\nshadow of recollection faded away once more, and she moved forward,\nwalking in a soft rapture over the delicious turf. Presently she came to\na little mound, upon which she paused to look about her. Every moment she\nsaw a little farther: blue hills far away, extending in long, sweet\ndistance, an indefinite landscape, but fair and vast, so that there could\nbe seen no end to it, not even the line of the horizon,--save at one\nside, where there seemed to be a great shadowy gateway, and something dim\nbeyond. She turned from the brightness to look at this, and when she had\nlooked for some time, she saw, what pleased her still more, though she\nhad been so happy before, people coming in. They were too far off for her\nto see clearly, but many came each apart, one figure only at a time. To\nwatch them amused her in the delightful leisure of her mind. Who were\nthey? she wondered; but no doubt soon some of them would come this way,\nand she would see. Then suddenly she seemed to hear, as if in answer to\nher question, some one say, \"Those who are coming in are the people\nwho have died on earth.\" \"Died!\" she said to herself aloud, with a\nwondering sense of the inappropriateness of the word which almost came\nthe length of laughter. In this sweet air, with such a sense of life\nabout, to suggest such an idea was almost ludicrous. She was so occupied\nwith this, that she did not look round to see who the speaker might be.\nShe thought it over, amused, but with some new confusion of the mind.\nThen she said, \"Perhaps I have died too,\" with a laugh to herself at the\nabsurdity of the thought.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the other voice, echoing that gentle laugh of hers, \"you have\ndied too.\"\n\nShe turned round, and saw another standing by her, a woman, younger and\nfairer, and more stately than herself, but of so sweet a countenance that\nour little Pilgrim felt no shyness, but recognized a friend at once. She\nwas more occupied looking at this new face, and feeling herself at once\nso much happier (though she had been so happy before) in finding a\ncompanion who would tell her what everything was, than in considering\nwhat these words might mean. But just then once more the recollection of\nthe four walls, with their little pictures hanging, and the window with\nits curtains drawn, seemed to come round her for a moment, so that her\nwhole soul was in a confusion. And as this vision slowly faded away\n(though she could not tell which was the vision, the darkened room or\nthis lovely light), her attention came back to the words at which she\nhad laughed, and at which the other had laughed as she repeated them.\nDied?--was it possible that this could be the meaning of it all? \"Died?\"\nshe said, looking with wonder in her companion's face, which smiled back\nto her.\n\n\"But do you mean--You cannot mean--I have never been so well: I am so\nstrong: I have no trouble--anywhere: I am full of life.\"\n\nThe other nodded her beautiful head with a more beautiful smile, and the\nlittle Pilgrim burst out in a great cry of joy, and said,--\"Is this all?\nIs it over?--Is it all over? Is it possible that this can be all?\"\n\n\"Were you afraid of it?\" the other said. There was a little agitation for\nthe moment in her heart. She was so glad, so relieved and thankful, that\nit took away her breath. She could not get over the wonder of it.\n\n\"To think one should look forward to it so long, and wonder, and be even\nunhappy trying to divine what it will be--and this all!\"\n\n\"Ah, but the angel was very gentle with you,\" said the young woman; \"you\nwere so tender and worn, that he only smiled and took you sleeping. There\nare other ways. But it is always wonderful to think it is over, as you\nsay.\"\n\nThe little Pilgrim could do nothing but talk of it, as one does after a\nvery great event. \"Are you sure, quite sure, it is so?\" she said. \"It\nwould be dreadful to find it only a dream, to go to sleep again, and wake\nup--there--\" This thought troubled her for a moment. The vision of the\nbedchamber came back; but this time she felt it was only a vision. \"Were\nyou afraid too?\" she said, in a low voice.\n\n\"I never thought of it at all,\" the beautiful stranger said; \"I did not\nthink it would come to me. But I was very sorry for the others to whom it\ncame, and grudged that they should lose the beautiful earth, and life,\nand all that was so sweet.\"\n\n\"My dear!\" cried the Pilgrim, as if she had never died, \"oh, but this is\nfar sweeter! And the heart is so light, and it is, happiness only to\nbreathe. Is it heaven here? It must be heaven.\"\n\n\"I do not know if it is heaven. We have so many things to learn. They\ncannot tell you every thing at once,\" said the beautiful lady. \"I have\nseen some of the people I was sorry for, and when I told them, we\nlaughed--as you and I laughed just now--for pleasure.\"\n\n\"That makes me think\" said the little Pilgrim; \"if I have died, as you\nsay--which is so strange, and me so living--if I have died, they will\nhave found it out. The house will be all dark, and they will be breaking\ntheir hearts. Oh, how could I forget them in my selfishness, and be\nhappy! I so light-hearted, while they--\"\n\nShe sat down hastily, and covered her face with her hands and wept. The\nother looked at her for a moment, then kissed her for comfort, and cried\ntoo. The two happy creatures sat there weeping together, thinking of\nthose they had left behind, with an exquisite grief which was not\nunhappiness, which was sweet with love and pity. \"And oh,\" said the\nlittle Pilgrim, \"what can we do to tell them not to grieve? Cannot\nyou send? cannot you speak? cannot one go to tell them?\"\n\nThe heavenly stranger shook her head.\n\n\"It is not well, they all say. Sometimes one has been permitted; but they\ndo not know you,\" she said, with a pitiful look in her sweet eyes. \"My\nmother told me that her heart was so sick for me, she was allowed to go;\nand she went and stood by me, and spoke to me, and I did not know her.\nShe came back so sad and sorry, that they took her at once to our\nFather; and there, you know, she found that it was all well. All is well\nwhen you are there.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said the little Pilgrim, \"I have been thinking of other things. Of\nhow happy I was, and of _them_; but never of the Father,--just as\nif I had not died.\"\n\nThe other smiled upon her with a wonderful smile.\n\n\"Do you think he will be offended--our Father--as if he were one of us?\"\nshe said.\n\nAnd then the little Pilgrim, in her sudden grief to have forgotten him,\nbecame conscious of a new rapture unexplainable in words. She felt his\nunderstanding to envelop her little spirit with a soft and clear\npenetration, and that nothing she did or said could ever be misconceived\nmore. \"Will you take me to him?\" she said, trembling yet glad, clasping\nher hands. And once again the other shook her head.\n\n\"They will take us both when it is time,\" she said: \"we do not go at our\nown will. But I have seen our Brother--\"\n\n\"Oh, take me to him!\" the little Pilgrim cried. \"Let me see his face! I\nhave so many things to say to him. I want to ask him--Oh, take me to\nwhere I can see his face!\"\n\nAnd then once again the heavenly lady smiled.\n\n\"I have seen him,\" she said. \"He is always about--now here, now there. He\nwill come and see you, perhaps when you are not thinking. But when he\npleases. We do not think here of what we will--\"\n\nThe little Pilgrim sat very still, wondering at all this. She had thought\nwhen a soul left the earth that it went at once to God, and thought of\nnothing more, except worship and singing of praises. But this was\ndifferent from her thoughts. She sat and pondered and wondered. She was\nbaffled at many points. She was not changed, as she expected, but so much\nlike herself; still--still perplexed, and feeling herself foolish; not\nunderstanding: toiling after a something which she could not grasp. The\nonly difference was that it was no trouble to her now. She smiled at\nherself and at her dullness, feeling sure that by and by she would\nunderstand.\n\n\"And don't you wonder too?\" she said to her companion, which was a speech\nsuch as she used to make upon the earth, when people thought her little\nremarks disjointed, and did not always see the connection of them. But\nher friend of heaven knew what she meant.\n\n\"I do nothing but wonder,\" she said, \"for it is all so natural, not what\nwe thought.\"\n\n\"Is it long since you have been here?\" the Pilgrim said.\n\n\"I came before you; but how long or how short I cannot tell, for that is\nnot how we count. We count only by what happens to us. And nothing yet\nhas happened to me, except that I have seen our Brother. My mother sees\nhim always. That means she has lived here a long time, and well--\"\n\n\"Is it possible to live ill--in heaven?\" The little Pilgrim's eyes grew\nlarge, as if they were going to have tears in them, and a little shadow\nseemed to come over her. But the other laughed softly, and restored all\nher confidence.\n\n\"I have told you I do not know if it is heaven or not. No one does ill,\nbut some do little, and some do much, just as it used to be. Do you\nremember in Dante there was a lazy spirit that stayed about the gates and\nnever got farther? But perhaps you never read that.\"\n\n\"I was not clever,\" said the little Pilgrim, wistfully; \"no, I never read\nit. I wish I had known more.\"\n\nUpon which the beautiful lady kissed her again to give her courage, and\nsaid,--\n\n\"It does not matter at all. It all comes to you, whether you have known\nit or not.\"\n\n\"Then your mother came here long ago?\" said the Pilgrim. \"Ah, then I\nshall see my mother too.\"\n\n\"Oh, very soon, as soon as she can come; but there are so many things to\ndo. Sometimes we can go and meet those who are coming; but it is not\nalways so. I remember that she had a message. She could not leave her\nbusiness, you may be sure, or she would have been here.\"\n\n\"Then you know my mother? Oh, and my dearest father too?\"\n\n\"We all know each other,\" the lady said with a smile.\n\n\"And you? did you come to meet me--only out of kindness, though I do not\nknow you?\" the little Pilgrim said.\n\n\"I am nothing but an idler,\" said the beautiful lady, \"making\nacquaintance. I am of little use as yet. I was very hard worked before I\ncame here, and they think it well that we should sit in the sun and take\na little rest, and find things out.\"\n\nThen the little Pilgrim sat still and mused, and felt in her heart that\nshe had found many things out. What she had heard had been wonderful, and\nit was more wonderful still to be sitting here all alone, save for this\nlady, yet so happy and at ease. She wanted to sing, she was so happy;\nbut remembered that she was old; and had lost her voice; and then\nremembered again that she was no longer old, and perhaps had found it\nagain. And then it occurred to her to remember how she had learned to\nsing, and how beautiful her sister's voice was, and how heavenly to\nhear her,--which made her remember that this dear sister would be\nweeping, not singing, down where she had come from; and immediately the\ntears stood in her eyes.\n\n\"Oh,\" she said, \"I never thought we should cry when we came here. I\nthought there were no tears in heaven.\"\n\n\"Did you think, then, that we were all turned into stone?\" cried the\nbeautiful lady. \"It says God shall wipe away all tears from our faces,\nwhich is not like saying there are to be no tears.\"\n\nUpon which the little Pilgrim, glad that it was permitted to be sorry,\nthough she was so happy, allowed herself to think upon the place she had\nso lately left. And she seemed to see her little room again, with all the\npictures hanging as she had left them, and the house darkened, and the\ndear faces she knew all sad and troubled, and to hear them saying over to\neach other all the little careless words she had said as if they were out\nof the Scriptures, and crying if any one but mentioned her name, and\nputting on crape and black dresses, and lamenting as if that which had\nhappened was something very terrible. She cried at this, and yet felt\nhalf inclined to laugh, but would not, because it would be disrespectful\nto those she loved. One thing did not occur to her, and that was, that\nthey would be carrying her body, which she had left behind her, away to\nthe grave. She did not think of this, because she was not aware of the\nloss, and felt far too much herself to think that there was another part\nof her being buried in the ground. From this she was aroused by her\ncompanion asking her a question.\n\n\"Have you left many there?\" she said.\n\n\"No one,\" said the little Pilgrim, \"to whom I was the first on earth; but\nthey loved me all the same; and if I could only, only let them know--\"\n\n\"But I left one to whom I was the first on earth,\" said the other, with\ntears in her beautiful eyes; \"and oh, how glad I should be to be less\nhappy if he might be less sad!\"\n\n\"And you cannot go? you cannot go to him and tell him? Oh, I wish,\" cried\nthe little Pilgrim; but then she paused, for the wish died all away in\nher heart into a tender love for this poor, sorrowful man whom she did\nnot know. This gave her the sweetest pang she had ever felt, for she knew\nthat all was well, and yet was so sorry, and would have willingly given\nup her happiness for his. All this the lady read in her eyes or her\nheart, and loved her for it; and they took hands and were silent\ntogether, thinking of those they had left, as we upon earth think of\nthose who have gone from us, but only with far more understanding and far\ngreater love. \"And have you never been able to do anything for him?\" our\nPilgrim said.\n\nThen the beautiful lady's face flushed all over with the most heavenly\nwarmth and light. Her smile ran over like the bursting out of the sun.\n\n\"Oh, I will tell you,\" she said. \"There was a moment when he was very sad\nand perplexed, not knowing what to think; there was something he could\nnot understand. Nor could I understand, nor did I know what it was, until\nit was said to me, 'You may go and tell him.' And I went in the early\nmorning before he was awake, and kissed him, and said it in his ear. He\nwoke up in a moment, and understood, and everything was clear to him.\nAfterward I heard him say, 'It is true that the night brings counsel. I\nhad been troubled and distressed all day long, but in the morning it was\nquite clear to me.' And the other answered, 'Your brain was refreshed,\nand that made your judgment clear.' But they never knew it was I! That\nwas a great delight. The dear souls, they are so foolish,\" she cried,\nwith the sweetest laughter, that ran into tears. \"One cries because one\nis so happy; it is just a silly old habit,\" she said.\n\n\"And you were not grieved--it did not hurt you--that he did not know--\"\n\n\"Oh, not then, not then! I did not go to him for that. When you have been\nhere a little longer, you will see the difference. When you go for\nyourself, out of impatience, because it still seems to you that you must\nknow best, and they don't know you, then it strikes to your heart; but\nwhen you go to help them,--ah,\" she cried, \"when he comes, how much I\nshall have to tell him! 'You thought it was sleep, when it was I; when\nyou woke so fresh and clear, it was I that kissed you; you thought it\nyour duty to me to be sad afterward, and were angry with yourself because\nyou had wronged me of the first thoughts of your waking--when it was all\nme, all through!'\"\n\n\"I begin to understand,\" said the little Pilgrim. \"But why should they\nnot see us, and why should not we tell them? It would seem so natural. If\nthey saw us, it would make them so happy and so sure.\"\n\nUpon this the lady shook her head.\n\n\"The worst of it is not that they are not sure, it is the parting. If\nthis makes us sorry here, how can they escape the sorrow of it, even if\nthey saw us?--for we must be parted. We cannot go back to live with them,\nor why should we have died? And then we must all live our lives, they in\ntheir way, we in ours. We must not weigh them down, but only help them\nwhen it is seen that there is need for it. All this we shall know better\nby and by.\"\n\n\"You make it so clear, and your face is so bright,\" said our little\nPilgrim gratefully, \"you must have known a great deal, and understood\neven when you were in the world.\"\n\n\"I was as foolish as I could be,\" said the other, with her laugh that was\nas sweet as music; \"yet thought I knew, and they thought I knew. But all\nthat does not matter now.\"\n\n\"I think it matters, for look how much you have showed me. But tell me\none thing more: how was it said to you that you must go and tell him? Was\nit some one who spoke? Was it--\"\n\nHer face grew so bright that all the past brightness was as a dull sky to\nthis. It gave out such a light of happiness, that the little Pilgrim was\ndazzled.\n\n\"I was wandering about,\" she said, \"to see this new place. My mother had\ncome back between two errands she had, and had come to see me and tell me\neverything; and I was straying about, wondering what I was to do, when\nsuddenly I saw some one coming along, as it might be now--\"\n\nShe paused and looked up, and the little Pilgrim looked up too, with her\nheart beating, but there was no one. Then she gave a little sigh, and\nturned and listened again.\n\n\"I had not been looking for him, or thinking. You know my mind is too\nlight; I am pleased with whatever is before me. And I was so curious, for\nmy mother had told me many things; when suddenly I caught sight of him\npassing by. He was going on, and when I saw this a panic seized me, lest\nhe should pass and say nothing. I do not know what I did. I flung myself\nupon his robe, and got hold of it,--or at least I think so. I was in such\nan agony lest he should pass and never notice me. But that was my folly.\nHe pass! As if that could be!\"\n\n\"And what did he say to you?\" cried the little Pilgrim, her heart almost\naching, it beat so high with sympathy and expectation.\n\nThe lady looked at her for a little without saying anything.\n\n\"I cannot tell you,\" she said, \"any more than I can tell if this is\nheaven. It is a mystery. When you see him you will know. It will be all\nyou have ever hoped for, and more besides, for he understands everything.\nHe knows what is in our hearts about those we have left, and why he sent\nfor us before them. There is no need to tell him anything, he knows. He\nwill come when it is time; and after you have seen him you will know what\nto do.\"\n\nThen the beautiful lady turned her eyes toward the gate, and while the\nlittle Pilgrim was still gazing, disappeared from her, and went to\ncomfort some other stranger. They were dear friends always, and met\noften, but not again in the same way.\n\nWhen she was thus left alone again, the little Pilgrim sat still upon the\ngrassy mound, quite tranquil and happy, without wishing to move. There\nwas such a sense of well-being in her, that she liked to sit there and\nlook about her, and breathe the delightful air, like the air of a summer\nmorning, without wishing for anything.\n\n\"How idle I am!\" she said to herself, in the very words she had often\nused before she died; but then she was idle from weakness, and now from\nhappiness. She wanted for nothing. To be alive was so sweet. There was a\ngreat deal to think about in what she had heard, but she did not even\nthink about that, only resigned herself to the delight of sitting there\nin the sweet air and being happy. Many people were coming and going, and\nthey all knew her, and smiled upon her, and those who were at a distance\nwould wave their hands. This did not surprise her at all, for though she\nwas a stranger, she too felt that she knew them all; but that they should\nbe so kind was a delight to her which words could not tell. She sat and\nmused very sweetly about all that had been told her, and wondered whether\nshe too might go sometimes, and with a kiss and a whisper clear up\nsomething that was dark in the mind of some one who loved her. \"I that\nnever was clever!\" she said to herself, with a smile. And chiefly she\nthought of a friend whom she loved, who was often in great perplexity,\nand did not know how to guide herself amid the difficulties of the world.\n\nThe little Pilgrim half laughed with delight, and then half cried with\nlonging to go, as the beautiful lady had done, and make something clear\nthat had been dark before, to this friend. As she was thinking what a\npleasure it would be, some one came up to her, crossing over the flowery\ngreenness, leaving the path on purpose. This was a being younger than the\nlady who had spoken to her before, with flowing hair all crisped with\ntouches of sunshine, and a dress all white and soft, like the feathers of\na white dove. There was something in her face different from that of the\nother, by which the little Pilgrim knew somehow, without knowing how,\nthat she had come here as a child, and grown up in this celestial place.\nShe was tall and fair, and came along with so musical a motion, as if her\nfoot scarcely touched the ground, that she might have had wings: and the\nlittle Pilgrim indeed was not sure as she watched, whether it might not\nperhaps be an angel; for she knew that there were angels among the\nblessed people who were coming and going about, but had not been able yet\nto find one out. She knew that this new-comer was coming to her, and\nturned towards her with a smile and a throb at her heart of expectation.\nBut when the heavenly maiden drew nearer, her face, though it was so\nfair, looked to the Pilgrim like another face, which she had known very\nwell,--indeed, like the homely and troubled face of the friend of whom\nshe had been thinking. And so she smiled all the more, and held out her\nhands and said, \"I am sure I know you;\" upon which the other kissed her\nand said, \"We all know each other; but I have seen you often before\nyou came here,\" and knelt down by her, among the flowers that were\ngrowing, just in front of some tall lilies that grew over her, and made\na lovely canopy over her head. There was something in her face that was\nlike a child: her mouth so soft, as if it had never spoken anything but\nheavenly words, her eyes brown and golden, as if they were filled with\nlight. She took the little Pilgrim's hands in hers, and held them and\nsmoothed them between her own. These hands had been very thin and worn\nbefore, but now, when the Pilgrim looked at them, she saw that they\nbecame softer and whiter every moment with the touch of this immortal\nyouth.\n\n\"I knew you were coming,\" said the maiden; \"when my mother has wanted me\nI have seen you there. And you were thinking of her now that was how I\nfound you.\"\n\n\"Do you know, then, what one thinks?\" said the little Pilgrim, with\nwondering eyes.\n\n\"It is in the air; and when it concerns us it comes to us like the\nbreeze. But we who are the children here, we feel it more quickly than\nyou.\"\n\n\"Are you a child?\" said the little Pilgrim, \"or are you an angel?\nSometimes you are like a child; but then your face shines, and you are\nlike--You must have some name for it here; there is nothing among the\nwords I know.\" And then she paused a little, still looking at her, and\ncried, \"Oh, if she could but see you, little Margaret! That would do her\nmost good of all.\"\n\nThen the maiden Margaret shook her lovely head. \"What does her most good\nis the will of the Father,\" she said.\n\nAt this the little Pilgrim felt once more that thrill of expectation and\nawe. \"Oh, child, you have seen him?\" she cried.\n\nAnd the other smiled. \"Have you forgotten who they are that always behold\nhis face? We have never had any fear or trembling. We are not angels, and\nthere is no other name; we are the children. There is something given to\nus beyond the others. We have had no other home.\"\n\n\"Oh, tell me, tell me!\" the little Pilgrim cried.\n\nUpon this Margaret kissed her, putting her soft cheek against hers, and\nsaid; \"It is a mystery; it cannot be put into words; in your time you\nwill know.\"\n\n\"When you touch me you change me, and I grow like you,\" the Pilgrim said.\n\"Ah, if she could see us together, you and me! And will you go to her\nsoon again? And do you see them always, what they are doing? and take\ncare of them?\"\n\n\"It is our Father who takes cares of them, and our Lord who is our\nBrother. I do his errands when I am able. Sometimes he will let me go,\nsometimes another, according as it is best. Who am I that I should take\ncare of them? I serve them when I may.\"\n\n\"But you do not forget them?\" the Pilgrim said, with wistful eyes.\n\n\"We love them always,\" said Margaret. She was more still than the lady\nwho had first spoken with the Pilgrim. Her countenance was full of a\nheavenly calm. It had never known passion nor anguish. Sometimes there\nwas in it a far-seeing look of vision, sometimes the simplicity of a\nchild. \"But what are we in comparison? For he loves them more than we do.\nWhen he keeps us from them, it is for love. We must each live our own\nlife.\"\n\n\"But it is hard for them sometimes,\" said the little Pilgrim, who could\nnot withdraw her thoughts from those she had left.\n\n\"They are never forsaken,\" said the angel maiden.\n\n\"But oh! there are worse things than sorrow,\" the little Pilgrim said;\n\"there is wrong, there is evil, Margaret. Will not he send you to step in\nbefore them, to save them from wrong?\"\n\n\"It is not for us to judge,\" said the young Margaret, with eyes full of\nheavenly wisdom; \"our Brother has it all in his hand. We do not read\ntheir hearts, like him. Sometimes you are permitted to see the battle--\"\n\nThe little Pilgrim covered her eyes with her hands. \"I could not--I could\nnot; unless I knew they were to win the day!\"\n\n\"They will win the day in the end. But sometimes, when it was being lost,\nI have seen in his face a something--I cannot tell--more love than\nbefore. Something that seemed to say, 'My child, my child, would that I\ncould do it for thee, my child!'\"\n\n\"Oh! that is what I have always felt,\" cried the Pilgrim, clasping her\nhands; her eyes were dim, her heart for a moment almost forgot its\nblessedness. \"But he could; oh, little Margaret, he could! You have\nforgotten, 'Lord; if thou wilt thou canst--'\"\n\nThe child of heaven looked at her mutely, with sweet, grave eyes, in\nwhich there was much that confused her who was a stranger here, and once\nmore softly shook her head.\n\n\"Is it that he will not then?\" said the other with a low voice of awe.\n\"Our Lord, who died--he--\"\n\n\"Listen!\" said the other; \"I hear his step on the way.\"\n\nThe little Pilgrim rose up from the mound on which she was sitting. Her\nsoul was confused with wonder and fear. She had thought that an angel\nmight step between a soul on earth and sin, and that if one but prayed\nand prayed, the dear Lord would stand between and deliver the tempted.\nShe had meant when she saw his face to ask him to save. Was not he born,\ndid not he live and die, to save? The angel maiden looked at her all the\nwhile with eyes that understood all her perplexity and her doubt, but\nspoke not. Thus it was that before the Lord came to her, the sweetness of\nher first blessedness was obscured, and she found that here too, even\nhere, though in a moment she should see him, there was need for faith.\nYoung Margaret, who had been kneeling by her, rose up too and stood among\nthe lilies, waiting, her soft countenance shining, her eyes turned\ntowards him who was coming. Upon her there was no cloud nor doubt. She\nwas one of the children of that land familiar with his presence. And\nin the air there was a sound such as those who hear it alone can\ndescribe,--a sound as of help coming and safety, like the sound of a\ndeliverer when one is in deadly danger, like the sound of a conqueror,\nlike the step of the dearest beloved coming home. As it came nearer, the\nfear melted away out of the beating heart of the Pilgrim. Who could fear\nso near him? Her breath went away from her, her heart out of her bosom to\nmeet his coming. Oh, never fear could live where he was! Her soul was all\nconfused, but it was with hope and joy. She held out her hands in that\namaze, and dropped upon her knees, not knowing what she did.\n\nHe was going about his Father's business, not lingering, yet neither\nmaking haste; and the calm and peace which the little Pilgrim had seen in\nthe faces of the blessed were but reflections from the majestic\ngentleness of the countenance to which, all quivering with happiness and\nwonder, she lifted up her eyes. Many things there had been in her mind to\nsay to him. She wanted to ask for those she loved some things which\nperhaps he had overlooked. She wanted to say, \"Send me.\" It seemed to her\nthat here was the occasion she had longed for all her life. Oh, how many\ntimes had she wished to be able to go to him, to fall at his feet, to\nshow him something which had been left undone, something which perhaps\nfor her asking he would remember to do. But when this dream of her life\nwas fulfilled, and the little Pilgrim, kneeling, and all shaken and\ntrembling with devotion and joy, was at his feet, lifting her face to\nhim, seeing him, hearing him--then she said nothing to him at all. She\nno longer wanted to say anything, or wanted anything except what he\nchose, or had power to think of anything except that all was well, and\neverything--everything as it should be in his hand. It seemed to her that\nall that she had ever hoped for was fulfilled when she met the look in\nhis eyes. At first it seemed too bright for her to meet; but next moment\nshe knew it was all that was needed to light up the world, and in it\neverything was clear. Her trembling ceased, her little frame grew\ninspired; though she still knelt, her head rose erect, drawn to him like\nthe flower to the sun. She could not tell how long it was, nor what was\nsaid, nor if it was in words. All that she knew was that she told him all\nthat ever she had thought, or wished, or intended in all her life,\nalthough she said nothing at all; and that he opened all things to her,\nand showed her that everything was well, and no one forgotten; and that\nthe things she would have told him of were more near his heart than hers,\nand those to whom she wanted to be sent were in his own hand. But whether\nthis passed with words or without words, she could not tell. Her soul\nexpanded under his eyes like a flower. It opened out, it comprehended and\nfelt and knew. She smote her hands together in her wonder that she could\nhave missed seeing what was so clear, and laughed with a sweet scorn at\nher folly, as two people who love each other laugh at the little\nmisunderstanding that has parted them. She was bold with him, though she\nwas so timid by nature, and ventured to laugh at herself, not to reproach\nherself; for his divine eyes spoke no blame, but smiled upon her folly\ntoo. And then he laid a hand upon her head, which seemed to fill her with\ncurrents of strength and joy running through all her veins. And then she\nseemed to come to herself, saying loud out, \"And that I will! and that I\nwill!\" and lo, she was kneeling on the warm, soft sod alone, and hearing\nthe sound of his footsteps as he went about his Father's business,\nfilling all the air with echoes of blessing. And all the people who were\ncoming and going smiled upon her, and she knew they were all glad for her\nthat she had seen him, and got the desire of her heart. Some of them\nwaved their hands as they passed, and some paused a moment and spoke to\nher with tender congratulations. They seemed to have the tears in their\neyes for joy, remembering every one the first time they had themselves\nseen him, and the joy of it; so that all about there sounded a concord of\nhappy thoughts all echoing to each other, \"She has seen the Lord!\"\n\nWhy did she say, \"And that I will! and that I will!\" with such fervor and\ndelight? She could not have told, but yet she knew. The first thing was\nthat she had yet to wait and believe until all things should be\naccomplished, neither doubting nor fearing, but knowing that all should\nbe well; and the second was that she must delay no longer, but rise up\nand serve the Father according to what was given her as her reward. When\nshe had recovered a little of her rapture, she rose from her knees, and\nstood still for a little, to be sure which way she was to go. And she was\nnot aware what guided her, but yet turned her face in the appointed way\nwithout any doubt. For doubt was now gone away forever, and that fear\nthat once gave her so much trouble lest she might not be doing what was\nbest. As she moved along she wondered at herself more and more. She felt\nno longer, as at first, like the child she remembered to have been,\nventuring out in the awful lovely stillness of the morning before any one\nwas awake; but she felt that to move along was a delight, and that her\nfoot scarcely touched the grass. And her whole being was instinct with\nsuch lightness of strength and life, that it did not matter to her how\nfar she went, nor what she carried, nor if the way was easy or hard. The\nway she chose was one of those which led to the great gate, and many met\nher coming from thence, with looks that were somewhat bewildered, as if\nthey did not yet know whither they were going or what had happened to\nthem,--upon whom she smiled as she passed them with soft looks of\ntenderness and sympathy, knowing what they were feeling, but did not stop\nto explain to them, because she had something else that had been given\nher to do. For this is what always follows in that country when you meet\nthe Lord, that you instantly know what it is that he would have you do.\n\nThe little Pilgrim thus went on and on toward the gate, which she had not\nseen when she herself came through it, having been lifted in his arms by\nthe great Death Angel, and set down softly inside, so that she did not\nknow it, or even the shadow of it. As she drew nearer, the light became\nless bright, though very sweet, like a lovely dawn, and she wondered to\nherself to think that she had been here but a moment ago, and yet so much\nhad passed since then. And still she was not aware what was her errand,\nbut wondered if she was to go back by these same gates, and perhaps\nreturn where she had been. She went up to them very closely, for she was\ncurious to see the place through which she had come in her sleep,--as a\ntraveller goes back to see the city gate, with its bridge and portcullis,\nthrough which he has passed by night. The gate was very great, of a\nwonderful, curious architecture, having strange, delicate arches and\ncanopies above. Some parts of them seemed cut very clean and clear; but\nthe outlines were all softened with a sort of mist and shadow, so that it\nlooked greater and higher than it was. The lower part was not one great\ndoorway, as the Pilgrim had supposed, but had innumerable doors, all\nseparate and very narrow, so that but one could pass at a time, though\nthe arch inclosed all, and seemed filled with great folding gates, in\nwhich the smaller doors were set, so that if need arose a vast opening\nmight be made for many to enter. Of the little doors many were shut as\nthe Pilgrim approached; but from moment to moment one after another would\nbe pushed softly open from without, and some one would come in. The\nlittle Pilgrim looked at it all with great interest, wondering which of\nthe doors she herself had come by; but while she stood absorbed by this,\na door was suddenly pushed open close by her, and some one flung forward\ninto the blessed country, falling upon the ground, and stretched out wild\narms as though to clutch the very soil. This sight gave the Pilgrim a\ngreat surprise; for it was the first time she had heard any sound of\npain, or seen any sight of trouble, since she entered here. In that\nmoment she knew what it was that the dear Lord had given her to do. She\nhad no need to pause to think, for her heart told her; and she did not\nhesitate, as she might have done in the other life, not knowing what to\nsay. She went forward and gathered this poor creature into her arms, as\nif it had been a child, and drew her quite within the land of peace; for\nshe had fallen across the threshold, so as to hinder any one entering who\nmight be coming after her. It was a woman, and she had flung herself upon\nher face, so that it was difficult for the little Pilgrim to see what\nmanner of person it was; for though she felt herself strong enough to\ntake up this new-comer in her arms and carry her away, yet she forbore,\nseeing the will of the stranger was not so. For some time this woman lay\nmoaning, with now and then a great sob shaking her as she lay. The little\nPilgrim had taken her by both her arms, and drawn her head to rest upon\nher own lap, and was still holding the hands, which the poor creature had\nthrown out as if to clutch the ground. Thus she lay for a little while,\nas the little Pilgrim remembered she herself had lain, not wishing to\nmove, wondering what had happened to her; then she clutched the hands\nwhich grasped her, and said, muttering,--\n\n\"You are some one new. Have you come to save me? Oh, save me! Oh, save\nme! Don't let me die!\"\n\nThis was very strange to the little Pilgrim, and went to her heart. She\nsoothed the stranger, holding her hands warm and light, and stooping over\nher.\n\n\"Dear,\" she said, \"you must try and not be afraid.\"\n\n\"You say so,\" said the woman, \"because you are well and strong. You don't\nknow what it is to be seized in the middle of your life, and told\nthat you've got to die. Oh, I have been a sinful creature! I am not fit\nto die. Can't you give me something that will cure me? What is the good\nof doctors and nurses if they cannot save a poor soul that is not fit to\ndie?\"\n\nAt this the little Pilgrim smiled upon her, always holding her fast, and\nsaid,--\n\n\"Why are you so afraid to die?\"\n\nThe woman raised her head to see who it was who put such a strange\nquestion to her.\n\n\"You are some one new,\" she said. \"I have never seen you before. Is there\nany one that is not afraid to die? Would _you_ like to have to give\nyour account all in a moment, without any time to prepare?\"\n\n\"But you have had time to prepare,\" said the Pilgrim.\n\n\"Oh, only a very, very little time. And I never thought it was true. I am\nnot an old woman, and I am not fit to die; and I'm poor. Oh, if I were\nrich, I would bribe you to give me something to keep me alive. Won't you\ndo it for pity?--won't you do it for pity? When you are as bad as I am,\noh, you will perhaps call for some one to help you, and find nobody, like\nme.\"\n\n\"I will help you for love,\" said the little Pilgrim; \"some one who loves\nyou has sent me.\"\n\nThe woman lifted herself up a little and shook her head. \"There is nobody\nthat loves me.\" Then she cast her eyes round her and began to tremble\nagain (for the touch of the little Pilgrim had stilled her). \"Oh, where\nam I?\" she said. \"They have taken me away; they have brought me to a\nstrange place; and you are new. Oh, where have they taken me?--where am\nI?--where am I?\" she cried. \"Have they brought me here to die?\"\n\nThen the little Pilgrim bent over her and soothed her. \"You must not be\nso much afraid of dying; that is all over. You need not fear that any\nmore,\" she said softly; \"for here where you now are we have all died.\"\n\nThe woman started up out of her arms, and then she gave a great shriek\nthat made the air ring, and cried out, \"Dead! am I dead?\" with a shudder\nand convulsion, throwing herself again wildly with outstretched hands\nupon the ground.\n\nThis was a great and terrible work for the little Pilgrim--the first she\nhad ever had to do--and her heart failed her for a moment; but afterward\nshe remembered our Brother who sent her, and knew what was best. She drew\ncloser to the new-comer, and took her hand again.\n\n\"Try,\" she said, in a soft voice, \"and think a little. Do you feel now so\nill as you were? Do not be frightened, but think a little. I will hold\nyour hand. And look at me; you are not afraid of me?\"\n\nThe poor creature shuddered again, and then she turned her face and\nlooked doubtfully, with great dark eyes dilated, and the brow and cheek\nso curved and puckered round them that they seemed to glow out of deep\ncaverns. Her face was full of anguish and fear. But as she looked at the\nlittle Pilgrim, her troubled gaze softened. Of her own accord she clasped\nher other hand upon the one that held hers, and then she said with a\ngasp,--\n\n\"I am not afraid of you; that was not true that you said! You are one of\nthe sisters, and you want to frighten me and make me repent!\"\n\n\"You do repent,\" the Pilgrim said.\n\n\"Oh,\" cried the poor woman, \"what has the like of you to do with me? Now\nI look at you, I never saw any one that was like you before. Don't you\nhate me?--don't you loathe me? I do myself. It's so ugly to go wrong. I\nthink now I would almost rather die and be done with it. You will say\nthat is because I am going to get better. I feel a great deal better now.\nDo you think I am going to get over it? Oh, I am better! I could get up\nout of bed and walk about. Yes, but I am not in bed,--where have you\nbrought me? Never mind, it is a fine air; I shall soon get well here.\"\n\nThe Pilgrim was silent for a little, holding her hands. And then she\nsaid,--\n\n\"Tell me how you feel now,\" in her soft voice.\n\nThe woman had sat up and was gazing round her. \"It is very strange,\" she\nsaid; \"it is all confused. I think upon my mother and the old prayers I\nused to say. For a long, long time I always said my prayers; but now I've\ngot hardened, they say. Oh, I was once as fresh as any one. It all comes\nover me now. I feel as if I were young again--just come out of the\ncountry. I am sure that I could walk.\"\n\nThe little Pilgrim raised her up, holding her by her hands; and she stood\nand gazed round about her, making one or two doubtful steps. She was very\npale, and the light was dim; her eyes peered into it with a scared yet\neager look. She made another step, then stopped again.\n\n\"I am quite well,\" she said. \"I could walk a mile. I could walk any\ndistance. What was that you said? Oh, I tell you I am better! I am not\ngoing to die.\"\n\n\"You will never, never die,\" said the little Pilgrim; \"are you not glad\nit is all over? Oh, I was so glad! And all the more you should be glad if\nyou were so much afraid.\"\n\nBut this woman was not glad. She shrank away from her companion, then\ncame close to her again, and gripped her with her hands.\n\n\"It is your--fun,\" she said, \"or just to frighten me. Perhaps you think\nit will do me no harm as I am getting so well; you want to frighten me to\nmake me good. But I mean to be good without that--I do!--I do! When one\nis so near dying as I have been and yet gets better,--for I am going to\nget better! Yes! you know it as well as I.\"\n\nThe little Pilgrim made no reply, but stood by, looking at her charge,\nnot feeling that anything was given her to say,--and she was so new to\nthis work, that there was a little trembling in her, lest she should not\ndo everything as she ought. And the woman looked round with those anxious\neyes gazing all about. The light did not brighten as it had done when the\nPilgrim herself first came to this place. For one thing, they had\nremained quite close to the gate, which no doubt threw a shadow. The\nwoman looked at that, and then turned and looked into the dim morning,\nand did not know where she was, and her heart was confused and troubled.\n\n\"Where are we?\" she said. \"I do not know where it is; they must have\nbrought me here in my sleep,--where are we? How strange to bring a sick\nwoman away out of her room in her sleep! I suppose it was the new\ndoctor,\" she went on, looking very closely in the little Pilgrim's face;\nthen paused, and drawing a long breath, said softly, \"It has done me\ngood. It is better air--it is--a new kind of cure!\"\n\nBut though she spoke like this, she did not convince herself; her eyes\nwere wild with wondering and fear. She gripped the Pilgrim's arm more and\nmore closely, and trembled, leaning upon her.\n\n\"Why don't you speak to me?\" she said; \"why don't you tell me? Oh, I\ndon't know how to live in this place! What do you do?--how do you speak?\nI am not fit for it. And what are you? I never saw you before, nor any\none like you. What do you want with me? Why are you so kind to me?\nWhy--why--\"\n\nAnd here she went off into a murmur of questions. Why? why? always\nholding fast by the little Pilgrim, always gazing round her, groping as\nit were in the dimness with her great eyes.\n\n\"I have come because our dear Lord who is our Brother sent me to meet\nyou, and because I love you,\" the little Pilgrim said.\n\n\"Love me!\" the woman cried, throwing up her hands. \"But no one loves me;\nI have not deserved it.\" Here she grasped her close again with a sudden\nclutch, and cried out, \"If this is what you say, where is God?\"\n\n\"Are you afraid of him?\" the little Pilgrim said. Upon which the woman\ntrembled so, that the Pilgrim trembled too with the quivering of her\nframe; then loosed her hold, and fell upon her face, and cried,--\n\n\"Hide me! hide me! I have been a great sinner. Hide me, that he may not\nsee me;\" and with one hand she tried to draw the Pilgrim's dress as a\nveil between her and something she feared.\n\n\"How should I hide you from him who is everywhere? and why should I hide\nyou from your Father?\" the little Pilgrim said. This she said almost with\nindignation, wondering that any one could put more trust in her, who was\nno better than a child, than in the Father of all. But then she said,\n\"Look into your heart, and you will see you are not so much afraid as you\nthink. This is how you have been accustomed to frighten yourself. But now\nlook into your heart. You thought you were very ill at first, but not now\nand you think you are afraid; but look into your heart--\"\n\nThere was a silence; and then the woman raised her head with a wonderful\nlook, in which there was amazement and doubt, as if she had heard some\njoyful thing, but dared not yet believe that it was true. Once more she\nhid her face in her hands, and once more raised it again. Her eyes\nsoftened; a long sigh or gasp, like one taking breath after drowning,\nshook her breast. Then she said, \"I think--that is true. But if I am not\nafraid, it is because I am--bad. It is because I am hardened. Oh, should\nnot I fear him who can send me away into--the lake that burns--into the\npit--\" And here she gave a great cry, but held the little Pilgrim all the\nwhile with her eyes, which seemed to plead and ask for better news.\n\nThen there came into the Pilgrim's heart what to say, and she took the\nwoman's hand again and held it between her own. \"That is the change,\" she\nsaid, \"that comes when we come here. We are not afraid any more of our\nFather. We are not all happy. Perhaps you will not be happy at first. But\nif he says to you, 'Go!'--even to that place you speak of--you will know\nthat it is well, and you will not be afraid. You are not afraid now,--oh,\nI can see it in your eyes. You are not happy, but you are not afraid. You\nknow it is the Father. Do not say God,--that is far off,--Father!\" said\nthe little Pilgrim, holding up the woman's hand clasped in her own. And\nthere came into her soul an ecstasy, and tears that were tears of\nblessedness fell from her eyes, and all about her there seemed to shine a\nlight. When she came to herself, the woman who was her charge had come\nquite close to her, and had added her other hand to that the Pilgrim\nheld, and was weeping and saying, \"I am not afraid,\" with now and then a\ngasp and sob, like a child who after a passion of tears has been\nconsoled, yet goes on sobbing and cannot quite forget, and is afraid to\nown that all is well again. Then the Pilgrim kissed her, and bade her\nrest a little; for even she herself felt shaken, and longed for a little\nquiet, and to feel the true sense of the peace that was in her heart. She\nsat down beside her upon the ground, and made her lean her head against\nher shoulder, and thus they remained very still for a little time, saying\nno more. It seemed to the little Pilgrim that her companion had fallen\nasleep, and perhaps it was so, after so much agitation. All this time\nthere had been people passing, entering by the many doors. And most of\nthem paused a little to see where they were, and looked round them, then\nwent on; and it seemed to the little Pilgrim that according to the doors\nby which they entered each took a different way. While she watched,\nanother came in by the same door as that at which the woman who was her\ncharge had come in. And he too stumbled and looked about him with an air\nof great wonder and doubt. When he saw her seated on the ground, he came\nup to her hesitating, as one in a strange place who does not want to\nbetray that he is bewildered and has lost his way. He came with a little\npretence of smiling, though his countenance was pale and scared, and\nsaid, drawing his breath quick, \"I ought to know where I am, but I have\nlost my head, I think. Will you tell me which is--the way?\"\n\n\"What way?\" cried the little Pilgrim; for her strength was gone from her,\nand she had no word to say to him. He looked at her with that\nbewilderment on his face, and said, \"I find myself strange, strange. I\nought to know where I am; but it is scarcely daylight yet. It is perhaps\nfoolish to come out so early in the morning.\" This he said in his\nconfusion, not knowing where he was, nor what he said.\n\n\"I think all the ways lead to our Father,\" said the little Pilgrim\n(though she had not known this till now). \"And the dear Lord walks about\nthem all. Here you never go astray.\"\n\nUpon this the stranger looked at her, and asked in a faltering voice,\n\"Are you an angel?\" still not knowing what he said.\n\n\"Oh, no, no; I am only a Pilgrim,\" she replied.\n\n\"May I sit by you a little?\" said the man. He sat down, drawing long\nbreaths, as though he had gone through great fatigue; and looked about\nwith wondering eyes. \"You will wonder, but I do not know where I am,\" he\nsaid. \"I feel as if I must he dreaming. This is not where I expected to\ncome. I looked for something very different; do you think there can have\nbeen any--mistake?\"\n\n\"Oh, never that,\" she said; \"there are no mistakes here.\"\n\nThen he looked at her again, and said,--\n\n\"I perceive that you belong to this country, though you say you are a\npilgrim. I should be grateful if you would tell me. Does one live--here?\nAnd is this all? Is there no--no--but I don't know what word to use. All\nis so strange, different from what I expected.\"\n\n\"Do you know that you have died?\"\n\n\"Yes--yes, I am quite acquainted with that,\" he said, hurriedly; as if it\nhad been an idea he disliked to dwell upon. \"But then I expected--Is\nthere no one to tell you where to go, or what you are to be? or to take\nany notice of you?\"\n\nThe little Pilgrim was startled by this tone. She did not understand its\nmeaning, and she had not any word to say to him. She looked at him with\nas much bewilderment as he had shown when he approached her, and replied,\nfaltering,--\n\n\"There are a great many people here; but I have never heard if there is\nany one to tell you--\"\n\n\"What does it matter how many people there are if you know none of them?\"\nhe said.\n\n\"We all know each other,\" she answered him but then paused and hesitated\na little, because this was what had been said to her, and of herself she\nwas not assured of it, neither did she know at all how to deal with this\nstranger, to whom she had not any commission. It seemed that he had no\none to care for him, and the little Pilgrim had a sense of compassion,\nyet of trouble in her heart; for what could she say? And it was very\nstrange to her to see one who was not content here.\n\n\"Ah, but there should be some one to point out the way, and tell us which\nis our circle, and where we ought to go,\" he said. And then he too was\nsilent for a while, looking about him as all were fain to do on their\nfirst arrival, finding everything so strange. There were people coming in\nat every moment, and some were met at the very threshold, and some went\naway alone with peaceful faces, and there were many groups about talking\ntogether in soft voices; but no one interrupted the other, and though so\nmany were there, each voice was as clear as if it had spoken alone, and\nthere was no tumult of sound as when many people assemble together in the\nlower world.\n\nThe little Pilgrim wondered to find herself with the woman resting upon\nher on one side, and the man seated silent on the other, neither having,\nit appeared, any guide but only herself, who knew so little. How was she\nto lead them in the paths which she did not know?--and she was exhausted\nby the agitation of her struggle with the woman whom she felt to be her\ncharge. But in this moment of silence she had time to remember the face\nof the Lord, when he gave her this commission, and her heart was\nstrengthened. The man all this time sat and watched, looking eagerly all\nabout him, examining the faces of those who went and came: and sometimes\nhe made a little start as if to go and speak to some one he knew; but\nalways drew back again and looked at the little Pilgrim, as if he had\nsaid, \"This is the one who will serve me best.\" He spoke to her again\nafter a while and said, \"I suppose you are one of the guides that show\nthe way.\"\n\n\"No,\" said the little Pilgrim, anxiously. \"I know so little! It is not\nlong since I came here. I came in the early morning--\"\n\n\"Why, it is morning now. You could not come earlier than it is now. You\nmean yesterday.\"\n\n\"I think,\" said the Pilgrim, \"that yesterday is the other side; there is\nno yesterday here.\"\n\nHe looked at her with the keen look he had, to understand her the better;\nand then he said,--\n\n\"No division of time! I think that must be monotonous. It will be strange\nto have no night; but I suppose one gets used to everything. I hope\nthough there is something to do. I have always lived a very busy life.\nPerhaps this is just a little pause before we go--to be--to have--to\nget our--appointed place.\"\n\nHe had an uneasy look as he said this, and looked at her with an anxious\ncuriosity, which the little Pilgrim did not understand.\n\n\"I do not know,\" she said softly, shaking her head. \"I have so little\nexperience. I have not been told of an appointed place.\"\n\nThe man looked at her very strangely.\n\n\"I did not think,\" he said, \"that I should have found such ignorance\nhere. Is it not well known that we must all appear before the\njudgment-seat of God?\"\n\nThere words seemed to cause a trembling on the still air, and the woman\non the other side raised herself suddenly up, clasping her hands and some\nof those who had just entered heard the words, and came and crowded about\nthe little Pilgrim, some standing, some falling down upon their knee, all\nwith their faces turned towards her. She who had always been so simple\nand small, so little used to teach; she was frightened with the sight of\nall these strangers crowding, hanging upon her lips, looking to her for\nknowledge. She knew not what to do or what to say. The tears came into\nher eyes.\n\n\"Oh,\" she said, \"I do not know anything about a judgment-seat. I know\nthat our Father is here, and that when we are in trouble we are taken to\nhim to be comforted, and that our dear Lord our Brother is among us every\nday, and every one may see him. Listen,\" she said, standing up suddenly\namong them, feeling strong as an angel. \"I have seen him! though I am\nnothing, so little as you see, and often silly, never clever as some of\nyou are, I have seen him! and so will all of you. There is no more that I\nknow of,\" she said softly, clasping her hands. \"When you see him it comes\ninto your heart what you must do.\"\n\nAnd then there was a murmur of voices about her, some saying that was\nbest, and some wondering if that were all, and some crying if he would\nbut come now--while the little Pilgrim stood among them with her face\nshining, and they all looked at her, asking her to tell them more, to\nshow them how to find him. But this was far above what she could do, for\nshe too was not much more than a stranger, and had little strength. She\nwould not go back a step, nor desert those who were so anxious to know,\nthough her heart fluttered almost as it had used to do before she died,\nwhat with her longing to tell them, and knowing that she had no more to\nsay.\n\nBut in that land it is never permitted that one who stands bravely and\nfails not shall be left without succor; for it is no longer needful there\nto stand even to death, since all dying is over, and all souls are\ntested. When it was seen that the little Pilgrim was thus surrounded by\nso many that questioned her, there suddenly came about her many others\nfrom the brightness out of which she had come, who, one going to one\nhand, and one to another, safely led them into the ways in which their\ncourse lay: so that the Pilgrim was free to lead forth the woman who had\nbeen given her in charge, and whose path lay in a dim, but pleasant\ncountry, outside of that light and gladness in which the Pilgrim's home\nwas.\n\n\"But,\" she said, \"you are not to fear or be cast down, because he goes\nlikewise by these ways, and there is not a corner in all this land but he\nis to be seen passing by; and he will come and speak to you, and lay his\nhand upon you; and afterwards everything will be clear, and you will know\nwhat you are to do.\"\n\n\"Stay with me till he comes,--oh, stay with me,\" the woman cried,\nclinging to her arm.\n\n\"Unless another is sent,\" the little Pilgrim said. And it was nothing to\nher that the air was less bright there, for her mind was full of light,\nso that, though her heart still fluttered a little with all that had\npassed, she had no longing to return, nor to shorten the way, but went by\nthe lower road sweetly, with the stranger hanging upon her, who was\nstronger and taller than she. Thus they went on, and the Pilgrim told her\nall she knew, and everything that came into her heart. And so full was\nshe of the great things she had to say, that it was a surprise to her,\nand left her trembling, when suddenly the woman took away her clinging\nhand, and flew forward with arms out-spread and a cry of joy. The little\nPilgrim stood still to see, and on the path before them was a child,\ncoming towards them singing, with a look such as is never seen but upon\nthe faces of children who have come here early, and who behold the face\nof the Father, and have never known fear nor sorrow. The woman flew and\nfell at the child's feet, and he put his hand upon her, and raised her\nup, and called her \"mother.\" Then he smiled upon the little Pilgrim, and\nled her away.\n\n\"Now she needs me no longer,\" said the Pilgrim; and it was a surprise to\nher, and for a moment she wondered in herself if it was known that this\nchild should come so suddenly and her work be over; and also how she was\nto return again to the sweet place among the flowers from which she had\ncome. But when she turned to look if there was any way, she found one\nstanding by such as she had not yet seen. This was a youth, with a face\njust touched with manhood, as at the moment when the boy ends, when all\nis still fresh and pure in the heart; but he was taller and greater than\na man.\n\n\"I am sent,\" he said, \"little sister, to take you to the Father; because\nyou have been very faithful, and gone beyond your strength.\"\n\nAnd he took the little Pilgrim by the hand, and she knew he was an angel;\nand immediately the sweet air melted about them into light, and a hush\ncame upon her of all thought and all sense, attending till she should\nreceive the blessing, and her new name, and see what is beyond telling,\nand hear and understand.\n\n\n\n\nII.\n\nTHE LITTLE PILGRIM GOES UP HIGHER.\n\n\nWhen the little Pilgrim came out of the presence of the Father, she found\nherself in the street of a great city. But what she saw and heard when\nshe was with Him it is not given to the tongue of mortal to say, for it\nis beyond words, and beyond even thought. As the mystery of love is not\nto be spoken but to be felt, even in the lower earth, so, but much less,\nis that great mystery of the love of the Father to be expressed in sound.\nThe little Pilgrim was very happy when she went into that sacred place,\nbut there was a great awe upon her, and it might even be said that she\nwas afraid; but when she came out again she feared nothing, but looked\nwith clear eyes upon all she saw, loving them, but no more overawed by\nthem, having seen that which is above all. When she came forth again to\nher common life--for it is not permitted save for those who have attained\nthe greatest heights to dwell there--she had no longer need of any guide,\nbut came alone, knowing where to go, and walking where it pleased her,\nwith reverence and a great delight in seeing and knowing all that was\naround, but no fear. It was a great city, but it was not like the great\ncities which she had seen. She understood as she passed along how it was\nthat those who had been dazzled but by a passing glance had described the\nwalls and the pavement as gold. They were like what gold is, beautiful\nand clear, of a lovely color, but softer in tone than metal ever was, and\nas cool and fresh to walk upon and to touch as if they had been velvet\ngrass. The buildings were all beautiful, of every style and form that it\nis possible to think of, yet in great harmony, as if every man had\nfollowed his own taste, yet all had been so combined and grouped by the\nmaster architect that each individual feature enhanced the effect of the\nrest. Some of the houses were greater and some smaller, but all of them\nwere rich in carvings and pictures and lovely decorations, and the effect\nwas as if the richest materials had been employed, marbles and beautiful\nsculptured stone, and wood of beautiful tints, though the little Pilgrim\nknew that these were not like the marble and stone she had once known,\nbut heavenly representatives of them, far better than they. There were\npeople at work upon them, building new houses and making additions, and a\ngreat many painters painting upon them the history of the people who\nlived there, or of others who were worthy that commemoration. And the\nstreets were full of pleasant sound, and of crowds going and coming, and\nthe commotion of much business, and many things to do. And this movement,\nand the brightness of the air, and the wonderful things that were to be\nseen on every side, made the Pilgrim gay, so that she could have sung\nwith pleasure as she went along. And all who met her smiled, and every\ngroup exchanged greetings as they passed along, all knowing each other.\nMany of them, as might be seen, had come there, as she did, to see the\nwonders of the beautiful city; and all who lived there were ready to tell\nthem whatever they desired to know, and show them the finest houses and\nthe greatest pictures. And this gave a feeling of holiday and pleasure\nwhich was delightful beyond description, for all the busy people about\nwere full of sympathy with the strangers, bidding them welcome, inviting\nthem into their houses, making the warmest fellowship. And friends were\nmeeting continually on every side; but the Pilgrim had no sense that she\nwas forlorn in being alone, for all were friends; and it pleased her to\nwatch the others, and see how one turned this way and one another, every\none finding something that delighted him above all other things. She\nherself took a great pleasure in watching a painter, who was standing\nupon a balcony a little way above her, painting upon a great fresco: and\nwhen he saw this he asked her to come up beside him and see his work. She\nasked him a great many questions about it, and why it was that he was\nworking only at the draperies of the figures, and did not touch their\nfaces, some of which were already finished and seemed to be looking at\nher, as living as she was, out of the wall, while some were merely\noutlined as yet. He told her that he was not a great painter to do this,\nor to design the great work, but that the master would come presently,\nwho had the chief responsibility. \"For we have not all the same genius,\"\nhe said, \"and if I were to paint this head it would not have the gift of\nlife as that one has; but to stand by and see him put it in, you cannot\nthink what a happiness that is; for one knows every touch, and just what\neffect it will have, though one could not do it one's self; and it is a\nwonder and a delight perpetual that it should be done.\"\n\nThe little Pilgrim looked up at him and said, \"That is very beautiful to\nsay. And do you never wish to be like him--to make the lovely, living\nfaces as well as the other parts?\"\n\n\"Is not this lovely too?\" he said; and showed her how he had just put in\na billowy robe, buoyed out with the wind, and sweeping down from the\nshoulders of a stately figure in such free and graceful folds that she\nwould have liked to take it in her hand and feel the silken texture; and\nthen he told her how absorbing it was to study the mysteries of color and\nthe differences of light. \"There is enough in that to make one happy,\"\nhe said. \"It is thought by some that we will all come to the higher point\nwith work and thought: but that is not my feeling; and whether it is so\nor not what does it matter, for our Father makes no difference: and all\nof us are necessary to everything that is done: and it is almost more\ndelight to see the master do it than to do it with one's own hand. For\none thing, your own work may rejoice you in your heart, but always\nwith a little trembling because it is never so perfect as you would have\nit--whereas in your master's work you have full content, because his idea\ngoes beyond yours, and as he makes every touch you can feel 'That is\nright--that is complete--that is just as it ought to be.' Do you\nunderstand what I mean?\" he said, turning to her with a smile.\n\n\"I understand it perfectly,\" she cried, clasping her hands together with\nthe delight of accord. \"Don't you think that is one of the things that\nare so happy here? you understand at half a word.\"\n\n\"Not everybody,\" he said, and smiled upon her like a brother; \"for we are\nnot all alike even here.\"\n\n\"Were you a painter?\" she said, \"in--in the other--\"\n\n\"In the old times. I was one of those that strove for the mastery, and\nsometimes grudged--We remember these things at times,\" he said gravely,\n\"to make us more aware of the blessedness of being content.\"\n\n\"It is long since then?\" she said with some wistfulness; upon which he\nsmiled again.\n\n\"So long,\" he said, \"that we have worn out most of our links to the world\nbelow. We have all come away, and those who were after us for\ngenerations. But you are a new-comer.\"\n\n\"And are they all with you? are you all--together? do you live--as in the\nold time?\"\n\nUpon this the painter smiled, but not so brightly as before.\n\n\"Not as in the old time,\" he said, \"nor are they all here. Some are still\nupon the way, and of some we have no certainty, only news from time to\ntime. The angels are very good to us. They never miss an occasion to\nbring us news; for they go everywhere, you know.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the little Pilgrim, though indeed she had not known it till\nnow; but it seemed to her as if it had come to her mind by nature and she\nhad never needed to be told.\n\n\"They are so tender-hearted,\" the painter said; \"and more than that, they\nare very curious about men and women. They have known it all from the\nbeginning, and it is a wonder to them. There is a friend of mine, an\nangel, who is more wise in men's hearts than any one I know; and yet he\nwill say to me sometimes, 'I do not understand you,--you are wonderful.'\nThey like to find out all we are thinking. It is an endless pleasure to\nthem, just as it is to some of us to watch the people in the other\nworlds.\"\n\n\"Do you mean--where we have come from?\" said the little Pilgrim.\n\n\"Not always there. We in this city have been long separated from that\ncountry, for all that we love are out of it.\"\n\n\"But not here?\" the little Pilgrim cried again, with a little sorrow--a\npang that she knew was going to be put away--in her heart.\n\n\"But coming! coming!\" said the painter, cheerfully; \"and some were here\nbefore us, and some have arrived since. They are everywhere.\"\n\n\"But some in trouble--some in trouble!\" she cried, with the tears in her\neyes.\n\n\"We suppose so,\" he said, gravely; \"for some are in that place which once\nwas called among us the place of despair.\"\n\n\"You mean--\" and though the little Pilgrim had been made free of fear, at\nthat word which she would not speak, she trembled, and the light grew dim\nin her eyes.\n\n\"Well!\" said her new friend, \"and what then? The Father sees through and\nthrough it as he does here; they cannot escape him: so that there is Love\nnear them always. I have a son,\" he said, then sighed a little, but\nsmiled again, \"who is there.\"\n\nThe little Pilgrim at this clasped her hands with a piteous cry.\n\n\"Nay, nay,\" he said, \"little sister; my friend I was telling you of, the\nangel, brought me news of him just now. Indeed there was news of him\nthrough all the city. Did you not hear all the bells ringing? But perhaps\nthat was before you came. The angels who know me best came one\nafter another to tell me, and our Lord himself came to wish me joy. My\nson had found the way.\"\n\nThe little Pilgrim did not understand this, and almost thought that the\npainter must be mistaken or dreaming. She looked at him very anxiously\nand said,--\n\n\"I thought that those unhappy--never came out any more.\"\n\nThe painter smiled at her in return, and said,--\n\n\"Had you children in the old time?\"\n\nShe paused a little before she replied.\n\n\"I had children in love,\" she said, \"but none that were born mine.\"\n\n\"It is the same,\" he said, \"it is the same; and if one of them had sinned\nagainst you, injured you, done wrong in any way, would you have cast him\noff, or what would you have done?\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said the little Pilgrim again, with a vivid light of memory coming\ninto her face, which showed she had no need to think of this as a thing\nthat might have happened, but knew. \"I brought him home. I nursed him\nwell again. I prayed for him night and day. Did you say cast him off?\nwhen he had most need of me? then I never could have loved him,\" she\ncried.\n\nThe painter nodded his head, and his hand with the pencil in it, for he\nhad turned from his picture to look at her.\n\n\"Then you think you love better than our Father?\" he said; and turned to\nhis work, and painted a new fold in the robe, which looked as if a soft\nair had suddenly blown into it, and not the touch of a skilful hand.\n\nThis made the Pilgrim tremble, as though in her ignorance she had done\nsomething wrong. After that there came a great joy into her heart. \"Oh,\nhow happy you have made me!\" she cried. \"I am glad with all my heart for\nyou and your son--\" Then she paused a little and added, \"But you said he\nwas still there.\"\n\n\"It is true; for the land of darkness is very confusing, they tell me,\nfor want of the true light, and our dear friends the angels are not\npermitted to help: but if one follows them, that shows the way. You may\nbe in that land yet on your way hither. It was very hard to understand at\nfirst,\" said the painter; \"there are some sketches I could show you. No\none has ever made a picture of it, though many have tried; but I could\nshow you some sketches--if you wish to see.\"\n\nTo this the little Pilgrim's look was so plain an answer that the painter\nlaid down his pallet and his brush, and left his work, to show them to\nher as he had promised. They went down from the balcony and along the\nstreet until they came to one of the great palaces, where many were\ncoming and going. Here they walked through some vast halls, where\nstudents were working at easels, doing every kind of beautiful work: some\npainting pictures, some preparing drawings, planning houses and palaces.\nThe Pilgrim would have liked to pause at every moment to see one lovely\nthing or another; but the painter walked on steadily till he came to a\nroom which was full of sketches, some of them like pictures in little,\nwith many figures,--some of them only a representation of a flower, or\nthe wing of a bird. \"These are all the master's,\" he said; \"sometimes the\nsight of them will be enough to put something great into the mind of\nanother. In this corner are the sketches I told you of.\" There were two\nof them hanging together upon the wall, and at first it seemed to the\nlittle Pilgrim as if they represented the flames and fire of which she\nhad read, and this made her shudder for the moment. But then she saw that\nit was a red light like a stormy sunset, with masses of clouds in the\nsky, and a low sun very fiery and dazzling, which no doubt to a hasty\nglance must have looked, with its dark shadows and high lurid lights,\nlike the fires of the bottomless pit. But when you looked down you saw\nthe reality what it was. The country that lay beneath was full of\ntropical foliage, but with many stretches of sand and dry plains, and in\nthe foreground was a town, that looked very prosperous and crowded,\nthough the figures were very minute, the subject being so great; but no\none to see it would have taken it for anything but a busy and wealthy\nplace, in a thunderous atmosphere, with a storm coming on. In the next\nthere was a section of a street with a great banqueting hall open to the\nview, and many people sitting about the table. You could see that there\nwas a great deal of laughter and conversation going on, some very noisy\ngroups, but others that sat more quietly in corners and conversed, and\nsome who sang, and every kind of entertainment. The little Pilgrim was\nvery much astonished to see this, and turned to the painter, who answered\nher directly, though she had not spoken. \"We used to think differently\nonce. There are some who are there and do not know it. They think only it\nis the old life over again, but always worse, and they are led on in the\nways of evil; but they do not feel the punishment until they begin to\nfind out where they are and to struggle, and wish for other things.\"\n\nThe little Pilgrim felt her heart beat very wildly while she looked at\nthis, and she thought upon the rich man in the parable, who, though he\nwas himself in torment, prayed that his brother might be saved, and she\nsaid to herself, \"Our dear Lord would never leave him there who could\nthink of his brother when he was himself in such a strait.\" And when she\nlooked at the painter he smiled upon her, and nodded his head. Then he\nled her to the other corner of the room where there were other pictures.\nOne of them was of a party seated round a table and an angel looking\non. The angel had the aspect of a traveller, as if he were passing\nquickly by and had but paused a moment to look, and one of the men\nglancing up suddenly saw him. The picture was dim, but the startled look\nupon this man's face, and the sorrow on the angel's, appeared out of the\nmisty background with such truth that the tears came into the little\nPilgrim's eyes, and she said in her heart, \"Oh that I could go to him and\nhelp him!\" The other sketches were dimmer and dimmer. You seemed to see\nout of the darkness, gleaming lights, and companies of revellers, out of\nwhich here and there was one trying to escape. And then the wide plains\nin the night, and the white vision of the angel in the distance, and here\nand there by different paths a fugitive striving to follow. \"Oh, sir,\"\nsaid the little Pilgrim, \"how did you learn to do it? You have never been\nthere.\"\n\n\"It was the master, not I; and I cannot tell you if he has ever been\nthere. When the Father has given you that gift, you can go to many\nplaces, without leaving the one where you are. And then he has heard what\nthe angels say.\"\n\n\"And will they all get safe at the last? and even that great spirit, he\nthat fell from heaven--\"\n\nThe painter shook his head and said, \"It is not permitted to you and me\nto know such great things. Perhaps the wise will tell you if you ask\nthem: but for me I ask the Father in my heart and listen to what he\nsays.\"\n\n\"That is best!\" the little Pilgrim said; and she asked the Father in her\nheart: and there came all over her such a glow of warmth and happiness\nthat her soul was satisfied. She looked in the painter's face and laughed\nfor joy. And he put out his hands as if welcoming some one, and his\ncountenance shone; and he said,--\n\n\"My son had a great gift. He was a master born, though it was not given\nto me. He shall paint it all for us so that the heart shall rejoice; and\nyou will come again and see.\"\n\nAfter that it happened to the little Pilgrim to enter into another great\npalace where there were many people reading, and some sitting at their\ndesks and writing, and some consulting together, with many great volumes\nstretched out open upon the tables. One of these who was seated alone\nlooked up as she paused wondering at him, and smiled as every one did,\nand greeted her with such a friendly tone that the Pilgrim, who always\nhad a great desire to know, came nearer to him and looked at the book,\nthen begged his pardon, and said she did not know that books were needed\nhere. And then he told her that he was one of the historians of the city\nwhere all the records of the world were kept, and that it was his\nbusiness to work upon the great history, and to show what was the meaning\nof the Father in everything that had happened, and how each event came in\nits right place.\n\n\"And do you get it out of books?\" she asked; for she was not learned, nor\nwise, and knew but little, though she always loved to know.\n\n\"The books are the records,\" he said; \"and there are many here that were\nnever known to us in the old days; for the angels love to look into\nthese things, and they can tell us much, for they saw it; and in the\ngreat books they have kept there is much put down that was never in the\nbooks we wrote, for then we did not know. We found out about the kings\nand the state, and tried to understand what great purposes they were\nserving; but even these we did not know, for those purposes were too\ngreat for us, not knowing the end from the beginning, and the hearts of\nmen were too great for us. We comprehended the evil sometimes, but never\nfathomed the good. And how could we know the lesser things which were\nworking out God's way? for some of these even the angels did not know;\nand it has happened to me that our Lord himself has come in sometimes to\ntell me of one that none of us had discovered.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said the little Pilgrim, with tears in her eyes, \"I should like to\nhave been that one!--that was not known even to the angels, but only\nto Himself!\"\n\nThe historian smiled. \"It was my brother,\" he said.\n\nThe Pilgrim looked at him with great wonder. \"Your brother, and you did\nnot know him!\"\n\nAnd then he turned over the pages and showed her where the story was.\n\n\"You know,\" he said, \"that we who live here are not of your time, but\nhave lived and lived here till the old life is far away and like a dream.\nThere were great tumults and fightings in our time, and it was settled by\nthe prince of the place that our town was to be abandoned, and all the\npeople left to the mercy of an enemy who had no mercy. But every day as\nhe rode out he saw at one door a child, a little fair boy, who sat on the\nsteps, and sang his little song like a bird. This child was never afraid\nof anything,--when the horses pranced past him, and the troopers pushed\nhim aside, he looked up into their faces and smiled. And when he had\nanything, a piece of bread, or an apple, or a plaything, he shared it\nwith his playmates; and his little face, and his pretty voice, and all\nhis pleasant ways, made that corner bright. He was like a flower growing\nthere; everybody smiled that saw him.\"\n\n\"I have seen such a child,\" the little Pilgrim said.\n\n\"But we made no account of him,\" said the historian. \"The Lord of the\nplace came past him every day, and always saw him singing in the sun by\nhis father's door. And it was a wonder then, and it has been a wonder\never since, why, having resolved upon it, that prince did not abandon the\ntown, which would have changed all his fortune after. Much had been made\nclear to me since I began to study, but not this: till the Lord himself\ncame to me and told me. The prince looked at the child till he loved him,\nand he reflected how many children there were like this that would be\nmurdered, or starved to death, and he could not give up the little\nsinging boy to the sword. So he remained; and the town was saved, and he\nbecame a great king. It was so secret that even the angels did not know\nit. But without that child the history would not have been complete.\"\n\n\"And is he here?\" the little Pilgrim said.\n\n\"Ah,\" said the historian, \"that is more strange still; for that which\nsaved him was also to his harm. He is not here. He is Elsewhere.\"\n\nThe little Pilgrim's face grew sad; but then she remembered what she had\nbeen told.\n\n\"But you know,\" she said, \"that he is coming?\"\n\n\"I know that our Father will never forsake him, and that everything that\nis being accomplished in him is well.\"\n\n\"Is it well to suffer? Is it well to live in that dark stormy country?\nOh, that they were all here, and happy like you!\"\n\nHe shook his head a little and said,--\n\n\"It was a long time before I got here; and as for suffering that matters\nlittle. You get experience by it. You are more accomplished and fit for\ngreater work in the end. It is not for nothing that we are permitted to\nwander; and sometimes one goes to the edge of despair--\"\n\nShe looked at him with such wondering eyes that he answered her without a\nword.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"I have been there.\"\n\nAnd then it seemed to her that there was something in his eyes which she\nhad not remarked before. Not only the great content that was everywhere,\nbut a deeper light, and the air of a judge who knew both good and evil,\nand could see both sides, and understood all, both to love and to hate.\n\n\"Little sister,\" he said, \"you have never wandered far; it is not needful\nfor such as you. Love teaches you, and you need no more; but when we have\nto be trained for an office like this, to make the way of the Lord clear\nthrough all the generations, reason is that we should see everything, and\nlearn all that man is and can be. These things are too deep for us; we\nstumble on, and know not till after. But now to me it is all clear.\"\n\nShe looked at him again and again while he spoke, and it seemed to her\nthat she saw in him such great knowledge and tenderness as made her glad;\nand how he could understand the follies that men had done, and fathom\nwhat real meaning was in them, and disentangle all the threads. He smiled\nas she gazed at him, and answered as if she had spoken.\n\n\"What was evil perishes, and what was good remains; almost everywhere\nthere is a little good. We could not understand all if we had not seen\nall and shared all.\"\n\n\"And the punishment too,\" she said, wondering more and more.\n\nHe smiled so joyfully that it was like laughter.\n\n\"Pain is a great angel,\" he said. \"The reason we hated him in the old\ndays was because he tended to death and decay; but when it is towards\nlife he leads, we fear him no more. The welcome thing of all in the land\nof darkness is when you see him first and know who he is; for by this you\nare aware that you have found the way.\"\n\nThe little Pilgrim did nothing but question with her anxious eyes, for\nthis was such a wonder to her, and she could not understand. But he only\nsat musing with a smile over the things he remembered. And at last he\nsaid,--\n\n\"If this is so interesting to you, you shall read it all in another\nplace, in the room where we have laid up our own experiences, in order to\nserve for the history afterwards. But we are still busy upon the work of\nthe earth. There is always something new to be discovered. And it is\nessential for the whole world that the chronicle should be full. I am in\ngreat joy because it was but just now that our Lord told me about that\nchild. Everything was imperfect without him, but now it is clear.\"\n\n\"You mean your brother? And you are happy though you are not sure if he\nis happy?\" the little Pilgrim said.\n\n\"It is not to be happy that we live,\" said he; and then, \"We are all\nhappy so soon as we have found the way.\"\n\nShe would have asked him more, but that he was called to a consultation\nwith some others of his kind, and had to leave her, waving his hand to\nher with a tender kindness which went to her heart. She looked after him\nwith great respect, scarcely knowing why; but it seemed to her that a man\nwho had been in the land of darkness, and made his way out of it, must be\nmore wonderful than any other. She looked round for a little upon the\ngreat library, full of all the books that had ever been written, and\nwhere people were doing their work, examining and reading and making\nextracts, every one with looks of so much interest, that she almost\nenvied them,--though it was a generous delight in seeing people so\nhappy in their occupation, and a desire to associate herself somehow in\nit, rather than any grudging of their satisfaction, that was in her\nmind. She went about all the courts of this palace alone, and everywhere\nsaw the same work going on, and everywhere met the same kind looks. Even\nwhen the greatest of all looked up from his work and saw her, he would\ngive her a friendly greeting and a smile; and nobody was too wise to lend\nan ear to the little visitor, or to answer her questions. And this was\nhow it was that she began to talk to another, who was seated at a great\ntable with many more, and who drew her to him by something that was in\nhis looks, though she could not have told what it was. It was not that he\nwas kinder than the rest, for they were all kind. She stood by him a\nlittle, and saw how he worked and would take something from one book and\nsomething from another, putting them ready for use. And it did not seem\nany trouble to do this work, but only pleasure, and the very pen in his\nhand was like a winged thing, as if it loved to write. When he saw her\nwatching him, he looked up and showed her the beautiful book out of which\nhe was copying, which was all illuminated with lovely pictures.\n\n\"This is one of the volumes of the great history,\" he said. \"There are\nsome things in it which are needed for another, and it is a pleasure to\nwork at it. If you will come here you will be able to see the page while\nI write.\"\n\nThen the little Pilgrim asked him some questions about the pictures, and\nhe answered her, describing and explaining them; for they were in the\nmiddle of the history, and she did not understand what it was. When she\nsaid, \"I ought not to trouble you, for you are busy,\" he laughed so\nkindly that she laughed too for pleasure. And he said,--\n\n\"There is no trouble here. When we are not allowed to work, as sometimes\nhappens, that makes us not quite so happy, but it is very seldom that it\nhappens so.\"\n\n\"Is it for punishment?\" she said.\n\nAnd then he laughed out with a sound which made all the others look up\nsmiling; and if they had not all looked so tenderly at her, as at a child\nwho has made such a mistake as it is pretty for the child to make, she\nwould have feared she had said something wrong; but she only laughed at\nherself too, and blushed a little, knowing that she was not wise: and to\nput her at her ease again, he turned the leaf and showed her other\npictures, and the story which went with them, from which he was copying\nsomething. And he said,--\n\n\"This is for another book, to show how the grace of the Father was\nbeautiful in some homes and families. It is not the great history, but\nconnected with it; and there are many who love that better than the story\nwhich is more great.\"\n\nThen the Pilgrim looked in his face and said,--\n\n\"What I want most is, to know about your homes here.\"\n\n\"It is all home here,\" he said, and smiled; and then, as he met her\nwistful looks, he went on to tell her that he and his brothers were not\nalways there. \"We have all our occupations,\" he said, \"and sometimes I am\nsent to inquire into facts that have happened, of which the record is not\nclear; for we must omit nothing; and sometimes we are told to rest and\ntake in new strength; and sometimes--\"\n\n\"But oh, forgive me,\" cried the little Pilgrim, \"you had some who were\nmore dear to you than all the world in the old time?\"\n\nAnd the others all looked up again at the question, and looked at her\nwith tender eyes, and said to the man whom she questioned,--\"Speak!\"\n\nHe made a little pause before he spoke, and he looked at one here and\nthere, and called to them,--\n\n\"Patience, brother,\" and \"Courage, brother.\" And then he said, \"Those\nwhom we loved best are nearly all with us; but some have not yet come.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said the little Pilgrim, \"but how then do you bear it, to be parted\nso long--so long?\"\n\nThen one of those to whom the first speaker had called out \"Patience\"\nrose, and came to her smiling; and he said,--\n\n\"I think every hour that perhaps she will come, and the joy will be so\ngreat, that thinking of that makes the waiting short: and nothing here is\nlong, for it never ends; and it will be so wonderful to hear her tell how\nthe Father has guided her, that it will be a delight to us all; and she\nwill be able to explain many things, not only for us, but for all; and we\nlove each other so that this separation is as nothing in comparison with\nwhat is to come.\"\n\nIt was beautiful to hear this, but it was not what the little Pilgrim\nexpected, for she thought they would have told her of the homes to which\nthey all returned when their work was over, and a life which was like the\nlife of the old time; but of this they said nothing, only looking at her\nwith smiling eyes, as at the curious questions of a child. And there were\nmany other things she would have asked, but refrained when she looked at\nthem, feeling as if she did not yet understand; when one of them broke\nforth suddenly in a louder voice, and said,--\n\n\"The little sister knows only the little language and the beginning of\ndays. She has not learned the mysteries, and what Love is, and what life\nis.\"\n\nAnd another cried, \"It is sweet to hear it again;\" and they all gathered\nround her with tender looks, and began to talk to each other, and tell\nher, as men will tell of the games of their childhood, of things that\nhappened, which were half-forgotten, in the old time.\n\nAfter this the little Pilgrim went out again into the beautiful city,\nfeeling in her heart that everything was a mystery, and that the days\nwould never be long enough to learn all that had yet to be learned, but\nknowing now that this too was the little language, and pleased with the\nsweet thought of so much that was to come. For one had whispered to her\nas she went out that the new tongue, and every explanation, as she was\nready for it, would come to her through one of those whom she loved best,\nwhich is the usage of that country. And when the stranger has no one\nthere that is very dear, then it is an angel who teaches the greater\nlanguage, and that is what happens often to the children who are\nbrought up in that heavenly place. When she reached the street again, she\nwas so pleased with this thought that it went out of her mind to ask her\nway to the great library, where she was to read the story of the\nhistorian's journey through the land of darkness; indeed she forgot that\nland altogether, and thought only of what was around her in the great\ncity, which is beyond everything that eye has seen, or that ear has\nheard, or that it has entered into the imagination to conceive. And now\nit seemed to her that she was much more familiar with the looks of the\npeople, and could distinguish between those who belonged to the city and\nthose who were visitors like herself; and also could tell which they were\nwho had entered into the mysteries of the kingdom, and which were, like\nherself, only acquainted with the beginning of days. And it came to her\nmind, she could not tell how, that it was best not to ask questions, but\nto wait until the beloved one should come, who would teach her the first\nwords. For in the mean time she did not feel at all impatient or\ndisturbed by her want of knowledge, but laughed a little at herself to\nsuppose that she could find out everything, and went on looking round\nher, and saying a word to every one she met, and enjoying the holiday\nlooks of all the strangers, and the sense she had in her heart of holiday\ntoo. She was walking on in this pleasant way, when she heard a sound that\nwas like silver trumpets, and saw the crowd turn towards an open space in\nwhich all the beautiful buildings were shaded with fine trees, and\nflowers were springing at the very edge of the pavements. The strangers\nall hastened along to hear what it was, and she with them, and some also\nof the people of the place. And as the little Pilgrim found herself\nwalking by a woman who was of these last, she asked her what it was.\n\nAnd the woman told her it was a poet who had come to say to them what had\nbeen revealed to him, and that the two with the silver trumpets were\nangels of the musicians' order, whose office it was to proclaim\neverything that was new, that the people should know. And many of those\nwho were at work in the palaces came out and joined the crowd, and the\npainter who had showed the little Pilgrim his picture, and many whose\nfaces she began to be acquainted with. The poet stood up upon a beautiful\npedestal all sculptured in stone, and with wreaths of living flowers hung\nupon it--and when the crowd had gathered in front of him, he began his\npoem. He told them that it was not about this land, or anything that\nhappened in it, which they knew as he did, but that it was a story of the\nold time, when men were walking in darkness, and when no one knew the\ntrue meaning even of what he himself did, but had to go on as if blindly,\nstumbling and groping with their hands. And \"Oh, brethren,\" he said,\n\"though all is more beautiful and joyful here where we know, yet to\nremember the days when we knew not, and the ways when all was uncertain,\nand the end could not be distinguished from the beginning, is sweet and\ndear; and that which was done in the dim twilight should be celebrated in\nthe day; and our Father himself loves to hear of those who, having not\nseen, loved, and who learned without any teacher, and followed the light,\nthough they did not understand.\"\n\nAnd then he told them the story of one who had lived in the old time; and\nin that air, which seemed to be made of sunshine, and amid all those\nstately palaces, he described to them the little earth which they had\nleft behind--the skies that were covered with clouds, and the ways that\nwere so rough and stony, and the cruelty of the oppressor, and the cries\nof those that were oppressed. And he showed the sickness and the\ntroubles, and the sorrow and danger; and how Death stalked about, and\ntore heart from heart; and how sometimes the strongest would fail, and\nthe truest fall under the power of a lie, and the tenderest forget to be\nkind; and how evil things lurked in every corner to beguile the dwellers\nthere; and how the days were short and the nights dark, and life so\nlittle that by the time a man had learned something it was his hour to\ndie. \"What can a soul do that is born there?\" he cried; \"for war is there\nand fighting, and perplexity and darkness; and no man knows if that\nwhich he does will be for good or evil, or can tell which is the best\nway, or know the end from the beginning; and those he loves the most are\na mystery to him, and their thoughts beyond his reach. And clouds are\nbetween him and the Father, and he is deceived with false gods and false\nteachers, who make him to love a lie.\" The people who were listening held\ntheir breath, and a shadow like a cloud fell on them, and they remembered\nand knew that it was true. But the next moment their hearts rebelled, and\none and another would have spoken, and the little Pilgrim herself had\nalmost cried out and made her plea for the dear earth which she loved;\nwhen he suddenly threw forth his voice again like a great song. \"Oh, dear\nmother earth,\" he cried; \"oh, little world and great, forgive thy son!\nfor lovely thou art and dear, and the sun of God shines upon thee, and\nthe sweet dews fall; and there were we born, and loved and died, and are\ncome hence to bless the Father and the Son. For in no other world, though\nthey are so vast, is it given to any to know the Lord in the darkness,\nand follow him groping, and make way through sin and death, and overcome\nthe evil, and conquer in his name.\" At which there was a great sound of\nweeping and of triumph, and the little Pilgrim could not contain herself,\nbut cried out too in joy as if for a deliverance. And then the poet told\nhis tale. And as he told them of the man who was poor and sorrowful and\nalone, and how he loved and was not loved again, and trusted and was\nbetrayed, and was tempted and drawn into the darkness, so that it seemed\nas if he must perish; but when hope was almost gone, turned again from\nthe edge of despair, and confronted all his enemies, and fought and\nconquered--the people followed every word with great outcries of love and\npity and wonder. For each one as he listened remembered his own career\nand that of his brethren in the old life, and admired to think that all\nthe evil was past, and wondered that out of such tribulation and through\nso many dangers all were safe and blessed here. And there were others\nthat were not of them, who listened, some seated at the windows of the\npalaces and some standing in the great square,--people who were not like\nthe others, whose bearing was more majestic, and who looked upon the\ncrowd all smiling and weeping, with wonder and interest, but had no\nknowledge of the cause, and listened as it were to a tale that is told.\nThe poet and his audience were as one, and at every period of the story\nthere was a deep breathing and pause, and every one looked at his\nneighbor, and some grasped each other's hands as they remembered all that\nwas in the past; but the strangers listened and gazed and observed all,\nas those who listen and are instructed in something beyond their\nknowledge. The little Pilgrim stood all this time not knowing where she\nwas, so intent was she upon the tale; and as she listened it seemed to\nher that all her own life was rolling out before her, and she remembered\nthe things that had been, and perceived how all had been shaped and\nguided, and trembled a little for the brother who was in danger, yet knew\nthat all would be well.\n\nThe woman who had been at her side listened too with all her heart,\nsaying to herself, as she stood in the crowd, \"He has left nothing out!\nThe little days they were so short, and the skies would change all in a\nmoment and one's heart with them. How he brings it all back!\" And she put\nup her hand to dry away a tear from her eyes, though her face all the\ntime was shining with the recollection. The little Pilgrim was glad to be\nby the side of a woman after talking with so many men, and she put out\nher hand and touched the cloak that this lady wore, and which was white\nand of the most beautiful texture, with gold threads woven in it, or\nsomething that looked like gold.\n\n\"Do you like,\" she said, \"to think of the old time?\"\n\nThe woman turned and looked down upon her, for she was tall and stately,\nand immediately took the hand of the little Pilgrim into hers, and held\nit without answering, till the poet had ended and come down from the\nplace where he had been standing. He came straight through the crowd to\nwhere this lady stood, and said something to her. \"You did well to tell\nme,\" looking at her with love in his eyes,--not the tender sweetness\nof all those kind looks around, but the love that is for one. The little\nPilgrim looked at them with her heart beating, and was very glad for\nthem, and happy in herself; for she had not seen this love before since\nshe came into the city, and it had troubled her to think that perhaps it\ndid not exist any more. \"I am glad,\" the lady said, and gave him her\nother hand; \"but here is a little sister who asks me something, and I\nmust answer her. I think she has but newly come.\"\n\n\"She has a face full of the morning,\" the poet said. It did the little\nPilgrim good to feel the touch of the warm, soft hand; and she was not\nafraid, but lifted her eyes and spoke to the lady and to the poet. \"It is\nbeautiful what you said to us. Sometimes in the old time we used to look\nup to the beautiful skies and wonder what there was above the clouds; but\nwe never thought that up here in this great city you would be thinking of\nwhat we were doing, and making beautiful poems all about us. We thought\nthat you would sing wonderful psalms, and talk of things high, high above\nus.\"\n\n\"The little sister does not know what the meaning of the earth is,\" the\npoet said. \"It is but a little speck, but it is the centre of all. Let\nher walk with us, and we will go home, and you will tell her, Ama, for I\nlove to hear you talk.\"\n\n\"Will you come with us?\" the lady said.\n\nAnd the little Pilgrim's heart leaped up in her, to think she was now\ngoing to see a home in this wonderful city; and they went along, hand in\nhand, and though they were three together, and many were coming and\ngoing, there was no difficulty, for every one made way for them. And\nthere was a little murmur of pleasure as the poet passed, and those who\nhad heard his poem made obeisance to him, and thanked him, and thanked\nthe Father for him that he was able to show them so many beautiful\nthings. And they walked along the street which was shining with color,\nand saw as they passed how the master painter had come to his work, and\nwas standing upon the balcony where the little Pilgrim had been, and\nbringing out of the wall, under his hand, faces which were full of life,\nand which seemed to spring forth as if they had been hidden there. \"Let\nus wait a little and see him working,\" the poet said; and all round about\nthe people stopped on their way, and there was a soft cry of pleasure and\npraise all through the beautiful street. And the painter with whom the\nlittle Pilgrim had talked before came, and stood behind her as if he had\nbeen an old friend, and called out to her at every new touch to mark how\nthis and that was done. She did not understand as he did, but she saw how\nbeautiful it was, and she was glad to have seen the great painter, as she\nhad been glad to hear the great poet. It seemed to the little Pilgrim as\nif everything happened well for her, and that no one had ever been so\nblessed before. And to make it all more sweet, this new friend, this\ngreat and sweet lady, always held her hand, and pressed it softly when\nsomething more lovely appeared; and even the pictured faces on the wall\nseemed to beam upon her, as they came out one by one like the stars in\nthe sky. Then the three went on again, and passed by many more beautiful\npalaces, and great streets leading away into the light, till you could\nsee no further; and they met with bands of singers who sang so sweetly\nthat the heart seemed to leap out of the Pilgrim's breast to meet with\nthem, for above all things this was what she had loved most. And out of\none of the palaces there came such glorious music that everything she had\nseen and heard before seemed as nothing in comparison. And amid all these\ndelights they went on and on, but without wearying, till they came out of\nthe streets into lovely walks and alleys, and made their way to the banks\nof a great river, which seemed to sing, too, a soft melody of its own.\n\nAnd here there were some fair houses surrounded by gardens and flowers\nthat grew everywhere, and the doors were all open, and within everything\nwas lovely and still, and ready for rest if you were weary. The little\nPilgrim was not weary; but the lady placed her upon a couch in the porch,\nwhere the pillars and the roof were all formed of interlacing plants and\nflowers; and there they sat with her, and talked, and explained to her\nmany things. They told her that the earth though so small was the place\nin all the world to which the thoughts of those above were turned. \"And\nnot only of us who have lived there, but of all our brothers in the other\nworlds; for we are the race which the Father has chosen to be the\nexample. In every age there is one that is the scene of the struggle and\nthe victory, and it is for this reason that the chronicles are made, and\nthat we are all placed here to gather the meaning of what has been done\namong men. And I am one of those,\" the lady said, \"that go back to the\ndear earth and gather up the tale of what our little brethren are doing.\nI have not to succor like some others, but only to see and bring the\nnews; and he makes them into great poems, as you have heard; and\nsometimes the master painter will take one and make of it a picture; and\nthere is nothing that is so delightful to us as when we can bring back\nthe histories of beautiful things.\"\n\n\"But, oh,\" said the little Pilgrim, \"what can there be on earth so\nbeautiful as the meanest thing that is here?\"\n\nThen they both smiled upon her and said, \"It is more beautiful than the\nmost beautiful thing here to see how, under the low skies and in the\nshort days, a soul will turn to our Father. And sometimes,\" said Ama,\n\"when I am watching, one will wander and stray, and be led into the\ndark till my heart is sick; then come back and make me glad. Sometimes I\ncry out within myself to the Father, and say, 'O my Father, it is\nenough!' and it will seem to me that it is not possible to stand by and\nsee his destruction.  And then while you are gazing, while you are\ncrying, he will recover and return, and go on again. And to the angels it\nis more wonderful than to us, for they have never lived there. And all\nthe other worlds are eager to hear what we can tell them. For no one\nknows except the Father how the battle will turn, or when it will all be\naccomplished; and there are some who tremble for our little brethren. For\nto look down and see how little light there is, and how no one knows what\nmay happen to him next, makes them afraid who never were there.\"\n\nThe little Pilgrim listened with an intent face, clasping her hands, and\nsaid,--\n\n\"But it never could be that our Father should be overcome by evil. Is not\nthat known in all the worlds?\"\n\nThen the lady turned and kissed her; and the poet broke forth in singing,\nand said, \"Faith is more heavenly than heaven; it is more beautiful than\nthe angels. It is the only voice that can answer to our Father. We praise\nhim, we glorify him, we love his name; but there is but one response to\nhim through all the worlds, and that is the cry of the little brothers,\nwho see nothing and know nothing, but believe that he will never fail.\"\n\nAt this the little Pilgrim wept, for her heart was touched; but she\nsaid,--\n\n\"We are not so ignorant; for we have our Lord who is our Brother, and he\nteaches us all that we require to know.\"\n\nUpon this the poet rose and lifted up his hands and sang again a great\nsong; it was in the other language which the little Pilgrim still did not\nunderstand, but she could make out that it sounded like a great\nproclamation that He was wise as he was good, and called upon all to see\nthat the Lord had chosen the only way: and the sound of the poet's voice\nwas like a great trumpet sounding bold and sweet, as if to tell this to\nthose who were far away.\n\n\"For you must know,\" said the Lady Ama, who all the time held the\nPilgrim's hand, \"that it is permitted to all to judge according to the\nwisdom that has been given them. And there are some who think that our\ndear Lord might have found another way, and that wait, sometimes with\ntrembling, lest he should fail; but not among us who have lived on earth,\nfor we know. And it is our work to show to all the worlds that his way\nnever fails, and how wonderful it is, and beautiful above all that heart\nhas conceived. And thus we justify the ways of God, who is our Father.\nBut in the other worlds there are many who will continue to fear until\nthe history of the earth is all ended and the chronicles are made\ncomplete.\"\n\n\"And will that be long?\" the little Pilgrim cried, feeling in her heart\nthat she would like to go to all the worlds and tell them of our Lord,\nand of his love, and how the thought of him makes you strong; and it\ntroubled her a little to hear her friends speak of the low skies, and the\nshort days, and the dimness of that dear country which she had left\nbehind, in which there were so many still whom she loved.\n\nUpon this Ama shook her head, and said that of that day no one knew, not\neven our Lord, but only the Father; and then she smiled and answered the\nlittle Pilgrim's thought. \"When we go back,\" she said, \"it is not as when\nwe lived there; for now we see all the dangers of it and the mysteries\nwhich we did not see before. It was by the Father's dear love that we did\nnot see what was around us and about us while we lived there, for then\nour hearts would have fainted; and that makes us wonder now that any one\nendures to the end.\"\n\n\"You are a great deal wiser than I am,\" said the little Pilgrim; \"but,\nthough our hearts had fainted, how could we have been overcome? For He\nwas on our side.\"\n\nAt this neither of them made any reply at first, but looked at her; and\nat length the poet said that she had brought many thoughts back to his\nmind, and how he had himself been almost worsted when one like her came\nto him and gave strength to his soul. \"For that He was on our side was\nthe only thing she knew,\" he said, \"and all that could be learned or\ndiscovered was not worthy of naming beside it. And this I must tell when\nnext I speak to the people, and how our little sister brought it to my\nmind.\"\n\nAnd then they paused from this discourse, and the little Pilgrim looked\nround upon the beautiful houses and the fair gardens, and she said,--\n\n\"You live here? and do you come home at night?--but I do not mean at\nnight, I mean when your work is done. And are they poets like you that\ndwell all about in these pleasant places, and the--\"\n\nShe would have said the children, but stopped, not knowing if perhaps it\nmight be unkind to speak of the children when she saw none there.\n\nUpon this the lady smiled once more, and said,--\n\n\"The door stands open always, so that no one is shut out, and the\nchildren come and go when they will. They are children no longer, and\nthey have their appointed work like him and me.\"\n\n\"And you are always among those you love?\" the Pilgrim said; upon which\nthey smiled again and said, \"We all love each other;\" and the lady held\nher hand in both of hers, and caressed it, and softly laughed and said,\n\"You know only the little language. When you have been taught the other\nyou will learn many beautiful things.\"\n\nShe rested for some time after this, and talked much with her new\nfriends; and then there came into the heart of the little Pilgrim a\nlonging to go to the place which was appointed for her, and which was her\nhome, and to do the work which had been given her to do. And when the\nlady saw this she rose and said that she would accompany her a little\nupon her way. But the poet bid her farewell and remained under the porch,\nwith the green branches shading him, and the flowers twining round the\npillars, and the open door of this beautiful house behind him. When\nshe looked back upon him he waved his hand to her as if bidding her\nGod-speed, and the lady by her side looked back too and waved her hand,\nand the little Pilgrim felt tears of happiness come to her eyes; for she\nhad been wondering with a little disappointment to see that the people in\nthe city, except those who were strangers, were chiefly alone, and not\nlike those in the old world where the husband and wife go together. It\nconsoled her to see again two who were one. The lady pressed her hand in\nanswer to her thought, and bade her pause a moment and look back into the\ncity as they passed the end of the great street out of which they came.\nAnd then the Pilgrim was more and more consoled, for she saw many who\nhad before been alone now walking together hand in hand.\n\n\"It is not as it was,\" Ama said. \"For all of us have work to do which is\nneeded for the worlds, and it is no longer needful that one should sit at\nhome while the other goes forth; for our work is not for our life as of\nold, or for ourselves, but for the Father who has given us so great a\ntrust. And, little sister, you must know that though we are not so great\nas the angels, nor as many that come to visit us from the other worlds,\nyet we are nearer to him. For we are in his secret, and it is ours to\nmake it clear.\"\n\nThe little Pilgrim's heart was very full to hear this; but she said,--\n\n\"I was never clever, nor knew much. It is better for me to go away to my\nlittle border-land, and help the strangers who do not know the way.\"\n\n\"Whatever is your work is the best,\" the lady said; \"but though you are\nso little you are in the Father's secret too, for it is nature to you to\nknow what the others cannot be sure of, that we must have the victory at\nthe last: so that we have this between us, the Father and we. And though\nall are his children, we are of the kindred of God, because of our Lord\nwho is our Brother.\" And then the Lady Ama kissed her, and bade her when\nshe returned to the great city, either for rest or for love, or because\nthe Father sent for her, that she should come to the house by the river.\n\"For we are friends for ever,\" she said, and so threw her white veil over\nher head, and was gone upon her mission, whither the little Pilgrim did\nnot know.\n\nAnd now she found herself at a distance from the great city, which shone\nin the light with its beautiful towers, and roofs, and all its monuments,\nsoftly fringed with trees, and set in a heavenly firmament. And the\nPilgrim thought of those words that described this lovely place as a\nbride adorned for her husband, and did not wonder at him who had said\nthat her streets were of gold and her gates of pearl, because gold and\npearls and precious jewels were as nothing to the glory and the beauty of\nher. The little Pilgrim was glad to have seen these wonderful things, and\nher mind was like a cup running over with almost more than it could\ncontain. It seemed to her that there never could be a time when she\nshould want for wonder and interest and delight, so long as she had this\nto think of. Yet she was not sorry to turn her back upon the beautiful\ncity, but went on her way singing in unutterable content, and thinking\nover what the lady had said, that we were in God's secret, more than all\nthe great worlds above and even the angels, because of knowing how it is\nthat in darkness and doubt, and without any open vision, a man may still\nkeep the right way. The path lay along the bank of the river which flowed\nbeside her and made the air full of music, and a soft air blew across the\nrunning stream and breathed in her face and refreshed her, and the birds\nsang in all the trees. And as she passed through the villages the people\ncame out to meet her, and asked of her if she had come from the city, and\nwhat she had seen there. And everywhere she found friends, and kind\nvoices that gave her greeting. But some would ask her why she still spoke\nthe little language, though it was sweet to their ears; and others when\nthey heard it hastened to call from the houses and the fields some among\nthem who knew the other tongue but a little, and who came and crowded\nround the little Pilgrim, and asked her many questions both about the\nthings she had been seeing and about the old time. And she perceived that\nthe village folk were a simple folk, not learned and wise like those she\nhad left; and that though they lived within sight of the great city, and\nshowed every stranger the beautiful view of it, and the glory of its\ntowers, yet few among them had travelled there; for they were so content\nwith their fields, and their river, and the shade of their trees, and the\nbirds singing, and their simple life, that they wanted no change; though\nit pleased them to receive the little Pilgrim, and they brought her into\ntheir villages rejoicing, and called every one to see her. And they told\nher that they had all been poor and labored hard in the old time, and had\nnever rested; so that now it was the Father's good pleasure that they\nshould enjoy great peace and consolation among the fresh-breathing fields\nand on the riverside, so that there were many who even now had little\noccupation except to think of the Father's goodness, and to rest. And\nthey told her how the Lord himself would come among them, and sit down\nunder a tree, and tell them one of his parables, and make them all more\nhappy than words could say; and how sometimes he would send one out of\nthe beautiful city, with a poem or tale to say to them, and bands of\nlovely music, more lovely than anything beside, except the sound of the\nLord's own voice. \"And what is more wonderful, the angels themselves come\noften and listen to us,\" they said, \"when we begin to talk and remind\neach other of the old time, and how we suffered heat and cold, and were\nbowed down with labor, and bending over the soil, and how sometimes the\nharvest would fail us, and sometimes we had not bread, and sometimes\nwould hush the children to sleep because there was nothing to give them;\nand how we grew old and weary, and still worked on and on.\" \"We are\nthose who were old,\" a number of them called out to her, with a murmuring\nsound of laughter, one looking over another's shoulder. And one woman\nsaid, \"The angels say to us, 'Did you never think the Father had forsaken\nyou and the Lord forgotten you?'\" And all the rest answered as in a\nchorus, \"There were moments that we thought this; but all the time we\nknew that it could not be.\" \"And the angels wonder at us,\" said another.\nAll this they said, crowding one before another, every one anxious to say\nsomething, and sometimes speaking together, but always in accord. And\nthen there was a sound of laughter and pleasure, both at the strange\nthought that the Lord could have forgotten them, and at the wonder of the\nangels over their simple tales. And immediately they began to remind each\nother, and say, \"Do you remember?\" and they told the little Pilgrim a\nhundred tales of the hardships and troubles they had known, all smiling\nand radiant with pleasure; and at every new account the others would\napplaud and rejoice, feeling the happiness all the more for the evils\nthat were past. And some of them led her into their gardens to show her\ntheir flowers, and to tell her how they had begun to study and learn\nhow colors were changed and form perfected, and the secrets of the growth\nand of the germ, of which they had been ignorant. And others arranged\nthemselves in choirs, and sang to her delightful songs of the fields, and\naccompanied her out upon her way, singing and answering to each other.\nThe difference between the simple folk and the greatness of the others\nmade the little Pilgrim wonder and admire; and she loved them in her\nsimplicity, and turned back many a time to wave her hand to them, and to\nlisten to the lovely simple singing as it went further and further away.\nIt had an evening tone of rest and quietness, and of protection and\npeace. \"He leadeth me by the green pastures and beside the quiet waters,\"\nshe said to herself; and her heart swelled with pleasure to think that it\nwas those who had been so old, and so weary and poor, who had this rest\nto console them for all their sorrows.\n\nAnd as she went along, not only did she pass through many other villages,\nbut met many on the way who were travelling towards the great city, and\nwould greet her sweetly as they passed, and sometimes stop to say a\npleasant word, so that the little Pilgrim was never lonely wherever she\nwent. But most of them began to speak to her in the other language, which\nwas as beautiful and sweet as music, but which she could not understand;\nand they were surprised to find her ignorant of it, not knowing that she\nwas but a new-comer into these lands. And there were many things that\ncould not be told but in that language, for the earthly tongue had no\nwords to express them. The little Pilgrim was a little sad not to\nunderstand what was said to her, but cheered herself with the thought\nthat it should be taught to her by one whom she loved best. The way by\nthe riverside was very cheerful and bright, with many people coming and\ngoing, and many villages, some of them with a bridge across the stream,\nsome withdrawn among the fields, but all of them bright and full of life,\nand with sounds of music, and voices, and footsteps: and the little\nPilgrim felt no weariness, and moved along as lightly as a child, taking\ngreat pleasure in everything she saw, and answering all the friendly\ngreetings with all her heart, yet glad to think that she was approaching\never nearer to the country where it was ordained that she should dwell\nfor a time and succor the strangers, and receive those who were newly\narrived. And she consoled herself with the thought that there was no need\nof any language but that which she knew. As this went through her mind,\nmaking her glad, she suddenly became aware of one who was walking by her\nside, a lady who was covered with a veil white and shining like that\nwhich Ama had worn in the beautiful city. It hung about this stranger's\nhead so that it was not easy to see her face, but the sound of her voice\nwas very sweet in the pilgrim's ear, yet startled her like the sound of\nsomething which she knew well, but could not remember. And as there\nwere few who were going that way, she was glad and said, \"Let us walk\ntogether, if that pleases you.\" And the stranger said, \"It is for that I\nhave come,\" which was a reply which made the little Pilgrim wonder more\nand more, though she was very glad and joyful to have this companion upon\nher way. And then the lady began to ask her many questions, not about the\ncity, or the great things she had seen, but about herself, and what the\ndear Lord had given her to do.\n\n\"I am little and weak, and I cannot do much,\" the little Pilgrim said.\n\"It is nothing but pleasure. It is to welcome those that are coming, and\ntell them. Sometimes they are astonished and do not know. I was so\nmyself. I came in my sleep, and understood nothing. But now that I know,\nit is sweet to tell them that they need not fear.\"\n\n\"I was glad,\" the lady said, \"that you came in your sleep; for sometimes\nthe way is dark and hard, and you are little and tender. When your\nbrother comes you will be the first to see him, and show him the way.\"\n\n\"My brother! is he coming?\" the little Pilgrim cried. And then she said\nwith a wistful look, \"But we are all brethren, and you mean only one of\nthose who are the children of our Father. You must forgive me that I do\nnot know the higher speech, but only what is natural, for I have not yet\nbeen long here.\"\n\n\"He whom I mean is called--\" and here the lady said a name which was the\ntrue name of a brother born whom the Pilgrim loved above all others. She\ngave a cry, and then she said, trembling, \"I know your voice, but I\ncannot see your face. And what you say makes me think of many things. No\none else has covered her face when she has spoken to me. I know you, and\nyet I cannot tell who you are.\"\n\nThe woman stood for a little without saying a word, and then very softly,\nin a voice which only the heart heard, she called the little Pilgrim by\nher name.\n\n\"MOTHER,\" cried the Pilgrim, with such a cry of joy that it echoed all\nabout in the sweet air, and flung herself upon the veiled lady, and drew\nthe veil from her face, and saw that it was she. And with this sight\nthere came a revelation which flooded her soul with happiness. For the\nface which had been old and feeble was old no longer, but fair in the\nmaturity of day; and the figure that had been bent and weary was full of\na tender majesty, and the arms that clasped her about were warm and soft\nwith love and life. And all that had changed their relations in the other\ndays and made the mother in her weakness seem as a child, and transferred\nall protection and strength to the daughter, was gone for ever and the\nlittle Pilgrim beheld in a rapture one who was her sister and equal, yet\never above her,--more near to her than any, though all were so near,--one\nof whom she herself was a part, yet another, and who knew all her\nthoughts and the way of them before they arose in her. And to see her\nface as in the days of her prime, and her eyes so clear and wise, and to\nfeel once more that which is different from the love of all, that which\nis still most sweet where all is sweet, the love of one, was like a crown\nto her in her happiness. The little Pilgrim could not think for joy, nor\nsay a word, but held this dear mother's hands and looked in her face, and\nher heart soared away to the Father in thanks and joy. They sat down by\nthe roadside under the shade of the trees,--while the river ran softly\nby, and everything was hushed out of sympathy and kindness,--and\nquestioned each other of all that had been and was to be. And the little\nPilgrim told all the little news of home, and of the brothers and sisters\nand the children that had been born, and of those whose faces were turned\ntowards this better country; and the mother smiled and listened and would\nhave heard all over and over, although many things she already knew. \"But\nwhy should I tell you, for did not you watch over us and see all we did,\nand were not you near us always?\" the little Pilgrim said.\n\n\"How could that be?\" said the mother; \"for we are not like our Lord, to\nbe everywhere. We come and go where we are sent. But sometimes we knew,\nand sometimes saw, and always loved. And whenever our hearts were sick\nfor news it was but to go to him, and he told us everything. And now, my\nlittle one, you are as we are, and have seen the Lord. And this has been\ngiven us, to teach our child once more, and show you the heavenly\nlanguage, that you may understand all, both the little and the great.\"\n\nThen the Pilgrim lifted her head from her mother's bosom, and looked in\nher face with eyes full of longing. \"You said 'we,'\" she said.\n\nThe mother did nothing but smile; then lifted her eyes and looked along\nthe beautiful path of the river to where some one was coming to join\nthem. And the little Pilgrim cried out again, in wonder and joy; and\npresently found herself seated between them, her father and her mother,\nthe two who had loved her most in the other days. They looked more\nbeautiful than the angels and all the great persons whom she had seen;\nfor still they were hers and she was theirs more than all the angels and\nall the blessed could be. And thus she learned that though the new may\ntake the place of the old, and many things may blossom out of it like\nflowers, yet that the old is never done away. And then they sat together,\ntelling of everything that had befallen, and all the little tender things\nthat were of no import, and all the great changes and noble ways, and the\nwonders of heaven above--and the earth beneath, for all, were open to\nthem, both great and small; and when they had satisfied their souls with\nthese, her father and mother began to teach her the\n\n### Summary:\n\n"}

It had many advantages which made it peculiarly\nappropriate. It was within reach of Edinburgh; and my boy Roland, whose\neducation had been considerably neglected, could go in and out to\nschool; which was thought to be better for him than either leaving home\naltogether or staying there always with a tutor. The first of these\nexpedients would have seemed preferable to me; the second commended\nitself to his mother. The doctor, like a judicious man, took the midway\nbetween. \"Put him on his pony, and let him ride into the High School\nevery morning; it will do him all the good in the world,\" Dr. Simson\nsaid; \"and when it is bad weather, there is the train.\" His mother\naccepted this solution of the difficulty more easily than I could have\nhoped; and our pale-faced boy, who had never known anything more\ninvigorating than Simla, began to encounter the brisk breezes of the\nNorth in the subdued severity of the month of May. Before the time of\nthe vacation in July we had the satisfaction of seeing him begin to\nacquire something of the brown and ruddy complexion of his\nschoolfellows. The English system did not commend itself to Scotland in\nthese days. There was no little Eton at Fettes; nor do I think, if there\nhad been, that a genteel exotic of that class would have tempted either\nmy wife or me. The lad was doubly precious to us, being the only one\nleft us of many; and he was fragile in body, we believed, and deeply\nsensitive in mind. To keep him at home, and yet to send him to\nschool,--to combine the advantages of the two systems,--seemed to be\neverything that could be desired. The two girls also found at Brentwood\neverything they wanted. They were near enough to Edinburgh to have\nmasters and lessons as many as they required for completing that\nnever-ending education which the young people seem to require nowadays.\nTheir mother married me when she was younger than Agatha; and I should\nlike to see them improve upon their mother! I myself was then no more\nthan twenty-five,--an age at which I see the young fellows now groping\nabout them, with no notion what they are going to do with their lives.\nHowever; I suppose every generation has a conceit of itself which\nelevates it, in its own opinion, above that which comes after it.\n\nBrentwood stands on that fine and wealthy <DW72> of country--one of the\nrichest in Scotland--which lies between the Pentland Hills and the\nFirth. In clear weather you could see the blue gleam--like a bent bow,\nembracing the wealthy fields and scattered houses--of the great estuary\non one side of you, and on the other the blue heights, not gigantic like\nthose we had been used to, but just high enough for all the glories of\nthe atmosphere, the play of clouds, and sweet reflections, which give to\na hilly country an interest and a charm which nothing else can emulate.\nEdinburgh--with its two lesser heights, the Castle and the Calton Hill,\nits spires and towers piercing through the smoke, and Arthur's Seat lying\ncrouched behind, like a guardian no longer very needful, taking his\nrepose beside the well-beloved charge, which is now, so to speak, able to\ntake care of itself without him--lay at our right hand. From the lawn\nand drawing-room windows we could see all these varieties of landscape.\nThe color was sometimes a little chilly, but sometimes, also, as animated\nand full of vicissitude as a drama. I was never tired of it. Its color\nand freshness revived the eyes which had grown weary of arid plains and\nblazing skies. It was always cheery, and fresh, and full of repose.\n\nThe village of Brentwood lay almost under the house, on the other side of\nthe deep little ravine, down which a stream--which ought to have been a\nlovely, wild, and frolicsome little river--flowed between its rocks and\ntrees. The river, like so many in that district, had, however, in its\nearlier life been sacrificed to trade, and was grimy with paper-making.\nBut this did not affect our pleasure in it so much as I have known it to\naffect other streams. Perhaps our water was more rapid; perhaps less\nclogged with dirt and refuse. Our side of the dell was charmingly\n_accidente_, and clothed with fine trees, through which various paths\nwound down to the river-side and to the village bridge which crossed the\nstream. The village lay in the hollow, and climbed, with very prosaic\nhouses, the other side. Village architecture does not flourish in\nScotland. The blue slates and the gray stone are sworn foes to the\npicturesque; and though I do not, for my own part, dislike the interior\nof an old-fashioned hewed and galleried church, with its little family\nsettlements on all sides, the square box outside, with its bit of a spire\nlike a handle to lift it by, is not an improvement to the landscape.\nStill a cluster of houses on differing elevations, with scraps of garden\ncoming in between, a hedgerow with clothes laid out to dry, the opening\nof a street with its rural sociability, the women at their doors, the\nslow wagon lumbering along, gives a centre to the landscape. It was\ncheerful to look at, and convenient in a hundred ways. Within ourselves\nwe had walks in plenty, the glen being always beautiful in all its\nphases, whether the woods were green in the spring or ruddy in the\nautumn. In the park which surrounded the house were the ruins of the\nformer mansion of Brentwood,--a much smaller and less important house\nthan the solid Georgian edifice which we inhabited. The ruins were\npicturesque, however, and gave importance to the place. Even we, who were\nbut temporary tenants, felt a vague pride in them, as if they somehow\nreflected a certain consequence upon ourselves. The old building had the\nremains of a tower,--an indistinguishable mass of mason-work,\nover-grown with ivy; and the shells of walls attached to this were half\nfilled up with soil. I had never examined it closely, I am ashamed to\nsay. There was a large room, or what had been a large room, with the\nlower part of the windows still existing, on the principal floor, and\nunderneath other windows, which were perfect, though half filled up with\nfallen soil, and waving with a wild growth of brambles and chance growths\nof all kinds. This was the oldest part of all. At a little distance were\nsome very commonplace and disjointed fragments of building, one of them\nsuggesting a certain pathos by its very commonness and the complete wreck\nwhich it showed. This was the end of a low gable, a bit of gray wall, all\nincrusted with lichens, in which was a common door-way. Probably it had\nbeen a servants' entrance, a backdoor, or opening into what are called\n\"the offices\" in Scotland. No offices remained to be entered,--pantry and\nkitchen had all been swept out of being; but there stood the door-way\nopen and vacant, free to all the winds, to the rabbits, and every wild\ncreature. It struck my eye, the first time I went to Brentwood, like a\nmelancholy comment upon a life that was over. A door that led to\nnothing,--closed once, perhaps, with anxious care, bolted and guarded,\nnow void of any meaning. It impressed me, I remember, from the first; so\nperhaps it may be said that my mind was prepared to attach to it an\nimportance which nothing justified.\n\nThe summer was a very happy period of repose for us all. The warmth of\nIndian suns was still in our veins. It seemed to us that we could never\nhave enough of the greenness, the dewiness, the freshness of the northern\nlandscape. Even its mists were pleasant to us, taking all the fever out\nof us, and pouring in vigor and refreshment. In autumn we followed the\nfashion of the time, and went away for change which we did not in the\nleast require. It was when the family had settled down for the winter,\nwhen the days were short and dark, and the rigorous reign of frost upon\nus, that the incidents occurred which alone could justify me in intruding\nupon the world my private affairs. These incidents were, however, of so\ncurious a character, that I hope my inevitable references to my own\nfamily and pressing personal interests will meet with a general pardon.\n\nI was absent in London when these events began. In London an old Indian\nplunges back into the interests with which all his previous life has been\nassociated, and meets old friends at every step. I had been circulating\namong some half-dozen of these,--enjoying the return to my former life in\nshadow, though I had been so thankful in substance to throw it\naside,--and had missed some of my home letters, what with going down from\nFriday to Monday to old Benbow's place in the country, and stopping on\nthe way back to dine and sleep at Sellar's and to take a look into\nCross's stables, which occupied another day. It is never safe to miss\none's letters. In this transitory life, as the Prayer-book says, how can\none ever be certain what is going to happen? All was well at home. I knew\nexactly (I thought) what they would have to say to me: \"The weather has\nbeen so fine, that Roland has not once gone by train, and he enjoys the\nride beyond anything.\" \"Dear papa, be sure that you don't forget\nanything, but bring us so-and-so, and so-and-so,\"--a list as long as my\narm. Dear girls and dearer mother! I would not for the world have\nforgotten their commissions, or lost their little letters, for all the\nBenbows and Crosses in the world.\n\nBut I was confident in my home-comfort and peacefulness. When I got back\nto my club, however, three or four letters were lying for one, upon some\nof which I noticed the \"immediate,\" \"urgent,\" which old-fashioned people\nand anxious people still believe will influence the post-office and\nquicken the speed of the mails. I was about to open one of these, when\nthe club porter brought me two telegrams, one of which, he said, had\narrived the night before. I opened, as was to be expected, the last\nfirst, and this was what I read: \"Why don't you come or answer? For God's\nsake, come. He is much worse.\" This was a thunderbolt to fall upon a\nman's head who had one only son, and he the light of his eyes! The other\ntelegram, which I opened with hands trembling so much that I lost time by\nmy haste, was to much the same purport: \"No better; doctor afraid of\nbrain-fever. Calls for you day and night. Let nothing detain you.\" The\nfirst thing I did was to look up the time-tables to see if there was any\nway of getting off sooner than by the night-train, though I knew well\nenough there was not; and then I read the letters, which furnished, alas!\ntoo clearly, all the details. They told me that the boy had been pale for\nsome time, with a scared look. His mother had noticed it before I left\nhome, but would not say anything to alarm me. This look had increased day\nby day: and soon it was observed that Roland came home at a wild gallop\nthrough the park, his pony panting and in foam, himself \"as white as a\nsheet,\" but with the perspiration streaming from his forehead. For a long\ntime he had resisted all questioning, but at length had developed such\nstrange changes of mood, showing a reluctance to go to school, a desire\nto be fetched in the carriage at night,--which was a ridiculous piece of\nluxury,--an unwillingness to go out into the grounds, and nervous start\nat every sound, that his mother had insisted upon an explanation. When\nthe boy--our boy Roland, who had never known what fear was--began to talk\nto her of voices he had heard in the park, and shadows that had appeared\nto him among the ruins, my wife promptly put him to bed and sent for Dr.\nSimson, which, of course, was the only thing to do.\n\nI hurried off that evening, as may be supposed, with an anxious heart.\nHow I got through the hours before the starting of the train, I cannot\ntell. We must all be thankful for the quickness of the railway when in\nanxiety; but to have thrown myself into a post-chaise as soon as horses\ncould be put to, would have been a relief. I got to Edinburgh very early\nin the blackness of the winter morning, and scarcely dared look the man\nin the face, at whom I gasped, \"What news?\" My wife had sent the\nbrougham for me, which I concluded, before the man spoke, was a bad sign.\nHis answer was that stereotyped answer which leaves the imagination so\nwildly free,--\"Just the same.\" Just the same! What might that mean? The\nhorses seemed to me to creep along the long dark country road. As we\ndashed through the park, I thought I heard some one moaning among the\ntrees, and clenched my fist at him (whoever he might be) with fury. Why\nhad the fool of a woman at the gate allowed any one to come in to disturb\nthe quiet of the place? If I had not been in such hot haste to get home,\nI think I should have stopped the carriage and got out to see what tramp\nit was that had made an entrance, and chosen my grounds, of all places in\nthe world,--when my boy was ill!--to grumble and groan in. But I had no\nreason to complain of our slow pace here. The horses flew like lightning\nalong the intervening path, and drew up at the door all panting, as if\nthey had run a race. My wife stood waiting to receive me, with a pale\nface, and a candle in her hand, which made her look paler still as the\nwind blew the flame about. \"He is sleeping,\" she said in a whisper, as if\nher voice might wake him. And I replied, when I could find my voice, also\nin a whisper, as though the jingling of the horses' furniture and the\nsound of their hoofs must not have been more dangerous. I stood on the\nsteps with her a moment, almost afraid to go in, now that I was here; and\nit seemed to me that I saw without observing, if I may say so, that the\nhorses were unwilling to turn round, though their stables lay that way,\nor that the men were unwilling. These things occurred to me afterwards,\nthough at the moment I was not capable of anything but to ask questions\nand to hear of the condition of the boy.\n\nI looked at him from the door of his room, for we were afraid to go near,\nlest we should disturb that blessed sleep. It looked like actual sleep,\nnot the lethargy into which my wife told me he would sometimes fall. She\ntold me everything in the next room, which communicated with his, rising\nnow and then and going to the door of communication; and in this there\nwas much that was very startling and confusing to the mind. It appeared\nthat ever since the winter began--since it was early dark, and night had\nfallen before his return from school--he had been hearing voices among\nthe ruins: at first only a groaning, he said, at which his pony was as\nmuch alarmed as he was, but by degrees a voice. The tears ran down my\nwife's cheeks as she described to me how he would start up in the night\nand cry out, \"Oh, mother, let me in! oh, mother, let me in!\" with a\npathos which rent her heart. And she sitting there all the time, only\nlonging to do everything his heart could desire! But though she would try\nto soothe him, crying, \"You are at home, my darling. I am here. Don't you\nknow me? Your mother is here!\" he would only stare at her, and after a\nwhile spring up again with the same cry. At other times he would be quite\nreasonable, she said, asking eagerly when I was coming, but declaring\nthat he must go with me as soon as I did so, \"to let them in.\" \"The\ndoctor thinks his nervous system must have received a shock,\" my wife\nsaid. \"Oh, Henry, can it be that we have pushed him on too much with his\nwork--a delicate boy like Roland? And what is his work in comparison with\nhis health? Even you would think little of honors or prizes if it hurt\nthe boy's health.\" Even I!--as if I were an inhuman father sacrificing my\nchild to my ambition. But I would not increase her trouble by taking any\nnotice. After awhile they persuaded me to lie down, to rest, and to eat,\nnone of which things had been possible since I received their letters.\nThe mere fact of being on the spot, of course, in itself was a great\nthing; and when I knew that I could be called in a moment, as soon as he\nwas awake and wanted me, I felt capable, even in the dark, chill morning\ntwilight, to snatch an hour or two's sleep. As it happened, I was so\nworn out with the strain of anxiety, and he so quieted and consoled by\nknowing I had come, that I was not disturbed till the afternoon, when the\ntwilight had again settled down. There was just daylight enough to see\nhis face when I went to him; and what a change in a fortnight! He was\npaler and more worn, I thought, than even in those dreadful days in the\nplains before we left India. His hair seemed to me to have grown long and\nlank; his eyes were like blazing lights projecting out of his white face.\nHe got hold of my hand in a cold and tremulous clutch, and waved to\neverybody to go away. \"Go away--even mother,\" he said; \"go away.\" This\nwent to her heart; for she did not like that even I should have more of\nthe boy's confidence than herself; but my wife has never been a woman to\nthink of herself, and she left us alone. \"Are they all gone?\" he said\neagerly. \"They would not let me speak. The doctor treated me as if I were\na fool. You know I am not a fool, papa.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, my boy, I know. But you are ill, and quiet is so necessary.\nYou are not only not a fool, Roland, but you are reasonable and\nunderstand. When you are ill you must deny yourself; you must not do\neverything that you might do being well.\"\n\nHe waved his thin hand with a sort of indignation. \"Then, father, I am\nnot ill,\" he cried. \"Oh, I thought when you came you would not stop\nme,--you would see the sense of it! What do you think is the matter with\nme, all of you? Simson is well enough; but he is only a doctor. What do\nyou think is the matter with me? I am no more ill than you are. A doctor,\nof course, he thinks you are ill the moment he looks at you--that's what\nhe's there for--and claps you into bed.\"\n\n\"Which is the best place for you at present, my dear boy.\"\n\n\"I made up my mind,\" cried the little fellow, \"that I would stand it till\nyou came home. I said to myself, I won't frighten mother and the girls.\nBut now, father,\" he cried, half jumping out of bed, \"it's not illness:\nit's a secret.\"\n\nHis eyes shone so wildly, his face was so swept with strong feeling, that\nmy heart sank within me. It could be nothing but fever that did it, and\nfever had been so fatal. I got him into my arms to put him back into\nbed. \"Roland,\" I said, humoring the poor child, which I knew was the\nonly way, \"if you are going to tell me this secret to do any good, you\nknow you must be quite quiet, and not excite yourself. If you excite\nyourself, I must not let you speak.\"\n\n\"Yes, father,\" said the boy. He was quiet directly, like a man, as if he\nquite understood. When I had laid him back on his pillow, he looked up at\nme with that grateful, sweet look with which children, when they are ill,\nbreak one's heart, the water coming into his eyes in his weakness. \"I was\nsure as soon as you were here you would know what to do,\" he said.\n\n\"To be sure, my boy. Now keep quiet, and tell it all out like a man.\" To\nthink I was telling lies to my own child! for I did it only to humor him,\nthinking, poor little fellow, his brain was wrong.\n\n\"Yes, father. Father, there is some one in the park--some one that has\nbeen badly used.\"\n\n\"Hush, my dear; you remember there is to be no excitement. Well, who\nis this somebody, and who has been ill-using him? We will soon put\na stop to that.\"\n\n\"All,\" cried Roland, \"but it is not so easy as you think. I don't know\nwho it is. It is just a cry. Oh, if you could hear it! It gets into my\nhead in my sleep. I heard it as clear--as clear; and they think that I\nam dreaming, or raving perhaps,\" the boy said, with a sort of\ndisdainful smile.\n\nThis look of his perplexed me; it was less like fever than I thought.\n\"Are you quite sure you have not dreamed it, Roland?\" I said.\n\n\"Dreamed?--that!\" He was springing up again when he suddenly bethought\nhimself, and lay down flat, with the same sort of smile on his face. \"The\npony heard it, too,\" he said. \"She jumped as if she had been shot. If I\nhad not grasped at the reins--for I was frightened, father--\"\n\n\"No shame to you, my boy,\" said I, though I scarcely knew why.\n\n\"If I hadn't held to her like a leech, she'd have pitched me over her\nhead, and never drew breath till we were at the door. Did the pony dream\nit?\" he said, with a soft disdain, yet indulgence for my foolishness.\nThen he added slowly, \"It was only a cry the first time, and all the\ntime before you went away. I wouldn't tell you, for it was so wretched\nto be frightened. I thought it might be a hare or a rabbit snared, and I\nwent in the morning and looked; but there was nothing. It was after you\nwent I heard it really first; and this is what he says.\" He raised\nhimself on his elbow close to me, and looked me in the face: \"'Oh,\nmother, let me in! oh, mother, let me in!'\" As he said the words a mist\ncame over his face, the mouth quivered, the soft features all melted and\nchanged, and when he had ended these pitiful words, dissolved in a\nshower of heavy tears.\n\nWas it a hallucination? Was it the fever of the brain? Was it the\ndisordered fancy caused by great bodily weakness? How could I tell? I\nthought it wisest to accept it as if it were all true.\n\n\"This is very touching, Roland,\" I said.\n\n\"Oh, if you had just heard it, father! I said to myself, if father heard\nit he would do something; but mamma, you know, she's given over to\nSimson, and that fellow's a doctor, and never thinks of anything but\nclapping you into bed.\"\n\n\"We must not blame Simson for being a doctor, Roland.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" said my boy, with delightful toleration and indulgence; \"oh,\nno; that's the good of him; that's what he's for; I know that. But\nyou--you are different; you are just father; and you'll do\nsomething--directly, papa, directly; this very night.\"\n\n\"Surely,\" I said. \"No doubt it is some little lost child.\"\n\nHe gave me a sudden, swift look, investigating my face as though to see\nwhether, after all, this was everything my eminence as \"father\" came\nto,--no more than that. Then he got hold of my shoulder, clutching it\nwith his thin hand. \"Look here,\" he said, with a quiver in his voice;\n\"suppose it wasn't--living at all!\"\n\n\"My dear boy, how then could you have heard it?\" I said.\n\nHe turned away from me with a pettish exclamation,--\"As if you didn't\nknow better than that!\"\n\n\"Do you want to tell me it is a ghost?\" I said.\n\nRoland withdrew his hand; his countenance assumed an aspect of great\ndignity and gravity; a slight quiver remained about his lips. \"Whatever\nit was--you always said we were not to call names. It was something--in\ntrouble. Oh, father, in terrible trouble!\"\n\n\"But, my boy,\" I said (I was at my wits' end), \"if it was a child\nthat was lost, or any poor human creature--but, Roland, what do you\nwant me to do?\"\n\n\"I should know if I was you,\" said the child eagerly. \"That is what I\nalways said to myself,--Father will know. Oh, papa, papa, to have to\nface it night after night, in such terrible, terrible trouble, and never\nto be able to do it any good! I don't want to cry; it's like a baby, I\nknow; but what can I do else? Out there all by itself in the ruin, and\nnobody to help it! I can't bear it! I can't bear it!\" cried my generous\nboy. And in his weakness he burst out, after many attempts to restrain\nit, into a great childish fit of sobbing and tears.\n\nI do not know that I ever was in a greater perplexity, in my life; and\nafterwards, when I thought of it, there was something comic in it too. It\nis bad enough to find your child's mind possessed with the conviction\nthat he has seen, or heard, a ghost; but that he should require you to go\ninstantly and help that ghost was the most bewildering experience that\nhad ever come my way. I am a sober man myself, and not superstitious--at\nleast any more than everybody is superstitious. Of course I do not\nbelieve in ghosts; but I don't deny, any more than other people, that\nthere are stories which I cannot pretend to understand. My blood got a\nsort of chill in my veins at the idea that Roland should be a ghost-seer;\nfor that generally means a hysterical temperament and weak health, and\nall that men most hate and fear for their children. But that I should\ntake up his ghost and right its wrongs, and save it from its trouble, was\nsuch a mission as was enough to confuse any man. I did my best to console\nmy boy without giving any promise of this astonishing kind; but he was\ntoo sharp for me: he would have none of my caresses. With sobs breaking\nin at intervals upon his voice, and the rain-drops hanging on his\neyelids, he yet returned to the charge.\n\n\"It will be there now!--it will be there all the night! Oh, think,\npapa,--think if it was me! I can't rest for thinking of it. Don't!\" he\ncried, putting away my hand,--\"don't! You go and help it, and mother can\ntake care of me.\"\n\n\"But, Roland, what can I do?\"\n\nMy boy opened his eyes, which were large with weakness and fever, and\ngave me a smile such, I think, as sick children only know the secret of.\n\"I was sure you would know as soon as you came. I always said, Father\nwill know. And mother,\" he cried, with a softening of repose upon his\nface, his limbs relaxing, his form sinking with a luxurious ease in his\nbed,--\"mother can come and take care of me.\"\n\nI called her, and saw him turn to her with the complete dependence of a\nchild; and then I went away and left them, as perplexed a man as any in\nScotland. I must say, however, I had this consolation, that my mind was\ngreatly eased about Roland. He might be under a hallucination; but his\nhead was clear enough, and I did not think him so ill as everybody else\ndid. The girls were astonished even at the ease with which I took it.\n\"How do you think he is?\" they said in a breath, coming round me, laying\nhold of me. \"Not half so ill as I expected,\" I said; \"not very bad at\nall.\" \"Oh, papa, you are a darling!\" cried Agatha, kissing me, and crying\nupon my shoulder; while little Jeanie, who was as pale as Roland, clasped\nboth her arms round mine, and could not speak at all. I knew nothing\nabout it, not half so much as Simson; but they believed in me: they had a\nfeeling that all would go right now. God is very good to you when your\nchildren look to you like that. It makes one humble, not proud. I was not\nworthy of it; and then I recollected that I had to act the part of a\nfather to Roland's ghost,--which made me almost laugh, though I might\njust as well have cried. It was the strangest mission that ever was\nintrusted to mortal man.\n\nIt was then I remembered suddenly the looks of the men when they turned\nto take the brougham to the stables in the dark that morning. They had\nnot liked it, and the horses had not liked it. I remembered that even in\nmy anxiety about Roland I had heard them tearing along the avenue back to\nthe stables, and had made a memorandum mentally that I must speak of it.\nIt seemed to me that the best thing I could do was to go to the stables\nnow and make a few inquiries. It is impossible to fathom the minds of\nrustics; there might be some devilry of practical joking, for anything I\nknew; or they might have some interest in getting up a bad reputation for\nthe Brentwood avenue. It was getting dark by the time I went out, and\nnobody who knows the country will need to be told how black is the\ndarkness of a November night under high laurel-bushes and yew-trees. I\nwalked into the heart of the shrubberies two or three times, not seeing a\nstep before me, till I came out upon the broader carriage-road, where the\ntrees opened a little, and there was a faint gray glimmer of sky visible,\nunder which the great limes and elms stood darkling like ghosts; but it\ngrew black again as I approached the corner where the ruins lay. Both\neyes and ears were on the alert, as may be supposed; but I could see\nnothing in the absolute gloom, and, so far as I can recollect, I heard\nnothing. Nevertheless there came a strong impression upon me that\nsomebody was there. It is a sensation which most people have felt. I have\nseen when it has been strong enough to awake me out of sleep, the sense\nof some one looking at me. I suppose my imagination had been affected by\nRoland's story; and the mystery of the darkness is always full of\nsuggestions. I stamped my feet violently on the gravel to rouse myself,\nand called out sharply, \"Who's there?\" Nobody answered, nor did I expect\nany one to answer, but the impression had been made. I was so foolish\nthat I did not like to look back, but went sideways, keeping an eye on\nthe gloom behind. It was with great relief that I spied the light in the\nstables, making a sort of oasis in the darkness. I walked very quickly\ninto the midst of that lighted and cheerful place, and thought the clank\nof the groom's pail one of the pleasantest sounds I had ever heard. The\ncoachman was the head of this little colony, and it was to his house I\nwent to pursue my investigations. He was a native of the district, and\nhad taken care of the place in the absence of the family for years; it\nwas impossible but that he must know everything that was going on, and\nall the traditions of the place. The men, I could see, eyed me anxiously\nwhen I thus appeared at such an hour among them, and followed me with\ntheir eyes to Jarvis's house, where he lived alone with his old wife,\ntheir children being all married and out in the world. Mrs. Jarvis met me\nwith anxious questions. How was the poor young gentleman? But the others\nknew, I could see by their faces, that not even this was the foremost\nthing in my mind.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Noises?--ou ay, there'll be noises,--the wind in the trees, and the\nwater soughing down the glen. As for tramps, Cornel, no, there's little\no' that kind o' cattle about here; and Merran at the gate's a careful\nbody.\" Jarvis moved about with some embarrassment from one leg to\nanother as he spoke. He kept in the shade, and did not look at me more\nthan he could help. Evidently his mind was perturbed, and he had\nreasons for keeping his own counsel. His wife sat by, giving him a quick\nlook now and then, but saying nothing. The kitchen was very snug and\nwarm and bright,--as different as could be from the chill and mystery of\nthe night outside.\n\n\"I think you are trifling with me, Jarvis,\" I said.\n\n\"Triflin', Cornel? No me. What would I trifle for? If the deevil himsel\nwas in the auld hoose, I have no interest in 't one way or another--\"\n\n\"Sandy, hold your peace!\" cried his wife imperatively.\n\n\"And what am I to hold my peace for, wi' the Cornel standing there asking\na' thae questions? I'm saying, if the deevil himsel--\"\n\n\"And I'm telling ye hold your peace!\" cried the woman, in great\nexcitement. \"Dark November weather and lang nichts, and us that ken a' we\nken. How daur ye name--a name that shouldna be spoken?\" She threw down\nher stocking and got up, also in great agitation. \"I tellt ye you never\ncould keep it. It's no a thing that will hide, and the haill toun kens as\nweel as you or me. Tell the Cornel straight out--or see, I'll do it. I\ndinna hold wi' your secrets, and a secret that the haill toun kens!\" She\nsnapped her fingers with an air of large disdain. As for Jarvis, ruddy\nand big as he was, he shrank to nothing before this decided woman. He\nrepeated to her two or three times her own adjuration, \"Hold your peace!\"\nthen, suddenly changing his tone, cried out, \"Tell him then, confound\nye! I'll wash my hands o't. If a' the ghosts in Scotland were in the auld\nhoose, is that ony concern o' mine?\"\n\nAfter this I elicited without much difficulty the whole story. In the\nopinion of the Jarvises, and of everybody about, the certainty that the\nplace was haunted was beyond all doubt. As Sandy and his wife warmed to\nthe tale, one tripping up another in their eagerness to tell everything,\nit gradually developed as distinct a superstition as I ever heard, and\nnot without poetry and pathos. How long it was since the voice had been\nheard first, nobody could tell with certainty. Jarvis's opinion was that\nhis father, who had been coachman at Brentwood before him, had never\nheard anything about it, and that the whole thing had arisen within the\nlast ten years, since the complete dismantling of the old house; which\nwas a wonderfully modern date for a tale so well authenticated. According\nto these witnesses, and to several whom I questioned afterwards, and who\nwere all in perfect agreement, it was only in the months of November and\nDecember that \"the visitation\" occurred. During these months, the darkest\nof the year, scarcely a night passed without the recurrence of these\ninexplicable cries. Nothing, it was said, had ever been seen,--at least,\nnothing that could be identified. Some people, bolder or more imaginative\nthan the others, had seen the darkness moving, Mrs. Jarvis said, with\nunconscious poetry. It began when night fell, and continued, at\nintervals, till day broke. Very often it was only all inarticulate cry\nand moaning, but sometimes the words which had taken possession of my\npoor boy's fancy had been distinctly audible,--\"Oh, mother, let me in!\"\nThe Jarvises were not aware that there had ever been any investigation\ninto it. The estate of Brentwood had lapsed into the hands of a distant\nbranch of the family, who had lived but little there; and of the many\npeople who had taken it, as I had done, few had remained through two\nDecembers. And nobody had taken the trouble to make a very close\nexamination into the facts. \"No, no,\" Jarvis said, shaking his head,\n\"No, no, Cornel. Wha wad set themsels up for a laughin'-stock to a' the\ncountry-side, making a wark about a ghost? Naebody believes in ghosts. It\nbid to be the wind in the trees, the last gentleman said, or some effec'\no' the water wrastlin' among the rocks. He said it was a' quite easy\nexplained; but he gave up the hoose. And when you cam, Cornel, we were\nawfu' anxious you should never hear. What for should I have spoiled the\nbargain and hairmed the property for no-thing?\"\n\n\"Do you call my child's life nothing?\" I said in the trouble of the\nmoment, unable to restrain myself. \"And instead of telling this all to\nme, you have told it to him,--to a delicate boy, a child unable to sift\nevidence or judge for himself, a tender-hearted young creature--\"\n\nI was walking about the room with an anger all the hotter that I felt it\nto be most likely quite unjust. My heart was full of bitterness against\nthe stolid retainers of a family who were content to risk other people's\nchildren and comfort rather than let a house be empty. If I had been\nwarned I might have taken precautions, or left the place, or sent Roland\naway, a hundred things which now I could not do; and here I was with my\nboy in a brain-fever, and his life, the most precious life on earth,\nhanging in the balance, dependent on whether or not I could get to the\nreason of a commonplace ghost-story! I paced about in high wrath, not\nseeing what I was to do; for to take Roland away, even if he were able to\ntravel, would not settle his agitated mind; and I feared even that a\nscientific explanation of refracted sound or reverberation, or any other\nof the easy certainties with which we elder men are silenced, would have\nvery little effect upon the boy.\n\n\"Cornel,\" said Jarvis solemnly, \"and _she'll_ bear me witness,--the young\ngentleman never heard a word from me--no, nor from either groom or\ngardener; I'll gie ye my word for that. In the first place, he's no a lad\nthat invites ye to talk. There are some that are, and some that arena.\nSome will draw ye on, till ye've tellt them a' the clatter of the toun,\nand a' ye ken, and whiles mair. But Maister Roland, his mind's fu' of his\nbooks. He's aye civil and kind, and a fine lad; but no that sort. And ye\nsee it's for a' our interest, Cornel, that you should stay at Brentwood.\nI took it upon me mysel to pass the word,--'No a syllable to Maister\nRoland, nor to the young leddies--no a syllable.' The women-servants,\nthat have little reason to be out at night, ken little or nothing about\nit. And some think it grand to have a ghost so long as they're no in the\nway of coming across it. If you had been tellt the story to begin with,\nmaybe ye would have thought so yourself.\"\n\nThis was true enough, though it did not throw any light upon my\nperplexity. If we had heard of it to start with, it is possible that all\nthe family would have considered the possession of a ghost a distinct\nadvantage. It is the fashion of the times. We never think what a risk it\nis to play with young imaginations, but cry out, in the fashionable\njargon, \"A ghost!--nothing else was wanted to make it perfect.\" I should\nnot have been above this myself. I should have smiled, of course, at the\nidea of the ghost at all, but then to feel that it was mine would have\npleased my vanity. Oh, yes, I claim no exemption. The girls would have\nbeen delighted. I could fancy their eagerness, their interest, and\nexcitement. No; if we had been told, it would have done no good,--we\nshould have made the bargain all the more eagerly, the fools that we are.\n\"And there has been no attempt to investigate it,\" I said, \"to see what\nit really is?\"\n\n\"Eh, Cornel,\" said the coachman's wife, \"wha would investigate, as ye\ncall it, a thing that nobody believes in? Ye would be the laughin'-stock\nof a' the country-side, as my man says.\"\n\n\"But you believe in it,\" I said, turning upon her hastily. The woman was\ntaken by surprise. She made a step backward out of my way.\n\n\"Lord, Cornel, how ye frichten a body! Me!--there's awfu' strange things\nin this world. An unlearned person doesna ken what to think. But the\nminister and the gentry they just laugh in your face. Inquire into the\nthing that is not! Na, na, we just let it be.\"\n\n\"Come with me, Jarvis,\" I said hastily, \"and we'll make an attempt at\nleast. Say nothing to the men or to anybody. I'll come back after dinner,\nand we'll make a serious attempt to see what it is, if it is anything. If\nI hear it,--which I doubt,--you may be sure I shall never rest till I\nmake it out. Be ready for me about ten o'clock.\"\n\n\"Me, Cornel!\" Jarvis said, in a faint voice. I had not been looking at\nhim in my own preoccupation, but when I did so, I found that the greatest\nchange had come over the fat and ruddy coachman. \"Me, Cornel!\" he\nrepeated, wiping the perspiration from his brow. His ruddy face hung in\nflabby folds, his knees knocked together, his voice seemed half\nextinguished in his throat. Then he began to rub his hands and smile upon\nme in a deprecating, imbecile way. \"There's nothing I wouldna do to\npleasure ye, Cornel,\" taking a step further back. \"I'm sure _she_ kens\nI've aye said I never had to do with a mair fair, weel-spoken\ngentleman--\" Here Jarvis came to a pause, again looking at me, rubbing\nhis hands.\n\n\"Well?\" I said.\n\n\"But eh, sir!\" he went on, with the same imbecile yet insinuating smile,\n\"if ye'll reflect that I am no used to my feet. With a horse atween my\nlegs, or the reins in my hand, I'm maybe nae worse than other men; but on\nfit, Cornel--It's no the--bogles--but I've been cavalry, ye see,\" with a\nlittle hoarse laugh, \"a' my life. To face a thing ye dinna understan'--on\nyour feet, Cornel.\"\n\n\"Well, sir, if _I_ do it,\" said I tartly, \"why shouldn't you?\"\n\n\"Eh, Cornel, there's an awfu' difference. In the first place, ye tramp\nabout the haill countryside, and think naething of it; but a walk tires\nme mair than a hunard miles' drive; and then ye're a gentleman, and do\nyour ain pleasure; and you're no so auld as me; and it's for your ain\nbairn, ye see, Cornel; and then--\"\n\n\"He believes in it, Cornel, and you dinna believe in it,\" the woman said.\n\n\"Will you come with me?\" I said, turning to her.\n\nShe jumped back, upsetting her chair in her bewilderment. \"Me!\" with a\nscream, and then fell into a sort of hysterical laugh. \"I wouldna say but\nwhat I would go; but what would the folk say to hear of Cornel Mortimer\nwith an auld silly woman at his heels?\"\n\nThe suggestion made me laugh too, though I had little inclination for it.\n\"I'm sorry you have so little spirit, Jarvis,\" I said. \"I must find some\none else, I suppose.\"\n\nJarvis, touched by this, began to remonstrate, but I cut him short. My\nbutler was a soldier who had been with me in India, and was not supposed\nto fear anything,--man or devil,--certainly not the former; and I felt\nthat I was losing time. The Jarvises were too thankful to get rid of me.\nThey attended me to the door with the most anxious courtesies. Outside,\nthe two grooms stood close by, a little confused by my sudden exit. I\ndon't know if perhaps they had been listening,--at least standing as near\nas possible, to catch any scrap of the conversation. I waved my hand to\nthem as I went past, in answer to their salutations, and it was very\napparent to me that they also were glad to see me go.\n\nAnd it will be thought very strange, but it would be weak not to add,\nthat I myself, though bent on the investigation I have spoken of, pledged\nto Roland to carry it out, and feeling that my boy's health, perhaps his\nlife, depended on the result of my inquiry,--I felt the most\nunaccountable reluctance to pass these ruins on my way home. My curiosity\nwas intense; and yet it was all my mind could do to pull my body along. I\ndaresay the scientific people would describe it the other way, and\nattribute my cowardice to the state of my stomach. I went on; but if I\nhad followed my impulse, I should have turned and bolted. Everything in\nme seemed to cry out against it: my heart thumped, my pulses all began,\nlike sledge-hammers, beating against my ears and every sensitive part. It\nwas very dark, as I have said; the old house, with its shapeless tower,\nloomed a heavy mass through the darkness, which was only not entirely so\nsolid as itself. On the other hand, the great dark cedars of which we\nwere so proud seemed to fill up the night. My foot strayed out of the\npath in my confusion and the gloom together, and I brought myself up with\na cry as I felt myself knock against something solid. What was it? The\ncontact with hard stone and lime and prickly bramble-bushes restored me a\nlittle to myself. \"Oh, it's only the old gable,\" I said aloud, with a\nlittle laugh to reassure myself. The rough feeling of the stones\nreconciled me. As I groped about thus, I shook off my visionary folly.\nWhat so easily explained as that I should have strayed from the path in\nthe darkness? This brought me back to common existence, as if I had been\nshaken by a wise hand out of all the silliness of superstition. How silly\nit was, after all! What did it matter which path I took? I laughed again,\nthis time with better heart, when suddenly, in a moment, the blood was\nchilled in my veins, a shiver stole along my spine, my faculties seemed\nto forsake me. Close by me, at my side, at my feet, there was a sigh. No,\nnot a groan, not a moaning, not anything so tangible,--a perfectly soft,\nfaint, inarticulate sigh. I sprang back, and my heart stopped beating.\nMistaken! no, mistake was impossible. I heard it as clearly as I hear\nmyself speak; a long, soft, weary sigh, as if drawn to the utmost, and\nemptying out a load of sadness that filled the breast. To hear this in\nthe solitude, in the dark, in the night (though it was still early), had\nan effect which I cannot describe. I feel it now,--something cold\ncreeping over me, up into my hair, and down to my feet, which refused to\nmove. I cried out, with a trembling voice, \"Who is there?\" as I had done\nbefore; but there was no reply.\n\nI got home I don't quite know how; but in my mind there was no longer\nany indifference as to the thing, whatever it was, that haunted these\nruins. My scepticism disappeared like a mist. I was as firmly determined\nthat there was something as Roland was. I did not for a moment pretend\nto myself that it was possible I could be deceived; there were movements\nand noises which I understood all about,--cracklings of small branches\nin the frost, and little rolls of gravel on the path, such as have a\nvery eerie sound sometimes, and perplex you with wonder as to who has\ndone it, _when there is no real mystery_; but I assure you all these\nlittle movements of nature don't affect you one bit _when there is\nsomething_. I understood _them_. I did not understand the sigh. That was\nnot simple nature; there was meaning in it, feeling, the soul of a\ncreature invisible. This is the thing that human nature trembles at,--a\ncreature invisible, yet with sensations, feelings, a power somehow of\nexpressing itself. I had not the same sense of unwillingness to turn my\nback upon the scene of the mystery which I had experienced in going to\nthe stables; but I almost ran home, impelled by eagerness to get\neverything done that had to be done, in order to apply myself to finding\nit out. Bagley was in the hall as usual when I went in. He was always\nthere in the afternoon, always with the appearance of perfect\noccupation, yet, so far as I know, never doing anything. The door was\nopen, so that I hurried in without any pause, breathless; but the sight\nof his calm regard, as he came to help me off with my overcoat, subdued\nme in a moment. Anything out of the way, anything incomprehensible,\nfaded to nothing in the presence of Bagley. You saw and wondered how\n_he_ was made: the parting of his hair, the tie of his white neckcloth,\nthe fit of his trousers, all perfect as works of art; but you could see\nhow they were done, which makes all the difference. I flung myself upon\nhim, so to speak, without waiting to note the extreme unlikeness of the\nman to anything of the kind I meant. \"Bagley,\" I said, \"I want you to\ncome out with me to-night to watch for--\"\n\n\"Poachers, Colonel?\" he said, a gleam of pleasure running all over him.\n\n\"No, Bagley; a great deal worse,\" I cried.\n\n\"Yes, Colonel; at what hour, sir?\" the man said; but then I had not told\nhim what it was.\n\nIt was ten o'clock when we set out. All was perfectly quiet indoors. My\nwife was with Roland, who had been quite calm, she said, and who (though,\nno doubt, the fever must run its course) had been better ever since I\ncame. I told Bagley to put on a thick greatcoat over his evening coat,\nand did the same myself, with strong boots; for the soil was like a\nsponge, or worse. Talking to him, I almost forgot what we were going to\ndo. It was darker even than it had been before, and Bagley kept very\nclose to me as we went along. I had a small lantern in my hand, which\ngave us a partial guidance. We had come to the corner where the path\nturns. On one side was the bowling-green, which the girls had taken\npossession of for their croquet-ground,--a wonderful enclosure surrounded\nby high hedges of holly, three hundred years old and more; on the other,\nthe ruins. Both were black as night; but before we got so far, there was\na little opening in which we could just discern the trees and the lighter\nline of the road. I thought it best to pause there and take breath.\n\"Bagley,\" I said, \"there is something about these ruins I don't\nunderstand. It is there I am going. Keep your eyes open and your wits\nabout you. Be ready to pounce upon any stranger you see,--anything, man\nor woman. Don't hurt, but seize anything you see.\" \"Colonel,\" said\nBagley, with a little tremor in his breath, \"they do say there's things\nthere--as is neither man nor woman.\" There was no time for words. \"Are\nyou game to follow me, my man? that's the question,\" I said. Bagley fell\nin without a word, and saluted. I knew then I had nothing to fear.\n\nWe went, so far as I could guess, exactly as I had come; when I heard\nthat sigh. The darkness, however, was so complete that all marks, as of\ntrees or paths, disappeared. One moment we felt our feet on the gravel,\nanother sinking noiselessly into the slippery grass, that was all. I had\nshut up my lantern, not wishing to scare any one, whoever it might be.\nBagley followed, it seemed to me, exactly in my footsteps as I made my\nway, as I supposed, towards the mass of the ruined house. We seemed to\ntake a long time groping along seeking this; the squash of the wet soil\nunder our feet was the only thing that marked our progress. After a while\nI stood still to see, or rather feel, where we were. The darkness was\nvery still, but no stiller than is usual in a winter's night. The sounds\nI have mentioned--the crackling of twigs, the roll of a pebble, the sound\nof some rustle in the dead leaves, or creeping creature on the\ngrass--were audible when you listened, all mysterious enough when your\nmind is disengaged, but to me cheering now as signs of the livingness of\nnature, even in the death of the frost. As we stood still there came up\nfrom the trees in the glen the prolonged hoot of an owl. Bagley started\nwith alarm, being in a state of general nervousness, and not knowing what\nhe was afraid of. But to me the sound was encouraging and pleasant, being\nso comprehensible.\n\n\"An owl,\" I said, under my breath. \"Y--es, Colonel,\" said Bagley, his\nteeth chattering. We stood still about five minutes, while it broke into\nthe still brooding of the air, the sound widening out in circles, dying\nupon the darkness. This sound, which is not a cheerful one, made me\nalmost gay. It was natural, and relieved the tension of the mind. I moved\non with new courage, my nervous excitement calming down.\n\nWhen all at once, quite suddenly, close to us, at our feet, there broke\nout a cry. I made a spring backwards in the first moment of surprise and\nhorror, and in doing so came sharply against the same rough masonry and\nbrambles that had struck me before. This new sound came upwards from the\nground,--a low, moaning, wailing voice, full of suffering and pain. The\ncontrast between it and the hoot of the owl was indescribable,--the one\nwith a wholesome wildness and naturalness that hurt nobody; the other, a\nsound that made one's blood curdle, full of human misery. With a great\ndeal of fumbling,--for in spite of everything I could do to keep up my\ncourage my hands shook,--I managed to remove the slide of my lantern. The\nlight leaped out like something living, and made the place visible in a\nmoment. We were what would have been inside the ruined building had\nanything remained but the gable-wall which I have described. It was close\nto us, the vacant door-way in it going out straight into the blackness\noutside. The light showed the bit of wall, the ivy glistening upon it in\nclouds of dark green, the bramble-branches waving, and below, the open\ndoor,--a door that led to nothing. It was from this the voice came which\ndied out just as the light flashed upon this strange scene. There was a\nmoment's silence, and then it broke forth again. The sound was so near,\nso penetrating, so pitiful, that, in the nervous start I gave, the light\nfell out of my hand. As I groped for it in the dark my hand was clutched\nby Bagley, who, I think, must have dropped upon his knees; but I was too\nmuch perturbed myself to think much of this. He clutched at me in the\nconfusion of his terror, forgetting all his usual decorum. \"For God's\nsake, what is it, sir?\" he gasped. If I yielded, there was evidently an\nend of both of us. \"I can't tell,\" I said, \"any more than you; that's\nwhat we've got to find out. Up, man, up!\" I pulled him to his feet. \"Will\nyou go round and examine the other side, or will you stay here with the\nlantern?\" Bagley gasped at me with a face of horror. \"Can't we stay\ntogether, Colonel?\" he said; his knees were trembling under him. I pushed\nhim against the corner of the wall, and put the light into his hands.\n\"Stand fast till I come back; shake yourself together, man; let nothing\npass you,\" I said. The voice was within two or three feet of us; of that\nthere could be no doubt.\n\nI went myself to the other side of the wall, keeping close to it. The\nlight shook in Bagley's hand, but, tremulous though it was, shone out\nthrough the vacant door, one oblong block of light marking all the\ncrumbling corners and hanging masses of foliage. Was that something dark\nhuddled in a heap by the side of it? I pushed forward across the light in\nthe door-way, and fell upon it with my hands; but it was only a\njuniper-bush growing close against the wall. Meanwhile, the sight of my\nfigure crossing the door-way had brought Bagley's nervous excitement to a\nheight: he flew at me, gripping my shoulder. \"I've got him, Colonel!\nI've got him!\" he cried, with a voice of sudden exultation. He thought it\nwas a man, and was at once relieved. But at that moment the voice burst\nforth again between us, at our feet,--more close to us than any separate\nbeing could be. He dropped off from me, and fell against the wall, his\njaw dropping as if he were dying. I suppose, at the same moment, he saw\nthat it was me whom he had clutched. I, for my part, had scarcely more\ncommand of myself. I snatched the light out of his hand, and flashed it\nall about me wildly. Nothing,--the juniper-bush which I thought I had\nnever seen before, the heavy growth of the glistening ivy, the brambles\nwaving. It was close to my ears now, crying, crying, pleading as if for\nlife. Either I heard the same words Roland had heard, or else, in my\nexcitement, his imagination got possession of mine. The voice went on,\ngrowing into distinct articulation, but wavering about, now from one\npoint, now from another, as if the owner of it were moving slowly back\nand forward. \"Mother! mother!\" and then an outburst of wailing. As my\nmind steadied, getting accustomed (as one's mind gets accustomed to\nanything), it seemed to me as if some uneasy, miserable creature was\npacing up and down before a closed door. Sometimes--but that must have\nbeen excitement--I thought I heard a sound like knocking, and then\nanother burst, \"Oh, mother! mother!\" All this close, close to the space\nwhere I was standing with my lantern, now before me, now behind me: a\ncreature restless, unhappy, moaning, crying, before the vacant door-way,\nwhich no one could either shut or open more.\n\n\"Do you hear it, Bagley? do you hear what it is saying?\" I cried,\nstepping in through the door-way. He was lying against the wall, his eyes\nglazed, half dead with terror. He made a motion of his lips as if to\nanswer me, but no sounds came; then lifted his hand with a curious\nimperative movement as if ordering me to be silent and listen. And how\nlong I did so I cannot tell. It began to have an interest, an exciting\nhold upon me, which I could not describe. It seemed to call up visibly a\nscene any one could understand,--a something shut out, restlessly\nwandering to and fro; sometimes the voice dropped, as if throwing itself\ndown, sometimes wandered off a few paces, growing sharp and clear. \"Oh,\nmother, let me in! oh, mother, mother, let me in! oh, let me in!\" Every\nword was clear to me. No wonder the boy had gone wild with pity. I tried\nto steady my mind upon Roland, upon his conviction that I could do\nsomething, but my head swam with the excitement, even when I partially\novercame the terror. At last the words died away, and there was a sound\nof sobs and moaning. I cried out, \"In the name of God, who are you?\" with\na kind of feeling in my mind that to use the name of God was profane,\nseeing that I did not believe in ghosts or anything supernatural; but I\ndid it all the same, and waited, my heart giving a leap of terror lest\nthere should be a reply. Why this should have been I cannot tell, but I\nhad a feeling that if there was an answer it would be more than I could\nbear. But there was no answer; the moaning went on, and then, as if it\nhad been real, the voice rose a little higher again, the words\nrecommenced, \"Oh, mother, let me in! oh, mother, let me in!\" with an\nexpression that was heart-breaking to hear.\n\n_As if it had been real_! What do I mean by that? I suppose I got less\nalarmed as the thing went on. I began to recover the use of my senses,--I\nseemed to explain it all to myself by saying that this had once happened,\nthat it was a recollection of a real scene. Why there should have seemed\nsomething quite satisfactory and composing in this explanation I cannot\ntell, but so it was. I began to listen almost as if it had been a play,\nforgetting Bagley, who, I almost think, had fainted, leaning against the\nwall. I was startled out of this strange spectatorship that had fallen\nupon me by the sudden rush of something which made my heart jump once\nmore, a large black figure in the door-way waving its arms. \"Come in!\ncome in! come in!\" it shouted out hoarsely at the top of a deep bass\nvoice, and then poor Bagley fell down senseless across the threshold. He\nwas less sophisticated than I,--he had not been able to bear it any\nlonger. I took him for something supernatural, as he took me, and it was\nsome time before I awoke to the necessities of the moment. I remembered\nonly after, that from the time I began to give my attention to the man, I\nheard the other voice no more. It was some time before I brought him to.\nIt must have been a strange scene: the lantern making a luminous spot in\nthe darkness, the man's white face lying on the black earth, I over him,\ndoing what I could for him, probably I should have been thought to be\nmurdering him had any one seen us. When at last I succeeded in pouring a\nlittle brandy down his throat, he sat up and looked about him wildly.\n\"What's up?\" he said; then recognizing me, tried to struggle to his feet\nwith a faint \"Beg your pardon, Colonel.\" I got him home as best I could,\nmaking him lean upon my arm. The great fellow was as weak as a child.\nFortunately he did not for some time remember what had happened. From the\ntime Bagley fell the voice had stopped, and all was still.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"You've got an epidemic in your house, Colonel,\" Simson said to me next\nmorning. \"What's the meaning of it all? Here's your butler raving about a\nvoice. This will never do, you know; and so far as I can make out, you\nare in it too.\"\n\n\"Yes, I am in it, Doctor. I thought I had better speak to you. Of course\nyou are treating Roland all right, but the boy is not raving, he is as\nsane as you or me. It's all true.\"\n\n\"As sane as--I--or you. I never thought the boy insane. He's got cerebral\nexcitement, fever. I don't know what you've got. There's something very\nqueer about the look of your eyes.\"\n\n\"Come,\" said I, \"you can't put us all to bed, you know. You had better\nlisten and hear the symptoms in full.\"\n\nThe Doctor shrugged his shoulders, but he listened to me patiently. He\ndid not believe a word of the story, that was clear; but he heard it all\nfrom beginning to end. \"My dear fellow,\" he said, \"the boy told me just\nthe same. It's an epidemic. When one person falls a victim to this sort\nof thing, it's as safe as can be,--there's always two or three.\"\n\n\"Then how do you account for it?\" I said.\n\n\"Oh, account for it!--that's a different matter; there's no accounting\nfor the freaks our brains are subject to. If it's delusion, if it's some\ntrick of the echoes or the winds,--some phonetic disturbance or other--\"\n\n\"Come with me to-night, and judge for yourself,\" I said.\n\nUpon this he laughed aloud, then said, \"That's not such a bad idea; but\nit would ruin me forever if it were known that John Simson was\nghost-hunting.\"\n\n\"There it is,\" said I; \"you dart down on us who are unlearned with your\nphonetic disturbances, but you daren't examine what the thing really is\nfor fear of being laughed at. That's science!\"\n\n\"It's not science,--it's common-sense,\" said the Doctor. \"The thing has\ndelusion on the front of it. It is encouraging an unwholesome tendency\neven to examine. What good could come of it? Even if I am convinced, I\nshouldn't believe.\"\n\n\"I should have said so yesterday; and I don't want you to be convinced or\nto believe,\" said I. \"If you prove it to be a delusion, I shall be very\nmuch obliged to you for one. Come; somebody must go with me.\"\n\n\"You are cool,\" said the Doctor. \"You've disabled this poor fellow of\nyours, and made him--on that point--a lunatic for life; and now you want\nto disable me. But, for once, I'll do it. To save appearance, if you'll\ngive me a bed, I'll come over after my last rounds.\"\n\nIt was agreed that I should meet him at the gate, and that we should\nvisit the scene of last night's occurrences before we came to the house,\nso that nobody might be the wiser. It was scarcely possible to hope that\nthe cause of Bagley's sudden illness should not somehow steal into the\nknowledge of the servants at least, and it was better that all should be\ndone as quietly as possible. The day seemed to me a very long one. I had\nto spend a certain part of it with Roland, which was a terrible ordeal\nfor me, for what could I say to the boy? The improvement continued, but\nhe was still in a very precarious state, and the trembling vehemence with\nwhich he turned to me when his mother left the room filled me with alarm.\n\"Father?\" he said quietly. \"Yes, my boy, I am giving my best attention to\nit; all is being done that I can do. I have not come to any\nconclusion--yet. I am neglecting nothing you said,\" I cried. What I could\nnot do was to give his active mind any encouragement to dwell upon the\nmystery. It was a hard predicament, for some satisfaction had to be given\nhim. He looked at me very wistfully, with the great blue eyes which shone\nso large and brilliant out of his white and worn face. \"You must trust\nme,\" I said. \"Yes, father. Father understands,\" he said to himself, as if\nto soothe some inward doubt. I left him as soon as I could. He was about\nthe most precious thing I had on earth, and his health my first thought;\nbut yet somehow, in the excitement of this other subject, I put that\naside, and preferred not to dwell upon Roland, which was the most curious\npart of it all.\n\nThat night at eleven I met Simson at the gate. He had come by train, and\nI let him in gently myself. I had been so much absorbed in the coming\nexperiment that I passed the ruins in going to meet him, almost without\nthought, if you can understand that. I had my lantern; and he showed me a\ncoil of taper which he had ready for use. \"There is nothing like light,\"\nhe said, in his scoffing tone. It was a very still night, scarcely a\nsound, but not so dark. We could keep the path without difficulty as we\nwent along. As we approached the spot we could hear a low moaning, broken\noccasionally by a bitter cry. \"Perhaps that is your voice,\" said the\nDoctor; \"I thought it must be something of the kind. That's a poor brute\ncaught in some of these infernal traps of yours; you'll find it among the\nbushes somewhere.\" I said nothing. I felt no particular fear, but a\ntriumphant satisfaction in what was to follow. I led him to the spot\nwhere Bagley and I had stood on the previous night. All was silent as a\nwinter night could be,--so silent that we heard far off the sound of the\nhorses in the stables, the shutting of a window at the house. Simson\nlighted his taper and went peering about, poking into all the corners. We\nlooked like two conspirators lying in wait for some unfortunate\ntraveller; but not a sound broke the quiet. The moaning had stopped\nbefore we came up; a star or two shone over us in the sky, looking down\nas if surprised at our strange proceedings. Dr. Simson did nothing but\nutter subdued laughs under his breath. \"I thought as much,\" he said. \"It\nis just the same with tables and all other kinds of ghostly apparatus; a\nsceptic's presence stops everything. When I am present nothing ever comes\noff. How long do you think it will be necessary to stay here? Oh, I don't\ncomplain; only when _you_ are satisfied, _I_ am--quite.\"\n\nI will not deny that I was disappointed beyond measure by this result. It\nmade me look like a credulous fool. It gave the Doctor such a pull over\nme as nothing else could. I should point all his morals for years to\ncome; and his materialism, his scepticism, would be increased beyond\nendurance. \"It seems, indeed,\" I said, \"that there is to be no--\"\n\"Manifestation,\" he said, laughing; \"that is what all the mediums say. No\nmanifestations, in consequence of the presence of an unbeliever.\" His\nlaugh sounded very uncomfortable to me in the silence; and it was now\nnear midnight. But that laugh seemed the signal; before it died away the\nmoaning we had heard before was resumed. It started from some distance\noff, and came towards us, nearer and nearer, like some one walking along\nand moaning to himself. There could be no idea now that it was a hare\ncaught in a trap. The approach was slow, like that of a weak person, with\nlittle halts and pauses. We heard it coming along the grass straight\ntowards the vacant door-way. Simson had been a little startled by the\nfirst sound. He said hastily, \"That child has no business to be out so\nlate.\" But he felt, as well as I, that this was no child's voice. As it\ncame nearer, he grew silent, and, going to the door-way with his taper,\nstood looking out towards the sound. The taper being unprotected blew\nabout in the night air, though there was scarcely any wind. I threw the\nlight of my lantern steady and white across the same space. It was in a\nblaze of light in the midst of the blackness. A little icy thrill had\ngone over me at the first sound, but as it came close, I confess that my\nonly feeling was satisfaction. The scoffer could scoff no more. The light\ntouched his own face, and showed a very perplexed countenance. If he was\nafraid, he concealed it with great success, but he was perplexed. And\nthen all that had happened on the previous night was enacted once more.\nIt fell strangely upon me with a sense of repetition. Every cry, every\nsob seemed the same as before. I listened almost without any emotion at\nall in my own person, thinking of its effect upon Simson. He maintained a\nvery bold front, on the whole. All that coming and going of the voice\nwas, if our ears could be trusted, exactly in front of the vacant, blank\ndoor-way, blazing full of light, which caught and shone in the glistening\nleaves of the great hollies at a little distance. Not a rabbit could have\ncrossed the turf without being seen; but there was nothing. After a time,\nSimson, with a certain caution and bodily reluctance, as it seemed to me,\nwent out with his roll of taper into this space. His figure showed\nagainst the holly in full outline. Just at this moment the voice sank, as\nwas its custom, and seemed to fling itself down at the door. Simson\nrecoiled violently, as if some one had come up against him, then turned,\nand held his taper low, as if examining something. \"Do you see anybody?\"\nI cried in a whisper, feeling the chill of nervous panic steal over me at\nthis action. \"It's nothing but a--confounded juniper-bush,\" he said. This\nI knew very well to be nonsense, for the juniper-bush was on the other\nside. He went about after this round and round, poking his taper\neverywhere, then returned to me on the inner side of the wall. He scoffed\nno longer; his face was contracted and pale. \"How long does this go on?\"\nhe whispered to me, like a man who does not wish to interrupt some one\nwho is speaking. I had become too much perturbed myself to remark whether\nthe successions and changes of the voice were the same as last night. It\nsuddenly went out in the air almost as he was speaking, with a soft\nreiterated sob dying away. If there had been anything to be seen, I\nshould have said that the person was at that moment crouching on the\nground close to the door.\n\nWe walked home very silent afterwards. It was only when we were in sight\nof the house that I said, \"What do you think of it?\" \"I can't tell what\nto think of it,\" he said quickly. He took--though he was a very temperate\nman--not the claret I was going to offer him, but some brandy from the\ntray, and swallowed it almost undiluted. \"Mind you, I don't believe a\nword of it,\" he said, when he had lighted his candle; \"but I can't tell\nwhat to think,\" he turned round to add, when he was half-way upstairs.\n\nAll of this, however, did me no good with the solution of my problem. I\nwas to help this weeping, sobbing thing, which was already to me as\ndistinct a personality as anything I knew; or what should I say to\nRoland? It was on my heart that my boy would die if I could not find some\nway of helping this creature. You may be surprised that I should speak of\nit in this way. I did not know if it was man or woman; but I no more\ndoubted that it was a soul in pain than I doubted my own being; and it\nwas my business to soothe this pain,--to deliver it, if that was\npossible. Was ever such a task given to an anxious father trembling for\nhis only boy? I felt in my heart, fantastic as it may appear, that I must\nfulfill this somehow, or part with my child; and you may conceive that\nrather than do that I was ready to die. But even my dying would not have\nadvanced me, unless by bringing me into the same world with that seeker\nat the door.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNext morning Simson was out before breakfast, and came in with evident\nsigns of the damp grass on his boots, and a look of worry and weariness,\nwhich did not say much for the night he had passed. He improved a little\nafter breakfast, and visited his two patients,--for Bagley was still an\ninvalid. I went out with him on his way to the train, to hear what he\nhad to say about the boy. \"He is going on very well,\" he said; \"there are\nno complications as yet. But mind you, that's not a boy to be trifled\nwith, Mortimer. Not a word to him about last night.\" I had to tell him\nthen of my last interview with Roland, and of the impossible demand he\nhad made upon me, by which, though he tried to laugh, he was much\ndiscomposed, as I could see. \"We must just perjure ourselves all round,\"\nhe said, \"and swear you exorcised it;\" but the man was too kind-hearted\nto be satisfied with that. \"It's frightfully serious for you, Mortimer. I\ncan't laugh as I should like to. I wish I saw a way out of it, for your\nsake. By the way,\" he added shortly, \"didn't you notice that juniper-bush\non the left-hand side?\" \"There was one on the right hand of the door. I\nnoticed you made that mistake last night.\" \"Mistake!\" he cried, with a\ncurious low laugh, pulling up the collar of his coat as though he felt\nthe cold,--\"there's no juniper there this morning, left or right. Just go\nand see.\" As he stepped into the train a few minutes after, he looked\nback upon me and beckoned me for a parting word. \"I'm coming back\nto-night,\" he said.\n\nI don't think I had any feeling about this as I turned away from that\ncommon bustle of the railway which made my private preoccupations feel so\nstrangely out of date. There had been a distinct satisfaction in my mind\nbefore, that his scepticism had been so entirely defeated. But the more\nserious part of the matter pressed upon me now. I went straight from the\nrailway to the manse, which stood on a little plateau on the side of the\nriver opposite to the woods of Brentwood. The minister was one of a class\nwhich is not so common in Scotland as it used to be. He was a man of good\nfamily, well educated in the Scotch way, strong in philosophy, not so\nstrong in Greek, strongest of all in experience,--a man who had \"come\nacross,\" in the course of his life, most people of note that had ever\nbeen in Scotland, and who was said to be very sound in doctrine, without\ninfringing the toleration with which old men, who are good men, are\ngenerally endowed. He was old-fashioned; perhaps he did not think so much\nabout the troublous problems of theology as many of the young men, nor\nask himself any hard questions about the Confession of Faith; but he\nunderstood human nature, which is perhaps better. He received me with a\ncordial welcome.\n\n\"Come away, Colonel Mortimer,\" he said; \"I'm all the more glad to see\nyou, that I feel it's a good sign for the boy. He's doing well?--God be\npraised,--and the Lord bless him and keep him. He has many a poor body's\nprayers, and that can do nobody harm.\"\n\n\"He will need them all, Dr. Moncrieff,\" I said, \"and your counsel too.\"\nAnd I told him the story,--more than I had told Simson. The old clergyman\nlistened to me with many suppressed exclamations, and at the end the\nwater stood in his eyes.\n\n\"That's just beautiful,\" he said. \"I do not mind to have heard anything\nlike it; it's as fine as Burns when he wished deliverance to one--that is\nprayed for in no kirk. Ay, ay! so he would have you console the poor lost\nspirit? God bless the boy! There's something more than common in that,\nColonel Mortimer. And also the faith of him in his father!--I would like\nto put that into a sermon.\" Then the old gentleman gave me an alarmed\nlook, and said, \"No, no; I was not meaning a sermon; but I must write it\ndown for the 'Children's Record.'\" I saw the thought that passed through\nhis mind. Either he thought, or he feared I would think, of a funeral\nsermon. You may believe this did not make me more cheerful.\n\nI can scarcely say that Dr. Moncrieff gave me any advice. How could any\none advise on such a subject? But he said, \"I think I'll come too. I'm an\nold man; I'm less liable to be frightened than those that are further off\nthe world unseen. It behooves me to think of my own journey there. I've\nno cut-and-dry beliefs on the subject. I'll come too; and maybe at the\nmoment the Lord will put into our heads what to do.\"\n\nThis gave me a little comfort,--more than Simson had given me. To be\nclear about the cause of it was not my grand desire. It was another thing\nthat was in my mind,--my boy. As for the poor soul at the open door, I\nhad no more doubt, as I have said, of its existence than I had of my own.\nIt was no ghost to me. I knew the creature, and it was in trouble. That\nwas my feeling about it, as it was Roland's. To hear it first was a great\nshock to my nerves, but not now; a man will get accustomed to anything.\nBut to do something for it was the great problem; how was I to be\nserviceable to a being that was invisible, that was mortal no longer?\n\"Maybe at the moment the Lord will put it into our heads.\" This is very\nold-fashioned phraseology, and a week before, most likely, I should have\nsmiled (though always with kindness) at Dr. Moncrieff's credulity; but\nthere was a great comfort, whether rational or otherwise I cannot say, in\nthe mere sound of the words.\n\nThe road to the station and the village lay through the glen, not by the\nruins; but though the sunshine and the fresh air, and the beauty of the\ntrees, and the sound of the water were all very soothing to the spirits,\nmy mind was so full of my own subject that I could not refrain from\nturning to the right hand as I got to the top of the glen, and going\nstraight to the place which I may call the scene of all my thoughts. It\nwas lying full in the sunshine, like all the rest of the world. The\nruined gable looked due east, and in the present aspect of the sun the\nlight streamed down through the door-way as our lantern had done,\nthrowing a flood of light upon the damp grass beyond. There was a strange\nsuggestion in the open door,--so futile, a kind of emblem of vanity: all\nfree around, so that you could go where you pleased, and yet that\nsemblance of an enclosure,--that way of entrance, unnecessary, leading to\nnothing. And why any creature should pray and weep to get in--to nothing,\nor be kept out--by nothing, you could not dwell upon it, or it made your\nbrain go round. I remembered, however, what Simson said about the\njuniper, with a little smile on my own mind as to the inaccuracy of\nrecollection which even a scientific man will be guilty of. I could see\nnow the light of my lantern gleaming upon the wet glistening surface of\nthe spiky leaves at the right hand,--and he ready to go to the stake for\nit that it was the left! I went round to make sure. And then I saw what\nhe had said. Right or left there was no juniper at all! I was confounded\nby this, though it was entirely a matter of detail nothing at all,--a\nbush of brambles waving, the grass growing up to the very walls. But\nafter all, though it gave me a shock for a moment, what did that matter?\nThere were marks as if a number of footsteps had been up and down in\nfront of the door, but these might have been our steps; and all was\nbright and peaceful and still. I poked about the other ruin--the larger\nruins of the old house--for some time, as I had done before. There were\nmarks upon the grass here and there--I could not call them\nfootsteps--all about; but that told for nothing one way or another. I had\nexamined the ruined rooms closely the first day. They were half filled up\nwith soil and _debris_, withered brackens and bramble,--no refuge for any\none there. It vexed me that Jarvis should see me coming from that spot\nwhen he came up to me for his orders. I don't know whether my nocturnal\nexpeditions had got wind among the servants, but there was a significant\nlook in his face. Something in it I felt was like my own sensation when\nSimson in the midst of his scepticism was struck dumb. Jarvis felt\nsatisfied that his veracity had been put beyond question. I never spoke\nto a servant of mine in such a peremptory tone before. I sent him away\n\"with a flea in his lug,\" as the man described it afterwards.\nInterference of any kind was intolerable to me at such a moment.\n\nBut what was strangest of all was, that I could not face Roland. I did\nnot go up to his room, as I would have naturally done, at once. This the\ngirls could not understand. They saw there was some mystery in it.\n\"Mother has gone to lie down,\" Agatha said; \"he has had such a good\nnight.\" \"But he wants you so, papa!\" cried little Jeanie, always with her\ntwo arms embracing mine in a pretty way she had. I was obliged to go at\nlast, but what could I say? I could only kiss him, and tell him to keep\nstill,--that I was doing all I could. There is something mystical about\nthe patience of a child. \"It will come all right, won't it, father?\" he\nsaid. \"God grant it may! I hope so, Roland.\" \"Oh, yes, it will come all\nright.\" Perhaps he understood that in the midst of my anxiety I could not\nstay with him as I should have done otherwise. But the girls were more\nsurprised than it is possible to describe. They looked at me with\nwondering eyes. \"If I were ill, papa, and you only stayed with me a\nmoment, I should break my heart,\" said Agatha. But the boy had a\nsympathetic feeling. He knew that of my own will I would not have done\nit. I shut myself up in the library, where I could not rest, but kept\npacing up and down like a caged beast. What could I do? and if I could do\nnothing, what would become of my boy? These were the questions that,\nwithout ceasing, pursued each other through my mind.\n\nSimson came out to dinner, and when the house was all still, and most of\nthe servants in bed, we went out and met Dr. Moncrieff, as we had\nappointed, at the head of the glen. Simson, for his part, was disposed to\nscoff at the Doctor. \"If there are to be any spells, you know, I'll cut\nthe whole concern,\" he said. I did not make him any reply. I had not\ninvited him; he could go or come as he pleased. He was very talkative,\nfar more so than suited my humor, as we went on. \"One thing is certain,\nyou know; there must be some human agency,\" he said. \"It is all bosh\nabout apparitions. I never have investigated the laws of sound to any\ngreat extent, and there's a great deal in ventriloquism that we don't\nknow much about.\" \"If it's the same to you,\" I said, \"I wish you'd keep\nall that to yourself, Simson. It doesn't suit my state of mind.\" \"Oh, I\nhope I know how to respect idiosyncrasy,\" he said. The very tone of his\nvoice irritated me beyond measure. These scientific fellows, I wonder\npeople put up with them as they do, when you have no mind for their\ncold-blooded confidence. Dr. Moncrieff met us about eleven o'clock, the\nsame time as on the previous night. He was a large man, with a venerable\ncountenance and white hair,--old, but in full vigor, and thinking less\nof a cold night walk than many a younger man. He had his lantern, as I\nhad. We were fully provided with means of lighting the place, and we were\nall of us resolute men. We had a rapid consultation as we went up, and\nthe result was that we divided to different posts. Dr. Moncrieff remained\ninside the wall--if you can call that inside where there was no wall but\none. Simson placed himself on the side next the ruins, so as to intercept\nany communication with the old house, which was what his mind was fixed\nupon. I was posted on the other side. To say that nothing could come near\nwithout being seen was self-evident. It had been so also on the previous\nnight. Now, with our three lights in the midst of the darkness, the whole\nplace seemed illuminated. Dr. Moncrieff's lantern, which was a large one,\nwithout any means of shutting up,--an old-fashioned lantern with a\npierced and ornamental top,--shone steadily, the rays shooting out of it\nupward into the gloom. He placed it on the grass, where the middle of the\nroom, if this had been a room, would have been. The usual effect of the\nlight streaming out of the door-way was prevented by the illumination\nwhich Simson and I on either side supplied. With these differences,\neverything seemed as on the previous night.\n\nAnd what occurred was exactly the same, with the same air of repetition,\npoint for point, as I had formerly remarked. I declare that it seemed to\nme as if I were pushed against, put aside, by the owner of the voice as\nhe paced up and down in his trouble,--though these are perfectly futile\nwords, seeing that the stream of light from my lantern, and that from\nSimson's taper, lay broad and clear, without a shadow, without the\nsmallest break, across the entire breadth of the grass. I had ceased even\nto be alarmed, for my part. My heart was rent with pity and\ntrouble,--pity for the poor suffering human creature that moaned and\npleaded so, and trouble for myself and my boy. God! if I could not find\nany help,--and what help could I find?--Roland would die.\n\nWe were all perfectly still till the first outburst was exhausted, as I\nknew, by experience, it would be. Dr. Moncrieff, to whom it was new, was\nquite motionless on the other side of the wall, as we were in our places.\nMy heart had remained almost at its usual beating during the voice. I was\nused to it; it did not rouse all my pulses as it did at first. But just\nas it threw itself sobbing at the door (I cannot use other words), there\nsuddenly came something which sent the blood coursing through my veins,\nand my heart into my mouth. It was a voice inside the wall,--the\nminister's well-known voice. I would have been prepared for it in any\nkind of adjuration, but I was not prepared for what I heard. It came out\nwith a sort of stammering, as if too much moved for utterance. \"Willie,\nWillie! Oh, God preserve us! is it you?\"\n\nThese simple words had an effect upon me that the voice of the\ninvisible creature had ceased to have. I thought the old man, whom I\nhad brought into this danger, had gone mad with terror. I made a dash\nround to the other side of the wall, half crazed myself with the\nthought. He was standing where I had left him, his shadow thrown vague\nand large upon the grass by the lantern which stood at his feet. I\nlifted my own light to see his face as I rushed forward. He was very\npale, his eyes wet and glistening, his mouth quivering with parted\nlips. He neither saw nor heard me. We that had gone through this\nexperience before, had crouched towards each other to get a little\nstrength to bear it. But he was not even aware that I was there. His\nwhole being seemed absorbed in anxiety and tenderness. He held out his\nhands, which trembled, but it seemed to me with eagerness, not fear. He\nwent on speaking all the time. \"Willie, if it is you,--and it's you, if\nit is not a delusion of Satan,--Willie, lad! why come ye here frighting\nthem that know you not? Why came ye not to me?\"\n\nHe seemed to wait for an answer. When his voice ceased, his countenance,\nevery line moving, continued to speak. Simson gave me another terrible\nshock, stealing into the open door-way with his light, as much\nawe-stricken, as wildly curious, as I. But the minister resumed, without\nseeing Simson, speaking to some one else. His voice took a tone of\nexpostulation:--\n\n\"Is this right to come here? Your mother's gone with your name on her\nlips. Do you think she would ever close her door on her own lad? Do ye\nthink the Lord will close the door, ye faint-hearted creature? No!--I\nforbid ye! I forbid ye!\" cried the old man. The sobbing voice had begun\nto resume its cries. He made a step forward, calling out the last words\nin a voice of command. \"I forbid ye! Cry out no more to man. Go home, ye\nwandering spirit! go home! Do you hear me?--me that christened ye, that\nhave struggled with ye, that have wrestled for ye with the Lord!\" Here\nthe loud tones of his voice sank into tenderness. \"And her too, poor\nwoman! poor woman! her you are calling upon. She's not here. You'll find\nher with the Lord. Go there and seek her, not here. Do you hear me, lad?\ngo after her there. He'll let you in, though it's late. Man, take heart!\nif you will lie and sob and greet, let it be at heaven's gate, and not\nyour poor mother's ruined door.\"\n\nHe stopped to get his breath; and the voice had stopped, not as it had\ndone before, when its time was exhausted and all its repetitions said,\nbut with a sobbing catch in the breath as if overruled. Then the\nminister spoke again, \"Are you hearing me, Will? Oh, laddie, you've liked\nthe beggarly elements all your days. Be done with them now. Go home to\nthe Father--the Father! Are you hearing me?\" Here the old man sank down\nupon his knees, his face raised upwards, his hands held up with a tremble\nin them, all white in the light in the midst of the darkness. I resisted\nas long as I could, though I cannot tell why; then I, too, dropped upon\nmy knees. Simson all the time stood in the door-way, with an expression\nin his face such as words could not tell, his under lip dropped, his eyes\nwild, staring. It seemed to be to him, that image of blank ignorance and\nwonder, that we were praying. All the time the voice, with a low arrested\nsobbing, lay just where he was standing, as I thought.\n\n\"Lord,\" the minister said,--\"Lord, take him into Thy everlasting\nhabitations. The mother he cries to is with Thee. Who can open to him but\nThee? Lord, when is it too late for Thee, or what is too hard for Thee?\nLord, let that woman there draw him inower! Let her draw him inower!\"\n\nI sprang forward to catch something in my arms that flung itself wildly\nwithin the door. The illusion was so strong, that I never paused till I\nfelt my forehead graze against the wall and my hands clutch the\nground,--for there was nobody there to save from falling, as in my\nfoolishness I thought. Simson held out his hand to me to help me up. He\nwas trembling and cold, his lower lip hanging, his speech almost\ninarticulate. \"It's gone,\" he said, stammering,--\"it's gone!\" We leaned\nupon each other for a moment, trembling so much, both of us, that the\nwhole scene trembled as if it were going to dissolve and disappear; and\nyet as long as I live I will never forget it,--the shining of the\nstrange lights, the blackness all round, the kneeling figure with all\nthe whiteness of the light concentrated on its white venerable head and\nuplifted hands. A strange solemn stillness seemed to close all round us.\nBy intervals a single syllable, \"Lord! Lord!\" came from the old\nminister's lips. He saw none of us, nor thought of us. I never knew how\nlong we stood, like sentinels guarding him at his prayers, holding our\nlights in a confused dazed way, not knowing what we did. But at last he\nrose from his knees, and standing up at his full height, raised his\narms, as the Scotch manner is at the end of a religious service, and\nsolemnly gave the apostolical benediction,--to what? to the silent\nearth, the dark woods, the wide breathing atmosphere; for we were but\nspectators gasping an Amen!\n\nIt seemed to me that it must be the middle of the night, as we all walked\nback. It was in reality very late. Dr. Moncrieff put his arm into mine.\nHe walked slowly, with an air of exhaustion. It was as if we were coming\nfrom a death-bed. Something hushed and solemnized the very air. There was\nthat sense of relief in it which there always is at the end of a\ndeath-struggle. And nature, persistent, never daunted, came back in all\nof us, as we returned into the ways of life. We said nothing to each\nother, indeed, for a time; but when we got clear of the trees and\nreached the opening near the house, where we could see the sky, Dr.\nMoncrieff himself was the first to speak. \"I must be going,\" he said;\n\"it's very late, I'm afraid. I will go down the glen, as I came.\"\n\n\"But not alone. I am going with you, Doctor.\"\n\n\"Well, I will not oppose it. I am an old man, and agitation wearies more\nthan work. Yes; I'll be thankful of your arm. To-night, Colonel, you've\ndone me more good turns than one.\"\n\nI pressed his hand on my arm, not feeling able to speak. But Simson,\nwho turned with us, and who had gone along all this time with his taper\nflaring, in entire unconsciousness, came to himself, apparently at the\nsound of our voices, and put out that wild little torch with a quick\nmovement, as if of shame. \"Let me carry your lantern,\" he said; \"it is\nheavy.\" He recovered with a spring; and in a moment, from the\nawe-stricken spectator he had been, became himself, sceptical and\ncynical. \"I should like to ask you a question,\" he said. \"Do you\nbelieve in Purgatory, Doctor? It's not in the tenets of the Church, so\nfar as I know.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said Dr. Moncrieff, \"an old man like me is sometimes not very\nsure what he believes. There is just one thing I am certain of--and that\nis the loving-kindness of God.\"\n\n\"But I thought that was in this life. I am no theologian--\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said the old man again, with a tremor in him which I could feel\ngoing over all his frame, \"if I saw a friend of mine within the gates of\nhell, I would not despair but his Father would take him by the hand\nstill, if he cried like _you_.\"\n\n\"I allow it is very strange, very strange. I cannot see through it. That\nthere must be human agency, I feel sure. Doctor, what made you decide\nupon the person and the name?\"\n\nThe minister put out his hand with the impatience which a man might show\nif he were asked how he recognized his brother. \"Tuts!\" he said, in\nfamiliar speech; then more solemnly, \"How should I not recognize a person\nthat I know better--far better--than I know you?\"\n\n\"Then you saw the man?\"\n\nDr. Moncrieff made no reply. He moved his hand again with a little\nimpatient movement, and walked on, leaning heavily on my arm. And we went\non for a long time without another word, threading the dark paths, which\nwere steep and slippery with the damp of the winter. The air was very\nstill,--not more than enough to make a faint sighing in the branches,\nwhich mingled with the sound of the water to which we were descending.\nWhen we spoke again, it was about indifferent matters,--about the height\nof the river, and the recent rains. We parted with the minister at his\nown door, where his old housekeeper appeared in great perturbation,\nwaiting for him. \"Eh, me, minister! the young gentleman will be worse?\"\nshe cried.\n\n\"Far from that--better. God bless him!\" Dr. Moncrieff said.\n\nI think if Simson had begun again to me with his questions, I should have\npitched him over the rocks as we returned up the glen; but he was silent,\nby a good inspiration. And the sky was clearer than it had been for many\nnights, shining high over the trees, with here and there a star faintly\ngleaming through the wilderness of dark and bare branches. The air, as I\nhave said, was very soft in them, with a subdued and peaceful cadence. It\nwas real, like every natural sound, and came to us like a hush of peace\nand relief. I thought there was a sound in it as of the breath of a\nsleeper, and it seemed clear to me that Roland must be sleeping,\nsatisfied and calm. We went up to his room when we went in. There we\nfound the complete hush of rest. My wife looked up out of a doze, and\ngave me a smile: \"I think he is a great deal better; but you are very\nlate,\" she said in a whisper, shading the light with her hand that the\nDoctor might see his patient. The boy had got back something like his own\ncolor. He woke as we stood all round his bed. His eyes had the happy,\nhalf-awakened look of childhood, glad to shut again, yet pleased with the\ninterruption and glimmer of the light. I stooped over him and kissed his\nforehead, which was moist and cool. \"All is well, Roland,\" I said. He\nlooked up at me with a glance of pleasure, and took my hand and laid his\ncheek upon it, and so went to sleep.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor some nights after, I watched among the ruins, spending all the dark\nhours up to midnight patrolling about the bit of wall which was\nassociated with so many emotions; but I heard nothing, and saw nothing\nbeyond the quiet course of nature; nor, so far as I am aware, has\nanything been heard again. Dr. Moncrieff gave me the history of the\nyouth, whom he never hesitated to name. I did not ask, as Simson did, how\nhe recognized him. He had been a prodigal,--weak, foolish, easily imposed\nupon, and \"led away,\" as people say. All that we had heard had passed\nactually in life, the Doctor said. The young man had come home thus a day\nor two after his mother died,--who was no more than the housekeeper in\nthe old house,--and distracted with the news, had thrown himself down at\nthe door and called upon her to let him in. The old man could scarcely\nspeak of it for tears. To me it seemed as if--Heaven help us, how little\ndo we know about anything!--a scene like that might impress itself\nsomehow upon the hidden heart of nature. I do not pretend to know how,\nbut the repetition had struck me at the time as, in its terrible\nstrangeness and incomprehensibility, almost mechanical,--as if the unseen\nactor could not exceed or vary, but was bound to re-enact the whole. One\nthing that struck me, however, greatly, was the likeness between the old\nminister and my boy in the manner of regarding these strange phenomena.\nDr. Moncrieff was not terrified, as I had been myself, and all the rest\nof us. It was no \"ghost,\" as I fear we all vulgarly considered it, to\nhim,--but a poor creature whom he knew under these conditions, just as\nhe had known him in the flesh, having no doubt of his identity. And to\nRoland it was the same. This spirit in pain,--if it was a spirit,--this\nvoice out of the unseen,--was a poor fellow-creature in misery, to be\nsuccored and helped out of his trouble, to my boy. He spoke to me quite\nfrankly about it when he got better. \"I knew father would find out some\nway,\" he said. And this was when he was strong and well, and all idea\nthat he would turn hysterical or become a seer of visions had happily\npassed away.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI must add one curious fact, which does not seem to me to have any\nrelation to the above, but which Simson made great use of, as the human\nagency which he was determined to find somehow. We had examined the ruins\nvery closely at the time of these occurrences; but afterwards, when all\nwas over, as we went casually about them one Sunday afternoon in the\nidleness of that unemployed day, Simson with his stick penetrated an old\nwindow which had been entirely blocked up with fallen soil. He jumped\ndown into it in great excitement, and called me to follow. There we found\na little hole,--for it was more a hole than a room,--entirely hidden\nunder the ivy and ruins, in which there was a quantity of straw laid in a\ncorner, as if some one had made a bed there, and some remains of crusts\nabout the floor. Some one had lodged there, and not very long before, he\nmade out; and that this unknown being was the author of all the\nmysterious sounds we heard he is convinced. \"I told you it was human\nagency,\" he said triumphantly. He forgets, I suppose, how he and I stood\nwith our lights, seeing nothing, while the space between us was audibly\ntraversed by something that could speak, and sob, and suffer. There is no\nargument with men of this kind. He is ready to get up a laugh against me\non this slender ground. \"I was puzzled myself,--I could not make it\nout,--but I always felt convinced human agency was at the bottom of it.\nAnd here it is,--and a clever fellow he must have been,\" the Doctor says.\n\nBagley left my service as soon as he got well. He assured me it was no\nwant of respect, but he could not stand \"them kind of things;\" and the\nman was so shaken and ghastly that I was glad to give him a present and\nlet him go. For my own part, I made a point of staying out the\ntime--two years--for which I had taken Brentwood; but I did not renew\nmy tenancy. By that time we had settled, and found for ourselves a\npleasant home of our own.\n\nI must add, that when the Doctor defies me, I can always bring back\ngravity to his countenance, and a pause in his railing, when I remind him\nof the juniper-bush. To me that was a matter of little importance. I\ncould believe I was mistaken. I did not care about it one way or other;\nbut on his mind the effect was different. The miserable voice, the spirit\nin pain, he could think of as the result of ventriloquism, or\nreverberation, or--anything you please: an elaborate prolonged hoax,\nexecuted somehow by the tramp that had found a lodging in the old tower;\nbut the juniper-bush staggered him. Things have effects so different on\nthe minds of different men.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\nTHE PORTRAIT\n\n\nAt the period when the following incidents occurred, I was living with my\nfather at The Grove, a large old house in the immediate neighborhood of a\nlittle town. This had been his home for a number of years; and I believe\nI was born in it. It was a kind of house which, notwithstanding all the\nred and white architecture known at present by the name of Queen Anne,\nbuilders nowadays have forgotten how to build. It was straggling and\nirregular, with wide passages, wide staircases, broad landings; the rooms\nlarge but not very lofty; the arrangements leaving much to be desired,\nwith no economy of space; a house belonging to a period when land was\ncheap, and, so far as that was concerned, there was no occasion to\neconomize. Though it was so near the town, the clump of trees in which it\nwas environed was a veritable grove. In the grounds in spring the\nprimroses grew as thickly as in the forest. We had a few fields for the\ncows, and an excellent walled garden. The place is being pulled down at\nthis moment to make room for more streets of mean little houses,--the\nkind of thing, and not a dull house of faded gentry, which perhaps the\nneighborhood requires. The house was dull, and so were we, its last\ninhabitants; and the furniture was faded, even a little dingy,--nothing\nto brag of. I do not, however, intend to convey a suggestion that we were\nfaded gentry, for that was not the case. My father, indeed, was rich, and\nhad no need to spare any expense in making his life and his house bright\nif he pleased; but he did not please, and I had not been long enough at\nhome to exercise any special influence of my own. It was the only home I\nhad ever known; but except in my earliest childhood, and in my holidays\nas a schoolboy, I had in reality known but little of it. My mother had\ndied at my birth, or shortly after, and I had grown up in the gravity and\nsilence of a house without women. In my infancy, I believe, a sister of\nmy father's had lived with us, and taken charge of the household and of\nme; but she, too, had died long, long ago, my mourning for her being one\nof the first things I could recollect. And she had no successor. There\nwere, indeed, a housekeeper and some maids,--the latter of whom I only\nsaw disappearing at the end of a passage, or whisking out of a room when\none of \"the gentlemen\" appeared. Mrs. Weir, indeed, I saw nearly every\nday; but a curtsey, a smile, a pair of nice round arms which she caressed\nwhile folding them across her ample waist, and a large white apron, were\nall I knew of her. This was the only female influence in the house. The\ndrawing-room I was aware of only as a place of deadly good order, into\nwhich nobody ever entered. It had three long windows opening on the lawn,\nand communicated at the upper end, which was rounded like a great bay,\nwith the conservatory. Sometimes I gazed into it as a child from without,\nwondering at the needlework on the chairs, the screens, the\nlooking-glasses which never reflected any living face. My father did not\nlike the room, which probably was not wonderful, though it never occurred\nto me in those early days to inquire why.\n\nI may say here, though it will probably be disappointing to those who\nform a sentimental idea of the capabilities of children, that it did\nnot occur to me either, in these early days, to make any inquiry about\nmy mother. There was no room in life, as I knew it, for any such\nperson; nothing suggested to my mind either the fact that she must have\nexisted, or that there was need of her in the house. I accepted, as I\nbelieve most children do, the facts of existence, on the basis with\nwhich I had first made acquaintance with them, without question or\nremark. As a matter of fact, I was aware that it was rather dull at\nhome; but neither by comparison with the books I read, nor by the\ncommunications received from my school-fellows, did this seem to me\nanything remarkable. And I was possibly somewhat dull too by nature,\nfor I did not mind. I was fond of reading, and for that there was\nunbounded opportunity. I had a little ambition in respect to work, and\nthat too could be prosecuted undisturbed. When I went to the\nuniversity, my society lay almost entirely among men; but by that time\nand afterwards, matters had of course greatly changed with me, and\nthough I recognized women as part of the economy of nature, and did not\nindeed by any means dislike or avoid them, yet the idea of connecting\nthem at all with my own home never entered into my head. That continued\nto be as it had always been, when at intervals I descended upon the\ncool, grave, colorless place, in the midst of my traffic with the\nworld: always very still, well-ordered, serious,--the cooking very\ngood, the comfort perfect; old Morphew, the butler, a little older (but\nvery little older, perhaps on the whole less old, since in my childhood\nI had thought him a kind of Methuselah); and Mrs. Weir, less active,\ncovering up her arms in sleeves, but folding and caressing them just as\nalways. I remember looking in from the lawn through the windows upon\nthat deadly-orderly drawing-room, with a humorous recollection of my\nchildish admiration and wonder, and feeling that it must be kept so\nforever and ever, and that to go into it would break some sort of\namusing mock mystery, some pleasantly ridiculous spell.\n\nBut it was only at rare intervals that I went home. In the long vacation,\nas in my school holidays, my father often went abroad with me, so that we\nhad gone over a great deal of the Continent together very pleasantly. He\nwas old in proportion to the age of his son, being a man of sixty when I\nwas twenty, but that did not disturb the pleasure of the relations\nbetween us. I don't know that they were ever very confidential. On my\nside there was but little to communicate, for I did not get into scrapes\nnor fall in love, the two predicaments which demand sympathy and\nconfidences. And as for my father himself, I was never aware what there\ncould be to communicate on his side. I knew his life exactly,--what he\ndid almost at every hour of the day; under what circumstances of the\ntemperature he would ride and when walk; how often and with what guests\nhe would indulge in the occasional break of a dinner-party, a serious\npleasure,--perhaps, indeed, less a pleasure than a duty. All this I knew\nas well as he did, and also his views on public matters, his political\nopinions, which naturally were different from mine. What ground, then,\nremained for confidence? I did not know any. We were both of us of a\nreserved nature, not apt to enter into our religious feelings, for\ninstance. There are many people who think reticence on such subjects a\nsign of the most reverential way of contemplating them. Of this I am far\nfrom being sure; but, at all events, it was the practice most congenial\nto my own mind.\n\nAnd then I was for a long time absent, making my own way in the world. I\ndid not make it very successfully. I accomplished the natural fate of an\nEnglishman, and went out to the Colonies; then to India in a\nsemi-diplomatic position; but returned home after seven or eight years,\ninvalided, in bad health and not much better spirits, tired and\ndisappointed with my first trial of life. I had, as people say, \"no\noccasion\" to insist on making my way. My father was rich, and had never\ngiven me the slightest reason to believe that he did not intend me to be\nhis heir. His allowance to me was not illiberal, and though he did not\noppose the carrying out of my own plans, he by no means urged me to\nexertion. When I came home he received me very affectionately, and\nexpressed his satisfaction in my return. \"Of course,\" he said, \"I am not\nglad that you are disappointed, Philip, or that your health is broken;\nbut otherwise it is an ill wind, you know, that blows nobody good; and I\nam very glad to have you at home. I am growing an old man--\"\n\n\"I don't see any difference, sir,\" said I; \"everything here seems exactly\nthe same as when I went away--\"\n\nHe smiled, and shook his head. \"It is true enough,\" he said; \"after we\nhave reached a certain age we seem to go on for a long time on a\nplane, and feel no great difference from year to year; but it is an\ninclined plane, and the longer we go on the more sudden will be the\nfall at the end. But at all events it will be a great comfort to me to\nhave you here.\"\n\n\"If I had known that,\" I said, \"and that you wanted me, I should have\ncome in any circumstances. As there are only two of us in the world--\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"there are only two of us in the world; but still I\nshould not have sent for you, Phil, to interrupt your career.\"\n\n\"It is as well, then, that it has interrupted itself,\" I said rather\nbitterly; for disappointment is hard to bear.\n\nHe patted me on the shoulder, and repeated, \"It is an ill wind that blows\nnobody good,\" with a look of real pleasure which gave me a certain\ngratification too; for, after all, he was an old man, and the only one in\nall the world to whom I owed any duty. I had not been without dreams of\nwarmer affections, but they had come to nothing--not tragically, but in\nthe ordinary way. I might perhaps have had love which I did not want but\nnot that which I did want,--which was not a thing to make any unmanly\nmoan about, but in the ordinary course of events. Such disappointments\nhappen every day; indeed, they are more common than anything else, and\nsometimes it is apparent afterwards that it is better it was so.\n\nHowever, here I was at thirty stranded, yet wanting for nothing,--in a\nposition to call forth rather envy than pity from the greater part of my\ncontemporaries; for I had an assured and comfortable existence, as much\nmoney as I wanted, and the prospect of an excellent fortune for the\nfuture. On the other hand, my health was still low, and I had no\noccupation. The neighborhood of the town was a drawback rather than an\nadvantage. I felt myself tempted, instead of taking the long walk into\nthe country which my doctor recommended, to take a much shorter one\nthrough the High Street, across the river, and back again, which was\nnot a walk but a lounge. The country was silent and full of\nthoughts,--thoughts not always very agreeable,--whereas there were always\nthe humors of the little urban population to glance at, the news to be\nheard,--all those petty matters which so often make up life in a very\nimpoverished version for the idle man. I did not like it, but I felt\nmyself yielding to it, not having energy enough to make a stand. The\nrector and the leading lawyer of the place asked me to dinner. I might\nhave glided into the society, such as it was, had I been disposed for\nthat; everything about me began to close over me as if I had been fifty,\nand fully contented with my lot.\n\nIt was possibly my own want of occupation which made me observe with\nsurprise, after a while, how much occupied my father was. He had\nexpressed himself glad of my return; but now that I had returned, I saw\nvery little of him. Most of his time was spent in his library, as had\nalways been the case. But on the few visits I paid him there, I could not\nbut perceive that the aspect of the library was much changed. It had\nacquired the look of a business-room, almost an office. There were large\nbusiness-like books on the table, which I could not associate with\nanything he could naturally have to do; and his correspondence was very\nlarge. I thought he closed one of those books hurriedly as I came in, and\npushed it away, as if he did not wish me to see it. This surprised me at\nthe moment without arousing any other feeling; but afterwards I\nremembered it with a clearer sense of what it meant. He was more absorbed\naltogether than I had been used to see him. He was visited by men\nsometimes not of very prepossessing appearance. Surprise grew in my mind\nwithout any very distinct idea of the reason of it; and it was not till\nafter a chance conversation with Morphew that my vague uneasiness began\nto take definite shape. It was begun without any special intention on my\npart. Morphew had informed me that master was very busy, on some occasion\nwhen I wanted to see him. And I was a little annoyed to be thus put off.\n\"It appears to me that my father is always busy,\" I said hastily. Morphew\nthen began very oracularly to nod his head in assent.\n\n\"A deal too busy, sir, if you take my opinion,\" he said.\n\nThis startled me much, and I asked hurriedly, \"What do you mean?\" without\nreflecting that to ask for private information from a servant about my\nfather's habits was as bad as investigating into a stranger's affairs. It\ndid not strike me in the same light.\n\n\"Mr. Philip,\" said Morphew, \"a thing 'as 'appened as 'appens more often\nthan it ought to. Master has got awful keen about money in his old age.\"\n\n\"That's a new thing for him,\" I said.\n\n\"No, sir, begging your pardon, it ain't a new thing. He was once\nbroke of it, and that wasn't easy done; but it's come back, if you'll\nexcuse me saying so. And I don't know as he'll ever be broke of it\nagain at his age.\"\n\nI felt more disposed to be angry than disturbed by this. \"You must be\nmaking some ridiculous mistake,\" I said. \"And if you were not so old a\nfriend as you are, Morphew, I should not have allowed my father to be so\nspoken of to me.\"\n\nThe old man gave me a half-astonished, half-contemptuous look. \"He's been\nmy master a deal longer than he's been your father,\" he said, turning on\nhis heel. The assumption was so comical that my anger could not stand in\nface of it. I went out, having been on my way to the door when this\nconversation occurred, and took my usual lounge about, which was not a\nsatisfactory sort of amusement. Its vanity and emptiness appeared to be\nmore evident than usual to-day. I met half-a-dozen people I knew, and had\nas many pieces of news confided to me. I went up and down the length of\nthe High Street. I made a small purchase or two. And then I turned\nhomeward, despising myself, yet finding no alternative within my reach.\nWould a long country walk have been more virtuous? It would at least have\nbeen more wholesome; but that was all that could be said. My mind did\nnot dwell on Morphew's communication. It seemed without sense or meaning\nto me; and after the excellent joke about his superior interest in his\nmaster to mine in my father, was dismissed lightly enough from my mind. I\ntried to invent some way of telling this to my father without letting him\nperceive that Morphew had been finding faults in him, or I listening; for\nit seemed a pity to lose so good a joke. However, as I returned home,\nsomething happened which put the joke entirely out of my head. It is\ncurious when a new subject of trouble or anxiety has been suggested to\nthe mind in an unexpected way, how often a second advertisement follows\nimmediately after the first, and gives to that a potency which in itself\nit had not possessed.\n\nI was approaching our own door, wondering whether my father had gone, and\nwhether, on my return, I should find him at leisure,--for I had several\nlittle things to say to him,--when I noticed a poor woman lingering about\nthe closed gates. She had a baby sleeping in her arms. It was a spring\nnight, the stars shining in the twilight, and everything soft and dim;\nand the woman's figure was like a shadow, flitting about, now here, now\nthere, on one side or another of the gate. She stopped when she saw me\napproaching, and hesitated for a moment, then seemed to take a sudden\nresolution. I watched her without knowing, with a prevision that she was\ngoing to address me, though with no sort of idea as to the subject of her\naddress. She came up to me doubtfully, it seemed, yet certainly, as I\nfelt, and when she was close to me, dropped a sort of hesitating curtsey,\nand said, \"It's Mr. Philip?\" in a low voice.\n\n\"What do you want with me?\" I said.\n\nThen she poured forth suddenly, without warning or preparation, her long\nspeech,--a flood of words which must have been all ready and waiting at\nthe doors of her lips for utterance. \"Oh, sir, I want to speak to you! I\ncan't believe you'll be so hard, for you're young; and I can't believe\nhe'll be so hard if so be as his own son, as I've always heard he had but\none, 'll speak up for us. Oh, gentleman, it is easy for the likes of you,\nthat, if you ain't comfortable in one room, can just walk into another;\nbut if one room is all you have, and every bit of furniture you have\ntaken out of it, and nothing but the four walls left,--not so much as the\ncradle for the child, or a chair for your man to sit down upon when he\ncomes from his work, or a saucepan to cook him his supper--\"\n\n\"My good woman,\" I said, \"who can have taken all that from you? Surely\nnobody can be so cruel?\"\n\n\"You say it's cruel!\" she cried with a sort of triumph. \"Oh, I knowed you\nwould, or any true gentleman that don't hold with screwing poor folks.\nJust go and say that to him inside there for the love of God. Tell him\nto think what he's doing, driving poor creatures to despair. Summer's\ncoming, the Lord be praised, but yet it's bitter cold at night with your\ncounterpane gone; and when you've been working hard all day, and nothing\nbut four bare walls to come home to, and all your poor little sticks of\nfurniture that you've saved up for, and got together one by one, all\ngone, and you no better than when you started, or rather worse, for then\nyou was young. Oh, sir!\" the woman's voice rose into a sort of passionate\nwail. And then she added, beseechingly, recovering herself, \"Oh, speak\nfor us; he'll not refuse his own son--\"\n\n\"To whom am I to speak? Who is it that has done this to you?\" I said.\n\nThe woman hesitated again, looking keenly in my face, then repeated with\na slight faltering, \"It's Mr. Philip?\" as if that made everything right.\n\n\"Yes; I am Philip Canning,\" I said; \"but what have I to do with this?\nand to whom am I to speak?\"\n\nShe began to whimper, crying and stopping herself. \"Oh, please, sir! it's\nMr. Canning as owns all the house property about; it's him that our court\nand the lane and everything belongs to. And he's taken the bed from under\nus, and the baby's cradle, although it's said in the Bible as you're not\nto take poor folks' bed.\"\n\n\"My father!\" I cried in spite of myself; \"then it must be some agent,\nsome one else in his name. You may be sure he knows nothing of it. Of\ncourse I shall speak to him at once.\"\n\n\"Oh, God bless you, sir,\" said the woman. But then she added, in a lower\ntone, \"It's no agent. It's one as never knows trouble. It's him that\nlives in that grand house.\" But this was said under her breath, evidently\nnot for me to hear.\n\nMorphew's words flashed through my mind as she spoke. What was this? Did\nit afford an explanation of the much-occupied hours, the big books, the\nstrange visitors? I took the poor woman's name, and gave her something\nto procure a few comforts for the night, and went indoors disturbed and\ntroubled. It was impossible to believe that my father himself would\nhave acted thus; but he was not a man to brook interference, and I did\nnot see how to introduce the subject, what to say. I could but hope\nthat, at the moment of broaching it, words would be put into my mouth,\nwhich often happens in moments of necessity, one knows not how, even\nwhen one's theme is not so all-important as that for which such help has\nbeen promised. As usual, I did not see my father till dinner. I have\nsaid that our dinners were very good, luxurious in a simple way,\neverything excellent in its kind, well cooked, well served,--the\nperfection of comfort without show,--which is a combination very dear to\nthe English heart. I said nothing till Morphew, with his solemn\nattention to everything that was going, had retired; and then it was\nwith some strain of courage that I began.\n\n\"I was stopped outside the gate to-day by a curious sort of\npetitioner,--a poor woman, who seems to be one of your tenants, sir, but\nwhom your agent must have been rather too hard upon.\"\n\n\"My agent? Who is that?\" said my father quietly.\n\n\"I don't know his name, and I doubt his competence. The poor creature\nseems to have had everything taken from her,--her bed, her child's\ncradle.\"\n\n\"No doubt she was behind with her rent.\"\n\n\"Very likely, sir. She seemed very poor,\" said I.\n\n\"You take it coolly,\" said my father, with an upward glance, half-amused,\nnot in the least shocked by my statement. \"But when a man, or a woman\neither, takes a house, I suppose you will allow that they ought to pay\nrent for it.\"\n\n\"Certainly, sir,\" I replied, \"when they have got anything to pay.\"\n\n\"I don't allow the reservation,\" he said. But he was not angry, which I\nhad feared he would be.\n\n\"I think,\" I continued, \"that your agent must be too severe. And this\nemboldens me to say something which has been in my mind for some\ntime\"--(these were the words, no doubt, which I had hoped would be put\ninto my month; they were the suggestion of the moment, and yet as I said\nthem it was with the most complete conviction of their truth)--\"and that\nis this: I am doing nothing; my time hangs heavy on my hands. Make me\nyour agent. I will see for myself, and save you from such mistakes; and\nit will be an occupation--\"\n\n\"Mistakes? What warrant have you for saying these are mistakes?\" he said\ntestily; then after a moment: \"This is a strange proposal from you, Phil.\nDo you know what it is you are offering?--to be a collector of rents,\ngoing about from door to door, from week to week; to look after wretched\nlittle bits of repairs, drains, etc.; to get paid, which, after all, is\nthe chief thing, and not to be taken in by tales of poverty.\"\n\n\"Not to let you be taken in by men without pity,\" I said.\n\nHe gave me a strange glance, which I did not very well understand, and\nsaid abruptly, a thing which, so far as I remember, he had never in my\nlife said before, \"You've become a little like your mother, Phil--\"\n\n\"My mother!\" the reference was so unusual--nay, so unprecedented--that I\nwas greatly startled. It seemed to me like the sudden introduction of a\nquite new element in the stagnant atmosphere, as well as a new party to\nour conversation. My father looked across the table, as if with some\nastonishment at my tone of surprise.\n\n\"Is that so very extraordinary?\" he said.\n\n\"No; of course it is not extraordinary that I should resemble my mother.\nOnly--I have heard very little of her--almost nothing.\"\n\n\"That is true.\" He got up and placed himself before the fire, which was\nvery low, as the night was not cold--had not been cold heretofore at\nleast; but it seemed to me now that a little chill came into the dim and\nfaded room. Perhaps it looked more dull from the suggestion of a\nsomething brighter, warmer, that might have been. \"Talking of mistakes,\"\nhe said, \"perhaps that was one: to sever you entirely from her side of\nthe house. But I did not care for the connection. You will understand how\nit is that I speak of it now when I tell you--\" He stopped here, however,\nsaid nothing more for a minute or so, and then rang the bell. Morphew\ncame, as he always did, very deliberately, so that some time elapsed in\nsilence, during which my surprise grew. When the old man appeared at the\ndoor--\"Have you put the lights in the drawing-room, as I told you?\" my\nfather said.\n\n\"Yes, sir; and opened the box, sir; and it's a--it's a speaking\nlikeness--\"\n\nThis the old man got out in a great hurry, as if afraid that his master\nwould stop him. My father did so with a wave of his hand.\n\n\"That's enough. I asked no information. You can go now.\"\n\nThe door closed upon us, and there was again a pause. My subject had\nfloated away altogether like a mist, though I had been so concerned about\nit. I tried to resume, but could not. Something seemed to arrest my very\nbreathing; and yet in this dull, respectable house of ours, where\neverything breathed good character and integrity, it was certain that\nthere could be no shameful mystery to reveal. It was some time before my\nfather spoke, not from any purpose that I could see, but apparently\nbecause his mind was busy with probably unaccustomed thoughts.\n\n\"You scarcely know the drawing-room, Phil,\" he said at last.\n\n\"Very little. I have never seen it used. I have a little awe of it, to\ntell the truth.\"\n\n\"That should not be. There is no reason for that. But a man by himself,\nas I have been for the greater part of my life, has no occasion for a\ndrawing-room. I always, as a matter of preference, sat among my books;\nhowever, I ought to have thought of the impression on you.\"\n\n\"Oh, it is not important,\" I said; \"the awe was childish. I have not\nthought of it since I came home.\"\n\n\"It never was anything very splendid at the best,\" said he. He lifted the\nlamp from the table with a sort of abstraction, not remarking even my\noffer to take it from him, and led the way. He was on the verge of\nseventy, and looked his age; but it was a vigorous age, with no symptom\nof giving way. The circle of light from the lamp lit up his white hair\nand keen blue eyes and clear complexion; his forehead was like old ivory,\nhis cheek warmly ; an old man, yet a man in full strength. He was\ntaller than I was, and still almost as strong. As he stood for a moment\nwith the lamp in his hand, he looked like a tower in his great height and\nbulk. I reflected as I looked at him that I knew him intimately, more\nintimately than any other creature in the world,--I was familiar with\nevery detail of his outward life; could it be that in reality I did not\nknow him at all?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe drawing-room was already lighted with a flickering array of candles\nupon the mantelpiece and along the walls, producing the pretty, starry\neffect which candles give without very much light. As I had not the\nsmallest idea what I was about to see, for Morphew's \"speaking likeness\"\nwas very hurriedly said, and only half comprehensible in the bewilderment\nof my faculties, my first glance was at this very unusual illumination,\nfor which I could assign no reason. The next showed me a large\nfull-length portrait, still in the box in which apparently it had\ntravelled, placed upright, supported against a table in the centre of the\nroom. My father walked straight up to it, motioned to me to place a\nsmaller table close to the picture on the left side, and put his lamp\nupon that. Then he waved his hand towards it, and stood aside that I\nmight see.\n\nIt was a full-length portrait of a very young woman--I might say a girl\nscarcely twenty--in a white dress, made in a very simple old fashion,\nthough I was too little accustomed to female costume to be able to fix\nthe date. It might have been a hundred years old, or twenty, for aught I\nknew. The face had an expression of youth, candor, and simplicity more\nthan any face I had ever seen,--or so, at least in my surprise, I\nthought. The eyes were a little wistful, with something which was almost\nanxiety which at least was not content--in them; a faint, almost\nimperceptible, curve in the lids. The complexion was of a dazzling\nfairness, the hair light, but the eyes dark, which gave individuality to\nthe face. It would have been as lovely had the eyes been blue,--probably\nmore so,--but their darkness gave a touch of character, a slight discord,\nwhich made the harmony finer. It was not, perhaps, beautiful in the\nhighest sense of the word. The girl must have been too young, too slight,\ntoo little developed for actual beauty; but a face which so invited love\nand confidence I never saw. One smiled at it with instinctive affection.\n\"What a sweet face!\" I said. \"What a lovely girl! Who is she? Is this one\nof the relations you were speaking of on the other side?\"\n\nMy father made me no reply. He stood aside, looking at it as if he knew\nit too well to require to look,--as if the picture was already in his\neyes. \"Yes,\" he said, after an interval, with a long-drawn breath, \"she\nwas a lovely girl, as you say.\"\n\n\"Was?--then she is dead. What a pity!\" I said; \"what a pity! so young and\nso sweet!\"\n\nWe stood gazing at her thus, in her beautiful stillness and calm,--two\nmen, the younger of us full-grown and conscious of many experiences, the\nother an old man,--before this impersonation of tender youth. At length\nhe said, with a slight tremulousness in his voice, \"Does nothing suggest\nto you who she is, Phil?\"\n\nI turned round to look at him with profound astonishment, but he turned\naway from my look. A sort of quiver passed over his face. \"That is your\nmother,\" he said, and walked suddenly away, leaving me there.\n\nMy mother!\n\nI stood for a moment in a kind of consternation before the white-robed\ninnocent creature, to me no more than a child; then a sudden laugh broke\nfrom me, without any will of mine something ludicrous, as well as\nsomething awful, was in it. When the laugh was over, I found myself with\ntears in my eyes, gazing, holding my breath. The soft features seemed to\nmelt, the lips to move, the anxiety in the eyes to become a personal\ninquiry. Ah, no! nothing of the kind; only because of the water in mine.\nMy mother! oh, fair and gentle creature, scarcely woman, how could any\nman's voice call her by that name! I had little idea enough of what it\nmeant,--had heard it laughed at, scoffed at, reverenced, but never had\nlearned to place it even among the ideal powers of life. Yet if it meant\nanything at all, what it meant was worth thinking of. What did she ask,\nlooking at me with those eyes? What would she have said if \"those lips\nhad language\"? If I had known her only as Cowper did--with a child's\nrecollection--there might have been some thread, some faint but\ncomprehensible link, between us; but now all that I felt was the curious\nincongruity. Poor child! I said to myself; so sweet a creature: poor\nlittle tender soul! as if she had been a little sister, a child of\nmine,--but my mother! I cannot tell how long I stood looking at her,\nstudying the candid, sweet face, which surely had germs in it of\neverything that was good and beautiful; and sorry, with a profound\nregret, that she had died and never carried these promises to\nfulfillment. Poor girl! poor people who had loved her! These were my\nthoughts; with a curious vertigo and giddiness of my whole being in the\nsense of a mysterious relationship, which it was beyond my power to\nunderstand.\n\nPresently my father came back, possibly because I had been a long time\nunconscious of the passage of the minutes, or perhaps because he was\nhimself restless in the strange disturbance of his habitual calm. He came\nin and put his arm within mine, leaning his weight partially upon me,\nwith an affectionate suggestion which went deeper than words. I pressed\nhis arm to my side: it was more between us two grave Englishmen than any\nembracing.\n\n\"I cannot understand it,\" I said.\n\n\"No. I don't wonder at that; but if it is strange to you, Phil, think how\nmuch more strange to me! That is the partner of my life. I have never had\nanother, or thought of another. That--girl! If we are to meet again, as I\nhave always hoped we should meet again, what am I to say to her,--I, an\nold man? Yes; I know what you mean. I am not an old man for my years; but\nmy years are threescore and ten, and the play is nearly played out. How\nam I to meet that young creature? We used to say to each other that it\nwas forever, that we never could be but one, that it was for life and\ndeath. But what--what am I to say to her, Phil, when I meet her again,\nthat--that angel? No, it is not her being an angel that troubles me; but\nshe is so young! She is like my--my granddaughter,\" he cried, with a\nburst of what was half sobs, half laughter; \"and she is my wife,--and I\nam an old man--an old man! And so much has happened that she could not\nunderstand.\"\n\nI was too much startled by this strange complaint to know what to say.\nIt was not my own trouble, and I answered it in the conventional way.\n\n\"They are not as we are, sir,\" I said; \"they look upon us with larger,\nother eyes than ours.\"\n\n\"Ah! you don't know what I mean,\" he said quickly; and in the interval he\nhad subdued his emotion. \"At first, after she died, it was my consolation\nto think that I should meet her again,--that we never could be really\nparted. But, my God, how I have changed since then! I am another man,--I\nam a different being. I was not very young even then,--twenty years older\nthan she was; but her youth renewed mine. I was not an unfit partner; she\nasked no better, and knew as much more than I did in some things,--being\nso much nearer the source,--as I did in others that were of the world.\nBut I have gone a long way since then, Phil,--a long way; and there she\nstands, just where I left her.\"\n\nI pressed his arm again. \"Father,\" I said, which was a title I seldom\nused, \"we are not to suppose that in a higher life the mind stands\nstill.\" I did not feel myself qualified to discuss such topics, but\nsomething one must say.\n\n\"Worse, worse!\" he replied; \"then she too will be, like me, a different\nbeing, and we shall meet as what? as strangers, as people who have lost\nsight of each other, with a\n\n### Summary:\n\n"}

H. F. Cary\n\n\n\nPURGATORY\n\nCantos 1 - 33\n\n\n\nCANTO I\n\nO'er better waves to speed her rapid course\nThe light bark of my genius lifts the sail,\nWell pleas'd to leave so cruel sea behind;\nAnd of that second region will I sing,\nIn which the human spirit from sinful blot\nIs purg'd, and for ascent to Heaven prepares.\n\nHere, O ye hallow'd Nine! for in your train\nI follow, here the deadened strain revive;\nNor let Calliope refuse to sound\nA somewhat higher song, of that loud tone,\nWhich when the wretched birds of chattering note\nHad heard, they of forgiveness lost all hope.\n\nSweet hue of eastern sapphire, that was spread\nO'er the serene aspect of the pure air,\nHigh up as the first circle, to mine eyes\nUnwonted joy renew'd, soon as I'scap'd\nForth from the atmosphere of deadly gloom,\nThat had mine eyes and bosom fill'd with grief.\nThe radiant planet, that to love invites,\nMade all the orient laugh, and veil'd beneath\nThe Pisces' light, that in his escort came.\n\nTo the right hand I turn'd, and fix'd my mind\nOn the' other pole attentive, where I saw\nFour stars ne'er seen before save by the ken\nOf our first parents.  Heaven of their rays\nSeem'd joyous.  O thou northern site, bereft\nIndeed, and widow'd, since of these depriv'd!\n\nAs from this view I had desisted, straight\nTurning a little tow'rds the other pole,\nThere from whence now the wain had disappear'd,\nI saw an old man standing by my side\nAlone, so worthy of rev'rence in his look,\nThat ne'er from son to father more was ow'd.\nLow down his beard and mix'd with hoary white\nDescended, like his locks, which parting fell\nUpon his breast in double fold.  The beams\nOf those four luminaries on his face\nSo brightly shone, and with such radiance clear\nDeck'd it, that I beheld him as the sun.\n\n\"Say who are ye, that stemming the blind stream,\nForth from th' eternal prison-house have fled?\"\nHe spoke and moved those venerable plumes.\n\"Who hath conducted, or with lantern sure\nLights you emerging from the depth of night,\nThat makes the infernal valley ever black?\nAre the firm statutes of the dread abyss\nBroken, or in high heaven new laws ordain'd,\nThat thus, condemn'd, ye to my caves approach?\"\n\nMy guide, then laying hold on me, by words\nAnd intimations given with hand and head,\nMade my bent knees and eye submissive pay\nDue reverence; then thus to him replied.\n\n\"Not of myself I come; a Dame from heaven\nDescending, had besought me in my charge\nTo bring.  But since thy will implies, that more\nOur true condition I unfold at large,\nMine is not to deny thee thy request.\nThis mortal ne'er hath seen the farthest gloom.\nBut erring by his folly had approach'd\nSo near, that little space was left to turn.\nThen, as before I told, I was dispatch'd\nTo work his rescue, and no way remain'd\nSave this which I have ta'en.  I have display'd\nBefore him all the regions of the bad;\nAnd purpose now those spirits to display,\nThat under thy command are purg'd from sin.\nHow I have brought him would be long to say.\nFrom high descends the virtue, by whose aid\nI to thy sight and hearing him have led.\nNow may our coming please thee.  In the search\nOf liberty he journeys: that how dear\nThey know, who for her sake have life refus'd.\nThou knowest, to whom death for her was sweet\nIn Utica, where thou didst leave those weeds,\nThat in the last great day will shine so bright.\nFor us the' eternal edicts are unmov'd:\nHe breathes, and I am free of Minos' power,\nAbiding in that circle where the eyes\nOf thy chaste Marcia beam, who still in look\nPrays thee, O hallow'd spirit! to own her shine.\nThen by her love we' implore thee, let us pass\nThrough thy sev'n regions; for which best thanks\nI for thy favour will to her return,\nIf mention there below thou not disdain.\"\n\n\"Marcia so pleasing in my sight was found,\"\nHe then to him rejoin'd, \"while I was there,\nThat all she ask'd me I was fain to grant.\nNow that beyond the' accursed stream she dwells,\nShe may no longer move me, by that law,\nWhich was ordain'd me, when I issued thence.\nNot so, if Dame from heaven, as thou sayst,\nMoves and directs thee; then no flattery needs.\nEnough for me that in her name thou ask.\nGo therefore now: and with a slender reed\nSee that thou duly gird him, and his face\nLave, till all sordid stain thou wipe from thence.\nFor not with eye, by any cloud obscur'd,\nWould it be seemly before him to come,\nWho stands the foremost minister in heaven.\nThis islet all around, there far beneath,\nWhere the wave beats it, on the oozy bed\nProduces store of reeds. No other plant,\nCover'd with leaves, or harden'd in its stalk,\nThere lives, not bending to the water's sway.\nAfter, this way return not; but the sun\nWill show you, that now rises, where to take\nThe mountain in its easiest ascent.\"\n\nHe disappear'd; and I myself uprais'd\nSpeechless, and to my guide retiring close,\nToward him turn'd mine eyes.  He thus began;\n\"My son! observant thou my steps pursue.\nWe must retreat to rearward, for that way\nThe champain to its low extreme declines.\"\n\nThe dawn had chas'd the matin hour of prime,\nWhich deaf before it, so that from afar\nI spy'd the trembling of the ocean stream.\n\nWe travers'd the deserted plain, as one\nWho, wander'd from his track, thinks every step\nTrodden in vain till he regain the path.\n\nWhen we had come, where yet the tender dew\nStrove with the sun, and in a place, where fresh\nThe wind breath'd o'er it, while it slowly dried;\nBoth hands extended on the watery grass\nMy master plac'd, in graceful act and kind.\nWhence I of his intent before appriz'd,\nStretch'd out to him my cheeks suffus'd with tears.\nThere to my visage he anew restor'd\nThat hue, which the dun shades of hell conceal'd.\n\nThen on the solitary shore arriv'd,\nThat never sailing on its waters saw\nMan, that could after measure back his course,\nHe girt me in such manner as had pleas'd\nHim who instructed, and O, strange to tell!\nAs he selected every humble plant,\nWherever one was pluck'd, another there\nResembling, straightway in its place arose.\n\n\n\n\nCANTO II\n\nNow had the sun to that horizon reach'd,\nThat covers, with the most exalted point\nOf its meridian circle, Salem's walls,\nAnd night, that opposite to him her orb\nSounds, from the stream of Ganges issued forth,\nHolding the scales, that from her hands are dropp'd\nWhen she reigns highest: so that where I was,\nAurora's white and vermeil-tinctur'd cheek\nTo orange turn'd as she in age increas'd.\n\nMeanwhile we linger'd by the water's brink,\nLike men, who, musing on their road, in thought\nJourney, while motionless the body rests.\nWhen lo! as near upon the hour of dawn,\nThrough the thick vapours Mars with fiery beam\nGlares down in west, over the ocean floor;\nSo seem'd, what once again I hope to view,\nA light so swiftly coming through the sea,\nNo winged course might equal its career.\nFrom which when for a space I had withdrawn\nThine eyes, to make inquiry of my guide,\nAgain I look'd and saw it grown in size\nAnd brightness: thou on either side appear'd\nSomething, but what I knew not of bright hue,\nAnd by degrees from underneath it came\nAnother.  My preceptor silent yet\nStood, while the brightness, that we first discern'd,\nOpen'd the form of wings: then when he knew\nThe pilot, cried aloud, \"Down, down; bend low\nThy knees; behold God's angel: fold thy hands:\nNow shalt thou see true Ministers indeed.\n\n\"Lo how all human means he sets at naught!\nSo that nor oar he needs, nor other sail\nExcept his wings, between such distant shores.\nLo how straight up to heaven he holds them rear'd,\nWinnowing the air with those eternal plumes,\nThat not like mortal hairs fall off or change!\"\n\nAs more and more toward us came, more bright\nAppear'd the bird of God, nor could the eye\nEndure his splendor near: I mine bent down.\nHe drove ashore in a small bark so swift\nAnd light, that in its course no wave it drank.\nThe heav'nly steersman at the prow was seen,\nVisibly written blessed in his looks.\n\nWithin a hundred spirits and more there sat.\n\"In Exitu Israel de Aegypto;\"\nAll with one voice together sang, with what\nIn the remainder of that hymn is writ.\nThen soon as with the sign of holy cross\nHe bless'd them, they at once leap'd out on land,\nThe swiftly as he came return'd. The crew,\nThere left, appear'd astounded with the place,\nGazing around as one who sees new sights.\n\nFrom every side the sun darted his beams,\nAnd with his arrowy radiance from mid heav'n\nHad chas'd the Capricorn, when that strange tribe\nLifting their eyes towards us: \"If ye know,\nDeclare what path will Lead us to the mount.\"\n\nThem Virgil answer'd.  \"Ye suppose perchance\nUs well acquainted with this place: but here,\nWe, as yourselves, are strangers.  Not long erst\nWe came, before you but a little space,\nBy other road so rough and hard, that now\nThe' ascent will seem to us as play.\"  The spirits,\nWho from my breathing had perceiv'd I liv'd,\nGrew pale with wonder.  As the multitude\nFlock round a herald, sent with olive branch,\nTo hear what news he brings, and in their haste\nTread one another down, e'en so at sight\nOf me those happy spirits were fix'd, each one\nForgetful of its errand, to depart,\nWhere cleans'd from sin, it might be made all fair.\n\nThen one I saw darting before the rest\nWith such fond ardour to embrace me, I\nTo do the like was mov'd.  O shadows vain\nExcept in outward semblance! thrice my hands\nI clasp'd behind it, they as oft return'd\nEmpty into my breast again.  Surprise\nI needs must think was painted in my looks,\nFor that the shadow smil'd and backward drew.\nTo follow it I hasten'd, but with voice\nOf sweetness it enjoin'd me to desist.\nThen who it was I knew, and pray'd of it,\nTo talk with me, it would a little pause.\nIt answered: \"Thee as in my mortal frame\nI lov'd, so loos'd forth it I love thee still,\nAnd therefore pause; but why walkest thou here?\"\n\n\"Not without purpose once more to return,\nThou find'st me, my Casella, where I am\nJourneying this way;\" I said, \"but how of thee\nHath so much time been lost?\"  He answer'd straight:\n\"No outrage hath been done to me, if he\nWho when and whom he chooses takes, me oft\nThis passage hath denied, since of just will\nHis will he makes.  These three months past indeed,\nHe, whose chose to enter, with free leave\nHath taken; whence I wand'ring by the shore\nWhere Tyber's wave grows salt, of him gain'd kind\nAdmittance, at that river's mouth, tow'rd which\nHis wings are pointed, for there always throng\nAll such as not to Archeron descend.\"\n\nThen I: \"If new laws have not quite destroy'd\nMemory and use of that sweet song of love,\nThat while all my cares had power to'swage;\nPlease thee with it a little to console\nMy spirit, that incumber'd with its frame,\nTravelling so far, of pain is overcome.\"\n\n\"Love that discourses in my thoughts.\"  He then\nBegan in such soft accents, that within\nThe sweetness thrills me yet.  My gentle guide\nAnd all who came with him, so well were pleas'd,\nThat seem'd naught else might in their thoughts have room.\n\nFast fix'd in mute attention to his notes\nWe stood, when lo! that old man venerable\nExclaiming, \"How is this, ye tardy spirits?\nWhat negligence detains you loit'ring here?\nRun to the mountain to cast off those scales,\nThat from your eyes the sight of God conceal.\"\n\nAs a wild flock of pigeons, to their food\nCollected, blade or tares, without their pride\nAccustom'd, and in still and quiet sort,\nIf aught alarm them, suddenly desert\nTheir meal, assail'd by more important care;\nSo I that new-come troop beheld, the song\nDeserting, hasten to the mountain's side,\nAs one who goes yet where he tends knows not.\n\nNor with less hurried step did we depart.\n\n\n\n\nCANTO III\n\nThem sudden flight had scatter'd over the plain,\nTurn'd tow'rds the mountain, whither reason's voice\nDrives us; I to my faithful company\nAdhering, left it not.  For how of him\nDepriv'd, might I have sped, or who beside\nWould o'er the mountainous tract have led my steps\nHe with the bitter pang of self-remorse\nSeem'd smitten.  O clear conscience and upright\nHow doth a little fling wound thee sore!\n\nSoon as his feet desisted (slack'ning pace),\nFrom haste, that mars all decency of act,\nMy mind, that in itself before was wrapt,\nIts thoughts expanded, as with joy restor'd:\nAnd full against the steep ascent I set\nMy face, where highest to heav'n its top o'erflows.\n\nThe sun, that flar'd behind, with ruddy beam\nBefore my form was broken; for in me\nHis rays resistance met.  I turn'd aside\nWith fear of being left, when I beheld\nOnly before myself the ground obscur'd.\nWhen thus my solace, turning him around,\nBespake me kindly: \"Why distrustest thou?\nBeliev'st not I am with thee, thy sure guide?\nIt now is evening there, where buried lies\nThe body, in which I cast a shade, remov'd\nTo Naples from Brundusium's wall.  Nor thou\nMarvel, if before me no shadow fall,\nMore than that in the sky element\nOne ray obstructs not other.  To endure\nTorments of heat and cold extreme, like frames\nThat virtue hath dispos'd, which how it works\nWills not to us should be reveal'd.  Insane\nWho hopes, our reason may that space explore,\nWhich holds three persons in one substance knit.\nSeek not the wherefore, race of human kind;\nCould ye have seen the whole, no need had been\nFor Mary to bring forth.  Moreover ye\nHave seen such men desiring fruitlessly;\nTo whose desires repose would have been giv'n,\nThat now but serve them for eternal grief.\nI speak of Plato, and the Stagyrite,\nAnd others many more.\"  And then he bent\nDownwards his forehead, and in troubled mood\nBroke off his speech.  Meanwhile we had arriv'd\nFar as the mountain's foot, and there the rock\nFound of so steep ascent, that nimblest steps\nTo climb it had been vain.  The most remote\nMost wild untrodden path, in all the tract\n'Twixt Lerice and Turbia were to this\nA ladder easy' and open of access.\n\n\"Who knows on which hand now the steep declines?\"\nMy master said and paus'd, \"so that he may\nAscend, who journeys without aid of wine?\"\nAnd while with looks directed to the ground\nThe meaning of the pathway he explor'd,\nAnd I gaz'd upward round the stony height,\nOf spirits, that toward us mov'd their steps,\nYet moving seem'd not, they so slow approach'd.\n\nI thus my guide address'd: \"Upraise thine eyes,\nLo that way some, of whom thou may'st obtain\nCounsel, if of thyself thou find'st it not!\"\n\nStraightway he look'd, and with free speech replied:\n\"Let us tend thither: they but softly come.\nAnd thou be firm in hope, my son belov'd.\"\n\nNow was that people distant far in space\nA thousand paces behind ours, as much\nAs at a throw the nervous arm could fling,\nWhen all drew backward on the messy crags\nOf the steep bank, and firmly stood unmov'd\nAs one who walks in doubt might stand to look.\n\n\"O spirits perfect!  O already chosen!\"\nVirgil to them began, \"by that blest peace,\nWhich, as I deem, is for you all prepar'd,\nInstruct us where the mountain low declines,\nSo that attempt to mount it be not vain.\nFor who knows most, him loss of time most grieves.\"\n\nAs sheep, that step from forth their fold, by one,\nOr pairs, or three at once; meanwhile the rest\nStand fearfully, bending the eye and nose\nTo ground, and what the foremost does, that do\nThe others, gath'ring round her, if she stops,\nSimple and quiet, nor the cause discern;\nSo saw I moving to advance the first,\nWho of that fortunate crew were at the head,\nOf modest mien and graceful in their gait.\nWhen they before me had beheld the light\nFrom my right side fall broken on the ground,\nSo that the shadow reach'd the cave, they stopp'd\nAnd somewhat back retir'd: the same did all,\nWho follow'd, though unweeting of the cause.\n\n\"Unask'd of you, yet freely I confess,\nThis is a human body which ye see.\nThat the sun's light is broken on the ground,\nMarvel not: but believe, that not without\nVirtue deriv'd from Heaven, we to climb\nOver this wall aspire.\"  So them bespake\nMy master; and that virtuous tribe rejoin'd;\n\"Turn, and before you there the entrance lies,\"\nMaking a signal to us with bent hands.\n\nThen of them one began.  \"Whoe'er thou art,\nWho journey'st thus this way, thy visage turn,\nThink if me elsewhere thou hast ever seen.\"\n\nI tow'rds him turn'd, and with fix'd eye beheld.\nComely, and fair, and gentle of aspect,\nHe seem'd, but on one brow a gash was mark'd.\n\nWhen humbly I disclaim'd to have beheld\nHim ever: \"Now behold!\"  he said, and show'd\nHigh on his breast a wound: then smiling spake.\n\n\"I am Manfredi, grandson to the Queen\nCostanza: whence I pray thee, when return'd,\nTo my fair daughter go, the parent glad\nOf Aragonia and Sicilia's pride;\nAnd of the truth inform her, if of me\nAught else be told.  When by two mortal blows\nMy frame was shatter'd, I betook myself\nWeeping to him, who of free will forgives.\nMy sins were horrible; but so wide arms\nHath goodness infinite, that it receives\nAll who turn to it.  Had this text divine\nBeen of Cosenza's shepherd better scann'd,\nWho then by Clement on my hunt was set,\nYet at the bridge's head my bones had lain,\nNear Benevento, by the heavy mole\nProtected; but the rain now drenches them,\nAnd the wind drives, out of the kingdom's bounds,\nFar as the stream of Verde, where, with lights\nExtinguish'd, he remov'd them from their bed.\nYet by their curse we are not so destroy'd,\nBut that the eternal love may turn, while hope\nRetains her verdant blossoms.  True it is,\nThat such one as in contumacy dies\nAgainst the holy church, though he repent,\nMust wander thirty-fold for all the time\nIn his presumption past; if such decree\nBe not by prayers of good men shorter made\nLook therefore if thou canst advance my bliss;\nRevealing to my good Costanza, how\nThou hast beheld me, and beside the terms\nLaid on me of that interdict; for here\nBy means of those below much profit comes.\"\n\n\n\n\nCANTO IV\n\nWhen by sensations of delight or pain,\nThat any of our faculties hath seiz'd,\nEntire the soul collects herself, it seems\nShe is intent upon that power alone,\nAnd thus the error is disprov'd which holds\nThe soul not singly lighted in the breast.\nAnd therefore when as aught is heard or seen,\nThat firmly keeps the soul toward it turn'd,\nTime passes, and a man perceives it not.\nFor that, whereby he hearken, is one power,\nAnother that, which the whole spirit hash;\nThis is as it were bound, while that is free.\n\nThis found I true by proof, hearing that spirit\nAnd wond'ring; for full fifty steps aloft\nThe sun had measur'd unobserv'd of me,\nWhen we arriv'd where all with one accord\nThe spirits shouted, \"Here is what ye ask.\"\n\nA larger aperture ofttimes is stopp'd\nWith forked stake of thorn by villager,\nWhen the ripe grape imbrowns, than was the path,\nBy which my guide, and I behind him close,\nAscended solitary, when that troop\nDeparting left us.  On Sanleo's road\nWho journeys, or to Noli low descends,\nOr mounts Bismantua's height, must use his feet;\nBut here a man had need to fly, I mean\nWith the swift wing and plumes of high desire,\nConducted by his aid, who gave me hope,\nAnd with light furnish'd to direct my way.\n\nWe through the broken rock ascended, close\nPent on each side, while underneath the ground\nAsk'd help of hands and feet.  When we arriv'd\nNear on the highest ridge of the steep bank,\nWhere the plain level open'd I exclaim'd,\n\"O master! say which way can we proceed?\"\n\nHe answer'd, \"Let no step of thine recede.\nBehind me gain the mountain, till to us\nSome practis'd guide appear.\"  That eminence\nWas lofty that no eye might reach its point,\nAnd the side proudly rising, more than line\nFrom the mid quadrant to the centre drawn.\nI wearied thus began: \"Parent belov'd!\nTurn, and behold how I remain alone,\nIf thou stay not.\"--\" My son!\"  He straight reply'd,\n\"Thus far put forth thy strength;\" and to a track\nPointed, that, on this side projecting, round\nCircles the hill.  His words so spurr'd me on,\nThat I behind him clamb'ring, forc'd myself,\nTill my feet press'd the circuit plain beneath.\nThere both together seated, turn'd we round\nTo eastward, whence was our ascent: and oft\nMany beside have with delight look'd back.\n\nFirst on the nether shores I turn'd my eyes,\nThen rais'd them to the sun, and wond'ring mark'd\nThat from the left it smote us.  Soon perceiv'd\nThat Poet sage now at the car of light\nAmaz'd I stood, where 'twixt us and the north\nIts course it enter'd.  Whence he thus to me:\n\"Were Leda's offspring now in company\nOf that broad mirror, that high up and low\nImparts his light beneath, thou might'st behold\nThe ruddy zodiac nearer to the bears\nWheel, if its ancient course it not forsook.\nHow that may be if thou would'st think; within\nPond'ring, imagine Sion with this mount\nPlac'd on the earth, so that to both be one\nHorizon, and two hemispheres apart,\nWhere lies the path that Phaeton ill knew\nTo guide his erring chariot: thou wilt see\nHow of necessity by this on one\nHe passes, while by that on the' other side,\nIf with clear view shine intellect attend.\"\n\n\"Of truth, kind teacher!\"  I exclaim'd, \"so clear\nAught saw I never, as I now discern\nWhere seem'd my ken to fail, that the mid orb\nOf the supernal motion (which in terms\nOf art is called the Equator, and remains\nEver between the sun and winter) for the cause\nThou hast assign'd, from hence toward the north\nDeparts, when those who in the Hebrew land\nInhabit, see it tow'rds the warmer part.\nBut if it please thee, I would gladly know,\nHow far we have to journey: for the hill\nMounts higher, than this sight of mine can mount.\"\n\nHe thus to me: \"Such is this steep ascent,\nThat it is ever difficult at first,\nBut, more a man proceeds, less evil grows.\nWhen pleasant it shall seem to thee, so much\nThat upward going shall be easy to thee.\nAs in a vessel to go down the tide,\nThen of this path thou wilt have reach'd the end.\nThere hope to rest thee from thy toil.  No more\nI answer, and thus far for certain know.\"\nAs he his words had spoken, near to us\nA voice there sounded: \"Yet ye first perchance\nMay to repose you by constraint be led.\"\nAt sound thereof each turn'd, and on the left\nA huge stone we beheld, of which nor I\nNor he before was ware.  Thither we drew,\nfind there were some, who in the shady place\nBehind the rock were standing, as a man\nThru' idleness might stand.  Among them one,\nWho seem'd to me much wearied, sat him down,\nAnd with his arms did fold his knees about,\nHolding his face between them downward bent.\n\n\"Sweet Sir!\"  I cry'd, \"behold that man, who shows\nHimself more idle, than if laziness\nWere sister to him.\"  Straight he turn'd to us,\nAnd, o'er the thigh lifting his face, observ'd,\nThen in these accents spake: \"Up then, proceed\nThou valiant one.\"  Straight who it was I knew;\nNor could the pain I felt (for want of breath\nStill somewhat urg'd me) hinder my approach.\nAnd when I came to him, he scarce his head\nUplifted, saying \"Well hast thou discern'd,\nHow from the left the sun his chariot leads.\"\n\nHis lazy acts and broken words my lips\nTo laughter somewhat mov'd; when I began:\n\"Belacqua, now for thee I grieve no more.\nBut tell, why thou art seated upright there?\nWaitest thou escort to conduct thee hence?\nOr blame I only shine accustom'd ways?\"\nThen he: \"My brother, of what use to mount,\nWhen to my suffering would not let me pass\nThe bird of God, who at the portal sits?\nBehooves so long that heav'n first bear me round\nWithout its limits, as in life it bore,\nBecause I to the end repentant Sighs\nDelay'd, if prayer do not aid me first,\nThat riseth up from heart which lives in grace.\nWhat other kind avails, not heard in heaven?\"'\n\nBefore me now the Poet up the mount\nAscending, cried: \"Haste thee, for see the sun\nHas touch'd the point meridian, and the night\nNow covers with her foot Marocco's shore.\"\n\n\n\n\nCANTO V\n\nNow had I left those spirits, and pursued\nThe steps of my Conductor, when beheld\nPointing the finger at me one exclaim'd:\n\"See how it seems as if the light not shone\nFrom the left hand of him beneath, and he,\nAs living, seems to be led on.\"  Mine eyes\nI at that sound reverting, saw them gaze\nThrough wonder first at me, and then at me\nAnd the light broken underneath, by turns.\n\"Why are thy thoughts thus riveted?\"  my guide\nExclaim'd, \"that thou hast slack'd thy pace? or how\nImports it thee, what thing is whisper'd here?\nCome after me, and to their babblings leave\nThe crowd. Be as a tower, that, firmly set,\nShakes not its top for any blast that blows!\nHe, in whose bosom thought on thought shoots out,\nStill of his aim is wide, in that the one\nSicklies and wastes to nought the other's strength.\"\n\nWhat other could I answer save \"I come?\"\nI said it, somewhat with that colour ting'd\nWhich ofttimes pardon meriteth for man.\n\nMeanwhile traverse along the hill there came,\nA little way before us, some who sang\nThe \"Miserere\" in responsive Strains.\nWhen they perceiv'd that through my body I\nGave way not for the rays to pass, their song\nStraight to a long and hoarse exclaim they chang'd;\nAnd two of them, in guise of messengers,\nRan on to meet us, and inquiring ask'd:\n\"Of your condition we would gladly learn.\"\n\nTo them my guide.  \"Ye may return, and bear\nTidings to them who sent you, that his frame\nIs real flesh.  If, as I deem, to view\nHis shade they paus'd, enough is answer'd them.\nHim let them honour, they may prize him well.\"\n\nNe'er saw I fiery vapours with such speed\nCut through the serene air at fall of night,\nNor August's clouds athwart the setting sun,\nThat upward these did not in shorter space\nReturn; and, there arriving, with the rest\nWheel back on us, as with loose rein a troop.\n\n\"Many,\" exclaim'd the bard, \"are these, who throng\nAround us: to petition thee they come.\nGo therefore on, and listen as thou go'st.\"\n\n\"O spirit! who go'st on to blessedness\nWith the same limbs, that clad thee at thy birth.\"\nShouting they came, \"a little rest thy step.\nLook if thou any one amongst our tribe\nHast e'er beheld, that tidings of him there\nThou mayst report.  Ah, wherefore go'st thou on?\nAh wherefore tarriest thou not?  We all\nBy violence died, and to our latest hour\nWere sinners, but then warn'd by light from heav'n,\nSo that, repenting and forgiving, we\nDid issue out of life at peace with God,\nWho with desire to see him fills our heart.\"\n\nThen I: \"The visages of all I scan\nYet none of ye remember.  But if aught,\nThat I can do, may please you, gentle spirits!\nSpeak; and I will perform it, by that peace,\nWhich on the steps of guide so excellent\nFollowing from world to world intent I seek.\"\n\nIn answer he began: \"None here distrusts\nThy kindness, though not promis'd with an oath;\nSo as the will fail not for want of power.\nWhence I, who sole before the others speak,\nEntreat thee, if thou ever see that land,\nWhich lies between Romagna and the realm\nOf Charles, that of thy courtesy thou pray\nThose who inhabit Fano, that for me\nTheir adorations duly be put up,\nBy which I may purge off my grievous sins.\nFrom thence I came.  But the deep passages,\nWhence issued out the blood wherein I dwelt,\nUpon my bosom in Antenor's land\nWere made, where to be more secure I thought.\nThe author of the deed was Este's prince,\nWho, more than right could warrant, with his wrath\nPursued me.  Had I towards Mira fled,\nWhen overta'en at Oriaco, still\nMight I have breath'd. But to the marsh I sped,\nAnd in the mire and rushes tangled there\nFell, and beheld my life-blood float the plain.\"\n\nThen said another: \"Ah! so may the wish,\nThat takes thee o'er the mountain, be fulfill'd,\nAs thou shalt graciously give aid to mine.\nOf Montefeltro I; Buonconte I:\nGiovanna nor none else have care for me,\nSorrowing with these I therefore go.\"  I thus:\n\"From Campaldino's field what force or chance\nDrew thee, that ne'er thy sepulture was known?\"\n\n\"Oh!\"  answer'd he, \"at Casentino's foot\nA stream there courseth, nam'd Archiano, sprung\nIn Apennine above the Hermit's seat.\nE'en where its name is cancel'd, there came I,\nPierc'd in the heart, fleeing away on foot,\nAnd bloodying the plain.  Here sight and speech\nFail'd me, and finishing with Mary's name\nI fell, and tenantless my flesh remain'd.\nI will report the truth; which thou again\nTell to the living.  Me God's angel took,\nWhilst he of hell exclaim'd: \"O thou from heav'n!\nSay wherefore hast thou robb'd me?  Thou of him\nTh' eternal portion bear'st with thee away\nFor one poor tear that he deprives me of.\nBut of the other, other rule I make.\"\n\n\"Thou knowest how in the atmosphere collects\nThat vapour dank, returning into water,\nSoon as it mounts where cold condenses it.\nThat evil will, which in his intellect\nStill follows evil, came, and rais'd the wind\nAnd smoky mist, by virtue of the power\nGiven by his nature.  Thence the valley, soon\nAs day was spent, he cover'd o'er with cloud\nFrom Pratomagno to the mountain range,\nAnd stretch'd the sky above, so that the air\nImpregnate chang'd to water.  Fell the rain,\nAnd to the fosses came all that the land\nContain'd not; and, as mightiest streams are wont,\nTo the great river with such headlong sweep\nRush'd, that nought stay'd its course.  My stiffen'd frame\nLaid at his mouth the fell Archiano found,\nAnd dash'd it into Arno, from my breast\nLoos'ning the cross, that of myself I made\nWhen overcome with pain.  He hurl'd me on,\nAlong the banks and bottom of his course;\nThen in his muddy spoils encircling wrapt.\"\n\n\"Ah! when thou to the world shalt be return'd,\nAnd rested after thy long road,\" so spake\nNext the third spirit; \"then remember me.\nI once was Pia.  Sienna gave me life,\nMaremma took it from me.  That he knows,\nWho me with jewell'd ring had first espous'd.\"\n\n\nCANTO VI\n\nWhen from their game of dice men separate,\nHe, who hath lost, remains in sadness fix'd,\nRevolving in his mind, what luckless throws\nHe cast: but meanwhile all the company\nGo with the other; one before him runs,\nAnd one behind his mantle twitches, one\nFast by his side bids him remember him.\nHe stops not; and each one, to whom his hand\nIs stretch'd, well knows he bids him stand aside;\nAnd thus he from the press defends himself.\nE'en such was I in that close-crowding throng;\nAnd turning so my face around to all,\nAnd promising, I'scap'd from it with pains.\n\nHere of Arezzo him I saw, who fell\nBy Ghino's cruel arm; and him beside,\nWho in his chase was swallow'd by the stream.\nHere Frederic Novello, with his hand\nStretch'd forth, entreated; and of Pisa he,\nWho put the good Marzuco to such proof\nOf constancy.  Count Orso I beheld;\nAnd from its frame a soul dismiss'd for spite\nAnd envy, as it said, but for no crime:\nI speak of Peter de la Brosse; and here,\nWhile she yet lives, that Lady of Brabant\nLet her beware; lest for so false a deed\nShe herd with worse than these. When I was freed\nFrom all those spirits, who pray'd for others' prayers\nTo hasten on their state of blessedness;\nStraight I began: \"O thou, my luminary!\nIt seems expressly in thy text denied,\nThat heaven's supreme decree can never bend\nTo supplication; yet with this design\nDo these entreat.  Can then their hope be vain,\nOr is thy saying not to me reveal'd?\"\n\nHe thus to me: \"Both what I write is plain,\nAnd these deceiv'd not in their hope, if well\nThy mind consider, that the sacred height\nOf judgment doth not stoop, because love's flame\nIn a short moment all fulfils, which he\nWho sojourns here, in right should satisfy.\nBesides, when I this point concluded thus,\nBy praying no defect could be supplied;\nBecause the pray'r had none access to God.\nYet in this deep suspicion rest thou not\nContented unless she assure thee so,\nWho betwixt truth and mind infuses light.\nI know not if thou take me right; I mean\nBeatrice.  Her thou shalt behold above,\nUpon this mountain's crown, fair seat of joy.\"\n\nThen I: \"Sir! let us mend our speed; for now\nI tire not as before; and lo! the hill\nStretches its shadow far.\"  He answer'd thus:\n\"Our progress with this day shall be as much\nAs we may now dispatch; but otherwise\nThan thou supposest is the truth.  For there\nThou canst not be, ere thou once more behold\nHim back returning, who behind the steep\nIs now so hidden, that as erst his beam\nThou dost not break.  But lo! a spirit there\nStands solitary, and toward us looks:\nIt will instruct us in the speediest way.\"\n\nWe soon approach'd it.  O thou Lombard spirit!\nHow didst thou stand, in high abstracted mood,\nScarce moving with slow dignity thine eyes!\nIt spoke not aught, but let us onward pass,\nEyeing us as a lion on his watch.\nBut Virgil with entreaty mild advanc'd,\nRequesting it to show the best ascent.\nIt answer to his question none return'd,\nBut of our country and our kind of life\nDemanded.  When my courteous guide began,\n\"Mantua,\" the solitary shadow quick\nRose towards us from the place in which it stood,\nAnd cry'd, \"Mantuan! I am thy countryman\nSordello.\"  Each the other then embrac'd.\n\nAh slavish Italy! thou inn of grief,\nVessel without a pilot in loud storm,\nLady no longer of fair provinces,\nBut brothel-house impure! this gentle spirit,\nEv'n from the Pleasant sound of his dear land\nWas prompt to greet a fellow citizen\nWith such glad cheer; while now thy living ones\nIn thee abide not without war; and one\nMalicious gnaws another, ay of those\nWhom the same wall and the same moat contains,\nSeek, wretched one! around thy sea-coasts wide;\nThen homeward to thy bosom turn, and mark\nIf any part of the sweet peace enjoy.\nWhat boots it, that thy reins Justinian's hand\nBefitted, if thy saddle be unpress'd?\nNought doth he now but aggravate thy shame.\nAh people! thou obedient still shouldst live,\nAnd in the saddle let thy Caesar sit,\nIf well thou marked'st that which God commands.\n\nLook how that beast to felness hath relaps'd\nFrom having lost correction of the spur,\nSince to the bridle thou hast set thine hand,\nO German Albert! who abandon'st her,\nThat is grown savage and unmanageable,\nWhen thou should'st clasp her flanks with forked heels.\nJust judgment from the stars fall on thy blood!\nAnd be it strange and manifest to all!\nSuch as may strike thy successor with dread!\nFor that thy sire and thou have suffer'd thus,\nThrough greediness of yonder realms detain'd,\nThe garden of the empire to run waste.\nCome see the Capulets and Montagues,\nThe Philippeschi and Monaldi! man\nWho car'st for nought! those sunk in grief, and these\nWith dire suspicion rack'd. Come, cruel one!\nCome and behold the' oppression of the nobles,\nAnd mark their injuries: and thou mayst see.\nWhat safety Santafiore can supply.\nCome and behold thy Rome, who calls on thee,\nDesolate widow! day and night with moans:\n\"My Caesar, why dost thou desert my side?\"\nCome and behold what love among thy people:\nAnd if no pity touches thee for us,\nCome and blush for thine own report.  For me,\nIf it be lawful, O Almighty Power,\nWho wast in earth for our sakes crucified!\nAre thy just eyes turn'd elsewhere? or is this\nA preparation in the wond'rous depth\nOf thy sage counsel made, for some good end,\nEntirely from our reach of thought cut off?\nSo are the' Italian cities all o'erthrong'd\nWith tyrants, and a great Marcellus made\nOf every petty factious villager.\n\nMy Florence! thou mayst well remain unmov'd\nAt this digression, which affects not thee:\nThanks to thy people, who so wisely speed.\nMany have justice in their heart, that long\nWaiteth for counsel to direct the bow,\nOr ere it dart unto its aim: but shine\nHave it on their lip's edge.  Many refuse\nTo bear the common burdens: readier thine\nAnswer uneall'd, and cry, \"Behold I stoop!\"\n\nMake thyself glad, for thou hast reason now,\nThou wealthy! thou at peace! thou wisdom-fraught!\nFacts best witness if I speak the truth.\nAthens and Lacedaemon, who of old\nEnacted laws, for civil arts renown'd,\nMade little progress in improving life\nTow'rds thee, who usest such nice subtlety,\nThat to the middle of November scarce\nReaches the thread thou in October weav'st.\nHow many times, within thy memory,\nCustoms, and laws, and coins, and offices\nHave been by thee renew'd, and people chang'd!\n\nIf thou remember'st well and can'st see clear,\nThou wilt perceive thyself like a sick wretch,\nWho finds no rest upon her down, but oft\nShifting her side, short respite seeks from pain.\n\n\n\n\nCANTO VII\n\nAfter their courteous greetings joyfully\nSev'n times exchang'd, Sordello backward drew\nExclaiming, \"Who are ye?\"  \"Before this mount\nBy spirits worthy of ascent to God\nWas sought, my bones had by Octavius' care\nBeen buried.  I am Virgil, for no sin\nDepriv'd of heav'n, except for lack of faith.\"\n\nSo answer'd him in few my gentle guide.\n\nAs one, who aught before him suddenly\nBeholding, whence his wonder riseth, cries\n\"It is yet is not,\" wav'ring in belief;\nSuch he appear'd; then downward bent his eyes,\nAnd drawing near with reverential step,\nCaught him, where of mean estate might clasp\nHis lord.  \"Glory of Latium!\" he exclaim'd,\n\"In whom our tongue its utmost power display'd!\nBoast of my honor'd birth-place! what desert\nOf mine, what favour rather undeserv'd,\nShows thee to me?  If I to hear that voice\nAm worthy, say if from below thou com'st\nAnd from what cloister's pale?\"--\"Through every orb\nOf that sad region,\" he reply'd, \"thus far\nAm I arriv'd, by heav'nly influence led\nAnd with such aid I come.  There is a place\nThere underneath, not made by torments sad,\nBut by dun shades alone; where mourning's voice\nSounds not of anguish sharp, but breathes in sighs.\n\n\"There I with little innocents abide,\nWho by death's fangs were bitten, ere exempt\nFrom human taint.  There I with those abide,\nWho the three holy virtues put not on,\nBut understood the rest, and without blame\nFollow'd them all.  But if thou know'st and canst,\nDirect us, how we soonest may arrive,\nWhere Purgatory its true beginning takes.\"\n\nHe answer'd thus: \"We have no certain place\nAssign'd us: upwards I may go or round,\nFar as I can, I join thee for thy guide.\nBut thou beholdest now how day declines:\nAnd upwards to proceed by night, our power\nExcels: therefore it may be well to choose\nA place of pleasant sojourn.  To the right\nSome spirits sit apart retir'd.  If thou\nConsentest, I to these will lead thy steps:\nAnd thou wilt know them, not without delight.\"\n\n\"How chances this?\"  was answer'd; \"who so wish'd\nTo ascend by night, would he be thence debarr'd\nBy other, or through his own weakness fail?\"\n\nThe good Sordello then, along the ground\nTrailing his finger, spoke: \"Only this line\nThou shalt not overpass, soon as the sun\nHath disappear'd; not that aught else impedes\nThy going upwards, save the shades of night.\nThese with the wont of power perplex the will.\nWith them thou haply mightst return beneath,\nOr to and fro around the mountain's side\nWander, while day is in the horizon shut.\"\n\nMy master straight, as wond'ring at his speech,\nExclaim'd: \"Then lead us quickly, where thou sayst,\nThat, while we stay, we may enjoy delight.\"\n\nA little space we were remov'd from thence,\nWhen I perceiv'd the mountain hollow'd out.\nEv'n as large valleys hollow'd out on earth,\n\n\"That way,\" the' escorting spirit cried, \"we go,\nWhere in a bosom the high bank recedes:\nAnd thou await renewal of the day.\"\n\nBetwixt the steep and plain a crooked path\nLed us traverse into the ridge's side,\nWhere more than half the sloping edge expires.\nRefulgent gold, and silver thrice refin'd,\nAnd scarlet grain and ceruse, Indian wood\nOf lucid dye serene, fresh emeralds\nBut newly broken, by the herbs and flowers\nPlac'd in that fair recess, in color all\nHad been surpass'd, as great surpasses less.\nNor nature only there lavish'd her hues,\nBut of the sweetness of a thousand smells\nA rare and undistinguish'd fragrance made.\n\n\"Salve Regina,\" on the grass and flowers\nHere chanting I beheld those spirits sit\nWho not beyond the valley could be seen.\n\n\"Before the west'ring sun sink to his bed,\"\nBegan the Mantuan, who our steps had turn'd,\n\n\"'Mid those desires not that I lead ye on.\nFor from this eminence ye shall discern\nBetter the acts and visages of all,\nThan in the nether vale among them mix'd.\nHe, who sits high above the rest, and seems\nTo have neglected that he should have done,\nAnd to the others' song moves not his lip,\nThe Emperor Rodolph call, who might have heal'd\nThe wounds whereof fair Italy hath died,\nSo that by others she revives but slowly,\nHe, who with kindly visage comforts him,\nSway'd in that country, where the water springs,\nThat Moldaw's river to the Elbe, and Elbe\nRolls to the ocean: Ottocar his name:\nWho in his swaddling clothes was of more worth\nThan Winceslaus his son, a bearded man,\nPamper'd with rank luxuriousness and ease.\nAnd that one with the nose depress, who close\nIn counsel seems with him of gentle look,\nFlying expir'd, with'ring the lily's flower.\nLook there how he doth knock against his breast!\nThe other ye behold, who for his cheek\nMakes of one hand a couch, with frequent sighs.\nThey are the father and the father-in-law\nOf Gallia's bane: his vicious life they know\nAnd foul; thence comes the grief that rends them thus.\n\n\"He, so robust of limb, who measure keeps\nIn song, with him of feature prominent,\nWith ev'ry virtue bore his girdle brac'd.\nAnd if that stripling who behinds him sits,\nKing after him had liv'd, his virtue then\nFrom vessel to like vessel had been pour'd;\nWhich may not of the other heirs be said.\nBy James and Frederick his realms are held;\nNeither the better heritage obtains.\nRarely into the branches of the tree\nDoth human worth mount up; and so ordains\nHe who bestows it, that as his free gift\nIt may be call'd.  To Charles my words apply\nNo less than to his brother in the song;\nWhich Pouille and Provence now with grief confess.\nSo much that plant degenerates from its seed,\nAs more than Beatrice and Margaret\nCostanza still boasts of her valorous spouse.\n\n\"Behold the king of simple life and plain,\nHarry of England, sitting there alone:\nHe through his branches better issue spreads.\n\n\"That one, who on the ground beneath the rest\nSits lowest, yet his gaze directs aloft,\nUs William, that brave Marquis, for whose cause\nThe deed of Alexandria and his war\nMakes Conferrat and Canavese weep.\"\n\n\n\n\nCANTO VIII\n\nNow was the hour that wakens fond desire\nIn men at sea, and melts their thoughtful heart,\nWho in the morn have bid sweet friends farewell,\nAnd pilgrim newly on his road with love\nThrills, if he hear the vesper bell from far,\nThat seems to mourn for the expiring day:\nWhen I, no longer taking heed to hear\nBegan, with wonder, from those spirits to mark\nOne risen from its seat, which with its hand\nAudience implor'd. Both palms it join'd and rais'd,\nFixing its steadfast gaze towards the east,\nAs telling God, \"I care for naught beside.\"\n\n\"Te Lucis Ante,\" so devoutly then\nCame from its lip, and in so soft a strain,\nThat all my sense in ravishment was lost.\nAnd the rest after, softly and devout,\nFollow'd through all the hymn, with upward gaze\nDirected to the bright supernal wheels.\n\nHere, reader! for the truth makes thine eyes keen:\nFor of so subtle texture is this veil,\nThat thou with ease mayst pass it through unmark'd.\n\nI saw that gentle band silently next\nLook up, as if in expectation held,\nPale and in lowly guise; and from on high\nI saw forth issuing descend beneath\nTwo angels with two flame-illumin'd swords,\nBroken and mutilated at their points.\nGreen as the tender leaves but newly born,\nTheir vesture was, the which by wings as green\nBeaten, they drew behind them, fann'd in air.\nA little over us one took his stand,\nThe other lighted on the' Opposing hill,\nSo that the troop were in the midst contain'd.\n\nWell I descried the whiteness on their heads;\nBut in their visages the dazzled eye\nWas lost, as faculty that by too much\nIs overpower'd.  \"From Mary's bosom both\nAre come,\" exclaim'd Sordello, \"as a guard\nOver the vale, ganst him, who hither tends,\nThe serpent.\"  Whence, not knowing by which path\nHe came, I turn'd me round, and closely press'd,\nAll frozen, to my leader's trusted side.\n\nSordello paus'd not: \"To the valley now\n(For it is time) let us descend; and hold\nConverse with those great shadows: haply much\nTheir sight may please ye.\"  Only three steps down\nMethinks I measur'd, ere I was beneath,\nAnd noted one who look'd as with desire\nTo know me.  Time was now that air arrow dim;\nYet not so dim, that 'twixt his eyes and mine\nIt clear'd not up what was conceal'd before.\nMutually tow'rds each other we advanc'd.\nNino, thou courteous judge! what joy I felt,\nWhen I perceiv'd thou wert not with the bad!\n\nNo salutation kind on either part\nWas left unsaid.  He then inquir'd: \"How long\nSince thou arrived'st at the mountain's foot,\nOver the distant waves?\"--\"O!\" answer'd I,\n\"Through the sad seats of woe this morn I came,\nAnd still in my first life, thus journeying on,\nThe other strive to gain.\"  Soon as they heard\nMy words, he and Sordello backward drew,\nAs suddenly amaz'd.  To Virgil one,\nThe other to a spirit turn'd, who near\nWas seated, crying: \"Conrad! up with speed:\nCome, see what of his grace high God hath will'd.\"\nThen turning round to me: \"By that rare mark\nOf honour which thou ow'st to him, who hides\nSo deeply his first cause, it hath no ford,\nWhen thou shalt be beyond the vast of waves.\nTell my Giovanna, that for me she call\nThere, where reply to innocence is made.\nHer mother, I believe, loves me no more;\nSince she has chang'd the white and wimpled folds,\nWhich she is doom'd once more with grief to wish.\nBy her it easily may be perceiv'd,\nHow long in women lasts the flame of love,\nIf sight and touch do not relume it oft.\nFor her so fair a burial will not make\nThe viper which calls Milan to the field,\nAs had been made by shrill Gallura's bird.\"\n\nHe spoke, and in his visage took the stamp\nOf that right seal, which with due temperature\nGlows in the bosom.  My insatiate eyes\nMeanwhile to heav'n had travel'd, even there\nWhere the bright stars are slowest, as a wheel\nNearest the axle; when my guide inquir'd:\n\"What there aloft, my son, has caught thy gaze?\"\n\nI answer'd: \"The three torches, with which here\nThe pole is all on fire.\"  He then to me:\n\"The four resplendent stars, thou saw'st this morn\nAre there beneath, and these ris'n in their stead.\"\n\nWhile yet he spoke.  Sordello to himself\nDrew him, and cry'd: \"Lo there our enemy!\"\nAnd with his hand pointed that way to look.\n\nAlong the side, where barrier none arose\nAround the little vale, a serpent lay,\nSuch haply as gave Eve the bitter food.\nBetween the grass and flowers, the evil snake\nCame on, reverting oft his lifted head;\nAnd, as a beast that smoothes its polish'd coat,\nLicking his hack.  I saw not, nor can tell,\nHow those celestial falcons from their seat\nMov'd, but in motion each one well descried,\nHearing the air cut by their verdant plumes.\nThe serpent fled; and to their stations back\nThe angels up return'd with equal flight.\n\nThe Spirit (who to Nino, when he call'd,\nHad come), from viewing me with fixed ken,\nThrough all that conflict, loosen'd not his sight.\n\n\"So may the lamp, which leads thee up on high,\nFind, in thy destin'd lot, of wax so much,\nAs may suffice thee to the enamel's height.\"\nIt thus began: \"If any certain news\nOf Valdimagra and the neighbour part\nThou know'st, tell me, who once was mighty there\nThey call'd me Conrad Malaspina, not\nThat old one, but from him I sprang.  The love\nI bore my people is now here refin'd.\"\n\n\"In your dominions,\" I answer'd, \"ne'er was I.\nBut through all Europe where do those men dwell,\nTo whom their glory is not manifest?\nThe fame, that honours your illustrious house,\nProclaims the nobles and proclaims the land;\nSo that he knows it who was never there.\nI swear to you, so may my upward route\nProsper! your honour'd nation not impairs\nThe value of her coffer and her sword.\nNature and use give her such privilege,\nThat while the world is twisted from his course\nBy a bad head, she only walks aright,\nAnd has the evil way in scorn.\"  He then:\n\"Now pass thee on: sev'n times the tired sun\nRevisits not the couch, which with four feet\nThe forked Aries covers, ere that kind\nOpinion shall be nail'd into thy brain\nWith stronger nails than other's speech can drive,\nIf the sure course of judgment be not stay'd.\"\n\n\n\n\nCANTO IX\n\nNow the fair consort of Tithonus old,\nArisen from her mate's beloved arms,\nLook'd palely o'er the eastern cliff: her brow,\nLucent with jewels, glitter'd, set in sign\nOf that chill animal, who with his train\nSmites fearful nations: and where then we were,\nTwo steps of her ascent the night had past,\nAnd now the third was closing up its wing,\nWhen I, who had so much of Adam with me,\nSank down upon the grass, o'ercome with sleep,\nThere where all five were seated.  In that hour,\nWhen near the dawn the swallow her sad lay,\nRememb'ring haply ancient grief, renews,\nAnd with our minds more wand'rers from the flesh,\nAnd less by thought restrain'd are, as 't were, full\nOf holy divination in their dreams,\nThen in a vision did I seem to view\nA golden-feather'd eagle in the sky,\nWith open wings, and hov'ring for descent,\nAnd I was in that place, methought, from whence\nYoung Ganymede, from his associates'reft,\nWas snatch'd aloft to the high consistory.\n\"Perhaps,\" thought I within me, \"here alone\nHe strikes his quarry, and elsewhere disdains\nTo pounce upon the prey.\"  Therewith, it seem'd,\nA little wheeling in his airy tour\nTerrible as the lightning rush'd he down,\nAnd snatch'd me upward even to the fire.\n\nThere both, I thought, the eagle and myself\nDid burn; and so intense th' imagin'd flames,\nThat needs my sleep was broken off.  As erst\nAchilles shook himself, and round him roll'd\nHis waken'd eyeballs wond'ring where he was,\nWhenas his mother had from Chiron fled\nTo Scyros, with him sleeping in her arms;\nE'en thus I shook me, soon as from my face\nThe slumber parted, turning deadly pale,\nLike one ice-struck with dread.  Solo at my side\nMy comfort stood: and the bright sun was now\nMore than two hours aloft: and to the sea\nMy looks were turn'd.  \"Fear not,\" my master cried,\n\"Assur'd we are at happy point.  Thy strength\nShrink not, but rise dilated.  Thou art come\nTo Purgatory now.  Lo! there the cliff\nThat circling bounds it!  Lo! the entrance there,\nWhere it doth seem disparted! re the dawn\nUsher'd the daylight, when thy wearied soul\nSlept in thee, o'er the flowery vale beneath\nA lady came, and thus bespake me: \"I\nAm Lucia.  Suffer me to take this man,\nWho slumbers.  Easier so his way shall speed.\"\nSordello and the other gentle shapes\nTarrying, she bare thee up: and, as day shone,\nThis summit reach'd: and I pursued her steps.\nHere did she place thee.  First her lovely eyes\nThat open entrance show'd me; then at once\nShe vanish'd with thy sleep.  Like one, whose doubts\nAre chas'd by certainty, and terror turn'd\nTo comfort on discovery of the truth,\nSuch was the change in me: and as my guide\nBeheld me fearless, up along the cliff\nHe mov'd, and I behind him, towards the height.\n\nReader! thou markest how my theme doth rise,\nNor wonder therefore, if more artfully\nI prop the structure! nearer now we drew,\nArriv'd' whence in that part, where first a breach\nAs of a wall appear'd, I could descry\nA portal, and three steps beneath, that led\nFor inlet there, of different colour each,\nAnd one who watch'd, but spake not yet a word.\nAs more and more mine eye did stretch its view,\nI mark'd him seated on the highest step,\nIn visage such, as past my power to bear.\n\nGrasp'd in his hand a naked sword, glanc'd back\nThe rays so toward me, that I oft in vain\nMy sight directed.  \"Speak from whence ye stand:\"\nHe cried: \"What would ye?  Where is your escort?\nTake heed your coming upward harm ye not.\"\n\n\"A heavenly dame, not skilless of these things,\"\nReplied the' instructor, \"told us, even now,\n\"Pass that way: here the gate is.\" --\"And may she\nBefriending prosper your ascent,\" resum'd\nThe courteous keeper of the gate: \"Come then\nBefore our steps.\"  We straightway thither came.\n\nThe lowest stair was marble white so smooth\nAnd polish'd, that therein my mirror'd form\nDistinct I saw.  The next of hue more dark\nThan sablest grain, a rough and singed block,\nCrack'd lengthwise and across.  The third, that lay\nMassy above, seem'd porphyry, that flam'd\nRed as the life-blood spouting from a vein.\nOn this God's angel either foot sustain'd,\nUpon the threshold seated, which appear'd\nA rock of diamond.  Up the trinal steps\nMy leader cheerily drew me.  \"Ask,\" said he,\n\n\"With humble heart, that he unbar the bolt.\"\n\nPiously at his holy feet devolv'd\nI cast me, praying him for pity's sake\nThat he would open to me: but first fell\nThrice on my bosom prostrate.  Seven times\nThe letter, that denotes the inward stain,\nHe on my forehead with the blunted point\nOf his drawn sword inscrib'd.  And \"Look,\" he cried,\n\"When enter'd, that thou wash these scars away.\"\n\nAshes, or earth ta'en dry out of the ground,\nWere of one colour with the robe he wore.\nFrom underneath that vestment forth he drew\nTwo keys of metal twain: the one was gold,\nIts fellow silver.  With the pallid first,\nAnd next the burnish'd, he so ply'd the gate,\nAs to content me well.  \"Whenever one\nFaileth of these, that in the keyhole straight\nIt turn not, to this alley then expect\nAccess in vain.\"  Such were the words he spake.\n\"One is more precious: but the other needs\nSkill and sagacity, large share of each,\nEre its good task to disengage the knot\nBe worthily perform'd.  From Peter these\nI hold, of him instructed, that I err\nRather in opening than in keeping fast;\nSo but the suppliant at my feet implore.\"\n\nThen of that hallow'd gate he thrust the door,\nExclaiming, \"Enter, but this warning hear:\nHe forth again departs who looks behind.\"\n\nAs in the hinges of that sacred ward\nThe swivels turn'd, sonorous metal strong,\nHarsh was the grating; nor so surlily\nRoar'd the Tarpeian, when by force bereft\nOf good Metellus, thenceforth from his loss\nTo leanness doom'd.  Attentively I turn'd,\nList'ning the thunder, that first issued forth;\nAnd \"We praise thee, O God,\" methought I heard\nIn accents blended with sweet melody.\nThe strains came o'er mine ear, e'en as the sound\nOf choral voices, that in solemn chant\nWith organ mingle, and, now high and clear,\nCome swelling, now float indistinct away.\n\n\n\n\nCANTO X\n\nWhen we had passed the threshold of the gate\n(Which the soul's ill affection doth disuse,\nMaking the crooked seem the straighter path),\nI heard its closing sound.  Had mine eyes turn'd,\nFor that offence what plea might have avail'd?\n\nWe mounted up the riven rock, that wound\nOn either side alternate, as the wave\nFlies and advances.  \"Here some little art\nBehooves us,\" said my leader, \"that our steps\nObserve the varying flexure of the path.\"\n\nThus we so slowly sped, that with cleft orb\nThe moon once more o'erhangs her wat'ry couch,\nEre we that strait have threaded.  But when free\nWe came and open, where the mount above\nOne solid mass retires, I spent, with toil,\nAnd both, uncertain of the way, we stood,\nUpon a plain more lonesome, than the roads\nThat traverse desert wilds.  From whence the brink\nBorders upon vacuity, to foot\nOf the steep bank, that rises still, the space\nHad measur'd thrice the stature of a man:\nAnd, distant as mine eye could wing its flight,\nTo leftward now and now to right dispatch'd,\nThat cornice equal in extent appear'd.\n\nNot yet our feet had on that summit mov'd,\nWhen I discover'd that the bank around,\nWhose proud uprising all ascent denied,\nWas marble white, and so exactly wrought\nWith quaintest sculpture, that not there alone\nHad Polycletus, but e'en nature's self\nBeen sham'd.  The angel who came down to earth\nWith tidings of the peace so many years\nWept for in vain, that op'd the heavenly gates\nFrom their long interdict, before us seem'd,\nIn a sweet act, so sculptur'd to the life,\nHe look'd no silent image. One had sworn\nHe had said, \"Hail!\" for she was imag'd there,\nBy whom the key did open to God's love,\nAnd in her act as sensibly impress\nThat word, \"Behold the handmaid of the Lord,\"\nAs figure seal'd on wax.  \"Fix not thy mind\nOn one place only,\" said the guide belov'd,\nWho had me near him on that part where lies\nThe heart of man.  My sight forthwith I turn'd\nAnd mark'd, behind the virgin mother's form,\nUpon that side, where he, that mov'd me, stood,\nAnother story graven on the rock.\n\nI passed athwart the bard, and drew me near,\nThat it might stand more aptly for my view.\nThere in the self-same marble were engrav'd\nThe cart and kine, drawing the sacred ark,\nThat from unbidden office awes mankind.\nBefore it came much people; and the whole\nParted in seven quires.  One sense cried, \"Nay,\"\nAnother, \"Yes, they sing.\"  Like doubt arose\nBetwixt the eye and smell, from the curl'd fume\nOf incense breathing up the well-wrought toil.\nPreceding the blest vessel, onward came\nWith light dance leaping, girt in humble guise,\nSweet Israel's harper: in that hap he seem'd\nLess and yet more than kingly.  Opposite,\nAt a great palace, from the lattice forth\nLook'd Michol, like a lady full of scorn\nAnd sorrow.  To behold the tablet next,\nWhich at the hack of Michol whitely shone,\nI mov'd me.  There was storied on the rock\nThe' exalted glory of the Roman prince,\nWhose mighty worth mov'd Gregory to earn\nHis mighty conquest, Trajan th' Emperor.\nA widow at his bridle stood, attir'd\nIn tears and mourning.  Round about them troop'd\nFull throng of knights, and overhead in gold\nThe eagles floated, struggling with the wind.\n\nThe wretch appear'd amid all these to say:\n\"Grant vengeance, sire! for, woe beshrew this heart\nMy son is murder'd.\"  He replying seem'd;\n\n\"Wait now till I return.\" And she, as one\nMade hasty by her grief; \"O sire, if thou\nDost not return?\"--\"Where I am, who then is,\nMay right thee.\"--\"What to thee is other's good,\nIf thou neglect thy own?\"--\"Now comfort thee,\"\nAt length he answers.  \"It beseemeth well\nMy duty be perform'd, ere I move hence:\nSo justice wills; and pity bids me stay.\"\n\nHe, whose ken nothing new surveys, produc'd\nThat visible speaking, new to us and strange\nThe like not found on earth.  Fondly I gaz'd\nUpon those patterns of meek humbleness,\nShapes yet more precious for their artist's sake,\nWhen \"Lo,\" the poet whisper'd, \"where this way\n(But slack their pace), a multitude advance.\nThese to the lofty steps shall guide us on.\"\n\nMine eyes, though bent on view of novel sights\nTheir lov'd allurement, were not slow to turn.\n\nReader! would not that amaz'd thou miss\nOf thy good purpose, hearing how just God\nDecrees our debts be cancel'd.  Ponder not\nThe form of suff'ring.  Think on what succeeds,\nThink that at worst beyond the mighty doom\nIt cannot pass.  \"Instructor,\" I began,\n\"What I see hither tending, bears no trace\nOf human semblance, nor of aught beside\nThat my foil'd sight can guess.\"  He answering thus:\n\"So courb'd to earth, beneath their heavy teems\nOf torment stoop they, that mine eye at first\nStruggled as thine.  But look intently thither,\nAn disentangle with thy lab'ring view,\nWhat underneath those stones approacheth: now,\nE'en now, mayst thou discern the pangs of each.\"\n\nChristians and proud! poor and wretched ones!\nThat feeble in the mind's eye, lean your trust\nUpon unstaid perverseness! now ye not\nThat we are worms, yet made at last to form\nThe winged insect, imp'd with angel plumes\nThat to heaven's justice unobstructed soars?\nWhy buoy ye up aloft your unfleg'd souls?\nAbortive then and shapeless ye remain,\nLike the untimely embryon of a worm!\n\nAs, to support incumbent floor or roof,\nFor corbel is a figure sometimes seen,\nThat crumples up its knees unto its breast,\nWith the feign'd posture stirring ruth unfeign'd\nIn the beholder's fancy; so I saw\nThese fashion'd, when I noted well their guise.\n\nEach, as his back was laden, came indeed\nOr more or less contract; but it appear'd\nAs he, who show'd most patience in his look,\nWailing exclaim'd: \"I can endure no more.\"\n\n\n\n\nCANTO XI\n\n\"O thou Almighty Father, who dost make\nThe heavens thy dwelling, not in bounds confin'd,\nBut that with love intenser there thou view'st\nThy primal effluence, hallow'd be thy name:\nJoin each created being to extol\nThy might, for worthy humblest thanks and praise\nIs thy blest Spirit.

Grant us this day\nOur daily manna, without which he roams\nThrough this rough desert retrograde, who most\nToils to advance his steps.  As we to each\nPardon the evil done us, pardon thou\nBenign, and of our merit take no count.\n'Gainst the old adversary prove thou not\nOur virtue easily subdu'd; but free\nFrom his incitements and defeat his wiles.\nThis last petition, dearest Lord! is made\nNot for ourselves, since that were needless now,\nBut for their sakes who after us remain.\"\n\nThus for themselves and us good speed imploring,\nThose spirits went beneath a weight like that\nWe sometimes feel in dreams, all, sore beset,\nBut with unequal anguish, wearied all,\nRound the first circuit, purging as they go,\nThe world's gross darkness off: In our behalf\nIf there vows still be offer'd, what can here\nFor them be vow'd and done by such, whose wills\nHave root of goodness in them?  Well beseems\nThat we should help them wash away the stains\nThey carried hence, that so made pure and light,\nThey may spring upward to the starry spheres.\n\n\"Ah! so may mercy-temper'd justice rid\nYour burdens speedily, that ye have power\nTo stretch your wing, which e'en to your desire\nShall lift you, as ye show us on which hand\nToward the ladder leads the shortest way.\nAnd if there be more passages than one,\nInstruct us of that easiest to ascend;\nFor this man who comes with me, and bears yet\nThe charge of fleshly raiment Adam left him,\nDespite his better will but slowly mounts.\"\nFrom whom the answer came unto these words,\nWhich my guide spake, appear'd not; but 'twas said:\n\n\"Along the bank to rightward come with us,\nAnd ye shall find a pass that mocks not toil\nOf living man to climb: and were it not\nThat I am hinder'd by the rock, wherewith\nThis arrogant neck is tam'd, whence needs I stoop\nMy visage to the ground, him, who yet lives,\nWhose name thou speak'st not him I fain would view.\nTo mark if e'er I knew himnd to crave\nHis pity for the fardel that I bear.\nI was of Latiun,  of a Tuscan horn\nA mighty one: Aldobranlesco's name\nMy sire's, I know not if ye e'er have heard.\nMy old blood and forefathers' gallant deeds\nMade me so haughty, that I clean forgot\nThe common mother, and to such excess,\nWax'd in my scorn of all men, that I fell,\nFell therefore; by what fate Sienna's sons,\nEach child in Campagnatico, can tell.\nI am Omberto; not me only pride\nHath injur'd, but my kindred all involv'd\nIn mischief with her.  Here my lot ordains\nUnder this weight to groan, till I appease\nGod's angry justice, since I did it not\nAmongst the living, here amongst the dead.\"\n\nList'ning I bent my visage down: and one\n(Not he who spake) twisted beneath the weight\nThat urg'd him, saw me, knew me straight, and call'd,\nHolding his eyes With difficulty fix'd\nIntent upon me, stooping as I went\nCompanion of their way.  \"O!\"  I exclaim'd,\n\n\"Art thou not Oderigi, art not thou\nAgobbio's glory, glory of that art\nWhich they of Paris call the limmer's skill?\"\n\n\"Brother!\" said he, \"with tints that gayer smile,\nBolognian Franco's pencil lines the leaves.\nHis all the honour now; mine borrow'd light.\nIn truth I had not been thus courteous to him,\nThe whilst I liv'd, through eagerness of zeal\nFor that pre-eminence my heart was bent on.\nHere of such pride the forfeiture is paid.\nNor were I even here; if, able still\nTo sin, I had not turn'd me unto God.\nO powers of man! how vain your glory, nipp'd\nE'en in its height of verdure, if an age\nLess bright succeed not! imbue thought\nTo lord it over painting's field; and now\nThe cry is Giotto's, and his name eclips'd.\nThus hath one Guido from the other snatch'd\nThe letter'd prize: and he perhaps is born,\nWho shall drive either from their nest.  The noise\nOf worldly fame is but a blast of wind,\nThat blows from divers points, and shifts its name\nShifting the point it blows from.  Shalt thou more\nLive in the mouths of mankind, if thy flesh\nPart shrivel'd from thee, than if thou hadst died,\nBefore the coral and the pap were left,\nOr ere some thousand years have passed? and that\nIs, to eternity compar'd, a space,\nBriefer than is the twinkling of an eye\nTo the heaven's slowest orb.  He there who treads\nSo leisurely before me, far and wide\nThrough Tuscany resounded once; and now\nIs in Sienna scarce with whispers nam'd:\nThere was he sov'reign, when destruction caught\nThe madd'ning rage of Florence, in that day\nProud as she now is loathsome.  Your renown\nIs as the herb, whose hue doth come and go,\nAnd his might withers it, by whom it sprang\nCrude from the lap of earth.\"  I thus to him:\n\"True are thy sayings: to my heart they breathe\nThe kindly spirit of meekness, and allay\nWhat tumours rankle there.  But who is he\nOf whom thou spak'st but now?\"--\"This,\" he replied,\n\"Is Provenzano.  He is here, because\nHe reach'd, with grasp presumptuous, at the sway\nOf all Sienna.  Thus he still hath gone,\nThus goeth never-resting, since he died.\nSuch is th' acquittance render'd back of him,\nWho, beyond measure, dar'd on earth.\"  I then:\n\"If soul that to the verge of life delays\nRepentance, linger in that lower space,\nNor hither mount, unless good prayers befriend,\nHow chanc'd admittance was vouchsaf'd to him?\"\n\n\"When at his glory's topmost height,\" said he,\n\"Respect of dignity all cast aside,\nFreely He fix'd him on Sienna's plain,\nA suitor to  redeem his suff'ring friend,\nWho languish'd in the prison-house of Charles,\nNor for his sake refus'd through every vein\nTo tremble.  More I will not say; and dark,\nI know, my words are, but thy neighbours soon\nShall help thee to a comment on the text.\nThis is the work, that from these limits freed him.\"\n\n\n\n\nCANTO XII\n\nWith equal pace as oxen in the yoke,\nI with that laden spirit journey'd on\nLong as the mild instructor suffer'd me;\nBut when he bade me quit him, and proceed\n(For \"here,\" said he, \"behooves with sail and oars\nEach man, as best he may, push on his bark\"),\nUpright, as one dispos'd for speed, I rais'd\nMy body, still in thought submissive bow'd.\n\nI now my leader's track not loth pursued;\nAnd each had shown how light we far'd along\nWhen thus he warn'd me: \"Bend thine eyesight down:\nFor thou to ease the way shall find it good\nTo ruminate the bed beneath thy feet.\"\n\nAs in memorial of the buried, drawn\nUpon earth-level tombs, the sculptur'd form\nOf what was once, appears (at sight whereof\nTears often stream forth by remembrance wak'd,\nWhose sacred stings the piteous only feel),\nSo saw I there, but with more curious skill\nOf portraiture o'erwrought, whate'er of space\nFrom forth the mountain stretches.  On one part\nHim I beheld, above all creatures erst\nCreated noblest, light'ning fall from heaven:\nOn th' other side with bolt celestial pierc'd\nBriareus: cumb'ring earth he lay through dint\nOf mortal ice-stroke.  The Thymbraean god\nWith Mars, I saw, and Pallas, round their sire,\nArm'd still, and gazing on the giant's limbs\nStrewn o'er th' ethereal field.  Nimrod I saw:\nAt foot of the stupendous work he stood,\nAs if bewilder'd, looking on the crowd\nLeagued in his proud attempt on Sennaar's plain.\n\nO Niobe! in what a trance of woe\nThee I beheld, upon that highway drawn,\nSev'n sons on either side thee slain!  Saul!\nHow ghastly didst thou look! on thine own sword\nExpiring in Gilboa, from that hour\nNe'er visited with rain from heav'n or dew!\n\nO fond Arachne! thee I also saw\nHalf spider now in anguish crawling up\nTh' unfinish'd web thou weaved'st to thy bane!\n\nO Rehoboam! here thy shape doth seem\nLouring no more defiance! but fear-smote\nWith none to chase him in his chariot whirl'd.\n\nWas shown beside upon the solid floor\nHow dear Alcmaeon forc'd his mother rate\nThat ornament in evil hour receiv'd:\nHow in the temple on Sennacherib fell\nHis sons, and how a corpse they left him there.\nWas shown the scath and cruel mangling made\nBy Tomyris on Cyrus, when she cried:\n\"Blood thou didst thirst for, take thy fill of blood!\"\nWas shown how routed in the battle fled\nTh' Assyrians, Holofernes slain, and e'en\nThe relics of the carnage.  Troy I mark'd\nIn ashes and in caverns.  Oh! how fall'n,\nHow abject, Ilion, was thy semblance there!\n\nWhat master of the pencil or the style\nHad trac'd the shades and lines, that might have made\nThe subtlest workman wonder?  Dead the dead,\nThe living seem'd alive; with clearer view\nHis eye beheld not who beheld the truth,\nThan mine what I did tread on, while I went\nLow bending.  Now swell out; and with stiff necks\nPass on, ye sons of Eve! veil not your looks,\nLest they descry the evil of your path!\n\nI noted not (so busied was my thought)\nHow much we now had circled of the mount,\nAnd of his course yet more the sun had spent,\nWhen he, who with still wakeful caution went,\nAdmonish'd: \"Raise thou up thy head: for know\nTime is not now for slow suspense.  Behold\nThat way an angel hasting towards us!  Lo!\nWhere duly the sixth handmaid doth return\nFrom service on the day.  Wear thou in look\nAnd gesture seemly grace of reverent awe,\nThat gladly he may forward us aloft.\nConsider that this day ne'er dawns again.\"\n\nTime's loss he had so often warn'd me 'gainst,\nI could not miss the scope at which he aim'd.\n\nThe goodly shape approach'd us, snowy white\nIn vesture, and with visage casting streams\nOf tremulous lustre like the matin star.\nHis arms he open'd, then his wings; and spake:\n\"Onward: the steps, behold! are near; and now\nTh' ascent is without difficulty gain'd.\"\n\nA scanty few are they, who when they hear\nSuch tidings, hasten.  O ye race of men\nThough born to soar, why suffer ye a wind\nSo slight to baffle ye?  He led us on\nWhere the rock parted; here against my front\nDid beat his wings, then promis'd I should fare\nIn safety on my way.  As to ascend\nThat steep, upon whose brow the chapel stands\n(O'er Rubaconte, looking lordly down\nOn the well-guided city,) up the right\nTh' impetuous rise is broken by the steps\nCarv'd in that old and simple age, when still\nThe registry and label rested safe;\nThus is th' acclivity reliev'd, which here\nPrecipitous from the other circuit falls:\nBut on each hand the tall cliff presses close.\n\nAs ent'ring there we turn'd, voices, in strain\nIneffable, sang: \"Blessed are the poor\nIn spirit.\"  Ah how far unlike to these\nThe straits of hell; here songs to usher us,\nThere shrieks of woe!  We climb the holy stairs:\nAnd lighter to myself by far I seem'd\nThan on the plain before, whence thus I spake:\n\"Say, master, of what heavy thing have I\nBeen lighten'd, that scarce aught the sense of toil\nAffects me journeying?\"  He in few replied:\n\"When sin's broad characters, that yet remain\nUpon thy temples, though well nigh effac'd,\nShall be, as one is, all clean razed out,\nThen shall thy feet by heartiness of will\nBe so o'ercome, they not alone shall feel\nNo sense of labour, but delight much more\nShall wait them urg'd along their upward way.\"\n\nThen like to one, upon whose head is plac'd\nSomewhat he deems not of but from the becks\nOf others as they pass him by; his hand\nLends therefore help to' assure him, searches, finds,\nAnd well performs such office as the eye\nWants power to execute: so stretching forth\nThe fingers of my right hand, did I find\nSix only of the letters, which his sword\nWho bare the keys had trac'd upon my brow.\nThe leader, as he mark'd mine action, smil'd.\n\n\n\n\nCANTO XIII\n\nWe reach'd the summit of the scale, and stood\nUpon the second buttress of that mount\nWhich healeth him who climbs.  A cornice there,\nLike to the former, girdles round the hill;\nSave that its arch with sweep less ample bends.\n\nShadow nor image there is seen; all smooth\nThe rampart and the path, reflecting nought\nBut the rock's sullen hue.  \"If here we wait\nFor some to question,\" said the bard, \"I fear\nOur choice may haply meet too long delay.\"\n\nThen fixedly upon the sun his eyes\nHe fastn'd, made his right the central point\nFrom whence to move, and turn'd the left aside.\n\"O pleasant light, my confidence and hope,\nConduct us thou,\" he cried, \"on this new way,\nWhere now I venture, leading to the bourn\nWe seek.  The universal world to thee\nOwes warmth and lustre.  If no other cause\nForbid, thy beams should ever be our guide.\"\n\nFar, as is measur'd for a mile on earth,\nIn brief space had we journey'd; such prompt will\nImpell'd; and towards us flying, now were heard\nSpirits invisible, who courteously\nUnto love's table bade the welcome guest.\nThe voice, that firstlew by, call'd forth aloud,\n\"They have no wine;\" so on behind us past,\nThose sounds reiterating, nor yet lost\nIn the faint distance, when another came\nCrying, \"I am Orestes,\" and alike\nWing'd its fleet way.  \"Oh father!\"  I exclaim'd,\n\"What tongues are these?\"  and as I question'd, lo!\nA third exclaiming, \"Love ye those have wrong'd you.\"\n\n\"This circuit,\" said my teacher, \"knots the scourge\nFor envy, and the cords are therefore drawn\nBy charity's correcting hand.  The curb\nIs of a harsher sound, as thou shalt hear\n(If I deem rightly), ere thou reach the pass,\nWhere pardon sets them free.  But fix thine eyes\nIntently through the air, and thou shalt see\nA multitude before thee seated, each\nAlong the shelving grot.\"  Then more than erst\nI op'd my eyes, before me view'd, and saw\nShadows with garments dark as was the rock;\nAnd when we pass'd a little forth, I heard\nA crying, \"Blessed Mary! pray for us,\nMichael and Peter! all ye saintly host!\"\n\nI do not think there walks on earth this day\nMan so remorseless, that he hath not yearn'd\nWith pity at the sight that next I saw.\nMine eyes a load of sorrow teemed, when now\nI stood so near them, that their semblances\nCame clearly to my view.  Of sackcloth vile\nTheir cov'ring seem'd; and on his shoulder one\nDid stay another, leaning, and all lean'd\nAgainst the cliff.  E'en thus the blind and poor,\nNear the confessionals, to crave an alms,\nStand, each his head upon his fellow's sunk,\n\nSo most to stir compassion, not by sound\nOf words alone, but that, which moves not less,\nThe sight of mis'ry.  And as never beam\nOf noonday visiteth the eyeless man,\nE'en so was heav'n a niggard unto these\nOf his fair light; for, through the orbs of all,\nA thread of wire, impiercing, knits them up,\nAs for the taming of a haggard hawk.\n\nIt were a wrong, methought, to pass and look\nOn others, yet myself the while unseen.\nTo my sage counsel therefore did I turn.\nHe knew the meaning of the mute appeal,\nNor waited for my questioning, but said:\n\"Speak; and be brief, be subtle in thy words.\"\n\nOn that part of the cornice, whence no rim\nEngarlands its steep fall, did Virgil come;\nOn the' other side me were the spirits, their cheeks\nBathing devout with penitential tears,\nThat through the dread impalement forc'd a way.\n\nI turn'd me to them, and \"O shades!\" said I,\n\n\"Assur'd that to your eyes unveil'd shall shine\nThe lofty light, sole object of your wish,\nSo may heaven's grace clear whatsoe'er of foam\nFloats turbid on the conscience, that thenceforth\nThe stream of mind roll limpid from its source,\nAs ye declare (for so shall ye impart\nA boon I dearly prize) if any soul\nOf Latium dwell among ye; and perchance\nThat soul may profit, if I learn so much.\"\n\n\"My brother, we are each one citizens\nOf one true city.  Any thou wouldst say,\nWho lived a stranger in Italia's land.\"\n\nSo heard I answering, as appeal'd, a voice\nThat onward came some space from whence I stood.\n\nA spirit I noted, in whose look was mark'd\nExpectance.  Ask ye how?  The chin was rais'd\nAs in one reft of sight.  \"Spirit,\" said I,\n\"Who for thy rise are tutoring (if thou be\nThat which didst answer to me,) or by place\nOr name, disclose thyself, that I may know thee.\"\n\n\"I was,\" it answer'd, \"of Sienna: here\nI cleanse away with these the evil life,\nSoliciting with tears that He, who is,\nVouchsafe him to us.  Though Sapia nam'd\nIn sapience I excell'd not, gladder far\nOf others' hurt, than of the good befell me.\nThat thou mayst own I now deceive thee not,\nHear, if my folly were not as I speak it.\nWhen now my years slop'd waning down the arch,\nIt so bechanc'd, my fellow citizens\nNear Colle met their enemies in the field,\nAnd I pray'd God to grant what He had will'd.\nThere were they vanquish'd, and betook themselves\nUnto the bitter passages of flight.\nI mark'd the hunt, and waxing out of bounds\nIn gladness, lifted up my shameless brow,\nAnd like the merlin cheated by a gleam,\nCried, \"It is over.  Heav'n! fear thee not.\"\nUpon my verge of life I wish'd for peace\nWith God; nor repentance had supplied\nWhat I did lack of duty, were it not\nThe hermit Piero, touch'd with charity,\nIn his devout orisons thought on me.\n\"But who art thou that question'st of our state,\nWho go'st to my belief, with lids unclos'd,\nAnd breathest in thy talk?\"--\"Mine eyes,\" said I,\n\"May yet be here ta'en from me; but not long;\nFor they have not offended grievously\nWith envious glances.  But the woe beneath\nUrges my soul with more exceeding dread.\nThat nether load already weighs me down.\"\n\nShe thus: \"Who then amongst us here aloft\nHath brought thee, if thou weenest to return?\"\n\n\"He,\" answer'd I, \"who standeth mute beside me.\nI live: of me ask therefore, chosen spirit,\nIf thou desire I yonder yet should move\nFor thee my mortal feet.\"--\"Oh!\" she replied,\n\"This is so strange a thing, it is great sign\nThat God doth love thee.  Therefore with thy prayer\nSometime assist me: and by that I crave,\nWhich most thou covetest, that if thy feet\nE'er tread on Tuscan soil, thou save my fame\nAmongst my kindred.  Them shalt thou behold\nWith that vain multitude, who set their hope\nOn Telamone's haven, there to fail\nConfounded, more shall when the fancied stream\nThey sought of Dian call'd: but they who lead\nTheir navies, more than ruin'd hopes shall mourn.\"\n\n\n\n\nCANTO XIV\n\n\"Say who is he around our mountain winds,\nOr ever death has prun'd his wing for flight,\nThat opes his eyes and covers them at will?\"\n\n\"I know not who he is, but know thus much\nHe comes not singly.  Do thou ask of him,\nFor thou art nearer to him, and take heed\nAccost him gently, so that he may speak.\"\n\nThus on the right two Spirits bending each\nToward the other, talk'd of me, then both\nAddressing me, their faces backward lean'd,\nAnd thus the one began: \"O soul, who yet\nPent in the body, tendest towards the sky!\nFor charity, we pray thee' comfort us,\nRecounting whence thou com'st, and who thou art:\nFor thou dost make us at the favour shown thee\nMarvel, as at a thing that ne'er hath been.\"\n\n\"There stretches through the midst of Tuscany,\"\nI straight began: \"a brooklet, whose well-head\nSprings up in Falterona, with his race\nNot satisfied, when he some hundred miles\nHath measur'd.  From his banks bring, I this frame.\nTo tell you who I am were words misspent:\nFor yet my name scarce sounds on rumour's lip.\"\n\n\"If well I do incorp'rate with my thought\nThe meaning of thy speech,\" said he, who first\nAddrest me, \"thou dost speak of Arno's wave.\"\n\nTo whom the other: \"Why hath he conceal'd\nThe title of that river, as a man\nDoth of some horrible thing?\"  The spirit, who\nThereof was question'd, did acquit him thus:\n\"I know not: but 'tis fitting well the name\nShould perish of that vale; for from the source\nWhere teems so plenteously the Alpine steep\nMaim'd of Pelorus, (that doth scarcely pass\nBeyond that limit,) even to the point\nWhereunto ocean is restor'd, what heaven\nDrains from th' exhaustless store for all earth's streams,\nThroughout the space is virtue worried down,\nAs 'twere a snake, by all, for mortal foe,\nOr through disastrous influence on the place,\nOr else distortion of misguided wills,\nThat custom goads to evil: whence in those,\nThe dwellers in that miserable vale,\nNature is so transform'd, it seems as they\nHad shar'd of Circe's feeding.  'Midst brute swine,\nWorthier of acorns than of other food\nCreated for man's use, he shapeth first\nHis obscure way; then, sloping onward, finds\nCurs, snarlers more in spite than power, from whom\nHe turns with scorn aside: still journeying down,\nBy how much more the curst and luckless foss\nSwells out to largeness, e'en so much it finds\nDogs turning into wolves.  Descending still\nThrough yet more hollow eddies, next he meets\nA race of foxes, so replete with craft,\nThey do not fear that skill can master it.\nNor will I cease because my words are heard\nBy other ears than thine.  It shall be well\nFor this man, if he keep in memory\nWhat from no erring Spirit I reveal.\nLo! behold thy grandson, that becomes\nA hunter of those wolves, upon the shore\nOf the fierce stream, and cows them all with dread:\nTheir flesh yet living sets he up to sale,\nThen like an aged beast to slaughter dooms.\nMany of life he reaves, himself of worth\nAnd goodly estimation.  Smear'd with gore\nMark how he issues from the rueful wood,\nLeaving such havoc, that in thousand years\nIt spreads not to prime lustihood again.\"\n\nAs one, who tidings hears of woe to come,\nChanges his looks perturb'd, from whate'er part\nThe peril grasp him, so beheld I change\nThat spirit, who had turn'd to listen, struck\nWith sadness, soon as he had caught the word.\n\nHis visage and the other's speech did raise\nDesire in me to know the names of both,\nwhereof with meek entreaty I inquir'd.\n\nThe shade, who late addrest me, thus resum'd:\n\"Thy wish imports that I vouchsafe to do\nFor thy sake what thou wilt not do for mine.\nBut since God's will is that so largely shine\nHis grace in thee, I will be liberal too.\nGuido of Duca know then that I am.\nEnvy so parch'd my blood, that had I seen\nA fellow man made joyous, thou hadst mark'd\nA livid paleness overspread my cheek.\nSuch harvest reap I of the seed I sow'd.\nO man, why place thy heart where there doth need\nExclusion of participants in good?\nThis is Rinieri's spirit, this the boast\nAnd honour of the house of Calboli,\nWhere of his worth no heritage remains.\nNor his the only blood, that hath been stript\n('twixt Po, the mount, the Reno, and the shore,)\nOf all that truth or fancy asks for bliss;\nBut in those limits such a growth has sprung\nOf rank and venom'd roots, as long would mock\nSlow culture's toil.  Where is good Liziohere\nManardi, Traversalo, and Carpigna?\nO bastard slips of old Romagna's line!\nWhen in Bologna the low artisan,\nAnd in Faenza yon Bernardin sprouts,\nA gentle cyon from ignoble stem.\nWonder not, Tuscan, if thou see me weep,\nWhen I recall to mind those once lov'd names,\nGuido of Prata, and of Azzo him\nThat dwelt with you; Tignoso and his troop,\nWith Traversaro's house and Anastagio's,\n(Each race disherited) and beside these,\nThe ladies and the knights, the toils and ease,\nThat witch'd us into love and courtesy;\nWhere now such malice reigns in recreant hearts.\nO Brettinoro! wherefore tarriest still,\nSince forth of thee thy family hath gone,\nAnd many, hating evil, join'd their steps?\nWell doeth he, that bids his lineage cease,\nBagnacavallo; Castracaro ill,\nAnd Conio worse, who care to propagate\nA race of Counties from such blood as theirs.\nWell shall ye also do, Pagani, then\nWhen from amongst you tries your demon child.\nNot so, howe'er, that henceforth there remain\nTrue proof of what ye were.  O Hugolin!\nThou sprung of Fantolini's line! thy name\nIs safe, since none is look'd for after thee\nTo cloud its lustre, warping from thy stock.\nBut, Tuscan, go thy ways; for now I take\nFar more delight in weeping than in words.\nSuch pity for your sakes hath wrung my heart.\"\n\nWe knew those gentle spirits at parting heard\nOur steps.  Their silence therefore of our way\nAssur'd us.  Soon as we had quitted them,\nAdvancing onward, lo! a voice that seem'd\nLike vollied light'ning, when it rives the air,\nMet us, and shouted, \"Whosoever finds\nWill slay me,\" then fled from us, as the bolt\nLanc'd sudden from a downward-rushing cloud.\nWhen it had giv'n short truce unto our hearing,\nBehold the other with a crash as loud\nAs the quick-following thunder: \"Mark in me\nAglauros turn'd to rock.\"  I at the sound\nRetreating drew more closely to my guide.\n\nNow in mute stillness rested all the air:\nAnd thus he spake: \"There was the galling bit.\nBut your old enemy so baits his hook,\nHe drags you eager to him.  Hence nor curb\nAvails you, nor reclaiming call.  Heav'n calls\nAnd round about you wheeling courts your gaze\nWith everlasting beauties.  Yet your eye\nTurns with fond doting still upon the earth.\nTherefore He smites you who discerneth all.\"\n\n\n\n\nCANTO XV\n\nAs much as 'twixt the third hour's close and dawn,\nAppeareth of heav'n's sphere, that ever whirls\nAs restless as an infant in his play,\nSo much appear'd remaining to the sun\nOf his <DW72> journey towards the western goal.\n\nEvening was there, and here the noon of night;\nand full upon our forehead smote the beams.\nFor  round the mountain, circling, so our path\nHad led us, that toward the sun-set now\nDirect we journey'd: when I felt a weight\nOf more exceeding splendour, than before,\nPress on my front.  The cause unknown, amaze\nPossess'd me, and both hands against my brow\nLifting, I interpos'd them, as a screen,\nThat of its gorgeous superflux of light\nClipp'd the diminish'd orb. As when the ray,\nStriking On water or the surface clear\nOf mirror, leaps unto the opposite part,\nAscending at a glance, e'en as it fell,\n(And so much differs from the stone, that falls\nThrough equal space, as practice skill hath shown);\nThus with refracted light before me seemed\nThe ground there smitten; whence in sudden haste\nMy sight recoil'd.  \"What is this, sire belov'd!\n'Gainst which I strive to shield the sight in vain?\"\nCried I, \"and which towards us moving seems?\"\n\n\"Marvel not, if the family of heav'n,\"\nHe answer'd, \"yet with dazzling radiance dim\nThy sense it is a messenger who comes,\nInviting man's ascent.  Such sights ere long,\nNot grievous, shall impart to thee delight,\nAs thy perception is by nature wrought\nUp to their pitch.\"  The blessed angel, soon\nAs we had reach'd him, hail'd us with glad voice:\n\"Here enter on a ladder far less steep\nThan ye have yet encounter'd.\"  We forthwith\nAscending, heard behind us chanted sweet,\n\"Blessed the merciful,\" and \"happy thou!\nThat conquer'st.\"  Lonely each, my guide and I\nPursued our upward way; and as we went,\nSome profit from his words I hop'd to win,\nAnd thus of him inquiring, fram'd my speech:\n\n\"What meant Romagna's spirit, when he spake\nOf bliss exclusive with no partner shar'd?\"\n\nHe straight replied: \"No wonder, since he knows,\nWhat sorrow waits on his own worst defect,\nIf he chide others, that they less may mourn.\nBecause ye point your wishes at a mark,\nWhere, by communion of possessors, part\nIs lessen'd, envy bloweth up the sighs of men.\nNo fear of that might touch ye, if the love\nOf higher sphere exalted your desire.\nFor there, by how much more they call it ours,\nSo much propriety of each in good\nIncreases more, and heighten'd charity\nWraps that fair cloister in a brighter flame.\"\n\n\"Now lack I satisfaction more,\" said I,\n\"Than if thou hadst been silent at the first,\nAnd doubt more gathers on my lab'ring thought.\nHow can it chance, that good distributed,\nThe many, that possess it, makes more rich,\nThan if 't were shar'd by few?\"  He answering thus:\n\"Thy mind, reverting still to things of earth,\nStrikes darkness from true light.  The highest good\nUnlimited, ineffable, doth so speed\nTo love, as beam to lucid body darts,\nGiving as much of ardour as it finds.\nThe sempiternal effluence streams abroad\nSpreading, wherever charity extends.\nSo that the more aspirants to that bliss\nAre multiplied, more good is there to love,\nAnd more is lov'd; as mirrors, that reflect,\nEach unto other, propagated light.\nIf these my words avail not to allay\nThy thirsting, Beatrice thou shalt see,\nWho of this want, and of all else thou hast,\nShall rid thee to the full.  Provide but thou\nThat from thy temples may be soon eras'd,\nE'en as the two already, those five scars,\nThat when they pain thee worst, then kindliest heal,\"\n\n\"Thou,\" I had said, \"content'st me,\" when I saw\nThe other round was gain'd, and wond'ring eyes\nDid keep me mute.  There suddenly I seem'd\nBy an ecstatic vision wrapt away;\nAnd in a temple saw, methought, a crowd\nOf many persons; and at th' entrance stood\nA dame, whose sweet demeanour did express\nA mother's love, who said, \"Child! why hast thou\nDealt with us thus?  Behold thy sire and I\nSorrowing have sought thee;\" and so held her peace,\nAnd straight the vision fled.  A female next\nAppear'd before me, down whose visage cours'd\nThose waters, that grief forces out from one\nBy deep resentment stung, who seem'd to say:\n\"If thou, Pisistratus, be lord indeed\nOver this city, nam'd with such debate\nOf adverse gods, and whence each science sparkles,\nAvenge thee of those arms, whose bold embrace\nHath clasp'd our daughter; \"and to fuel, meseem'd,\nBenign and meek, with visage undisturb'd,\nHer sovran spake: \"How shall we those requite,\nWho wish us evil, if we thus condemn\nThe man that loves us?\"  After that I saw\nA multitude, in fury burning, slay\nWith stones a stripling youth, and shout amain\n\"Destroy, destroy:\" and him I saw, who bow'd\nHeavy with death unto the ground, yet made\nHis eyes, unfolded upward, gates to heav'n,\n\nPraying forgiveness of th' Almighty Sire,\nAmidst that cruel conflict, on his foes,\nWith looks, that With compassion to their aim.\n\nSoon as my spirit, from her airy flight\nReturning, sought again the things, whose truth\nDepends not on her shaping, I observ'd\nHow she had rov'd to no unreal scenes\n\nMeanwhile the leader, who might see I mov'd,\nAs one, who struggles to shake off his sleep,\nExclaim'd: \"What ails thee, that thou canst not hold\nThy footing firm, but more than half a league\nHast travel'd with clos'd eyes and tott'ring gait,\nLike to a man by wine or sleep o'ercharg'd?\"\n\n\"Beloved father! so thou deign,\" said I,\n\"To listen, I will tell thee what appear'd\nBefore me, when so fail'd my sinking steps.\"\n\nHe thus: \"Not if thy Countenance were mask'd\nWith hundred vizards, could a thought of thine\nHow small soe'er, elude me.  What thou saw'st\nWas shown, that freely thou mightst ope thy heart\nTo the waters of peace, that flow diffus'd\nFrom their eternal fountain.  I not ask'd,\nWhat ails theeor such cause as he doth, who\nLooks only with that eye which sees no more,\nWhen spiritless the body lies; but ask'd,\nTo give fresh vigour to thy foot.  Such goads\nThe slow and loit'ring need; that they be found\nNot wanting, when their hour of watch returns.\"\n\nSo on we journey'd through the evening sky\nGazing intent, far onward, as our eyes\nWith level view could stretch against the bright\nVespertine ray: and lo! by slow degrees\nGath'ring, a fog made tow'rds us, dark as night.\nThere was no room for'scaping; and that mist\nBereft us, both of sight and the pure air.\n\n\n\n\nCANTO XVI\n\nHell's dunnest gloom, or night unlustrous, dark,\nOf every planes'reft, and pall'd in clouds,\nDid never spread before the sight a veil\nIn thickness like that fog, nor to the sense\nSo palpable and gross.  Ent'ring its shade,\nMine eye endured not with unclosed lids;\nWhich marking, near me drew the faithful guide,\nOffering me his shoulder for a stay.\n\nAs the blind man behind his leader walks,\nLest he should err, or stumble unawares\nOn what might harm him, or perhaps destroy,\nI journey'd through that bitter air and foul,\nStill list'ning to my escort's warning voice,\n\"Look that from me thou part not.\"  Straight I heard\nVoices, and each one seem'd to pray for peace,\nAnd for compassion, to the Lamb of God\nThat taketh sins away.  Their prelude still\nWas \"Agnus Dei,\" and through all the choir,\nOne voice, one measure ran, that perfect seem'd\nThe concord of their song.  \"Are these I hear\nSpirits, O master?\"  I exclaim'd; and he:\n\"Thou aim'st aright: these loose the bonds of wrath.\"\n\n\"Now who art thou, that through our smoke dost cleave?\nAnd speak'st of us, as thou thyself e'en yet\nDividest time by calends?\"  So one voice\nBespake me; whence my master said: \"Reply;\nAnd ask, if upward hence the passage lead.\"\n\n\"O being! who dost make thee pure, to stand\nBeautiful once more in thy Maker's sight!\nAlong with me: and thou shalt hear and wonder.\"\nThus I, whereto the spirit answering spake:\n\n\"Long as 't is lawful for me, shall my steps\nFollow on thine; and since the cloudy smoke\nForbids the seeing, hearing in its stead\nShall keep us join'd.\"  I then forthwith began\n\"Yet in my mortal swathing, I ascend\nTo higher regions, and am hither come\nThrough the fearful agony of hell.\nAnd, if so largely God hath doled his grace,\nThat, clean beside all modern precedent,\nHe wills me to behold his kingly state,\nFrom me conceal not who thou wast, ere death\nHad loos'd thee; but instruct me: and instruct\nIf rightly to the pass I tend; thy words\nThe way directing as a safe escort.\"\n\n\"I was of Lombardy, and Marco call'd:\nNot inexperienc'd of the world, that worth\nI still affected, from which all have turn'd\nThe nerveless bow aside.  Thy course tends right\nUnto the summit:\" and, replying thus,\nHe added, \"I beseech thee pray for me,\nWhen thou shalt come aloft.\"  And I to him:\n\"Accept my faith for pledge I will perform\nWhat thou requirest.  Yet one doubt remains,\nThat wrings me sorely, if I solve it not,\nSingly before it urg'd me, doubled now\nBy thine opinion, when I couple that\nWith one elsewhere declar'd, each strength'ning other.\nThe world indeed is even so forlorn\nOf all good as thou speak'st it and so swarms\nWith every evil.  Yet, beseech thee, point\nThe cause out to me, that myself may see,\nAnd unto others show it: for in heaven\nOne places it, and one on earth below.\"\n\nThen heaving forth a deep and audible sigh,\n\"Brother!\" he thus began, \"the world is blind;\nAnd thou in truth com'st from it.  Ye, who live,\nDo so each cause refer to heav'n above,\nE'en as its motion of necessity\nDrew with it all that moves.  If this were so,\nFree choice in you were none; nor justice would\nThere should be joy for virtue, woe for ill.\nYour movements have their primal bent from heaven;\nNot all; yet said I all; what then ensues?\nLight have ye still to follow evil or good,\nAnd of the will free power, which, if it stand\nFirm and unwearied in Heav'n's first assay,\nConquers at last, so it be cherish'd well,\nTriumphant over all.  To mightier force,\nTo better nature subject, ye abide\nFree, not constrain'd by that, which forms in you\nThe reasoning mind uninfluenc'd of the stars.\nIf then the present race of mankind err,\nSeek in yourselves the cause, and find it there.\nHerein thou shalt confess me no false spy.\n\n\"Forth from his plastic hand, who charm'd beholds\nHer image ere she yet exist, the soul\nComes like a babe, that wantons sportively\nWeeping and laughing in its wayward moods,\nAs artless and as ignorant of aught,\nSave that her Maker being one who dwells\nWith gladness ever, willingly she turns\nTo whate'er yields her joy.  Of some slight good\nThe flavour soon she tastes; and, snar'd by that,\nWith fondness she pursues it, if no guide\nRecall, no rein direct her wand'ring course.\nHence it behov'd, the law should be a curb;\nA sovereign hence behov'd, whose piercing view\nMight mark at least the fortress and main tower\nOf the true city.  Laws indeed there are:\nBut who is he observes them?  None; not he,\nWho goes before, the shepherd of the flock,\nWho chews the cud but doth not cleave the hoof.\nTherefore the multitude, who see their guide\nStrike at the very good they covet most,\nFeed there and look no further.  Thus the cause\nIs not corrupted nature in yourselves,\nBut ill-conducting, that hath turn'd the world\nTo evil.  Rome, that turn'd it unto good,\nWas wont to boast two suns, whose several beams\nCast light on either way, the world's and God's.\nOne since hath quench'd the other; and the sword\nIs grafted on the crook; and so conjoin'd\nEach must perforce decline to worse, unaw'd\nBy fear of other.  If thou doubt me, mark\nThe blade: each herb is judg'd of by its seed.\nThat land, through which Adice and the Po\nTheir waters roll, was once the residence\nOf courtesy and velour, ere the day,\nThat frown'd on Frederick; now secure may pass\nThose limits, whosoe'er hath left, for shame,\nTo talk with good men, or come near their haunts.\nThree aged ones are still found there, in whom\nThe old time chides the new: these deem it long\nEre God restore them to a better world:\nThe good Gherardo, of Palazzo he\nConrad, and Guido of Castello, nam'd\nIn Gallic phrase more fitly the plain Lombard.\nOn this at last conclude.  The church of Rome,\nMixing two governments that ill assort,\nHath miss'd her footing, fall'n into the mire,\nAnd there herself and burden much defil'd.\"\n\n\"O Marco!\" I replied, shine arguments\nConvince me: and the cause I now discern\nWhy of the heritage no portion came\nTo Levi's offspring.  But resolve me this\nWho that Gherardo is, that as thou sayst\nIs left a sample of the perish'd race,\nAnd for rebuke to this untoward age?\"\n\n\"Either thy words,\" said he, \"deceive; or else\nAre meant to try me; that thou, speaking Tuscan,\nAppear'st not to have heard of good Gherado;\nThe sole addition that, by which I know him;\nUnless I borrow'd from his daughter Gaia\nAnother name to grace him.  God be with you.\nI bear you company no more.  Behold\nThe dawn with white ray glimm'ring through the mist.\nI must away--the angel comes--ere he\nAppear.\"  He said, and would not hear me more.\n\n\n\n\nCANTO XVII\n\nCall to remembrance, reader, if thou e'er\nHast, on a mountain top, been ta'en by cloud,\nThrough which thou saw'st no better, than the mole\nDoth through opacous membrane; then, whene'er\nThe wat'ry vapours dense began to melt\nInto thin air, how faintly the sun's sphere\nSeem'd wading through them; so thy nimble thought\nMay image, how at first I re-beheld\nThe sun, that bedward now his couch o'erhung.\n\nThus with my leader's feet still equaling pace\nFrom forth that cloud I came, when now expir'd\nThe parting beams from off the nether shores.\n\nO quick and forgetive power! that sometimes dost\nSo rob us of ourselves, we take no mark\nThough round about us thousand trumpets clang!\nWhat moves thee, if the senses stir not?  Light\nKindled in heav'n, spontaneous, self-inform'd,\nOr likelier gliding down with swift illapse\nBy will divine.  Portray'd before me came\nThe traces of her dire impiety,\nWhose form was chang'd into the bird, that most\nDelights itself in song: and here my mind\nWas inwardly so wrapt, it gave no place\nTo aught that ask'd admittance from without.\n\nNext shower'd into my fantasy a shape\nAs of one crucified, whose visage spake\nFell rancour, malice deep, wherein he died;\nAnd round him Ahasuerus the great king,\nEsther his bride, and Mordecai the just,\nBlameless in word and deed.  As of itself\nThat unsubstantial coinage of the brain\nBurst, like a bubble, Which the water fails\nThat fed it; in my vision straight uprose\nA damsel weeping loud, and cried, \"O queen!\nO mother! wherefore has intemperate ire\nDriv'n thee to loath thy being?  Not to lose\nLavinia, desp'rate thou hast slain thyself.\nNow hast thou lost me.  I am she, whose tears\nMourn, ere I fall, a mother's timeless end.\"\n\nE'en as a sleep breaks off, if suddenly\nNew radiance strike upon the closed lids,\nThe broken slumber quivering ere it dies;\nThus from before me sunk that imagery\nVanishing, soon as on my face there struck\nThe light, outshining far our earthly beam.\nAs round I turn'd me to survey what place\nI had arriv'd at, \"Here ye mount,\" exclaim'd\nA voice, that other purpose left me none,\nSave will so eager to behold who spake,\nI could not choose but gaze.  As 'fore the sun,\nThat weighs our vision down, and veils his form\nIn light transcendent, thus my virtue fail'd\nUnequal.  \"This is Spirit from above,\nWho marshals us our upward way, unsought;\nAnd in his own light shrouds him.  As a man\nDoth for himself, so now is done for us.\nFor whoso waits imploring, yet sees need\nOf his prompt aidance, sets himself prepar'd\nFor blunt denial, ere the suit be made.\nRefuse we not to lend a ready foot\nAt such inviting: haste we to ascend,\nBefore it darken: for we may not then,\nTill morn again return.\"  So spake my guide;\nAnd to one ladder both address'd our steps;\nAnd the first stair approaching, I perceiv'd\nNear me as 'twere the waving of a wing,\nThat fann'd my face and whisper'd: \"Blessed they\nThe peacemakers: they know not evil wrath.\"\n\nNow to such height above our heads were rais'd\nThe last beams, follow'd close by hooded night,\nThat many a star on all sides through the gloom\nShone out.  \"Why partest from me, O my strength?\"\nSo with myself I commun'd; for I felt\nMy o'ertoil'd sinews slacken.  We had reach'd\nThe summit, and were fix'd like to a bark\nArriv'd at land.  And waiting a short space,\nIf aught should meet mine ear in that new round,\nThen to my guide I turn'd, and said: \"Lov'd sire!\nDeclare what guilt is on this circle purg'd.\nIf our feet rest, no need thy speech should pause.\"\n\nHe thus to me: \"The love of good, whate'er\nWanted of just proportion, here fulfils.\nHere plies afresh the oar, that loiter'd ill.\nBut that thou mayst yet clearlier understand,\nGive ear unto my words, and thou shalt cull\nSome fruit may please thee well, from this delay.\n\n\"Creator, nor created being, ne'er,\nMy son,\" he thus began, \"was without love,\nOr natural, or the free spirit's growth.\nThou hast not that to learn.  The natural still\nIs without error; but the other swerves,\nIf on ill object bent, or through excess\nOf vigour, or defect.  While e'er it seeks\nThe primal blessings, or with measure due\nTh' inferior, no delight, that flows from it,\nPartakes of ill.  But let it warp to evil,\nOr with more ardour than behooves, or less.\nPursue the good, the thing created then\nWorks 'gainst its Maker.  Hence thou must infer\nThat love is germin of each virtue in ye,\nAnd of each act no less, that merits pain.\nNow since it may not be, but love intend\nThe welfare mainly of the thing it loves,\nAll from self-hatred are secure; and since\nNo being can be thought t' exist apart\nAnd independent of the first, a bar\nOf equal force restrains from hating that.\n\n\"Grant the distinction just; and it remains\nThe' evil must be another's, which is lov'd.\nThree ways such love is gender'd in your clay.\nThere is who hopes (his neighbour's worth deprest,)\nPreeminence himself, and coverts hence\nFor his own greatness that another fall.\nThere is who so much fears the loss of power,\nFame, favour, glory (should his fellow mount\nAbove him), and so sickens at the thought,\nHe loves their opposite: and there is he,\nWhom wrong or insult seems to gall and shame\nThat he doth thirst for vengeance, and such needs\nMust doat on other's evil.  Here beneath\nThis threefold love is mourn'd.  Of th' other sort\nBe now instructed, that which follows good\nBut with disorder'd and irregular course.\n\n\"All indistinctly apprehend a bliss\nOn which the soul may rest, the hearts of all\nYearn after it, and to that wished bourn\nAll therefore strive to tend.  If ye behold\nOr seek it with a love remiss and lax,\nThis cornice after just repenting lays\nIts penal torment on ye.  Other good\nThere is, where man finds not his happiness:\nIt is not true fruition, not that blest\nEssence, of every good the branch and root.\nThe love too lavishly bestow'd on this,\nAlong three circles over us, is mourn'd.\nAccount of that division tripartite\nExpect not, fitter for thine own research.\"\n\n\n\n\nCANTO XVIII\n\nThe teacher ended, and his high discourse\nConcluding, earnest in my looks inquir'd\nIf I appear'd content; and I, whom still\nUnsated thirst to hear him urg'd, was mute,\nMute outwardly, yet inwardly I said:\n\"Perchance my too much questioning offends\"\nBut he, true father, mark'd the secret wish\nBy diffidence restrain'd, and speaking, gave\nMe boldness thus to speak: 'Master, my Sight\nGathers so lively virtue from thy beams,\nThat all, thy words convey, distinct is seen.\nWherefore I pray thee, father, whom this heart\nHolds dearest! thou wouldst deign by proof t' unfold\nThat love, from which as from their source thou bring'st\nAll good deeds and their opposite.'\"  He then:\n\"To what I now disclose be thy clear ken\nDirected, and thou plainly shalt behold\nHow much those blind have err'd, who make themselves\nThe guides of men.  The soul, created apt\nTo love, moves versatile which way soe'er\nAught pleasing prompts her, soon as she is wak'd\nBy pleasure into act.  Of substance true\nYour apprehension forms its counterfeit,\nAnd in you the ideal shape presenting\nAttracts the soul's regard.  If she, thus drawn,\nincline toward it, love is that inclining,\nAnd a new nature knit by pleasure in ye.\nThen as the fire points up, and mounting seeks\nHis birth-place and his lasting seat, e'en thus\nEnters the captive soul into desire,\nWhich is a spiritual motion, that ne'er rests\nBefore enjoyment of the thing it loves.\nEnough to show thee, how the truth from those\nIs hidden, who aver all love a thing\nPraise-worthy in itself: although perhaps\nIts substance seem still good.  Yet if the wax\nBe good, it follows not th' impression must.\"\n\"What love is,\" I return'd, \"thy words, O guide!\nAnd my own docile mind, reveal.  Yet thence\nNew doubts have sprung.  For from without if love\nBe offer'd to us, and the spirit knows\nNo other footing, tend she right or wrong,\nIs no desert of hers.\"  He answering thus:\n\"What reason here discovers I have power\nTo show thee: that which lies beyond, expect\nFrom Beatrice, faith not reason's task.\nSpirit, substantial form, with matter join'd\nNot in confusion mix'd, hath in itself\nSpecific virtue of that union born,\nWhich is not felt except it work, nor prov'd\nBut through effect, as vegetable life\nBy the green leaf.  From whence his intellect\nDeduced its primal notices of things,\nMan therefore knows not, or his appetites\nTheir first affections; such in you, as zeal\nIn bees to gather honey; at the first,\nVolition, meriting nor blame nor praise.\nBut o'er each lower faculty supreme,\nThat as she list are summon'd to her bar,\nYe have that virtue in you, whose just voice\nUttereth counsel, and whose word should keep\nThe threshold of assent.  Here is the source,\nWhence cause of merit in you is deriv'd,\nE'en as the affections good or ill she takes,\nOr severs, winnow'd as the chaff.  Those men\nWho reas'ning went to depth profoundest, mark'd\nThat innate freedom, and were thence induc'd\nTo leave their moral teaching to the world.\nGrant then, that from necessity arise\nAll love that glows within you; to dismiss\nOr harbour it, the pow'r is in yourselves.\nRemember, Beatrice, in her style,\nDenominates free choice by eminence\nThe noble virtue, if in talk with thee\nShe touch upon that theme.\"  The moon, well nigh\nTo midnight hour belated, made the stars\nAppear to wink and fade; and her broad disk\nSeem'd like a crag on fire, as up the vault\nThat course she journey'd, which the sun then warms,\nWhen they of Rome behold him at his set.\nBetwixt Sardinia and the Corsic isle.\nAnd now the weight, that hung upon my thought,\nWas lighten'd by the aid of that clear spirit,\nWho raiseth Andes above Mantua's name.\nI therefore, when my questions had obtain'd\nSolution plain and ample, stood as one\nMusing in dreary slumber; but not long\nSlumber'd; for suddenly a multitude,\n\nThe steep already turning, from behind,\nRush'd on.  With fury and like random rout,\nAs echoing on their shores at midnight heard\nIsmenus and Asopus, for his Thebes\nIf Bacchus' help were needed; so came these\nTumultuous, curving each his rapid step,\nBy eagerness impell'd of holy love.\n\nSoon they o'ertook us; with such swiftness mov'd\nThe mighty crowd.  Two spirits at their head\nCried weeping; \"Blessed Mary sought with haste\nThe hilly region.  Caesar to subdue\nIlerda, darted in Marseilles his sting,\nAnd flew to Spain.\"--\"Oh tarry not: away;\"\nThe others shouted; \"let not time be lost\nThrough slackness of affection.  Hearty zeal\nTo serve reanimates celestial grace.\"\n\n\"O ye, in whom intenser fervency\nHaply supplies, where lukewarm erst ye fail'd,\nSlow or neglectful, to absolve your part\nOf good and virtuous, this man, who yet lives,\n(Credit my tale, though strange) desires t' ascend,\nSo morning rise to light us.  Therefore say\nWhich hand leads nearest to the rifted rock?\"\n\nSo spake my guide, to whom a shade return'd:\n\"Come after us, and thou shalt find the cleft.\nWe may not linger: such resistless will\nSpeeds our unwearied course.  Vouchsafe us then\nThy pardon, if our duty seem to thee\nDiscourteous rudeness.  In Verona I\nWas abbot of San Zeno, when the hand\nOf Barbarossa grasp'd Imperial sway,\nThat name, ne'er utter'd without tears in Milan.\nAnd there is he, hath one foot in his grave,\nWho for that monastery ere long shall weep,\nRuing his power misus'd: for that his son,\nOf body ill compact, and worse in mind,\nAnd born in evil, he hath set in place\nOf its true pastor.\"  Whether more he spake,\nOr here was mute, I know not: he had sped\nE'en now so far beyond us.  Yet thus much\nI heard, and in rememb'rance treasur'd it.\n\nHe then, who never fail'd me at my need,\nCried, \"Hither turn.  Lo! two with sharp remorse\nChiding their sin!\"  In rear of all the troop\nThese shouted: \"First they died, to whom the sea\nOpen'd, or ever Jordan saw his heirs:\nAnd they, who with Aeneas to the end\nEndur'd not suffering, for their portion chose\nLife without glory.\"  Soon as they had fled\nPast reach of sight, new thought within me rose\nBy others follow'd fast, and each unlike\nIts fellow: till led on from thought to thought,\nAnd pleasur'd with the fleeting train, mine eye\nWas clos'd, and meditation chang'd to dream.\n\n\n\n\nCANTO XIX\n\nIt was the hour, when of diurnal heat\nNo reliques chafe the cold beams of the moon,\nO'erpower'd by earth, or planetary sway\nOf Saturn; and the geomancer sees\nHis Greater Fortune up the east ascend,\nWhere gray dawn checkers first the shadowy cone;\nWhen 'fore me in my dream a woman's shape\nThere came, with lips that stammer'd, eyes aslant,\nDistorted feet, hands maim'd, and colour pale.\n\nI look'd upon her; and as sunshine cheers\nLimbs numb'd by nightly cold, e'en thus my look\nUnloos'd her tongue, next in brief space her form\nDecrepit rais'd erect, and faded face\nWith love's own hue illum'd. Recov'ring speech\nShe forthwith warbling such a strain began,\nThat I, how loth soe'er, could scarce have held\nAttention from the song.  \"I,\" thus she sang,\n\"I am the Siren, she, whom mariners\nOn the wide sea are wilder'd when they hear:\nSuch fulness of delight the list'ner feels.\nI from his course Ulysses by my lay\nEnchanted drew.  Whoe'er frequents me once\nParts seldom; so I charm him, and his heart\nContented knows no void.\"  Or ere her mouth\nWas clos'd, to shame her at her side appear'd\nA dame of semblance holy.  With stern voice\nShe utter'd; \"Say, O Virgil, who is this?\"\nWhich hearing, he approach'd, with eyes still bent\nToward that goodly presence: th' other seiz'd her,\nAnd, her robes tearing, open'd her before,\nAnd show'd the belly to me, whence a smell,\nExhaling loathsome, wak'd me.  Round I turn'd\nMine eyes, and thus the teacher: \"At the least\nThree times my voice hath call'd thee.  Rise, begone.\nLet us the opening find where thou mayst pass.\"\n\nI straightway rose.  Now day, pour'd down from high,\nFill'd all the circuits of the sacred mount;\nAnd, as we journey'd, on our shoulder smote\nThe early ray.  I follow'd, stooping low\nMy forehead, as a man, o'ercharg'd with thought,\nWho bends him to the likeness of an arch,\nThat midway spans the flood; when thus I heard,\n\"Come, enter here,\" in tone so soft and mild,\nAs never met the ear on mortal strand.\n\nWith swan-like wings dispread and pointing up,\nWho thus had spoken marshal'd us along,\nWhere each side of the solid masonry\nThe sloping, walls retir'd; then mov'd his plumes,\nAnd fanning us, affirm'd that those, who mourn,\nAre blessed, for that comfort shall be theirs.\n\n\"What aileth thee, that still thou look'st to earth?\"\nBegan my leader; while th' angelic shape\nA little over us his station took.\n\n\"New vision,\" I replied, \"hath rais'd in me\nSurmisings strange and anxious doubts, whereon\nMy soul intent allows no other thought\nOr room or entrance.\"--\"Hast thou seen,\" said he,\n\"That old enchantress, her, whose wiles alone\nThe spirits o'er us weep for?  Hast thou seen\nHow man may free him of her bonds?  Enough.\nLet thy heels spurn the earth, and thy rais'd ken\nFix on the lure, which heav'n's eternal King\nWhirls in the rolling spheres.\"  As on his feet\nThe falcon first looks down, then to the sky\nTurns, and forth stretches eager for the food,\nThat woos him thither; so the call I heard,\nSo onward, far as the dividing rock\nGave way, I journey'd, till the plain was reach'd.\n\nOn the fifth circle when I stood at large,\nA race appear'd before me, on the ground\nAll downward lying prone and weeping sore.\n\"My soul hath cleaved to the dust,\" I heard\nWith sighs so deep, they well nigh choak'd the words.\n\"O ye elect of God, whose penal woes\nBoth hope and justice mitigate, direct\nTow'rds the steep rising our uncertain way.\"\n\n\"If ye approach secure from this our doom,\nProstration--and would urge your course with speed,\nSee that ye still to rightward keep the brink.\"\n\nSo them the bard besought; and such the words,\nBeyond us some short space, in answer came.\n\nI noted what remain'd yet hidden from them:\nThence to my liege's eyes mine eyes I bent,\nAnd he, forthwith interpreting their suit,\nBeckon'd his glad assent. Free then to act,\nAs pleas'd me, I drew near, and took my stand\nO`er that shade, whose words I late had mark'd.\nAnd, \"Spirit!\"  I said, \"in whom repentant tears\nMature that blessed hour, when thou with God\nShalt find acceptance, for a while suspend\nFor me that mightier care.  Say who thou wast,\nWhy thus ye grovel on your bellies prone,\nAnd if in aught ye wish my service there,\nWhence living I am come.\"  He answering spake\n\"The cause why Heav'n our back toward his cope\nReverses, shalt thou know: but me know first\nThe successor of Peter, and the name\nAnd title of my lineage from that stream,\nThat' twixt Chiaveri and Siestri draws\nHis limpid waters through the lowly glen.\nA month and little more by proof I learnt,\nWith what a weight that robe of sov'reignty\nUpon his shoulder rests, who from the mire\nWould guard it: that each other fardel seems\nBut feathers in the balance.  Late, alas!\nWas my conversion: but when I became\nRome's pastor, I discern'd at once the dream\nAnd cozenage of life, saw that the heart\nRested not there, and yet no prouder height\nLur'd on the climber: wherefore, of that life\nNo more enamour'd, in my bosom love\nOf purer being kindled.  For till then\nI was a soul in misery, alienate\nFrom God, and covetous of all earthly things;\nNow, as thou seest, here punish'd for my doting.\nSuch cleansing from the taint of avarice\nDo spirits converted need.  This mount inflicts\nNo direr penalty.  E'en as our eyes\nFasten'd below, nor e'er to loftier clime\nWere lifted, thus hath justice level'd us\nHere on the earth.  As avarice quench'd our love\nOf good, without which is no working, thus\nHere justice holds us prison'd, hand and foot\nChain'd down and bound, while heaven's just Lord shall please.\nSo long to tarry motionless outstretch'd.\"\n\nMy knees I stoop'd, and would have spoke; but he,\nEre my beginning, by his ear perceiv'd\nI did him reverence; and \"What cause,\" said he,\n\"Hath bow'd thee thus!\"--\"Compunction,\" I rejoin'd.\n\"And inward awe of your high dignity.\"\n\n\"Up,\" he exclaim'd, \"brother! upon thy feet\nArise: err not: thy fellow servant I,\n(Thine and all others') of one Sovran Power.\nIf thou hast ever mark'd those holy sounds\nOf gospel truth, 'nor shall be given ill marriage,'\nThou mayst discern the reasons of my speech.\nGo thy ways now; and linger here no more.\nThy tarrying is a let unto the tears,\nWith which I hasten that whereof thou spak'st.\nI have on earth a kinswoman; her name\nAlagia, worthy in herself, so ill\nExample of our house corrupt her not:\nAnd she is all remaineth of me there.\"\n\n\n\n\nCANTO XX\n\nIll strives the will, 'gainst will more wise that strives\nHis pleasure therefore to mine own preferr'd,\nI drew the sponge yet thirsty from the wave.\n\nOnward I mov'd: he also onward mov'd,\nWho led me, coasting still, wherever place\nAlong the rock was vacant, as a man\nWalks near the battlements on narrow wall.\nFor those on th' other part, who drop by drop\nWring out their all-infecting malady,\nToo closely press the verge.  Accurst be thou!\nInveterate wolf! whose gorge ingluts more prey,\nThan every beast beside, yet is not fill'd!\nSo bottomless thy maw!--Ye spheres of heaven!\nTo whom there are, as seems, who attribute\nAll change in mortal state, when is the day\nOf his appearing, for whom fate reserves\nTo chase her hence?--With wary steps and slow\nWe pass'd; and I attentive to the shades,\nWhom piteously I heard lament and wail;\n\nAnd,'midst the wailing, one before us heard\nCry out \"O blessed Virgin!\"  as a dame\nIn the sharp pangs of childbed; and \"How poor\nThou wast,\" it added, \"witness that low roof\nWhere thou didst lay thy sacred burden down.\nO good Fabricius! thou didst virtue choose\nWith poverty, before great wealth with vice.\"\n\nThe words so pleas'd me, that desire to know\nThe spirit, from whose lip they seem'd to come,\nDid draw me onward.  Yet it spake the gift\nOf Nicholas, which on the maidens he\nBounteous bestow'd, to save their youthful prime\nUnblemish'd.  \"Spirit! who dost speak of deeds\nSo worthy, tell me who thou was,\" I said,\n\"And why thou dost with single voice renew\nMemorial of such praise. That boon vouchsaf'd\nHaply shall meet reward; if I return\nTo finish the Short pilgrimage of life,\nStill speeding to its close on restless wing.\"\n\n\"I,\" answer'd he, \"will tell thee, not for hell,\nWhich thence I look for; but that in thyself\nGrace so exceeding shines, before thy time\nOf mortal dissolution.  I was root\nOf that ill plant, whose shade such poison sheds\nO'er all the Christian land, that seldom thence\nGood fruit is gather'd.  Vengeance soon should come,\nHad Ghent and Douay, Lille and Bruges power;\nAnd vengeance I of heav'n's great Judge implore.\nHugh Capet was I high: from me descend\nThe Philips and the Louis, of whom France\nNewly is govern'd; born of one, who ply'd\nThe slaughterer's trade at Paris.  When the race\nOf ancient kings had vanish'd (all save one\nWrapt up in sable weeds) within my gripe\nI found the reins of empire, and such powers\nOf new acquirement, with full store of friends,\nThat soon the widow'd circlet of the crown\nWas girt upon the temples of my son,\nHe, from whose bones th' anointed race begins.\nTill the great dower of Provence had remov'd\nThe stains, that yet obscur'd our lowly blood,\nIts sway indeed was narrow, but howe'er\nIt wrought no evil: there, with force and lies,\nBegan its rapine; after, for amends,\nPoitou it seiz'd, Navarre and Gascony.\nTo Italy came Charles, and for amends\nYoung Conradine an innocent victim slew,\nAnd sent th' angelic teacher back to heav'n,\nStill for amends.  I see the time at hand,\nThat forth from France invites another Charles\nTo make himself and kindred better known.\nUnarm'd he issues, saving with that lance,\nWhich the arch-traitor tilted with; and that\nHe carries with so home a thrust, as rives\nThe bowels of poor Florence.  No increase\nOf territory hence, but sin and shame\nShall be his guerdon, and so much the more\nAs he more lightly deems of such foul wrong.\nI see the other, who a prisoner late\nHad steps on shore, exposing to the mart\nHis daughter, whom he bargains for, as do\nThe Corsairs for their slaves.  O avarice!\nWhat canst thou more, who hast subdued our blood\nSo wholly to thyself, they feel no care\nOf their own flesh?  To hide with direr guilt\nPast ill and future, lo! the flower-de-luce\nEnters Alagna! in his Vicar Christ\nHimself a captive, and his mockery\nActed again!  Lo! to his holy lip\nThe vinegar and gall once more applied!\nAnd he 'twixt living robbers doom'd to bleed!\nLo! the new Pilate, of whose cruelty\nSuch violence cannot fill the measure up,\nWith no degree to sanction, pushes on\nInto the temple his yet eager sails!\n\n\"O sovran Master! when shall I rejoice\nTo see the vengeance, which thy wrath well-pleas'd\nIn secret silence broods?--While daylight lasts,\nSo long what thou didst hear of her, sole spouse\nOf the Great Spirit, and on which thou turn'dst\nTo me for comment, is the general theme\nOf all our prayers: but when it darkens, then\nA different strain we utter, then record\nPygmalion, whom his gluttonous thirst of gold\nMade traitor, robber, parricide: the woes\nOf Midas, which his greedy wish ensued,\nMark'd for derision to all future times:\nAnd the fond Achan, how he stole the prey,\nThat yet he seems by Joshua's ire pursued.\nSapphira with her husband next, we blame;\nAnd praise the forefeet, that with furious ramp\nSpurn'd Heliodorus.  All the mountain round\nRings with the infamy of Thracia's king,\nWho slew his Phrygian charge: and last a shout\nAscends: \"Declare, O Crassus! for thou know'st,\nThe flavour of thy gold.\"  The voice of each\nNow high now low, as each his impulse prompts,\nIs led through many a pitch, acute or grave.\nTherefore, not singly, I erewhile rehears'd\nThat blessedness we tell of in the day:\nBut near me none beside his accent rais'd.\"\n\nFrom him we now had parted, and essay'd\nWith utmost efforts to surmount the way,\nWhen I did feel, as nodding to its fall,\nThe mountain tremble; whence an icy chill\nSeiz'd on me, as on one to death convey'd.\nSo shook not Delos, when Latona there\nCouch'd to bring forth the twin-born eyes of heaven.\n\nForthwith from every side a shout arose\nSo vehement, that suddenly my guide\nDrew near, and cried: \"Doubt not, while I conduct thee.\"\n\"Glory!\" all shouted (such the sounds mine ear\nGather'd from those, who near me swell'd the sounds)\n\"Glory in the highest be to God.\"  We stood\nImmovably suspended, like to those,\nThe shepherds, who first heard in Bethlehem's field\nThat song: till ceas'd the trembling, and the song\nWas ended: then our hallow'd path resum'd,\nEying the prostrate shadows, who renew'd\nTheir custom'd mourning.  Never in my breast\nDid ignorance so struggle with desire\nOf knowledge, if my memory do not err,\nAs in that moment; nor through haste dar'd I\nTo question, nor myself could aught discern,\nSo on I far'd in thoughtfulness and dread.\n\n\n\n\nCANTO XXI\n\nThe natural thirst, ne'er quench'd but from the well,\nWhereof the woman of Samaria crav'd,\nExcited: haste along the cumber'd path,\nAfter my guide, impell'd; and pity mov'd\nMy bosom for the'vengeful deed, though just.\nWhen lo! even as Luke relates, that Christ\nAppear'd unto the two upon their way,\nNew-risen from his vaulted grave; to us\nA shade appear'd, and after us approach'd,\nContemplating the crowd beneath its feet.\nWe were not ware of it; so first it spake,\nSaying, \"God give you peace, my brethren!\" then\nSudden we turn'd: and Virgil such salute,\nAs fitted that kind greeting, gave, and cried:\n\"Peace in the blessed council be thy lot\nAwarded by that righteous court, which me\nTo everlasting banishment exiles!\"\n\n\"How!\" he exclaim'd, nor from his speed meanwhile\nDesisting, \"If that ye be spirits, whom God\nVouchsafes not room above, who up the height\nHas been thus far your guide?\"  To whom the bard:\n\"If thou observe the tokens, which this man\nTrac'd by the finger of the angel bears,\n'Tis plain that in the kingdom of the just\nHe needs must share.  But sithence she, whose wheel\nSpins day and night, for him not yet had drawn\nThat yarn, which, on the fatal distaff pil'd,\nClotho apportions to each wight that breathes,\nHis soul, that sister is to mine and thine,\nNot of herself could mount, for not like ours\nHer ken: whence I, from forth the ample gulf\nOf hell was ta'en, to lead him, and will lead\nFar as my lore avails.  But, if thou know,\nInstruct us for what cause, the mount erewhile\nThus shook and trembled: wherefore all at once\nSeem'd shouting, even from his wave-wash'd foot.\"\n\nThat questioning so tallied with my wish,\nThe thirst did feel abatement of its edge\nE'en from expectance.  He forthwith replied,\n\"In its devotion nought irregular\nThis mount can witness, or by punctual rule\nUnsanction'd; here from every change exempt.\nOther than that, which heaven in itself\nDoth of itself receive, no influence\nCan reach us.  Tempest none, shower, hail or snow,\nHoar frost or dewy moistness, higher falls\nThan that brief scale of threefold steps: thick clouds\nNor scudding rack are ever seen: swift glance\nNe'er lightens, nor Thaumantian Iris gleams,\nThat yonder often shift on each side heav'n.\nVapour adust doth never mount above\nThe highest of the trinal stairs, whereon\nPeter's vicegerent stands.

H. F. CARY, M.A.\n\n\n\n\nPARADISE\n\nCanto 1 - 33\n\n\n\nCANTO I\n\nHis glory, by whose might all things are mov'd,\nPierces the universe, and in one part\nSheds more resplendence, elsewhere less.  In heav'n,\nThat largeliest of his light partakes, was I,\nWitness of things, which to relate again\nSurpasseth power of him who comes from thence;\nFor that, so near approaching its desire\nOur intellect is to such depth absorb'd,\nThat memory cannot follow.  Nathless all,\nThat in my thoughts I of that sacred realm\nCould store, shall now be matter of my song.\n\nBenign Apollo! this last labour aid,\nAnd make me such a vessel of thy worth,\nAs thy own laurel claims of me belov'd.\nThus far hath one of steep Parnassus' brows\nSuffic'd me; henceforth there is need of both\nFor my remaining enterprise Do thou\nEnter into my bosom, and there breathe\nSo, as when Marsyas by thy hand was dragg'd\nForth from his limbs unsheath'd.  O power divine!\nIf thou to me of shine impart so much,\nThat of that happy realm the shadow'd form\nTrac'd in my thoughts I may set forth to view,\nThou shalt behold me of thy favour'd tree\nCome to the foot, and crown myself with leaves;\nFor to that honour thou, and my high theme\nWill fit me.  If but seldom, mighty Sire!\nTo grace his triumph gathers thence a wreath\nCaesar or bard (more shame for human wills\nDeprav'd) joy to the Delphic god must spring\nFrom the Pierian foliage, when one breast\nIs with such thirst inspir'd.  From a small spark\nGreat flame hath risen: after me perchance\nOthers with better voice may pray, and gain\nFrom the Cirrhaean city answer kind.\n\nThrough diver passages, the world's bright lamp\nRises to mortals, but through that which joins\nFour circles with the threefold cross, in best\nCourse, and in happiest constellation set\nHe comes, and to the worldly wax best gives\nIts temper and impression.  Morning there,\nHere eve was by almost such passage made;\nAnd whiteness had o'erspread that hemisphere,\nBlackness the other part; when to the left\nI saw Beatrice turn'd, and on the sun\nGazing, as never eagle fix'd his ken.\nAs from the first a second beam is wont\nTo issue, and reflected upwards rise,\nE'en as a pilgrim bent on his return,\nSo of her act, that through the eyesight pass'd\nInto my fancy, mine was form'd; and straight,\nBeyond our mortal wont, I fix'd mine eyes\nUpon the sun.  Much is allowed us there,\nThat here exceeds our pow'r; thanks to the place\nMade for the dwelling of the human kind\n\nI suffer'd it not long, and yet so long\nThat I beheld it bick'ring sparks around,\nAs iron that comes boiling from the fire.\nAnd suddenly upon the day appear'd\nA day new-ris'n, as he, who hath the power,\nHad with another sun bedeck'd the sky.\n\nHer eyes fast fix'd on the eternal wheels,\nBeatrice stood unmov'd; and I with ken\nFix'd upon her, from upward gaze remov'd\nAt her aspect, such inwardly became\nAs Glaucus, when he tasted of the herb,\nThat made him peer among the ocean gods;\nWords may not tell of that transhuman change:\nAnd therefore let the example serve, though weak,\nFor those whom grace hath better proof in store\n\nIf I were only what thou didst create,\nThen newly, Love! by whom the heav'n is rul'd,\nThou know'st, who by thy light didst bear me up.\nWhenas the wheel which thou dost ever guide,\nDesired Spirit! with its harmony\nTemper'd of thee and measur'd, charm'd mine ear,\nThen seem'd to me so much of heav'n to blaze\nWith the sun's flame, that rain or flood ne'er made\nA lake so broad.  The newness of the sound,\nAnd that great light, inflam'd me with desire,\nKeener than e'er was felt, to know their cause.\n\nWhence she who saw me, clearly as myself,\nTo calm my troubled mind, before I ask'd,\nOpen'd her lips, and gracious thus began:\n\"With false imagination thou thyself\nMak'st dull, so that thou seest not the thing,\nWhich thou hadst seen, had that been shaken off.\nThou art not on the earth as thou believ'st;\nFor light'ning scap'd from its own proper place\nNe'er ran, as thou hast hither now return'd.\"\n\nAlthough divested of my first-rais'd doubt,\nBy those brief words, accompanied with smiles,\nYet in new doubt was I entangled more,\nAnd said: \"Already satisfied, I rest\nFrom admiration deep, but now admire\nHow I above those lighter bodies rise.\"\n\nWhence, after utt'rance of a piteous sigh,\nShe tow'rds me bent her eyes, with such a look,\nAs on her frenzied child a mother casts;\nThen thus began: \"Among themselves all things\nHave order; and from hence the form, which makes\nThe universe resemble God.  In this\nThe higher creatures see the printed steps\nOf that eternal worth, which is the end\nWhither the line is drawn.  All natures lean,\nIn this their order, diversely, some more,\nSome less approaching to their primal source.\nThus they to different havens are mov'd on\nThrough the vast sea of being, and each one\nWith instinct giv'n, that bears it in its course;\nThis to the lunar sphere directs the fire,\nThis prompts the hearts of mortal animals,\nThis the brute earth together knits, and binds.\nNor only creatures, void of intellect,\nAre aim'd at by this bow; but even those,\nThat have intelligence and love, are pierc'd.\nThat Providence, who so well orders all,\nWith her own light makes ever calm the heaven,\nIn which the substance, that hath greatest speed,\nIs turn'd: and thither now, as to our seat\nPredestin'd, we are carried by the force\nOf that strong cord, that never looses dart,\nBut at fair aim and glad.  Yet is it true,\nThat as ofttimes but ill accords the form\nTo the design of art, through sluggishness\nOf unreplying matter, so this course\nIs sometimes quitted by the creature, who\nHath power, directed thus, to bend elsewhere;\nAs from a cloud the fire is seen to fall,\nFrom its original impulse warp'd, to earth,\nBy vicious fondness.  Thou no more admire\nThy soaring, (if I rightly deem,) than lapse\nOf torrent downwards from a mountain's height.\nThere would in thee for wonder be more cause,\nIf, free of hind'rance, thou hadst fix'd thyself\nBelow, like fire unmoving on the earth.\"\n\nSo said, she turn'd toward the heav'n her face.\n\n\n\n\nCANTO II\n\nAll ye, who in small bark have following sail'd,\nEager to listen, on the advent'rous track\nOf my proud keel, that singing cuts its way,\nBackward return with speed, and your own shores\nRevisit, nor put out to open sea,\nWhere losing me, perchance ye may remain\nBewilder'd in deep maze.  The way I pass\nNe'er yet was run: Minerva breathes the gale,\nApollo guides me, and another Nine\nTo my rapt sight the arctic beams reveal.\nYe other few, who have outstretch'd the neck.\nTimely for food of angels, on which here\nThey live, yet never know satiety,\nThrough the deep brine ye fearless may put out\nYour vessel, marking, well the furrow broad\nBefore you in the wave, that on both sides\nEqual returns.  Those, glorious, who pass'd o'er\nTo Colchos, wonder'd not as ye will do,\nWhen they saw Jason following the plough.\n\nThe increate perpetual thirst, that draws\nToward the realm of God's own form, bore us\nSwift almost as the heaven ye behold.\n\nBeatrice upward gaz'd, and I on her,\nAnd in such space as on the notch a dart\nIs plac'd, then loosen'd flies, I saw myself\nArriv'd, where wond'rous thing engag'd my sight.\nWhence she, to whom no work of mine was hid,\nTurning to me, with aspect glad as fair,\nBespake me: \"Gratefully direct thy mind\nTo God, through whom to this first star we come.\"\n\nMe seem'd as if a cloud had cover'd us,\nTranslucent, solid, firm, and polish'd bright,\nLike adamant, which the sun's beam had smit\nWithin itself the ever-during pearl\nReceiv'd us, as the wave a ray of light\nReceives, and rests unbroken.  If I then\nWas of corporeal frame, and it transcend\nOur weaker thought, how one dimension thus\nAnother could endure, which needs must be\nIf body enter body, how much more\nMust the desire inflame us to behold\nThat essence, which discovers by what means\nGod and our nature join'd!  There will be seen\nThat which we hold through faith, not shown by proof,\nBut in itself intelligibly plain,\nE'en as the truth that man at first believes.\n\nI answered: \"Lady! I with thoughts devout,\nSuch as I best can frame, give thanks to Him,\nWho hath remov'd me from the mortal world.\nBut tell, I pray thee, whence the gloomy spots\nUpon this body, which below on earth\nGive rise to talk of Cain in fabling quaint?\"\n\nShe somewhat smil'd, then spake: \"If mortals err\nIn their opinion, when the key of sense\nUnlocks not, surely wonder's weapon keen\nOught not to pierce thee; since thou find'st, the wings\nOf reason to pursue the senses' flight\nAre short.  But what thy own thought is, declare.\"\n\nThen I: \"What various here above appears,\nIs caus'd, I deem, by bodies dense or rare.\"\n\nShe then resum'd: \"Thou certainly wilt see\nIn falsehood thy belief o'erwhelm'd, if well\nThou listen to the arguments, which I\nShall bring to face it.  The eighth sphere displays\nNumberless lights, the which in kind and size\nMay be remark'd of different aspects;\nIf rare or dense of that were cause alone,\nOne single virtue then would be in all,\nAlike distributed, or more, or less.\nDifferent virtues needs must be the fruits\nOf formal principles, and these, save one,\nWill by thy reasoning be destroy'd.  Beside,\nIf rarity were of that dusk the cause,\nWhich thou inquirest, either in some part\nThat planet must throughout be void, nor fed\nWith its own matter; or, as bodies share\nTheir fat and leanness, in like manner this\nMust in its volume change the leaves.  The first,\nIf it were true, had through the sun's eclipse\nBeen manifested, by transparency\nOf light, as through aught rare beside effus'd.\nBut this is not.  Therefore remains to see\nThe other cause: and if the other fall,\nErroneous so must prove what seem'd to thee.\nIf not from side to side this rarity\nPass through, there needs must be a limit, whence\nIts contrary no further lets it pass.\nAnd hence the beam, that from without proceeds,\nMust be pour'd back, as colour comes, through glass\nReflected, which behind it lead conceals.\nNow wilt thou say, that there of murkier hue\nThan in the other part the ray is shown,\nBy being thence refracted farther back.\nFrom this perplexity will free thee soon\nExperience, if thereof thou trial make,\nThe fountain whence your arts derive their streame.\nThree mirrors shalt thou take, and two remove\nFrom thee alike, and more remote the third.\nBetwixt the former pair, shall meet thine eyes;\nThen turn'd toward them, cause behind thy back\nA light to stand, that on the three shall shine,\nAnd thus reflected come to thee from all.\nThough that beheld most distant do not stretch\nA space so ample, yet in brightness thou\nWill own it equaling the rest.  But now,\nAs under snow the ground, if the warm ray\nSmites it, remains dismantled of the hue\nAnd cold, that cover'd it before, so thee,\nDismantled in thy mind, I will inform\nWith light so lively, that the tremulous beam\nShall quiver where it falls.  Within the heaven,\nWhere peace divine inhabits, circles round\nA body, in whose virtue dies the being\nOf all that it contains.  The following heaven,\nThat hath so many lights, this being divides,\nThrough  different essences, from it distinct,\nAnd yet contain'd within it.  The other orbs\nTheir separate distinctions variously\nDispose, for their own seed and produce apt.\nThus do these organs of the world proceed,\nAs thou beholdest now, from step to step,\nTheir influences from above deriving,\nAnd thence transmitting downwards.  Mark me well,\nHow through this passage to the truth I ford,\nThe truth thou lov'st, that thou henceforth alone,\nMay'st know to keep the shallows, safe, untold.\n\n\"The virtue and motion of the sacred orbs,\nAs mallet by the workman's hand, must needs\nBy blessed movers be inspir'd.  This heaven,\nMade beauteous by so many luminaries,\nFrom the deep spirit, that moves its circling sphere,\nIts image takes an impress as a seal:\nAnd as the soul, that dwells within your dust,\nThrough members different, yet together form'd,\nIn different pow'rs resolves itself; e'en so\nThe intellectual efficacy unfolds\nIts goodness multiplied throughout the stars;\nOn its own unity revolving still.\nDifferent virtue compact different\nMakes with the precious body it enlivens,\nWith which it knits, as life in you is knit.\nFrom its original nature full of joy,\nThe virtue mingled through the body shines,\nAs joy through pupil of the living eye.\nFrom hence proceeds, that which from light to light\nSeems different, and not from dense or rare.\nThis is the formal cause, that generates\nProportion'd to its power, the dusk or clear.\"\n\n\n\n\nCANTO III\n\nThat sun, which erst with love my bosom warm'd\nHad of fair truth unveil'd the sweet aspect,\nBy proof of right, and of the false reproof;\nAnd I, to own myself convinc'd and free\nOf doubt, as much as needed, rais'd my head\nErect for speech.  But soon a sight appear'd,\nWhich, so intent to mark it, held me fix'd,\nThat of confession I no longer thought.\n\nAs through translucent and smooth glass, or wave\nClear and unmov'd, and flowing not so deep\nAs that its bed is dark, the shape returns\nSo faint of our impictur'd lineaments,\nThat on white forehead set a pearl as strong\nComes to the eye: such saw I many a face,\nAll stretch'd to speak, from whence I straight conceiv'd\nDelusion opposite to that, which rais'd\nBetween the man and fountain, amorous flame.\n\nSudden, as I perceiv'd them, deeming these\nReflected semblances to see of whom\nThey were, I turn'd mine eyes, and nothing saw;\nThen turn'd them back, directed on the light\nOf my sweet guide, who smiling shot forth beams\nFrom her celestial eyes.  \"Wonder not thou,\"\nShe cry'd, \"at this my smiling, when I see\nThy childish judgment; since not yet on truth\nIt rests the foot, but, as it still is wont,\nMakes thee fall back in unsound vacancy.\nTrue substances are these, which thou behold'st,\nHither through failure of their vow exil'd.\nBut speak thou with them; listen, and believe,\nThat the true light, which fills them with desire,\nPermits not from its beams their feet to stray.\"\n\nStraight to the shadow which for converse seem'd\nMost earnest, I addressed me, and began,\nAs one by over-eagerness perplex'd:\n\"O spirit, born for joy! who in the rays\nOf life eternal, of that sweetness know'st\nThe flavour, which, not tasted, passes far\nAll apprehension, me it well would please,\nIf thou wouldst tell me of thy name, and this\nYour station here.\" Whence she, with kindness prompt,\nAnd eyes glist'ning with smiles: \"Our charity,\nTo any wish by justice introduc'd,\nBars not the door, no more than she above,\nWho would have all her court be like herself.\nI was a virgin sister in the earth;\nAnd if thy mind observe me well, this form,\nWith such addition grac'd of loveliness,\nWill not conceal me long, but thou wilt know\nPiccarda, in the tardiest sphere thus plac'd,\nHere'mid these other blessed also blest.\nOur hearts, whose high affections burn alone\nWith pleasure, from the Holy Spirit conceiv'd,\nAdmitted to his order dwell in joy.\nAnd this condition, which appears so low,\nIs for this cause assign'd us, that our vows\nWere in some part neglected and made void.\"\n\nWhence I to her replied: \"Something divine\nBeams in your countenance, wond'rous fair,\nFrom former knowledge quite transmuting you.\nTherefore to recollect was I so slow.\nBut what thou sayst hath to my memory\nGiven now such aid, that to retrace your forms\nIs easier.  Yet inform me, ye, who here\nAre happy, long ye for a higher place\nMore to behold, and more in love to dwell?\"\n\nShe with those other spirits gently smil'd,\nThen answer'd with such gladness, that she seem'd\nWith love's first flame to glow: \"Brother! our will\nIs in composure settled by the power\nOf charity, who makes us will alone\nWhat we possess, and nought beyond desire;\nIf we should wish to be exalted more,\nThen must our wishes jar with the high will\nOf him, who sets us here, which in these orbs\nThou wilt confess not possible, if here\nTo be in charity must needs befall,\nAnd if her nature well thou contemplate.\nRather it is inherent in this state\nOf blessedness, to keep ourselves within\nThe divine will, by which our wills with his\nAre one.  So that as we from step to step\nAre plac'd throughout this kingdom, pleases all,\nE'en as our King, who in us plants his will;\nAnd in his will is our tranquillity;\nIt is the mighty ocean, whither tends\nWhatever it creates and nature makes.\"\n\nThen saw I clearly how each spot in heav'n\nIs Paradise, though with like gracious dew\nThe supreme virtue show'r not over all.\n\nBut as it chances, if one sort of food\nHath satiated, and of another still\nThe appetite remains, that this is ask'd,\nAnd thanks for that return'd; e'en so did I\nIn word and motion, bent from her to learn\nWhat web it was, through which she had not drawn\nThe shuttle to its point.  She thus began:\n\"Exalted worth and perfectness of life\nThe Lady higher up enshrine in heaven,\nBy whose pure laws upon your nether earth\nThe robe and veil they wear, to that intent,\nThat e'en till death they may keep watch or sleep\nWith their great bridegroom, who accepts each vow,\nWhich to his gracious pleasure love conforms.\nfrom the world, to follow her, when young\nEscap'd; and, in her vesture mantling me,\nMade promise of the way her sect enjoins.\nThereafter men, for ill than good more apt,\nForth snatch'd me from the pleasant cloister's pale.\nGod knows how after that my life was fram'd.\nThis other splendid shape, which thou beholdst\nAt my right side, burning with all the light\nOf this our orb, what of myself I tell\nMay to herself apply.  From her, like me\nA sister, with like violence were torn\nThe saintly folds, that shaded her fair brows.\nE'en when she to the world again was brought\nIn spite of her own will and better wont,\nYet not for that the bosom's inward veil\nDid she renounce.  This is the luminary\nOf mighty Constance, who from that loud blast,\nWhich blew the second over Suabia's realm,\nThat power produc'd, which was the third and last.\"\n\nShe ceas'd from further talk, and then began\n\"Ave Maria\" singing, and with that song\nVanish'd, as heavy substance through deep wave.\n\nMine eye, that far as it was capable,\nPursued her, when in dimness she was lost,\nTurn'd to the mark where greater want impell'd,\nAnd bent on Beatrice all its gaze.\nBut she as light'ning beam'd upon my looks:\nSo that the sight sustain'd it not at first.\nWhence I to question her became less prompt.\n\n\n\n\nCANTO IV\n\nBetween two kinds of food, both equally\nRemote and tempting, first a man might die\nOf hunger, ere he one could freely choose.\nE'en so would stand a lamb between the maw\nOf two fierce wolves, in dread of both alike:\nE'en so between two deer a dog would stand,\nWherefore, if I was silent, fault nor praise\nI to myself impute, by equal doubts\nHeld in suspense, since of necessity\nIt happen'd.  Silent was I, yet desire\nWas painted in my looks; and thus I spake\nMy wish more earnestly than language could.\n\nAs Daniel, when the haughty king he freed\nFrom ire, that spurr'd him on to deeds unjust\nAnd violent; so look'd Beatrice then.\n\n\"Well I discern,\" she thus her words address'd,\n\"How contrary desires each way constrain thee,\nSo that thy anxious thought is in itself\nBound up and stifled, nor breathes freely forth.\nThou arguest; if the good intent remain;\nWhat reason that another's violence\nShould stint the measure of my fair desert?\n\n\"Cause too thou findst for doubt, in that it seems,\nThat spirits to the stars, as Plato deem'd,\nReturn.  These are the questions which thy will\nUrge equally; and therefore I the first\nOf that will treat which hath the more of gall.\nOf seraphim he who is most ensky'd,\nMoses and Samuel, and either John,\nChoose which thou wilt, nor even Mary's self,\nHave not in any other heav'n their seats,\nThan have those spirits which so late thou saw'st;\nNor more or fewer years exist; but all\nMake the first circle beauteous, diversely\nPartaking of sweet life, as more or less\nAfflation of eternal bliss pervades them.\nHere were they shown thee, not that fate assigns\nThis for their sphere, but for a sign to thee\nOf that celestial furthest from the height.\nThus needs, that ye may apprehend, we speak:\nSince from things sensible alone ye learn\nThat, which digested rightly after turns\nTo intellectual.  For no other cause\nThe scripture, condescending graciously\nTo your perception, hands and feet to God\nAttributes, nor so means: and holy church\nDoth represent with human countenance\nGabriel, and Michael, and him who made\nTobias whole.  Unlike what here thou seest,\nThe judgment of Timaeus, who affirms\nEach soul restor'd to its particular star,\nBelieving it to have been taken thence,\nWhen nature gave it to inform her mold:\nSince to appearance his intention is\nE'en what his words declare: or else to shun\nDerision, haply thus he hath disguis'd\nHis true opinion.  If his meaning be,\nThat to the influencing of these orbs revert\nThe honour and the blame in human acts,\nPerchance he doth not wholly miss the truth.\nThis principle, not understood aright,\nErewhile perverted well nigh all the world;\nSo that it fell to fabled names of Jove,\nAnd Mercury, and Mars.  That other doubt,\nWhich moves thee, is less harmful; for it brings\nNo peril of removing thee from me.\n\n\"That, to the eye of man, our justice seems\nUnjust, is argument for faith, and not\nFor heretic declension.  To the end\nThis truth may stand more clearly in your view,\nI will content thee even to thy wish\n\n\"If violence be, when that which suffers, nought\nConsents to that which forceth, not for this\nThese spirits stood exculpate.  For the will,\nThat will not, still survives unquench'd, and doth\nAs nature doth in fire, tho' violence\nWrest it a thousand times; for, if it yield\nOr more or less, so far it follows force.\nAnd thus did these, whom they had power to seek\nThe hallow'd place again.  In them, had will\nBeen perfect, such as once upon the bars\nHeld Laurence firm, or wrought in Scaevola\nTo his own hand remorseless, to the path,\nWhence they were drawn, their steps had hasten'd back,\nWhen liberty return'd: but in too few\nResolve so steadfast dwells.  And by these words\nIf duly weigh'd, that argument is void,\nWhich oft might have perplex'd thee still.  But now\nAnother question thwarts thee, which to solve\nMight try thy patience without better aid.\nI have, no doubt, instill'd into thy mind,\nThat blessed spirit may not lie; since near\nThe source of primal truth it dwells for aye:\nAnd thou might'st after of Piccarda learn\nThat Constance held affection to the veil;\nSo that she seems to contradict me here.\nNot seldom, brother, it hath chanc'd for men\nTo do what they had gladly left undone,\nYet to shun peril they have done amiss:\nE'en as Alcmaeon, at his father's suit\nSlew his own mother, so made pitiless\nNot to lose pity.  On this point bethink thee,\nThat force and will are blended in such wise\nAs not to make the' offence excusable.\nAbsolute will agrees not to the wrong,\nThat inasmuch as there is fear of woe\nFrom non-compliance, it agrees.  Of will\nThus absolute Piccarda spake, and I\nOf th' other; so that both have truly said.\"\n\nSuch was the flow of that pure rill, that well'd\nFrom forth the fountain of all truth; and such\nThe rest, that to my wond'ring thoughts I found.\n\n\"O thou of primal love the prime delight!\nGoddess!\"  I straight reply'd, \"whose lively words\nStill shed new heat and vigour through my soul!\nAffection fails me to requite thy grace\nWith equal sum of gratitude: be his\nTo recompense, who sees and can reward thee.\nWell I discern, that by that truth alone\nEnlighten'd, beyond which no truth may roam,\nOur mind can satisfy her thirst to know:\nTherein she resteth, e'en as in his lair\nThe wild beast, soon as she hath reach'd that bound,\nAnd she hath power to reach it; else desire\nWere given to no end.  And thence doth doubt\nSpring, like a shoot, around the stock of truth;\nAnd it is nature which from height to height\nOn to the summit prompts us.  This invites,\nThis doth assure me, lady, rev'rently\nTo ask thee of other truth, that yet\nIs dark to me.  I fain would know, if man\nBy other works well done may so supply\nThe failure of his vows, that in your scale\nThey lack not weight.\"  I spake; and on me straight\nBeatrice look'd with eyes that shot forth sparks\nOf love celestial in such copious stream,\nThat, virtue sinking in me overpower'd,\nI turn'd, and downward bent confus'd my sight.\n\n\n\n\nCANTO V\n\n\"If beyond earthly wont, the flame of love\nIllume me, so that I o'ercome thy power\nOf vision, marvel not: but learn the cause\nIn that perfection of the sight, which soon\nAs apprehending, hasteneth on to reach\nThe good it apprehends.  I well discern,\nHow in thine intellect already shines\nThe light eternal, which to view alone\nNe'er fails to kindle love; and if aught else\nYour love seduces, 't is but that it shows\nSome ill-mark'd vestige of that primal beam.\n\n\"This would'st thou know, if failure of the vow\nBy other service may be so supplied,\nAs from self-question to assure the soul.\"\n\nThus she her words, not heedless of my wish,\nBegan; and thus, as one who breaks not off\nDiscourse, continued in her saintly strain.\n\"Supreme of gifts, which God creating gave\nOf his free bounty, sign most evident\nOf goodness, and in his account most priz'd,\nWas liberty of will, the boon wherewith\nAll intellectual creatures, and them sole\nHe hath endow'd.  Hence now thou mayst infer\nOf what high worth the vow, which so is fram'd\nThat when man offers, God well-pleas'd accepts;\nFor in the compact between God and him,\nThis treasure, such as I describe it to thee,\nHe makes the victim, and of his own act.\nWhat compensation therefore may he find?\nIf that, whereof thou hast oblation made,\nBy using well thou think'st to consecrate,\nThou would'st of theft do charitable deed.\nThus I resolve thee of the greater point.\n\n\"But forasmuch as holy church, herein\nDispensing, seems to contradict the truth\nI have discover'd to thee, yet behooves\nThou rest a little longer at the board,\nEre the crude aliment, which thou hast taken,\nDigested fitly to nutrition turn.\nOpen thy mind to what I now unfold,\nAnd give it inward keeping.  Knowledge comes\nOf learning well retain'd, unfruitful else.\n\n\"This sacrifice in essence of two things\nConsisteth; one is that, whereof 't is made,\nThe covenant the other.  For the last,\nIt ne'er is cancell'd if not kept: and hence\nI spake erewhile so strictly of its force.\nFor this it was enjoin'd the Israelites,\nThough leave were giv'n them, as thou know'st, to change\nThe offering, still to offer.  Th' other part,\nThe matter and the substance of the vow,\nMay well be such, to that without offence\nIt may for other substance be exchang'd.\nBut at his own discretion none may shift\nThe burden on his shoulders, unreleas'd\nBy either key, the yellow and the white.\nNor deem of any change, as less than vain,\nIf the last bond be not within the new\nIncluded, as the quatre in the six.\nNo satisfaction therefore can be paid\nFor what so precious in the balance weighs,\nThat all in counterpoise must kick the beam.\nTake then no vow at random: ta'en, with faith\nPreserve it; yet not bent, as Jephthah once,\nBlindly to execute a rash resolve,\nWhom better it had suited to exclaim,\n'I have done ill,' than to redeem his pledge\nBy doing worse or, not unlike to him\nIn folly, that great leader of the Greeks:\nWhence, on the alter, Iphigenia mourn'd\nHer virgin beauty, and hath since made mourn\nBoth wise and simple, even all, who hear\nOf so fell sacrifice.  Be ye more staid,\nO Christians, not, like feather, by each wind\nRemovable: nor think to cleanse ourselves\nIn every water.  Either testament,\nThe old and new, is yours: and for your guide\nThe shepherd of the church let this suffice\nTo save you.  When by evil lust entic'd,\nRemember ye be men, not senseless beasts;\nNor let the Jew, who dwelleth in your streets,\nHold you in mock'ry.  Be not, as the lamb,\nThat, fickle wanton, leaves its mother's milk,\nTo dally with itself in idle play.\"\n\nSuch were the words that Beatrice spake:\nThese ended, to that region, where the world\nIs liveliest, full of fond desire she turn'd.\n\nThough mainly prompt new question to propose,\nHer silence and chang'd look did keep me dumb.\nAnd as the arrow, ere the cord is still,\nLeapeth unto its mark; so on we sped\nInto the second realm.  There I beheld\nThe dame, so joyous enter, that the orb\nGrew brighter at her smiles; and, if the star\nWere mov'd to gladness, what then was my cheer,\nWhom nature hath made apt for every change!\n\nAs in a quiet and clear lake the fish,\nIf aught approach them from without, do draw\nTowards it, deeming it their food; so drew\nFull more than thousand splendours towards us,\nAnd in each one was heard: \"Lo! one arriv'd\nTo multiply our loves!\" and as each came\nThe shadow, streaming forth effulgence new,\nWitness'd augmented joy.  Here, reader! think,\nIf thou didst miss the sequel of my tale,\nTo know the rest how sorely thou wouldst crave;\nAnd thou shalt see what vehement desire\nPossess'd me, as soon as these had met my view,\nTo know their state.  \"O born in happy hour!\nThou to whom grace vouchsafes, or ere thy close\nOf fleshly warfare, to behold the thrones\nOf that eternal triumph, know to us\nThe light communicated, which through heaven\nExpatiates without bound.  Therefore, if aught\nThou of our beams wouldst borrow for thine aid,\nSpare not; and of our radiance take thy fill.\"\n\nThus of those piteous spirits one bespake me;\nAnd Beatrice next: \"Say on; and trust\nAs unto gods!\"--\"How in the light supreme\nThou harbour'st, and from thence the virtue bring'st,\nThat, sparkling in thine eyes, denotes thy joy,\nI mark; but, who thou art, am still to seek;\nOr wherefore, worthy spirit! for thy lot\nThis sphere assign'd, that oft from mortal ken\nIs veil'd by others' beams.\"  I said, and turn'd\nToward the lustre, that with greeting, kind\nErewhile had hail'd me.  Forthwith brighter far\nThan erst, it wax'd: and, as himself the sun\nHides through excess of light, when his warm gaze\nHath on the mantle of thick vapours prey'd;\nWithin its proper ray the saintly shape\nWas, through increase of gladness, thus conceal'd;\nAnd, shrouded so in splendour answer'd me,\nE'en as the tenour of my song declares.\n\n\n\n\nCANTO VI\n\n\"After that Constantine the eagle turn'd\nAgainst the motions of the heav'n, that roll'd\nConsenting with its course, when he of yore,\nLavinia's spouse, was leader of the flight,\nA hundred years twice told and more, his seat\nAt Europe's extreme point, the bird of Jove\nHeld, near the mountains, whence he issued first.\nThere, under shadow of his sacred plumes\nSwaying the world, till through successive hands\nTo mine he came devolv'd.  Caesar I was,\nAnd am Justinian; destin'd by the will\nOf that prime love, whose influence I feel,\nFrom vain excess to clear th' encumber'd laws.\nOr ere that work engag'd me, I did hold\nChrist's nature merely human, with such faith\nContented.  But the blessed Agapete,\nWho was chief shepherd, he with warning voice\nTo the true faith recall'd me.  I believ'd\nHis words: and what he taught, now plainly see,\nAs thou in every contradiction seest\nThe true and false oppos'd.  Soon as my feet\nWere to the church reclaim'd, to my great task,\nBy inspiration of God's grace impell'd,\nI gave me wholly, and consign'd mine arms\nTo Belisarius, with whom heaven's right hand\nWas link'd in such conjointment, 't was a sign\nThat I should rest.  To thy first question thus\nI shape mine answer, which were ended here,\nBut that its tendency doth prompt perforce\nTo some addition; that thou well, mayst mark\nWhat reason on each side they have to plead,\nBy whom that holiest banner is withstood,\nBoth who pretend its power and who oppose.\n\n\"Beginning from that hour, when Pallas died\nTo give it rule, behold the valorous deeds\nHave made it worthy reverence.  Not unknown\nTo thee, how for three hundred years and more\nIt dwelt in Alba, up to those fell lists\nWhere for its sake were met the rival three;\nNor aught unknown to thee, which it achiev'd\nDown to the Sabines' wrong to Lucrece' woe,\nWith its sev'n kings conqu'ring the nation round;\nNor all it wrought, by Roman worthies home\n'Gainst Brennus and th' Epirot prince, and hosts\nOf single chiefs, or states in league combin'd\nOf social warfare; hence Torquatus stern,\nAnd Quintius nam'd of his neglected locks,\nThe Decii, and the Fabii hence acquir'd\nTheir fame, which I with duteous zeal embalm.\nBy it the pride of Arab hordes was quell'd,\nWhen they led on by Hannibal o'erpass'd\nThe Alpine rocks, whence glide thy currents, Po!\nBeneath its guidance, in their prime of days\nScipio and Pompey triumph'd; and that hill,\nUnder whose summit thou didst see the light,\nRued its stern bearing.  After, near the hour,\nWhen heav'n was minded that o'er all the world\nHis own deep calm should brood, to Caesar's hand\nDid Rome consign it; and what then it wrought\nFrom Var unto the Rhine, saw Isere's flood,\nSaw Loire and Seine, and every vale, that fills\nThe torrent Rhone.  What after that it wrought,\nWhen from Ravenna it came forth, and leap'd\nThe Rubicon, was of so bold a flight,\nThat tongue nor pen may follow it.  Tow'rds Spain\nIt wheel'd its bands, then tow'rd Dyrrachium smote,\nAnd on Pharsalia with so fierce a plunge,\nE'en the warm Nile was conscious to the pang;\nIts native shores Antandros, and the streams\nOf Simois revisited, and there\nWhere Hector lies; then ill for Ptolemy\nHis pennons shook again; lightning thence fell\nOn Juba; and the next upon your west,\nAt sound of the Pompeian trump, return'd.\n\n\"What following and in its next bearer's gripe\nIt wrought, is now by Cassius and Brutus\nBark'd off in hell, and by Perugia's sons\nAnd Modena's was mourn'd.  Hence weepeth still\nSad Cleopatra, who, pursued by it,\nTook from the adder black and sudden death.\nWith him it ran e'en to the Red Sea coast;\nWith him compos'd the world to such a peace,\nThat of his temple Janus barr'd the door.\n\n\"But all the mighty standard yet had wrought,\nAnd was appointed to perform thereafter,\nThroughout the mortal kingdom which it sway'd,\nFalls in appearance dwindled and obscur'd,\nIf one with steady eye and perfect thought\nOn the third Caesar look; for to his hands,\nThe living Justice, in whose breath I move,\nCommitted glory, e'en into his hands,\nTo execute the vengeance of its wrath.\n\n\"Hear now and wonder at what next I tell.\nAfter with Titus it was sent to wreak\nVengeance for vengeance of the ancient sin,\nAnd, when the Lombard tooth, with fangs impure,\nDid gore the bosom of the holy church,\nUnder its wings victorious, Charlemagne\nSped to her rescue.  Judge then for thyself\nOf those, whom I erewhile accus'd to thee,\nWhat they are, and how grievous their offending,\nWho are the cause of all your ills.  The one\nAgainst the universal ensign rears\nThe yellow lilies, and with partial aim\nThat to himself the other arrogates:\nSo that 't is hard to see which more offends.\nBe yours, ye Ghibellines, to veil your arts\nBeneath another standard: ill is this\nFollow'd of him, who severs it and justice:\nAnd let not with his Guelphs the new-crown'd Charles\nAssail it, but those talons hold in dread,\nWhich from a lion of more lofty port\nHave rent the easing.  Many a time ere now\nThe sons have for the sire's transgression wail'd;\nNor let him trust the fond belief, that heav'n\nWill truck its armour for his lilied shield.\n\n\"This little star is furnish'd with good spirits,\nWhose mortal lives were busied to that end,\nThat honour and renown might wait on them:\nAnd, when desires thus err in their intention,\nTrue love must needs ascend with slacker beam.\nBut it is part of our delight, to measure\nOur wages with the merit; and admire\nThe close proportion.  Hence doth heav'nly justice\nTemper so evenly affection in us,\nIt ne'er can warp to any wrongfulness.\nOf diverse voices is sweet music made:\nSo in our life the different degrees\nRender sweet harmony among these wheels.\n\n\"Within the pearl, that now encloseth us,\nShines Romeo's light, whose goodly deed and fair\nMet ill acceptance.  But the Provencals,\nThat were his foes, have little cause for mirth.\nIll shapes that man his course, who makes his wrong\nOf other's worth.  Four daughters were there born\nTo Raymond Berenger, and every one\nBecame a queen; and this for him did Romeo,\nThough of mean state and from a foreign land.\nYet envious tongues incited him to ask\nA reckoning of that just one, who return'd\nTwelve fold to him for ten.  Aged and poor\nHe parted thence: and if the world did know\nThe heart he had, begging his life by morsels,\n'T would deem the praise, it yields him, scantly dealt.\"\n\n\n\n\nCANTO VII\n\n\"Hosanna Sanctus Deus Sabaoth\nSuperillustrans claritate tua\nFelices ignes horum malahoth!\"\nThus chanting saw I turn that substance bright\nWith fourfold lustre to its orb again,\nRevolving; and the rest unto their dance\nWith it mov'd also; and like swiftest sparks,\nIn sudden distance from my sight were veil'd.\n\nMe doubt possess'd, and \"Speak,\" it whisper'd me,\n\"Speak, speak unto thy lady, that she quench\nThy thirst with drops of sweetness.\"  Yet blank awe,\nWhich lords it o'er me, even at the sound\nOf Beatrice's name, did bow me down\nAs one in slumber held.  Not long that mood\nBeatrice suffer'd: she, with such a smile,\nAs might have made one blest amid the flames,\nBeaming upon me, thus her words began:\n\"Thou in thy thought art pond'ring (as I deem),\nAnd what I deem is truth how just revenge\nCould be with justice punish'd: from which doubt\nI soon will free thee; so thou mark my words;\nFor they of weighty matter shall possess thee.\n\n\"That man, who was unborn, himself condemn'd,\nAnd, in himself, all, who since him have liv'd,\nHis offspring: whence, below, the human kind\nLay sick in grievous error many an age;\nUntil it pleas'd the Word of God to come\nAmongst them down, to his own person joining\nThe nature, from its Maker far estrang'd,\nBy the mere act of his eternal love.\nContemplate here the wonder I unfold.\nThe nature with its Maker thus conjoin'd,\nCreated first was blameless, pure and good;\nBut through itself alone was driven forth\nFrom Paradise, because it had eschew'd\nThe way of truth and life, to evil turn'd.\nNe'er then was penalty so just as that\nInflicted by the cross, if thou regard\nThe nature in assumption doom'd: ne'er wrong\nSo great, in reference to him, who took\nSuch nature on him, and endur'd the doom.\nGod therefore and the Jews one sentence pleased:\nSo different effects flow'd from one act,\nAnd heav'n was open'd, though the earth did quake.\nCount it not hard henceforth, when thou dost hear\nThat a just vengeance was by righteous court\nJustly reveng'd.  But yet I see thy mind\nBy thought on thought arising sore perplex'd,\nAnd with how vehement desire it asks\nSolution of the maze.  What I have heard,\nIs plain, thou sayst: but wherefore God this way\nFor our redemption chose, eludes my search.\n\n\"Brother! no eye of man not perfected,\nNor fully ripen'd in the flame of love,\nMay fathom this decree.  It is a mark,\nIn sooth, much aim'd at, and but little kenn'd:\nAnd I will therefore show thee why such way\nWas worthiest.  The celestial love, that spume\nAll envying in its bounty, in itself\nWith such effulgence blazeth, as sends forth\nAll beauteous things eternal.  What distils\nImmediate thence, no end of being knows,\nBearing its seal immutably impress'd.\nWhatever thence immediate falls, is free,\nFree wholly, uncontrollable by power\nOf each thing new: by such conformity\nMore grateful to its author, whose bright beams,\nThough all partake their shining, yet in those\nAre liveliest, which resemble him the most.\nThese tokens of pre-eminence on man\nLargely bestow'd, if any of them fail,\nHe needs must forfeit his nobility,\nNo longer stainless.  Sin alone is that,\nWhich doth disfranchise him, and make unlike\nTo the chief good; for that its light in him\nIs darken'd.  And to dignity thus lost\nIs no return; unless, where guilt makes void,\nHe for ill pleasure pay with equal pain.\nYour nature, which entirely in its seed\nTrangress'd, from these distinctions fell, no less\nThan from its state in Paradise; nor means\nFound of recovery (search all methods out\nAs strickly as thou may) save one of these,\nThe only fords were left through which to wade,\nEither that God had of his courtesy\nReleas'd him merely, or else man himself\nFor his own folly by himself aton'd.\n\n\"Fix now thine eye, intently as thou canst,\nOn th' everlasting counsel, and explore,\nInstructed by my words, the dread abyss.\n\n\"Man in himself had ever lack'd the means\nOf satisfaction, for he could not stoop\nObeying, in humility so low,\nAs high he, disobeying, thought to soar:\nAnd for this reason he had vainly tried\nOut of his own sufficiency to pay\nThe rigid satisfaction.  Then behooved\nThat God should by his own ways lead him back\nUnto the life, from whence he fell, restor'd:\nBy both his ways, I mean, or one alone.\nBut since the deed is ever priz'd the more,\nThe more the doer's good intent appears,\nGoodness celestial, whose broad signature\nIs on the universe, of all its ways\nTo raise ye up, was fain to leave out none,\nNor aught so vast or so magnificent,\nEither for him who gave or who receiv'd\nBetween the last night and the primal day,\nWas or can be.  For God more bounty show'd.\nGiving himself to make man capable\nOf his return to life, than had the terms\nBeen mere and unconditional release.\nAnd for his justice, every method else\nWere all too scant, had not the Son of God\nHumbled himself to put on mortal flesh.\n\n\"Now, to fulfil each wish of thine, remains\nI somewhat further to thy view unfold.\nThat thou mayst see as clearly as myself.\n\n\"I see, thou sayst, the air, the fire I see,\nThe earth and water, and all things of them\nCompounded, to corruption turn, and soon\nDissolve.  Yet these were also things create,\nBecause, if what were told me, had been true\nThey from corruption had been therefore free.\n\n\"The angels, O my brother! and this clime\nWherein thou art, impassible and pure,\nI call created, as indeed they are\nIn their whole being.  But the elements,\nWhich thou hast nam'd, and what of them is made,\nAre by created virtue' inform'd: create\nTheir substance, and create the' informing virtue\nIn these bright stars, that round them circling move\nThe soul of every brute and of each plant,\nThe ray and motion of the sacred lights,\nWith complex potency attract and turn.\nBut this our life the' eternal good inspires\nImmediate, and enamours of itself;\nSo that our wishes rest for ever here.\n\n\"And hence thou mayst by inference conclude\nOur resurrection certain, if thy mind\nConsider how the human flesh was fram'd,\nWhen both our parents at the first were made.\"\n\n\n\n\nCANTO VIII\n\nThe world was in its day of peril dark\nWont to believe the dotage of fond love\nFrom the fair Cyprian deity, who rolls\nIn her third epicycle, shed on men\nBy stream of potent radiance: therefore they\nOf elder time, in their old error blind,\nNot her alone with sacrifice ador'd\nAnd invocation, but like honours paid\nTo Cupid and Dione, deem'd of them\nHer mother, and her son, him whom they feign'd\nTo sit in Dido's bosom: and from her,\nWhom I have sung preluding, borrow'd they\nThe appellation of that star, which views,\nNow obvious and now averse, the sun.\n\nI was not ware that I was wafted up\nInto  its orb; but the new loveliness\nThat grac'd my lady, gave me ample proof\nThat we had entered there.  And as in flame\nA sparkle is distinct, or voice in voice\nDiscern'd, when one its even tenour keeps,\nThe other comes and goes; so in that light\nI other luminaries saw, that cours'd\nIn circling motion, rapid more or less,\nAs their eternal phases each impels.\n\nNever was blast from vapour charged with cold,\nWhether invisible to eye or no,\nDescended with such speed, it had not seem'd\nTo linger in dull tardiness, compar'd\nTo those celestial lights, that tow'rds us came,\nLeaving the circuit of their joyous ring,\nConducted by the lofty seraphim.\nAnd after them, who in the van appear'd,\nSuch an hosanna sounded, as hath left\nDesire, ne'er since extinct in me, to hear\nRenew'd the strain.  Then parting from the rest\nOne near us drew, and sole began: \"We all\nAre ready at thy pleasure, well dispos'd\nTo do thee gentle service.  We are they,\nTo whom thou in the world erewhile didst Sing\n'O ye! whose intellectual ministry\nMoves the third heaven!' and in one orb we roll,\nOne motion, one impulse, with those who rule\nPrincedoms in heaven; yet are of love so full,\nThat to please thee 't will be as sweet to rest.\"\n\nAfter mine eyes had with meek reverence\nSought the celestial guide, and were by her\nAssur'd, they turn'd again unto the light\nWho had so largely promis'd, and with voice\nThat bare the lively pressure of my zeal,\n\"Tell who ye are,\" I cried.  Forthwith it grew\nIn size and splendour, through augmented joy;\nAnd thus it answer'd: \"A short date below\nThe world possess'd me.  Had the time been more,\nMuch evil, that will come, had never chanc'd.\nMy gladness hides thee from me, which doth shine\nAround, and shroud me, as an animal\nIn its own silk enswath'd.  Thou lov'dst me well,\nAnd had'st good cause; for had my sojourning\nBeen longer on the earth, the love I bare thee\nHad put forth more than blossoms.  The left bank,\nThat Rhone, when he hath mix'd with Sorga, laves.\n\n\"In me its lord expected, and that horn\nOf fair Ausonia, with its boroughs old,\nBari, and Croton, and Gaeta pil'd,\nFrom where the Trento disembogues his waves,\nWith Verde mingled, to the salt sea-flood.\nAlready on my temples beam'd the crown,\nWhich gave me sov'reignty over the land\nBy Danube wash'd, whenas he strays beyond\nThe limits of his German shores.  The realm,\nWhere, on the gulf by stormy Eurus lash'd,\nBetwixt Pelorus and Pachynian heights,\nThe beautiful Trinacria lies in gloom\n(Not through Typhaeus, but the vap'ry cloud\nBituminous upsteam'd), THAT too did look\nTo have its scepter wielded by a race\nOf monarchs, sprung through me from Charles and Rodolph;\nhad not ill lording which doth spirit up\nThe people ever, in Palermo rais'd\nThe shout of 'death,' re-echo'd loud and long.\nHad but my brother's foresight kenn'd as much,\nHe had been warier that the greedy want\nOf Catalonia might not work his bale.\nAnd truly need there is, that he forecast,\nOr other for him, lest more freight be laid\nOn his already over-laden bark.\nNature in him, from bounty fall'n to thrift,\nWould ask the  guard of braver arms, than such\nAs only care to have their coffers fill'd.\"\n\n\"My liege, it doth enhance the joy thy words\nInfuse into me, mighty as it is,\nTo think my gladness manifest to thee,\nAs to myself, who own it, when thou lookst\nInto the source and limit of all good,\nThere, where thou markest that which thou dost speak,\nThence priz'd of me the more.  Glad thou hast made me.\nNow make intelligent, clearing the doubt\nThy speech hath raised in me; for much I muse,\nHow bitter can spring up, when sweet is sown.\"\n\nI thus inquiring; he forthwith replied:\n\"If I have power to show one truth, soon that\nShall face thee, which thy questioning declares\nBehind thee now conceal'd.  The Good, that guides\nAnd blessed makes this realm, which thou dost mount,\nOrdains its providence to be the virtue\nIn these great bodies: nor th' all perfect Mind\nUpholds their nature merely, but in them\nTheir energy to save: for nought, that lies\nWithin the range of that unerring bow,\nBut is as level with the destin'd aim,\nAs ever mark to arrow's point oppos'd.\nWere it not thus, these heavens, thou dost visit,\nWould their effect so work, it would not be\nArt, but destruction; and this may not chance,\nIf th' intellectual powers, that move these stars,\nFail not, or who, first faulty made them fail.\nWilt thou this truth more clearly evidenc'd?\"\n\nTo whom I thus: \"It is enough: no fear,\nI see, lest nature in her part should tire.\"\n\nHe straight rejoin'd: \"Say, were it worse for man,\nIf he liv'd not in fellowship on earth?\"\n\n\"Yea,\" answer'd I; \"nor here a reason needs.\"\n\n\"And may that be, if different estates\nGrow not of different duties in your life?\nConsult your teacher, and he tells you 'no.\"'\n\nThus did he come, deducing to this point,\nAnd then concluded: \"For this cause behooves,\nThe roots, from whence your operations come,\nMust differ.  Therefore one is Solon born;\nAnother, Xerxes; and Melchisidec\nA third; and he a fourth, whose airy voyage\nCost him his son.  In her circuitous course,\nNature, that is the seal to mortal wax,\nDoth well her art, but no distinctions owns\n'Twixt one or other household.  Hence befalls\nThat Esau is so wide of Jacob: hence\nQuirinus of so base a father springs,\nHe dates from Mars his lineage.  Were it not\nThat providence celestial overrul'd,\nNature, in generation, must the path\nTrac'd by the generator, still pursue\nUnswervingly.  Thus place I in thy sight\nThat, which was late behind thee.  But, in sign\nOf more affection for thee, 't is my will\nThou wear this corollary.  Nature ever\nFinding discordant fortune, like all seed\nOut of its proper climate, thrives but ill.\nAnd were the world below content to mark\nAnd work on the foundation nature lays,\nIt would not lack supply of excellence.\nBut ye perversely to religion strain\nHim, who was born to gird on him the sword,\nAnd of the fluent phrasemen make your king;\nTherefore your steps have wander'd from the paths.\"\n\n\n\n\nCANTO IX\n\nAfter solution of my doubt, thy Charles,\nO fair Clemenza, of the treachery spake\nThat must befall his seed: but, \"Tell it not,\"\nSaid he, \"and let the destin'd years come round.\"\nNor may I tell thee more, save that the meed\nOf sorrow well-deserv'd shall quit your wrongs.\n\nAnd now the visage of that saintly light\nWas to the sun, that fills it, turn'd again,\nAs to the good, whose plenitude of bliss\nSufficeth all.  O ye misguided souls!\nInfatuate, who from such a good estrange\nYour hearts, and bend your gaze on vanity,\nAlas for you!--And lo! toward me, next,\nAnother of those splendent forms approach'd,\nThat, by its outward bright'ning, testified\nThe will it had to pleasure me.  The eyes\nOf Beatrice, resting, as before,\nFirmly upon me, manifested forth\nApproval of my wish.  \"And O,\" I cried,\n\"Blest spirit! quickly be my will perform'd;\nAnd prove thou to me, that my inmost thoughts\nI can reflect on thee.\"  Thereat the light,\nThat yet was new to me, from the recess,\nWhere it before was singing, thus began,\nAs one who joys in kindness: \"In that part\nOf the deprav'd Italian land, which lies\nBetween Rialto, and the fountain-springs\nOf Brenta and of Piava, there doth rise,\nBut to no lofty eminence, a hill,\nFrom whence erewhile a firebrand did descend,\nThat sorely sheet the region.  From one root\nI and it sprang; my name on earth Cunizza:\nAnd here I glitter, for that by its light\nThis star o'ercame me.  Yet I naught repine,\nNor grudge myself the cause of this my lot,\nWhich haply vulgar hearts can scarce conceive.\n\n\"This jewel, that is next me in our heaven,\nLustrous and costly, great renown hath left,\nAnd not to perish, ere these hundred years\nFive times absolve their round.  Consider thou,\nIf to excel be worthy man's endeavour,\nWhen such life may attend the first.  Yet they\nCare not for this, the crowd that now are girt\nBy Adice and Tagliamento, still\nImpenitent, tho' scourg'd.  The hour is near,\nWhen for their stubbornness at Padua's marsh\nThe water shall be chang'd, that laves Vicena\nAnd where Cagnano meets with Sile, one\nLords it, and bears his head aloft, for whom\nThe web is now a-warping.  Feltro too\nShall sorrow for its godless shepherd's fault,\nOf so deep stain, that never, for the like,\nWas Malta's bar unclos'd.  Too large should be\nThe skillet, that would hold Ferrara's blood,\nAnd wearied he, who ounce by ounce would weight it,\nThe which this priest, in show of party-zeal,\nCourteous will give; nor will the gift ill suit\nThe country's custom.  We descry above,\nMirrors, ye call them thrones, from which to us\nReflected shine the judgments of our God:\nWhence these our sayings we avouch for good.\"\n\nShe ended, and appear'd on other thoughts\nIntent, re-ent'ring on the wheel she late\nHad left.  That other joyance meanwhile wax'd\nA thing to marvel at, in splendour glowing,\nLike choicest ruby stricken by the sun,\nFor, in that upper clime, effulgence comes\nOf gladness, as here laughter: and below,\nAs the mind saddens, murkier grows the shade.\n\n\"God seeth all: and in him is thy sight,\"\nSaid I, \"blest Spirit!  Therefore will of his\nCannot to thee be dark.  Why then delays\nThy voice to satisfy my wish untold,\nThat voice which joins the inexpressive song,\nPastime of heav'n, the which those ardours sing,\nThat cowl them with six shadowing wings outspread?\nI would not wait thy asking, wert thou known\nTo me, as thoroughly I to thee am known.\"\n\nHe forthwith answ'ring, thus his words began:\n\"The valley' of waters, widest next to that\nWhich doth the earth engarland, shapes its course,\nBetween discordant shores, against the sun\nInward so far, it makes meridian there,\nWhere was before th' horizon.  Of that vale\nDwelt I upon the shore, 'twixt Ebro's stream\nAnd Macra's, that divides with passage brief\nGenoan bounds from Tuscan.  East and west\nAre nearly one to Begga and my land,\nWhose haven erst was with its own blood warm.\nWho knew my name were wont to call me Folco:\nAnd I did bear impression of this heav'n,\nThat now bears mine: for not with fiercer flame\nGlow'd Belus' daughter, injuring alike\nSichaeus and Creusa, than did I,\nLong as it suited the unripen'd down\nThat fledg'd my cheek: nor she of Rhodope,\nThat was beguiled of Demophoon;\nNor Jove's son, when the charms of Iole\nWere shrin'd within his heart.  And yet there hides\nNo sorrowful repentance here, but mirth,\nNot for the fault (that doth not come to mind),\nBut for the virtue, whose o'erruling sway\nAnd providence have wrought thus quaintly.  Here\nThe skill is look'd into, that fashioneth\nWith such effectual working, and the good\nDiscern'd, accruing to this upper world\nFrom that below.  But fully to content\nThy wishes, all that in this sphere have birth,\nDemands my further parle.  Inquire thou wouldst,\nWho of this light is denizen, that here\nBeside me sparkles, as the sun-beam doth\nOn the clear wave.  Know then, the soul of Rahab\nIs in that gladsome harbour, to our tribe\nUnited, and the foremost rank assign'd.\nHe to that heav'n, at which the shadow ends\nOf your sublunar world, was taken up,\nFirst, in Christ's triumph, of all souls redeem'd:\nFor well behoov'd, that, in some part of heav'n,\nShe should remain a trophy, to declare\nThe mighty contest won with either palm;\nFor that she favour'd first the high exploit\nOf Joshua on the holy land, whereof\nThe Pope recks little now.  Thy city, plant\nOf him, that on his Maker turn'd the back,\nAnd of whose envying so much woe hath sprung,\nEngenders and expands the cursed flower,\nThat hath made wander both the sheep and lambs,\nTurning the shepherd to a wolf.  For this,\nThe gospel and great teachers laid aside,\nThe decretals, as their stuft margins show,\nAre the sole study.  Pope and Cardinals,\nIntent on these, ne'er journey but in thought\nTo Nazareth, where Gabriel op'd his wings.\nYet it may chance, erelong, the Vatican,\nAnd other most selected parts of Rome,\nThat were the grave of Peter's soldiery,\nShall be deliver'd from the adult'rous bond.\"\n\n\n\n\nCANTO X\n\nLooking into his first-born with the love,\nWhich breathes from both eternal, the first Might\nIneffable, whence eye or mind\nCan roam, hath in such order all dispos'd,\nAs none may see and fail to enjoy.  Raise, then,\nO reader! to the lofty wheels, with me,\nThy ken directed to the point, whereat\nOne motion strikes on th' other.  There begin\nThy wonder of the mighty Architect,\nWho loves his work so inwardly, his eye\nDoth ever watch it.  See, how thence oblique\nBrancheth the circle, where the planets roll\nTo pour their wished influence on the world;\nWhose path not bending thus, in heav'n above\nMuch virtue would be lost, and here on earth,\nAll power well nigh extinct: or, from direct\nWere its departure distant more or less,\nI' th' universal order, great defect\nMust, both in heav'n and here beneath, ensue.\n\nNow rest thee, reader! on thy bench, and muse\nAnticipative of the feast to come;\nSo shall delight make thee not feel thy toil.\nLo! I have set before thee, for thyself\nFeed now: the matter I indite, henceforth\nDemands entire my thought.  Join'd with the part,\nWhich late we told of, the great minister\nOf nature, that upon the world imprints\nThe virtue of the heaven, and doles out\nTime for us with his beam, went circling on\nAlong the spires, where each hour sooner comes;\nAnd I was with him, weetless of ascent,\nAs one, who till arriv'd, weets not his coming.\n\nFor Beatrice, she who passeth on\nSo suddenly from good to better, time\nCounts not the act, oh then how great must needs\nHave been her brightness!  What she was i' th' sun\n(Where I had enter'd), not through change of hue,\nBut light transparent--did I summon up\nGenius, art, practice--I might not so speak,\nIt should be e'er imagin'd: yet believ'd\nIt may be, and the sight be justly crav'd.\nAnd if our fantasy fail of such height,\nWhat marvel, since no eye above the sun\nHath ever travel'd?  Such are they dwell here,\nFourth family of the Omnipotent Sire,\nWho of his spirit and of his offspring shows;\nAnd holds them still enraptur'd with the view.\nAnd thus to me Beatrice: \"Thank, oh thank,\nThe Sun of angels, him, who by his grace\nTo this perceptible hath lifted thee.\"\n\nNever was heart in such devotion bound,\nAnd with complacency so absolute\nDispos'd to render up itself to God,\nAs mine was at those words: and so entire\nThe love for Him, that held me, it eclips'd\nBeatrice in oblivion.  Naught displeas'd\nWas she, but smil'd thereat so joyously,\nThat of her laughing eyes the radiance brake\nAnd scatter'd my collected mind abroad.\n\nThen saw I a bright band, in liveliness\nSurpassing, who themselves did make the crown,\nAnd us their centre: yet more sweet in voice,\nThan in their visage beaming.  Cinctur'd thus,\nSometime Latona's daughter we behold,\nWhen the impregnate air retains the thread,\nThat weaves her zone.  In the celestial court,\nWhence I return, are many jewels found,\nSo dear and beautiful, they cannot brook\nTransporting from that realm: and of these lights\nSuch was the song.  Who doth not prune his wing\nTo soar up thither, let him look from thence\nFor tidings from the dumb.  When, singing thus,\nThose burning suns that circled round us thrice,\nAs nearest stars around the fixed pole,\nThen seem'd they like to ladies, from the dance\nNot ceasing, but suspense, in silent pause,\nList'ning, till they have caught the strain anew:\nSuspended so they stood: and, from within,\nThus heard I one, who spake: \"Since with its beam\nThe grace, whence true love lighteth first his flame,\nThat after doth increase by loving, shines\nSo multiplied in thee, it leads thee up\nAlong this ladder, down whose hallow'd steps\nNone e'er descend, and mount them not again,\nWho from his phial should refuse thee wine\nTo slake thy thirst, no less constrained were,\nThan water flowing not unto the sea.\nThou fain wouldst hear, what plants are these, that bloom\nIn the bright garland, which, admiring, girds\nThis fair dame round, who strengthens thee for heav'n.\nI then was of the lambs, that Dominic\nLeads, for his saintly flock, along the way,\nWhere well they thrive, not sworn with vanity.\nHe, nearest on my right hand, brother was,\nAnd master to me: Albert of Cologne\nIs this: and of Aquinum, Thomas I.\nIf thou of all the rest wouldst be assur'd,\nLet thine eye, waiting on the words I speak,\nIn circuit journey round the blessed wreath.\nThat next resplendence issues from the smile\nOf Gratian, who to either forum lent\nSuch help, as favour wins in Paradise.\nThe other, nearest, who adorns our quire,\nWas Peter, he that with the widow gave\nTo holy church his treasure.  The fifth light,\nGoodliest of all, is by such love inspired,\nThat all your world craves tidings of its doom:\nWithin, there is the lofty light, endow'd\nWith sapience so profound, if truth be truth,\nThat with a ken of such wide amplitude\nNo second hath arisen.  Next behold\nThat taper's radiance, to whose view was shown,\nClearliest, the nature and the ministry\nAngelical, while yet in flesh it dwelt.\nIn the other little light serenely smiles\nThat pleader for the Christian temples, he\nWho did provide Augustin of his lore.\nNow, if thy mind's eye pass from light to light,\nUpon my praises following, of the eighth\nThy thirst is next.  The saintly soul, that shows\nThe world's deceitfulness, to all who hear him,\nIs, with the sight of all the good, that is,\nBlest there.  The limbs, whence it was driven, lie\nDown in Cieldauro, and from martyrdom\nAnd exile came it here.  Lo! further on,\nWhere flames the arduous Spirit of Isidore,\nOf Bede, and Richard, more than man, erewhile,\nIn deep discernment.  Lastly this, from whom\nThy look on me reverteth, was the beam\nOf one, whose spirit, on high musings bent,\nRebuk'd the ling'ring tardiness of death.\nIt is the eternal light of Sigebert,\nWho'scap'd not envy, when of truth he argued,\nReading in the straw-litter'd street.\"  Forthwith,\nAs clock, that calleth up the spouse of God\nTo win her bridegroom's love at matin's hour,\nEach part of other fitly drawn and urg'd,\nSends out a tinkling sound, of note so sweet,\nAffection springs in well-disposed breast;\nThus saw I move the glorious wheel, thus heard\nVoice answ'ring voice, so musical and soft,\nIt can be known but where day endless shines.\n\n\n\n\nCANTO XI\n\nO fond anxiety of mortal men!\nHow vain and inconclusive arguments\nAre those, which make thee beat thy wings below\nFor statues one, and one for aphorisms\nWas hunting; this the priesthood follow'd, that\nBy force or sophistry aspir'd to rule;\nTo rob another, and another sought\nBy civil business wealth; one moiling lay\nTangled in net of sensual delight,\nAnd one to witless indolence resign'd;\nWhat time from all these empty things escap'd,\nWith Beatrice, I thus gloriously\nWas rais'd aloft, and made the guest of heav'n.\n\nThey of the circle to that point, each one.\nWhere erst it was, had turn'd; and steady glow'd,\nAs candle in his socket.  Then within\nThe lustre, that erewhile bespake me, smiling\nWith merer gladness, heard I thus begin:\n\n\"E'en as his beam illumes me, so I look\nInto the eternal light, and clearly mark\nThy thoughts, from whence they rise.  Thou art in doubt,\nAnd wouldst, that I should bolt my words afresh\nIn such plain open phrase, as may be smooth\nTo thy perception, where I told thee late\nThat 'well they thrive;' and that 'no second such\nHath risen,' which no small distinction needs.\n\n\"The providence, that governeth the world,\nIn depth of counsel by created ken\nUnfathomable, to the end that she,\nWho with loud cries was'spous'd in precious blood,\nMight keep her footing towards her well-belov'd,\nSafe in herself and constant unto him,\nHath two ordain'd, who should on either hand\nIn chief escort her: one seraphic all\nIn fervency; for wisdom upon earth,\nThe other splendour of cherubic light.\nI but of one will tell: he tells of both,\nWho one commendeth which of them so'er\nBe taken: for their deeds were to one end.\n\n\"Between Tupino, and the wave, that falls\nFrom blest Ubaldo's chosen hill, there hangs\nRich <DW72> of mountain high, whence heat and cold\nAre wafted through Perugia's eastern gate:\nAnd Norcera with Gualdo, in its rear\nMourn for their heavy yoke.  Upon that side,\nWhere it doth break its steepness most, arose\nA sun upon the world, as duly this\nFrom Ganges doth: therefore let none, who speak\nOf that place, say Ascesi; for its name\nWere lamely so deliver'd; but the East,\nTo call things rightly, be it henceforth styl'd.\nHe was not yet much distant from his rising,\nWhen his good influence 'gan to bless the earth.\nA dame to whom none openeth pleasure's gate\nMore than to death, was, 'gainst his father's will,\nHis stripling choice: and he did make her his,\nBefore the Spiritual court, by nuptial bonds,\nAnd in his father's sight: from day to day,\nThen lov'd her more devoutly.  She, bereav'd\nOf her first husband, slighted and obscure,\nThousand and hundred years and more, remain'd\nWithout a single suitor, till he came.\nNor aught avail'd, that, with Amyclas, she\nWas found unmov'd at rumour of his voice,\nWho shook the world: nor aught her constant boldness\nWhereby with Christ she mounted on the cross,\nWhen Mary stay'd beneath.  But not to deal\nThus closely with thee longer, take at large\nThe rovers' titles--Poverty and Francis.\nTheir concord and glad looks, wonder and love,\nAnd sweet regard gave birth to holy thoughts,\nSo much, that venerable Bernard first\nDid bare his feet, and, in pursuit of peace\nSo heavenly, ran, yet deem'd his footing slow.\nO hidden riches!  O prolific good!\nEgidius bares him next, and next Sylvester,\nAnd follow both the bridegroom; so the bride\nCan please them.  Thenceforth goes he on his way,\nThe father and the master, with his spouse,\nAnd with that family, whom now the cord\nGirt humbly: nor did abjectness of heart\nWeigh down his eyelids, for that he was son\nOf Pietro Bernardone, and by men\nIn wond'rous sort despis'd.  But royally\nHis hard intention he to Innocent\nSet forth, and from him first receiv'd the seal\nOn his religion.  Then, when numerous flock'd\nThe tribe of lowly ones, that trac'd HIS steps,\nWhose marvellous life deservedly were sung\nIn heights empyreal, through Honorius' hand\nA second crown, to deck their Guardian's virtues,\nWas by the eternal Spirit inwreath'd: and when\nHe had, through thirst of martyrdom, stood up\nIn the proud Soldan's presence, and there preach'd\nChrist and his followers; but found the race\nUnripen'd for conversion: back once more\nHe hasted (not to intermit his toil),\nAnd reap'd Ausonian lands.  On the hard rock,\n'Twixt Arno and the Tyber, he from Christ\nTook the last Signet, which his limbs two years\nDid carry.  Then the season come, that he,\nWho to such good had destin'd him, was pleas'd\nT' advance him to the meed, which he had earn'd\nBy his self-humbling, to his brotherhood,\nAs their just heritage, he gave in charge\nHis dearest lady, and enjoin'd their love\nAnd faith to her: and, from her bosom, will'd\nHis goodly spirit should move forth, returning\nTo its appointed kingdom, nor would have\nHis body laid upon another bier.\n\n\"Think now of one, who were a fit colleague,\nTo keep the bark of Peter in deep sea\nHelm'd to right point; and such our Patriarch was.\nTherefore who follow him, as he enjoins,\nThou mayst be certain, take good lading in.\nBut hunger of new viands tempts his flock,\nSo that they needs into strange pastures wide\nMust spread them: and the more remote from him\nThe stragglers wander, so much mole they come\nHome to the sheep-fold, destitute of milk.\nThere are of them, in truth, who fear their harm,\nAnd to the shepherd cleave; but these so few,\nA little stuff may furnish out their cloaks.\n\n\"Now, if my words be clear, if thou have ta'en\nGood heed, if that, which I have told, recall\nTo mind, thy wish may be in part fulfill'd:\nFor thou wilt see the point from whence they split,\nNor miss of the reproof, which that implies,\n'That well they thrive not sworn with vanity.\"'\n\n\n\n\nCANTO XII\n\nSoon as its final word the blessed flame\nHad rais'd for utterance, straight the holy mill\nBegan to wheel, nor yet had once revolv'd,\nOr ere another, circling, compass'd it,\nMotion to motion, song to song, conjoining,\nSong, that as much our muses doth excel,\nOur Sirens with their tuneful pipes, as ray\nOf primal splendour doth its faint reflex.\n\nAs when, if Juno bid her handmaid forth,\nTwo arches parallel, and trick'd alike,\nSpan the thin cloud, the outer taking birth\nFrom that within (in manner of that voice\nWhom love did melt away, as sun the mist),\nAnd they who gaze, presageful call to mind\nThe compact, made with Noah, of the world\nNo more to be o'erflow'd; about us thus\nOf sempiternal roses, bending, wreath'd\nThose garlands twain, and to the innermost\nE'en thus th' external answered.  When the footing,\nAnd other great festivity, of song,\nAnd radiance, light with light accordant, each\nJocund and blythe, had at their pleasure still'd\n(E'en as the eyes by quick volition mov'd,\nAre shut and rais'd together), from the heart\nOf one amongst the new lights mov'd a voice,\nThat made me seem like needle to the star,\nIn turning to its whereabout, and thus\nBegan: \"The love, that makes me beautiful,\nPrompts me to tell of th' other guide, for whom\nSuch good of mine is spoken.  Where one is,\nThe other worthily should also be;\nThat as their warfare was alike, alike\nShould be their glory.  Slow, and full of doubt,\nAnd with thin ranks, after its banner mov'd\nThe army of Christ (which it so clearly cost\nTo reappoint), when its imperial Head,\nWho reigneth ever, for the drooping host\nDid make provision, thorough grace alone,\nAnd not through its deserving.  As thou heard'st,\nTwo champions to the succour of his spouse\nHe sent, who by their deeds and words might join\nAgain his scatter'd people.  In that clime,\nWhere springs the pleasant west-wind to unfold\nThe fresh leaves, with which Europe sees herself\nNew-garmented; nor from those billows far,\nBeyond whose chiding, after weary course,\nThe sun doth sometimes hide him, safe abides\nThe happy Callaroga, under guard\nOf the great shield, wherein the lion lies\nSubjected and supreme.  And there was born\nThe loving million of the Christian faith,\nThe hollow'd wrestler, gentle to his own,\nAnd to his enemies terrible.  So replete\nHis soul with lively virtue, that when first\nCreated, even in the mother's womb,\nIt prophesied.  When, at the sacred font,\nThe spousals were complete 'twixt faith and him,\nWhere pledge of mutual safety was exchang'd,\nThe dame, who was his surety, in her sleep\nBeheld the wondrous fruit, that was from him\nAnd from his heirs to issue.  And that such\nHe might be construed, as indeed he was,\nShe was inspir'd to name him of his owner,\nWhose he was wholly, and so call'd him Dominic.\nAnd I speak of him, as the labourer,\nWhom Christ in his own garden chose to be\nHis help-mate.  Messenger he seem'd, and friend\nFast-knit to Christ; and the first love he show'd,\nWas after the first counsel that Christ gave.\nMany a time his nurse, at entering found\nThat he had ris'n in silence, and was prostrate,\nAs who should say, \"My errand was for this.\"\nO happy father!  Felix rightly nam'd!\nO favour'd mother! rightly nam'd Joanna!\nIf that do mean, as men interpret it.\nNot for the world's sake, for which now they pore\nUpon Ostiense and Taddeo's page,\nBut for the real manna, soon he grew\nMighty in learning, and did set himself\nTo go about the vineyard, that soon turns\nTo wan and wither'd, if not tended well:\nAnd from the see (whose bounty to the just\nAnd needy is gone by, not through its fault,\nBut his who fills it basely, he besought,\nNo dispensation for commuted wrong,\nNor the first vacant fortune, nor the tenth),\nThat to God's paupers rightly appertain,\nBut, 'gainst an erring and degenerate world,\nLicence to fight, in favour of that seed,\nFrom which the twice twelve cions gird thee round.\nThen, with sage doctrine and good will to help,\nForth on his great apostleship he far'd,\nLike torrent bursting from a lofty vein;\nAnd, dashing 'gainst the stocks of heresy,\nSmote fiercest, where resistance was most stout.\nThence many rivulets have since been turn'd,\nOver the garden Catholic to lead\nTheir living waters, and have fed its plants.\n\n\"If such one wheel of that two-yoked car,\nWherein the holy church defended her,\nAnd rode triumphant through the civil broil.\nThou canst not doubt its fellow's excellence,\nWhich Thomas, ere my coming, hath declar'd\nSo courteously unto thee.  But the track,\nWhich its smooth fellies made, is now deserted:\nThat mouldy mother is where late were lees.\nHis family, that wont to trace his path,\nTurn backward, and invert their steps; erelong\nTo rue the gathering in of their ill crop,\nWhen the rejected tares in vain shall ask\nAdmittance to the barn.  I question not\nBut he, who search'd our volume, leaf by leaf,\nMight still find page with this inscription on't,\n'I am as I was wont.'  Yet such were not\nFrom Acquasparta nor Casale, whence\nOf those, who come to meddle with the text,\nOne stretches and another cramps its rule.\nBonaventura's life in me behold,\nFrom Bagnororegio, one, who in discharge\nOf my great offices still laid aside\nAll sinister aim.  Illuminato here,\nAnd Agostino join me: two they were,\nAmong the first of those barefooted meek ones,\nWho sought God's friendship in the cord: with them\nHugues of Saint Victor, Pietro Mangiadore,\nAnd he of Spain in his twelve volumes shining,\nNathan the prophet, Metropolitan\nChrysostom, and Anselmo, and, who deign'd\nTo put his hand to the first art, Donatus.\nRaban is here: and at my side there shines\nCalabria's abbot, Joachim, endow'd\nWith soul prophetic.  The bright courtesy\nOf friar Thomas, and his goodly lore,\nHave mov'd me to the blazon of a peer\nSo worthy, and with me have mov'd this throng.\"\n\n\n\n\nCANTO XIII\n\nLet him, who would conceive what now I saw,\nImagine (and retain the image firm,\nAs mountain rock, the whilst he hears me speak),\nOf stars fifteen, from midst the ethereal host\nSelected, that, with lively ray serene,\nO'ercome the massiest air: thereto imagine\nThe wain, that, in the bosom of our sky,\nSpins ever on its axle night and day,\nWith the bright summit of that horn which swells\nDue from the pole, round which the first wheel rolls,\nT' have rang'd themselves in fashion of two signs\nIn heav'n, such as Ariadne made,\nWhen death's chill seized her; and that one of them\nDid compass in the other's beam; and both\nIn such sort whirl around, that each should tend\nWith opposite motion and, conceiving thus,\nOf that true constellation, and the dance\nTwofold, that circled me, he shall attain\nAs 't were the shadow; for things there as much\nSurpass our usage, as the swiftest heav'n\nIs swifter than the Chiana.  There was sung\nNo Bacchus, and no Io Paean, but\nThree Persons in the Godhead, and in one\nSubstance that nature and the human join'd.\n\nThe song fulfill'd its measure; and to us\nThose saintly lights attended, happier made\nAt each new minist'ring.  Then silence brake,\nAmid th' accordant sons of Deity,\nThat luminary, in which the wondrous life\nOf the meek man of God was told to me;\nAnd thus it spake: \"One ear o' th' harvest thresh'd,\nAnd its grain safely stor'd, sweet charity\nInvites me with the other to like toil.\n\n\"Thou know'st, that in the bosom, whence the rib\nWas ta'en to fashion that fair cheek, whose taste\nAll the world pays for, and in that, which pierc'd\nBy the keen lance, both after and before\nSuch satisfaction offer'd, as outweighs\nEach evil in the scale, whate'er of light\nTo human nature is allow'd, must all\nHave by his virtue been infus'd, who form'd\nBoth one and other: and thou thence admir'st\nIn that I told thee, of beatitudes\nA second, there is none, to his enclos'd\nIn the fifth radiance.  Open now thine eyes\nTo what I answer thee; and thou shalt see\nThy deeming and my saying meet in truth,\nAs centre in the round.  That which dies not,\nAnd that which can die, are but each the beam\nOf that idea, which our Soverign Sire\nEngendereth loving; for that lively light,\nWhich passeth from his brightness; not disjoin'd\nFrom him, nor from his love triune with them,\nDoth, through his bounty, congregate itself,\nMirror'd, as 't were in new existences,\nItself unalterable and ever one.\n\n\"Descending hence unto the lowest powers,\nIts energy so sinks, at last it makes\nBut brief contingencies: for so I name\nThings generated, which the heav'nly orbs\nMoving, with seed or without seed, produce.\nTheir wax, and that which molds it, differ much:\nAnd thence with lustre, more or less, it shows\nTh' ideal stamp impress: so that one tree\nAccording to his kind, hath better fruit,\nAnd worse: and, at your birth, ye, mortal men,\nAre in your talents various.  Were the wax\nMolded with nice exactness, and the heav'n\nIn its disposing influence supreme,\nThe lustre of the seal should be complete:\nBut nature renders it imperfect ever,\nResembling thus the artist in her work,\nWhose faultering hand is faithless to his skill.\nHowe'er, if love itself dispose, and mark\nThe primal virtue, kindling with bright view,\nThere all perfection is vouchsafed; and such\nThe clay was made, accomplish'd with each gift,\nThat life can teem with; such the burden fill'd\nThe virgin's bosom: so that I commend\nThy judgment, that the human nature ne'er\nWas or can be, such as in them it was.\n\n\"Did I advance no further than this point,\n'How then had he no peer?'  thou might'st reply.\nBut, that what now appears not, may appear\nRight plainly, ponder, who he was, and what\n(When he was bidden 'Ask' ), the motive sway'd\nTo his requesting.  I have spoken thus,\nThat thou mayst see, he was a king, who ask'd\nFor wisdom, to the end he might be king\nSufficient: not the number to search out\nOf the celestial movers; or to know,\nIf necessary with contingent e'er\nHave made necessity; or whether that\nBe granted, that first motion is; or if\nOf the mid circle can, by art, be made\nTriangle with each corner, blunt or sharp.\n\n\"Whence, noting that, which I have said, and this,\nThou kingly prudence and that ken mayst learn,\nAt which the dart of my intention aims.\nAnd, marking clearly, that I told thee, 'Risen,'\nThou shalt discern it only hath respect\nTo kings, of whom are many, and the good\nAre rare.  With this distinction take my words;\nAnd they may well consist with that which thou\nOf the first human father dost believe,\nAnd of our well-beloved.  And let this\nHenceforth be led unto thy feet, to make\nThee slow in motion, as a weary man,\nBoth to the 'yea' and to the 'nay' thou seest not.\nFor he among the fools is down full low,\nWhose affirmation, or denial, is\nWithout distinction, in each case alike\nSince it befalls, that in most instances\nCurrent opinion leads to false: and then\nAffection bends the judgment to her ply.\n\n\"Much more than vainly doth he loose from shore,\nSince he returns not such as he set forth,\nWho fishes for the truth and wanteth skill.\nAnd open proofs of this unto the world\nHave been afforded in Parmenides,\nMelissus, Bryso, and the crowd beside,\nWho journey'd on, and knew not whither: so did\nSabellius, Arius, and the other fools,\nWho, like to scymitars, reflected back\nThe scripture-image, by distortion marr'd.\n\n\"Let not the people be too swift to judge,\nAs one who reckons on the blades in field,\nOr ere the crop be ripe.  For I have seen\nThe thorn frown rudely all the winter long\nAnd after bear the rose upon its top;\nAnd bark, that all the way across the sea\nRan straight and speedy, perish at the last,\nE'en in the haven's mouth seeing one steal,\nAnother brine, his offering to the priest,\nLet not Dame Birtha and Sir Martin thence\nInto heav'n's counsels deem that they can pry:\nFor one of these may rise, the other fall.\"\n\n\n\n\nCANTO XIV\n\nFrom centre to the circle, and so back\nFrom circle to the centre, water moves\nIn the round chalice, even as the blow\nImpels it, inwardly, or from without.\nSuch was the image glanc'd into my mind,\nAs the great spirit of Aquinum ceas'd;\nAnd Beatrice after him her words\nResum'd alternate: \"Need there is (tho' yet\nHe tells it to you not in words, nor e'en\nIn thought) that he should fathom to its depth\nAnother mystery.  Tell him, if the light,\nWherewith your substance blooms, shall stay with you\nEternally, as now: and, if it doth,\nHow, when ye shall regain your visible forms,\nThe sight may without harm endure the change,\nThat also tell.\"  As those, who in a ring\nTread the light measure, in their fitful mirth\nRaise loud the voice, and spring with gladder bound;\nThus, at the hearing of that pious suit,\nThe saintly circles in their tourneying\nAnd wond'rous note attested new delight.\n\nWhoso laments, that we must doff this garb\nOf frail mortality, thenceforth to live\nImmortally above, he hath not seen\nThe sweet refreshing, of that heav'nly shower.\n\nHim, who lives ever, and for ever reigns\nIn mystic union of the Three in One,\nUnbounded, bounding all, each spirit thrice\nSang, with such melody, as but to hear\nFor highest merit were an ample meed.\nAnd from the lesser orb the goodliest light,\nWith gentle voice and mild, such as perhaps\nThe angel's once to Mary, thus replied:\n\"Long as the joy of Paradise shall last,\nOur love shall shine around that raiment, bright,\nAs fervent; fervent, as in vision blest;\nAnd that as far in blessedness exceeding,\nAs it hath grave beyond its virtue great.\nOur shape, regarmented with glorious weeds\nOf saintly flesh, must, being thus entire,\nShow yet more gracious.  Therefore shall increase,\nWhate'er of light, gratuitous, imparts\nThe Supreme Good; light, ministering aid,\nThe better disclose his glory: whence\nThe vision needs increasing, much increase\nThe fervour, which it kindles; and that too\nThe ray, that comes from it.  But as the greed\nWhich gives out flame, yet it its whiteness shines\nMore lively than that, and so preserves\nIts proper semblance; thus this circling sphere\nOf splendour, shall to view less radiant seem,\nThan shall our fleshly robe, which yonder earth\nNow covers.  Nor will such excess of light\nO'erpower us, in corporeal organs made\nFirm, and susceptible of all delight.\"\n\nSo ready and so cordial an \"Amen,\"\nFollowed from either choir, as plainly spoke\nDesire of their dead bodies; yet perchance\nNot for themselves, but for their kindred dear,\nMothers and sires, and those whom best they lov'd,\nEre they were made imperishable flame.\n\nAnd lo! forthwith there rose up round about\nA lustre over that already there,\nOf equal clearness, like the brightening up\nOf the horizon.  As at an evening hour\nOf twilight, new appearances through heav'n\nPeer with faint glimmer, doubtfully descried;\nSo there new substances, methought began\nTo rise in view; and round the other twain\nEnwheeling, sweep their ampler circuit wide.\n\nO gentle glitter of eternal beam!\nWith what a such whiteness did it flow,\nO'erpowering vision in me!  But so fair,\nSo passing lovely, Beatrice show'd,\nMind cannot follow it, nor words express\nHer infinite sweetness.  Thence mine eyes regain'd\nPower to look up, and I beheld myself,\nSole with my lady, to more lofty bliss\nTranslated: for the star, with warmer smile\nImpurpled, well denoted our ascent.\n\nWith all the heart, and with that tongue which speaks\nThe same in all, an holocaust I made\nTo God, befitting the new grace vouchsaf'd.\nAnd from my bosom had not yet upsteam'd\nThe fuming of that incense, when I knew\nThe rite accepted.  With such mighty sheen\nAnd mantling crimson, in two listed rays\nThe splendours shot before me, that I cried,\n\"God of Sabaoth! that does prank them thus!\"\n\nAs leads the galaxy from pole to pole,\nDistinguish'd into greater lights and less,\nIts pathway, which the wisest fail to spell;\nSo thickly studded, in the depth of Mars,\nThose rays describ'd the venerable sign,\nThat quadrants in the round conjoining frame.\nHere memory mocks the toil of genius.  Christ\nBeam'd on that cross; and pattern fails me now.\nBut whoso takes his cross, and follows Christ\nWill pardon me for that I leave untold,\nWhen in the flecker'd dawning he shall spy\nThe glitterance of Christ.  From horn to horn,\nAnd 'tween the summit and the base did move\nLights, scintillating, as they met and pass'd.\nThus oft are seen, with ever-changeful glance,\nStraight or athwart, now rapid and now slow,\nThe atomies of bodies, long or short,\nTo move along the sunbeam, whose slant line\nCheckers the shadow, interpos'd by art\nAgainst the noontide heat.  And as the chime\nOf minstrel music, dulcimer, and help\nWith many strings, a pleasant dining makes\nTo him, who heareth not distinct the note;\nSo from the lights, which there appear'd to me,\nGather'd along the cross a melody,\nThat, indistinctly heard, with ravishment\nPossess'd me.  Yet I mark'd it was a hymn\nOf lofty praises; for there came to me\n\"Arise and conquer,\" as to one who hears\nAnd comprehends not.  Me such ecstasy\nO'ercame, that never till that hour was thing\nThat held me in so sweet imprisonment.\n\nPerhaps my saying over bold appears,\nAccounting less the pleasure of those eyes,\nWhereon to look fulfilleth all desire.\nBut he, who is aware those living seals\nOf every beauty work with quicker force,\nThe higher they are ris'n; and that there\nI had not turn'd me to them; he may well\nExcuse me that, whereof in my excuse\nI do accuse me, and may own my truth;\nThat holy pleasure here not yet reveal'd,\nWhich grows in transport as we mount aloof.\n\n\n\n\nCANTO XV\n\nTrue love, that ever shows itself as clear\nIn kindness, as loose appetite in wrong,\nSilenced that lyre harmonious, and still'd\nThe sacred chords, that are by heav'n's right hand\nUnwound and tighten'd, flow to righteous prayers\nShould they not hearken, who, to give me will\nFor praying, in accordance thus were mute?\nHe hath in sooth good cause for endless grief,\nWho, for the love of thing that lasteth not,\nDespoils himself forever of that love.\n\nAs oft along the still and pure serene,\nAt nightfall, glides a sudden trail of fire,\nAttracting with involuntary heed\nThe eye to follow it, erewhile at rest,\nAnd seems some star that shifted place in heav'n,\nOnly that, whence it kindles, none is lost,\nAnd it is soon extinct; thus from the horn,\nThat on the dexter of the cross extends,\nDown to its foot, one luminary ran\nFrom mid the cluster shone there; yet no gem\nDropp'd from its foil; and through the beamy list\nLike flame in alabaster, glow'd its course.\n\nSo forward stretch'd him (if of credence aught\nOur greater muse may claim) the pious ghost\nOf old Anchises, in the' Elysian bower,\nWhen he perceiv'd his son.  \"O thou, my blood!\nO most exceeding grace divine! to whom,\nAs now to thee, hath twice the heav'nly gate\nBeen e'er unclos'd?\" so spake the light; whence I\nTurn'd me toward him; then unto my dame\nMy sight directed, and on either side\nAmazement waited me; for in her eyes\nWas lighted such a smile, I thought that mine\nHad <DW37>'d unto the bottom of my grace\nAnd of my bliss in Paradise.  Forthwith\nTo hearing and to sight grateful alike,\nThe spirit to his proem added things\nI understood not, so profound he spake;\nYet not of choice but through necessity\nMysterious; for his high conception scar'd\nBeyond the mark of mortals.  When the flight\nOf holy transport had so spent its rage,\nThat nearer to the level of our thought\nThe speech descended, the first sounds I heard\nWere, \"Best he thou, Triunal Deity!\nThat hast such favour in my seed vouchsaf'd!\"\nThen follow'd: \"No unpleasant thirst, tho' long,\nWhich took me reading in the sacred book,\nWhose leaves or white or dusky never change,\nThou hast allay'd, my son, within this light,\nFrom whence my voice thou hear'st; more thanks to her.\nWho for such lofty mounting has with plumes\nBegirt thee.  Thou dost deem thy thoughts to me\nFrom him transmitted, who is first of all,\nE'en as all numbers ray from unity;\nAnd therefore dost not ask me who I am,\nOr why to thee more joyous I appear,\nThan any other in this gladsome throng.\nThe truth is as thou deem'st; for in this hue\nBoth less and greater in that mirror look,\nIn which thy thoughts, or ere thou think'st, are shown.\nBut, that the love, which keeps me wakeful ever,\nUrging with sacred thirst of sweet desire,\nMay be contended fully, let thy voice,\nFearless, and frank and jocund, utter forth\nThy will distinctly, utter forth the wish,\nWhereto my ready answer stands decreed.\"\n\nI turn'd me to Beatrice; and she heard\nEre I had spoken, smiling, an assent,\nThat to my will gave wings; and I began\n\"To each among your tribe, what time ye kenn'd\nThe nature, in whom naught unequal dwells,\nWisdom and love were in one measure dealt;\nFor that they are so equal in the sun,\nFrom whence ye drew your radiance and your heat,\nAs makes all likeness scant.  But will and means,\nIn mortals, for the cause ye well discern,\nWith unlike wings are fledge.  A mortal I\nExperience inequality like this,\nAnd therefore give no thanks, but in the heart,\nFor thy paternal greeting.  This howe'er\nI pray thee, living topaz! that ingemm'st\nThis precious jewel, let me hear thy name.\"\n\n\"I am thy root, O leaf! whom to expect\nEven, hath pleas'd me:\" thus the prompt reply\nPrefacing, next it added; \"he, of whom\nThy kindred appellation comes, and who,\nThese hundred years and more, on its first ledge\nHath circuited the mountain, was my son\nAnd thy great grandsire.  Well befits, his long\nEndurance should be shorten'd by thy deeds.\n\n\"Florence, within her ancient limit-mark,\nWhich calls her still to matin prayers and noon,\nWas chaste and sober, and abode in peace.\nShe had no armlets and no head-tires then,\nNo purfled dames, no zone, that caught the eye\nMore than the person did.  Time was not yet,\nWhen at his daughter's birth the sire grew pale.\nFor fear the age and dowry should exceed\nOn each side just proportion.  House was none\nVoid of its family; nor yet had come\nHardanapalus, to exhibit feats\nOf chamber prowess.  Montemalo yet\nO'er our suburban turret rose; as much\nTo be surpass in fall, as in its rising.\nI saw Bellincione Berti walk abroad\nIn leathern girdle and a clasp of bone;\nAnd, with no artful colouring on her cheeks,\nHis lady leave the glass.  The sons I saw\nOf Nerli and of Vecchio well content\nWith unrob'd jerkin; and their good dames handling\nThe spindle and the flax; O happy they!\nEach sure of burial in her native land,\nAnd none left desolate a-bed for France!\nOne wak'd to tend the cradle, hushing it\nWith sounds that lull'd the parent's infancy:\nAnother, with her maidens, drawing off\nThe tresses from the distaff, lectur'd them\nOld tales of Troy and Fesole and Rome.\nA Salterello and Cianghella we\nHad held as strange a marvel, as ye would\nA Cincinnatus or Cornelia now.\n\n\"In such compos'd and seemly fellowship,\nSuch faithful and such fair equality,\nIn so sweet household, Mary at my birth\nBestow'd me, call'd on with loud cries; and there\nIn your old baptistery, I was made\nChristian at once and Cacciaguida; as were\nMy brethren, Eliseo and Moronto.\n\n\"From Valdipado came to me my spouse,\nAnd hence thy surname grew.  I follow'd then\nThe Emperor Conrad; and his knighthood he\nDid gird on me; in such good part he took\nMy valiant service.  After him I went\nTo testify against that evil law,\nWhose people, by the shepherd's fault, possess\nYour right, usurping.  There, by that foul crew\nWas I releas'd from the deceitful world,\nWhose base affection many a spirit soils,\nAnd from the martyrdom came to this peace.\"\n\n\n\n\nCANTO XVI\n\nO slight respect of man's nobility!\nI never shall account it marvelous,\nThat our infirm affection here below\nThou mov'st to boasting, when I could not choose,\nE'en in that region of unwarp'd desire,\nIn heav'n itself, but make my vaunt in thee!\nYet cloak thou art soon shorten'd, for that time,\nUnless thou be eked out from day to day,\nGoes round thee with his shears.  Resuming then\nWith greeting such, as Rome, was first to bear,\nBut since hath disaccustom'd I began;\nAnd Beatrice, that a little space\nWas sever'd, smil'd reminding me of her,\nWhose cough embolden'd (as the story holds)\nTo first offence the doubting Guenever.\n\n\"You are my sire,\" said I, \"you give me heart\nFreely to speak my thought: above myself\nYou raise me.  Through so many streams with joy\nMy soul is fill'd, that gladness wells from it;\nSo that it bears the mighty tide, and bursts not\nSay then, my honour'd stem! what ancestors\nWhere those you sprang from, and what years were mark'd\nIn your first childhood?  Tell me of the fold,\nThat hath Saint John for guardian, what was then\nIts state, and who in it were highest seated?\"\n\nAs embers, at the breathing of the wind,\nTheir flame enliven, so that light I saw\nShine at my blandishments; and, as it grew\nMore fair to look on, so with voice more sweet,\nYet not in this our modern phrase, forthwith\nIt answer'd: \"From the day, when it was said\n'Hail Virgin!' to the throes, by which my mother,\nWho now is sainted, lighten'd her of me\nWhom she was heavy with, this fire had come,\nFive hundred fifty times and thrice, its beams\nTo reilumine underneath the foot\nOf its own lion.  They, of whom I sprang,\nAnd I, had there our birth-place, where the last\nPartition of our city first is reach'd\nBy him, that runs her annual game.  Thus much\nSuffice of my forefathers: who they were,\nAnd whence they hither came, more honourable\nIt is to pass in silence than to tell.\nAll those, who in that time were there from Mars\nUntil the Baptist, fit to carry arms,\nWere but the fifth of them this day alive.\nBut then the citizen's blood, that now is mix'd\nFrom Campi and Certaldo and Fighine,\nRan purely through the last mechanic's veins.\nO how much better were it, that these people\nWere neighbours to you, and that at Galluzzo\nAnd at Trespiano, ye should have your bound'ry,\nThan to have them within, and bear the stench\nOf Aguglione's hind, and Signa's, him,\nThat hath his eye already keen for bart'ring!\nHad not the people, which of all the world\nDegenerates most, been stepdame unto Caesar,\nBut, as a mother, gracious to her son;\nSuch one, as hath become a Florentine,\nAnd trades and traffics, had been turn'd adrift\nTo Simifonte, where his grandsire ply'd\nThe beggar's craft.

Mark Luni, Urbisaglia mark,\nHow they are gone, and after them how go\nChiusi and Sinigaglia; and 't will seem\nNo longer new or strange to thee to hear,\nThat families fail, when cities have their end.\nAll things, that appertain t' ye, like yourselves,\nAre mortal: but mortality in some\nYe mark not, they endure so long, and you\nPass by so suddenly.  And as the moon\nDoth, by the rolling of her heav'nly sphere,\nHide and reveal the strand unceasingly;\nSo fortune deals with Florence.  Hence admire not\nAt what of them I tell thee, whose renown\nTime covers, the first Florentines.  I saw\nThe Ughi, Catilini and Filippi,\nThe Alberichi, Greci and Ormanni,\nNow in their wane, illustrious citizens:\nAnd great as ancient, of Sannella him,\nWith him of Arca saw, and Soldanieri\nAnd Ardinghi, and Bostichi.  At the poop,\nThat now is laden with new felony,\nSo cumb'rous it may speedily sink the bark,\nThe Ravignani sat, of whom is sprung\nThe County Guido, and whoso hath since\nHis title from the fam'd Bellincione ta'en.\nFair governance was yet an art well priz'd\nBy him of Pressa: Galigaio show'd\nThe gilded hilt and pommel, in his house.\nThe column, cloth'd with verrey, still was seen\nUnshaken: the Sacchetti still were great,\nGiouchi, Sifanti, Galli and Barucci,\nWith them who blush to hear the bushel nam'd.\nOf the Calfucci still the branchy trunk\nWas in its strength: and to the curule chairs\nSizii and Arigucci yet were drawn.\nHow mighty them I saw, whom since their pride\nHath undone! and in all her goodly deeds\nFlorence was by the bullets of bright gold\nO'erflourish'd.  Such the sires of those, who now,\nAs surely as your church is vacant, flock\nInto her consistory, and at leisure\nThere stall them and grow fat.  The o'erweening brood,\nThat plays the dragon after him that flees,\nBut unto such, as turn and show the tooth,\nAy or the purse, is gentle as a lamb,\nWas on its rise, but yet so slight esteem'd,\nThat Ubertino of Donati grudg'd\nHis father-in-law should yoke him to its tribe.\nAlready Caponsacco had descended\nInto the mart from Fesole: and Giuda\nAnd Infangato were good citizens.\nA thing incredible I tell, tho' true:\nThe gateway, named from those of Pera, led\nInto the narrow circuit of your walls.\nEach one, who bears the sightly quarterings\nOf the great Baron (he whose name and worth\nThe festival of Thomas still revives)\nHis knighthood and his privilege retain'd;\nAlbeit one, who borders them With gold,\nThis day is mingled with the common herd.\nIn Borgo yet the Gualterotti dwelt,\nAnd Importuni: well for its repose\nHad it still lack'd of newer neighbourhood.\nThe house, from whence your tears have had their spring,\nThrough the just anger that hath murder'd ye\nAnd put a period to your gladsome days,\nWas honour'd, it, and those consorted with it.\nO Buondelmonte! what ill counseling\nPrevail'd on thee to break the plighted bond\nMany, who now are weeping, would rejoice,\nHad God to Ema giv'n thee, the first time\nThou near our city cam'st.  But so was doom'd:\nOn that maim'd stone set up to guard the bridge,\nAt thy last peace, the victim, Florence! fell.\nWith these and others like to them, I saw\nFlorence in such assur'd tranquility,\nShe had no cause at which to grieve: with these\nSaw her so glorious and so just, that ne'er\nThe lily from the lance had hung reverse,\nOr through division been with vermeil dyed.\"\n\n\n\n\nCANTO XVII\n\nSuch as the youth, who came to Clymene\nTo certify himself of that reproach,\nWhich had been fasten'd on him, (he whose end\nStill makes the fathers chary to their sons),\nE'en such was I; nor unobserv'd was such\nOf Beatrice, and that saintly lamp,\nWho had erewhile for me his station mov'd;\nWhen thus by lady: \"Give thy wish free vent,\nThat it may issue, bearing true report\nOf the mind's impress; not that aught thy words\nMay to our knowledge add, but to the end,\nThat thou mayst use thyself to own thy thirst\nAnd men may mingle for thee when they hear.\"\n\n\"O plant! from whence I spring! rever'd and lov'd!\nWho soar'st so high a pitch, thou seest as clear,\nAs earthly thought determines two obtuse\nIn one triangle not contain'd, so clear\nDost see contingencies, ere in themselves\nExistent, looking at the point whereto\nAll times are present, I, the whilst I scal'd\nWith Virgil the soul purifying mount,\nAnd visited the nether world of woe,\nTouching my future destiny have heard\nWords grievous, though I feel me on all sides\nWell squar'd to fortune's blows.  Therefore my will\nWere satisfied to know the lot awaits me,\nThe arrow, seen beforehand, slacks its flight.\"\n\nSo said I to the brightness, which erewhile\nTo me had spoken, and my will declar'd,\nAs Beatrice will'd, explicitly.\nNor with oracular response obscure,\nSuch, as or ere the Lamb of God was slain,\nBeguil'd the credulous nations; but, in terms\nPrecise and unambiguous lore, replied\nThe spirit of paternal love, enshrin'd,\nYet in his smile apparent; and thus spake:\n\"Contingency, unfolded not to view\nUpon the tablet of your mortal mold,\nIs all depictur'd in the' eternal sight;\nBut hence deriveth not necessity,\nMore then the tall ship, hurried down the flood,\nDoth from the vision, that reflects the scene.\nFrom thence, as to the ear sweet harmony\nFrom organ comes, so comes before mine eye\nThe time prepar'd for thee.  Such as driv'n out\nFrom Athens, by his cruel stepdame's wiles,\nHippolytus departed, such must thou\nDepart from Florence.  This they wish, and this\nContrive, and will ere long effectuate, there,\nWhere gainful merchandize is made of Christ,\nThroughout the livelong day.  The common cry,\nWill, as 't is ever wont, affix the blame\nUnto the party injur'd: but the truth\nShall, in the vengeance it dispenseth, find\nA faithful witness.  Thou shall leave each thing\nBelov'd most dearly: this is the first shaft\nShot from the bow of exile.  Thou shalt prove\nHow salt the savour is of other's bread,\nHow hard the passage to descend and climb\nBy other's stairs, But that shall gall thee most\nWill be the worthless and vile company,\nWith whom thou must be thrown into these straits.\nFor all ungrateful, impious all and mad,\nShall turn 'gainst thee: but in a little while\nTheirs and not thine shall be the crimson'd brow\nTheir course shall so evince their brutishness\nT' have ta'en thy stand apart shall well become thee.\n\n\"First refuge thou must find, first place of rest,\nIn the great Lombard's courtesy, who bears\nUpon the ladder perch'd the sacred bird.\nHe shall behold thee with such kind regard,\nThat 'twixt ye two, the contrary to that\nWhich falls 'twixt other men, the granting shall\nForerun the asking.  With him shalt thou see\nThat mortal, who was at his birth impress\nSo strongly from this star, that of his deeds\nThe nations shall take note.  His unripe age\nYet holds him from observance; for these wheels\nOnly nine years have compass him about.\nBut, ere the Gascon practice on great Harry,\nSparkles of virtue shall shoot forth in him,\nIn equal scorn of labours and of gold.\nHis bounty shall be spread abroad so widely,\nAs not to let the tongues e'en of his foes\nBe idle in its praise.  Look thou to him\nAnd his beneficence: for he shall cause\nReversal of their lot to many people,\nRich men and beggars interchanging fortunes.\nAnd thou shalt bear this written in thy soul\nOf him, but tell it not;\" and things he told\nIncredible to those who witness them;\nThen added: \"So interpret thou, my son,\nWhat hath been told thee.--Lo! the ambushment\nThat a few circling seasons hide for thee!\nYet envy not thy neighbours: time extends\nThy span beyond their treason's chastisement.\"\n\nSoon, as the saintly spirit, by his silence,\nHad shown the web, which I had streteh'd for him\nUpon the warp, was woven, I began,\nAs one, who in perplexity desires\nCounsel of other, wise, benign and friendly:\n\"My father! well I mark how time spurs on\nToward me, ready to inflict the blow,\nWhich falls most heavily on him, who most\nAbandoned himself.  Therefore 't is good\nI should forecast, that driven from the place\nMost dear to me, I may not lose myself\nAll others by my song.  Down through the world\nOf infinite mourning, and along the mount\nFrom whose fair height my lady's eyes did lift me,\nAnd after through this heav'n from light to light,\nHave I learnt that, which if I tell again,\nIt may with many woefully disrelish;\nAnd, if I am a timid friend to truth,\nI fear my life may perish among those,\nTo whom these days shall be of ancient date.\"\n\nThe brightness, where enclos'd the treasure smil'd,\nWhich I had found there, first shone glisteningly,\nLike to a golden mirror in the sun;\nNext answer'd: \"Conscience, dimm'd or by its own\nOr other's shame, will feel thy saying sharp.\nThou, notwithstanding, all deceit remov'd,\nSee the whole vision be made manifest.\nAnd let them wince who have their withers wrung.\nWhat though, when tasted first, thy voice shall prove\nUnwelcome, on digestion it will turn\nTo vital nourishment.  The cry thou raisest,\nShall, as the wind doth, smite the proudest summits;\nWhich is of honour no light argument,\nFor this there only have been shown to thee,\nThroughout these orbs, the mountain, and the deep,\nSpirits, whom fame hath note of.  For the mind\nOf him, who hears, is loth to acquiesce\nAnd fix its faith, unless the instance brought\nBe palpable, and proof apparent urge.\"\n\n\n\n\nCANTO XVIII\n\nCANTO XVIII\n\nNow in his word, sole, ruminating, joy'd\nThat blessed spirit; and I fed on mine,\nTempting the sweet with bitter: she meanwhile,\nWho led me unto God, admonish'd: \"Muse\nOn other thoughts: bethink thee, that near Him\nI dwell, who recompenseth every wrong.\"\n\nAt the sweet sounds of comfort straight I turn'd;\nAnd, in the saintly eyes what love was seen,\nI leave in silence here: nor through distrust\nOf my words only, but that to such bliss\nThe mind remounts not without aid.  Thus much\nYet may I speak; that, as I gaz'd on her,\nAffection found no room for other wish.\nWhile the everlasting pleasure, that did full\nOn Beatrice shine, with second view\nFrom her fair countenance my gladden'd soul\nContented; vanquishing me with a beam\nOf her soft smile, she spake: \"Turn thee, and list.\nThese eyes are not thy only Paradise.\"\n\nAs here we sometimes in the looks may see\nTh' affection mark'd, when that its sway hath ta'en\nThe spirit wholly; thus the hallow'd light,\nTo whom I turn'd, flashing, bewray'd its will\nTo talk yet further with me, and began:\n\"On this fifth lodgment of the tree, whose life\nIs from its top, whose fruit is ever fair\nAnd leaf unwith'ring, blessed spirits abide,\nThat were below, ere they arriv'd in heav'n,\nSo mighty in renown, as every muse\nMight grace her triumph with them.  On the horns\nLook therefore of the cross: he, whom I name,\nShall there enact, as doth in summer cloud\nIts nimble fire.\"  Along the cross I saw,\nAt the repeated name of Joshua,\nA splendour gliding; nor, the word was said,\nEre it was done: then, at the naming saw\nOf the great Maccabee, another move\nWith whirling speed; and gladness was the scourge\nUnto that top.  The next for Charlemagne\nAnd for the peer Orlando, two my gaze\nPursued, intently, as the eye pursues\nA falcon flying.  Last, along the cross,\nWilliam, and Renard, and Duke Godfrey drew\nMy ken, and Robert Guiscard.  And the soul,\nWho spake with me among the other lights\nDid move away, and mix; and with the choir\nOf heav'nly songsters prov'd his tuneful skill.\n\nTo Beatrice on my right l bent,\nLooking for intimation or by word\nOr act, what next behoov'd; and did descry\nSuch mere effulgence in her eyes, such joy,\nIt past all former wont.  And, as by sense\nOf new delight, the man, who perseveres\nIn good deeds doth perceive from day to day\nHis virtue growing; I e'en thus perceiv'd\nOf my ascent, together with the heav'n\nThe circuit widen'd, noting the increase\nOf beauty in that wonder.  Like the change\nIn a brief moment on some maiden's cheek,\nWhich from its fairness doth discharge the weight\nOf pudency, that stain'd it; such in her,\nAnd to mine eyes so sudden was the change,\nThrough silvery whiteness of that temperate star,\nWhose sixth orb now enfolded us.  I saw,\nWithin that Jovial cresset, the clear sparks\nOf love, that reign'd there, fashion to my view\nOur language.  And as birds, from river banks\nArisen, now in round, now lengthen'd troop,\nArray them in their flight, greeting, as seems,\nTheir new-found pastures; so, within the lights,\nThe saintly creatures flying, sang, and made\nNow D. now I. now L. figur'd I' th' air.\n\nFirst, singing, to their notes they mov'd, then one\nBecoming of these signs, a little while\nDid rest them, and were mute.  O nymph divine\nOf Pegasean race! whose souls, which thou\nInspir'st, mak'st glorious and long-liv'd, as they\nCities and realms by thee! thou with thyself\nInform me; that I may set forth the shapes,\nAs fancy doth present them.  Be thy power\nDisplay'd in this brief song.  The characters,\nVocal and consonant, were five-fold seven.\nIn order each, as they appear'd, I mark'd.\nDiligite Justitiam, the first,\nBoth verb and noun all blazon'd; and the extreme\nQui judicatis terram.  In the M.\nOf the fifth word they held their station,\nMaking the star seem silver streak'd with gold.\nAnd on the summit of the M. I saw\nDescending other lights, that rested there,\nSinging, methinks, their bliss and primal good.\nThen, as at shaking of a lighted brand,\nSparkles innumerable on all sides\nRise scatter'd, source of augury to th' unwise;\nThus more than thousand twinkling lustres hence\nSeem'd reascending, and a higher pitch\nSome mounting, and some less; e'en as the sun,\nWhich kindleth them, decreed.  And when each one\nHad settled in his place, the head and neck\nThen saw I of an eagle, lively\nGrav'd in that streaky fire.  Who painteth there,\nHath none to guide him; of himself he guides;\nAnd every line and texture of the nest\nDoth own from him the virtue, fashions it.\nThe other bright beatitude, that seem'd\nErewhile, with lilied crowning, well content\nTo over-canopy the M. mov'd forth,\nFollowing gently the impress of the bird.\n\n Sweet star! what glorious and thick-studded gems\nDeclar'd to me our justice on the earth\nTo be the effluence of that heav'n, which thou,\nThyself a costly jewel, dost inlay!\nTherefore I pray the Sovran Mind, from whom\nThy motion and thy virtue are begun,\nThat he would look from whence the fog doth rise,\nTo vitiate thy beam: so that once more\nHe may put forth his hand 'gainst such, as drive\nTheir traffic in that sanctuary, whose walls\nWith miracles and martyrdoms were built.\n\nYe host of heaven! whose glory I survey!\nO beg ye grace for those, that are on earth\nAll after ill example gone astray.\nWar once had for its instrument the sword:\nBut now 't is made, taking the bread away\nWhich the good Father locks from none.  --And thou,\nThat writes but to cancel, think, that they,\nWho for the vineyard, which thou wastest, died,\nPeter and Paul live yet, and mark thy doings.\nThou hast good cause to cry, \"My heart so cleaves\nTo him, that liv'd in solitude remote,\nAnd from the wilds was dragg'd to martyrdom,\nI wist not of the fisherman nor Paul.\"\n\n\n\n\nCANTO XIX\n\nBefore my sight appear'd, with open wings,\nThe beauteous image, in fruition sweet\nGladdening the thronged spirits.  Each did seem\nA little ruby, whereon so intense\nThe sun-beam glow'd that to mine eyes it came\nIn clear refraction.  And that, which next\nBefalls me to portray, voice hath not utter'd,\nNor hath ink written, nor in fantasy\nWas e'er conceiv'd.  For I beheld and heard\nThe beak discourse; and, what intention form'd\nOf many, singly as of one express,\nBeginning: \"For that I was just and piteous,\nl am exalted to this height of glory,\nThe which no wish exceeds: and there on earth\nHave I my memory left, e'en by the bad\nCommended, while they leave its course untrod.\"\n\nThus is one heat from many embers felt,\nAs in that image many were the loves,\nAnd one the voice, that issued from them all.\nWhence I address them: \"O perennial flowers\nOf gladness everlasting! that exhale\nIn single breath your odours manifold!\nBreathe now; and let the hunger be appeas'd,\nThat with great craving long hath held my soul,\nFinding no food on earth.  This well I know,\nThat if there be in heav'n a realm, that shows\nIn faithful mirror the celestial Justice,\nYours without veil reflects it.  Ye discern\nThe heed, wherewith I do prepare myself\nTo hearken; ye the doubt that urges me\nWith such inveterate craving.\"  Straight I saw,\nLike to a falcon issuing from the hood,\nThat rears his head, and claps him with his wings,\nHis beauty and his eagerness bewraying.\nSo saw I move that stately sign, with praise\nOf grace divine inwoven and high song\nOf inexpressive joy.  \"He,\" it began,\n\"Who turn'd his compass on the world's extreme,\nAnd in that space so variously hath wrought,\nBoth openly, and in secret, in such wise\nCould not through all the universe display\nImpression of his glory, that the Word\nOf his omniscience should not still remain\nIn infinite excess.  In proof whereof,\nHe first through pride supplanted, who was sum\nOf each created being, waited not\nFor light celestial, and abortive fell.\nWhence needs each lesser nature is but scant\nReceptacle unto that Good, which knows\nNo limit, measur'd by itself alone.\nTherefore your sight, of th' omnipresent Mind\nA single beam, its origin must own\nSurpassing far its utmost potency.\nThe ken, your world is gifted with, descends\nIn th' everlasting Justice as low down,\nAs eye doth in the sea; which though it mark\nThe bottom from the shore, in the wide main\nDiscerns it not; and ne'ertheless it is,\nBut hidden through its deepness.  Light is none,\nSave that which cometh from the pure serene\nOf ne'er disturbed ether: for the rest,\n'Tis darkness all, or shadow of the flesh,\nOr else its poison.  Here confess reveal'd\nThat covert, which hath hidden from thy search\nThe living justice, of the which thou mad'st\nSuch frequent question; for thou saidst--'A man\nIs born on Indus' banks, and none is there\nWho speaks of Christ, nor who doth read nor write,\nAnd all his inclinations and his acts,\nAs far as human reason sees, are good,\nAnd he offendeth not in word or deed.\nBut unbaptiz'd he dies, and void of faith.\nWhere is the justice that condemns him?  where\nHis blame, if he believeth not?'--What then,\nAnd who art thou, that on the stool wouldst sit\nTo judge at distance of a thousand miles\nWith the short-sighted vision of a span?\nTo him, who subtilizes thus with me,\nThere would assuredly be room for doubt\nEven to wonder, did not the safe word\nOf scripture hold supreme authority.\n\n\"O animals of clay!  O spirits gross I\nThe primal will, that in itself is good,\nHath from itself, the chief Good, ne'er been mov'd.\nJustice consists in consonance with it,\nDerivable by no created good,\nWhose very cause depends upon its beam.\"\n\nAs on her nest the stork, that turns about\nUnto her young, whom lately she hath fed,\nWhile they with upward eyes do look on her;\nSo lifted I my gaze; and bending so\nThe ever-blessed image wav'd its wings,\nLab'ring with such deep counsel.  Wheeling round\nIt warbled, and did say: \"As are my notes\nTo thee, who understand'st them not, such is\nTh' eternal judgment unto mortal ken.\"\n\nThen still abiding in that ensign rang'd,\nWherewith the Romans over-awed the world,\nThose burning splendours of the Holy Spirit\nTook up the strain; and thus it spake again:\n\"None ever hath ascended to this realm,\nWho hath not a believer been in Christ,\nEither before or after the blest limbs\nWere nail'd upon the wood.  But lo! of those\nWho call 'Christ, Christ,' there shall be many found,\n In judgment, further off from him by far,\nThan such, to whom his name was never known.\nChristians like these the Ethiop shall condemn:\nWhen that the two assemblages shall part;\nOne rich eternally, the other poor.\n\n\"What may the Persians say unto your kings,\nWhen they shall see that volume, in the which\nAll their dispraise is written, spread to view?\nThere amidst Albert's works shall that be read,\nWhich will give speedy motion to the pen,\nWhen Prague shall mourn her desolated realm.\nThere shall be read the woe, that he doth work\nWith his adulterate money on the Seine,\nWho by the tusk will perish: there be read\nThe thirsting pride, that maketh fool alike\nThe English and Scot, impatient of their bound.\nThere shall be seen the Spaniard's luxury,\nThe delicate living there of the Bohemian,\nWho still to worth has been a willing stranger.\nThe halter of Jerusalem shall see\nA unit for his virtue, for his vices\nNo less a mark than million.  He, who guards\nThe isle of fire by old Anchises honour'd\nShall find his avarice there and cowardice;\nAnd better to denote his littleness,\nThe writing must be letters maim'd, that speak\nMuch in a narrow space.  All there shall know\nHis uncle and his brother's filthy doings,\nWho so renown'd a nation and two crowns\nHave bastardized.  And they, of Portugal\nAnd Norway, there shall be expos'd with him\nOf Ratza, who hath counterfeited ill\nThe coin of Venice.  O blest Hungary!\nIf thou no longer patiently abid'st\nThy ill-entreating! and, O blest Navarre!\nIf with thy mountainous girdle thou wouldst arm thee\nIn earnest of that day, e'en now are heard\nWailings and groans in Famagosta's streets\nAnd Nicosia's, grudging at their beast,\nWho keepeth even footing with the rest.\"\n\n\n\n\nCANTO XX\n\nWhen, disappearing, from our hemisphere,\nThe world's enlightener vanishes, and day\nOn all sides wasteth, suddenly the sky,\nErewhile irradiate only with his beam,\nIs yet again unfolded, putting forth\nInnumerable lights wherein one shines.\nOf such vicissitude in heaven I thought,\nAs the great sign, that marshaleth the world\nAnd the world's leaders, in the blessed beak\nWas silent; for that all those living lights,\nWaxing in splendour, burst forth into songs,\nSuch as from memory glide and fall away.\n\nSweet love! that dost apparel thee in smiles,\nHow lustrous was thy semblance in those sparkles,\nWhich merely are from holy thoughts inspir'd!\n\nAfter the precious and bright beaming stones,\nThat did ingem the sixth light, ceas'd the chiming\nOf their angelic bells; methought I heard\nThe murmuring of a river, that doth fall\nFrom rock to rock transpicuous, making known\nThe richness of his spring-head: and as sound\nOf cistern, at the fret-board, or of pipe,\nIs, at the wind-hole, modulate and tun'd;\nThus up the neck, as it were hollow, rose\nThat murmuring of the eagle, and forthwith\nVoice there assum'd, and thence along the beak\nIssued in form of words, such as my heart\nDid look for, on whose tables I inscrib'd them.\n\n\"The part in me, that sees, and bears the sun,,\nIn mortal eagles,\" it began, \"must now\nBe noted steadfastly: for of the fires,\nThat figure me, those, glittering in mine eye,\nAre chief of all the greatest.  This, that shines\nMidmost for pupil, was the same, who sang\nThe Holy Spirit's song, and bare about\nThe ark from town to town; now doth he know\nThe merit of his soul-impassion'd strains\nBy their well-fitted guerdon.  Of the five,\nThat make the circle of the vision, he\nWho to the beak is nearest, comforted\nThe widow for her son: now doth he know\nHow dear he costeth not to follow Christ,\nBoth from experience of this pleasant life,\nAnd of its opposite.  He next, who follows\nIn the circumference, for the over arch,\nBy true repenting slack'd the pace of death:\nNow knoweth he, that the degrees of heav'n\nAlter not, when through pious prayer below\nToday's is made tomorrow's destiny.\nThe other following, with the laws and me,\nTo yield the shepherd room, pass'd o'er to Greece,\nFrom good intent producing evil fruit:\nNow knoweth he, how all the ill, deriv'd\nFrom his well doing, doth not helm him aught,\nThough it have brought destruction on the world.\nThat, which thou seest in the under bow,\nWas William, whom that land bewails, which weeps\nFor Charles and Frederick living: now he knows\nHow well is lov'd in heav'n the righteous king,\nWhich he betokens by his radiant seeming.\nWho in the erring world beneath would deem,\nThat Trojan Ripheus in this round was set\nFifth of the saintly splendours?  now he knows\nEnough of that, which the world cannot see,\nThe grace divine, albeit e'en his sight\nReach not its utmost depth.\"  Like to the lark,\nThat warbling in the air expatiates long,\nThen, trilling out his last sweet melody,\nDrops satiate with the sweetness; such appear'd\nThat image stampt by the' everlasting pleasure,\nWhich fashions like itself all lovely things.\n\nI, though my doubting were as manifest,\nAs is through glass the hue that mantles it,\nIn silence waited not: for to my lips\n\"What things are these?\"  involuntary rush'd,\nAnd forc'd a passage out: whereat I mark'd\nA sudden lightening and new revelry.\nThe eye was kindled: and the blessed sign\nNo more to keep me wond'ring and suspense,\nReplied: \"I see that thou believ'st these things,\nBecause I tell them, but discern'st not how;\nSo that thy knowledge waits not on thy faith:\nAs one who knows the name of thing by rote,\nBut is a stranger to its properties,\nTill other's tongue reveal them.  Fervent love\nAnd lively hope with violence assail\nThe kingdom of the heavens, and overcome\nThe will of the Most high; not in such sort\nAs man prevails o'er man; but conquers it,\nBecause 't is willing to be conquer'd, still,\nThough conquer'd, by its mercy conquering.\n\n\"Those, in the eye who live the first and fifth,\nCause thee to marvel, in that thou behold'st\nThe region of the angels deck'd with them.\nThey quitted not their bodies, as thou deem'st,\nGentiles but Christians, in firm rooted faith,\nThis of the feet in future to be pierc'd,\nThat of feet nail'd already to the cross.\nOne from the barrier of the dark abyss,\nWhere never any with good will returns,\nCame back unto his bones.  Of lively hope\nSuch was the meed; of lively hope, that wing'd\nThe prayers sent up to God for his release,\nAnd put power into them to bend his will.\nThe glorious Spirit, of whom I speak to thee,\nA little while returning to the flesh,\nBeliev'd in him, who had the means to help,\nAnd, in believing, nourish'd such a flame\nOf holy love, that at the second death\nHe was made sharer in our gamesome mirth.\nThe other, through the riches of that grace,\nWhich from so deep a fountain doth distil,\nAs never eye created saw its rising,\nPlac'd all his love below on just and right:\nWherefore of grace God op'd in him the eye\nTo the redemption of mankind to come;\nWherein believing, he endur'd no more\nThe filth of paganism, and for their ways\nRebuk'd the stubborn nations.  The three nymphs,\nWhom at the right wheel thou beheldst advancing,\nWere sponsors for him more than thousand years\nBefore baptizing.  O how far remov'd,\nPredestination! is thy root from such\nAs see not the First cause entire: and ye,\nO mortal men! be wary how ye judge:\nFor we, who see our Maker, know not yet\nThe number of the chosen: and esteem\nSuch scantiness of knowledge our delight:\nFor all our good is in that primal good\nConcentrate, and God's will and ours are one.\"\n\nSo, by that form divine, was giv'n to me\nSweet medicine to clear and strengthen sight,\nAnd, as one handling skillfully the harp,\nAttendant on some skilful songster's voice\nBids the chords vibrate, and therein the song\nAcquires more pleasure; so, the whilst it spake,\nIt doth remember me, that I beheld\nThe pair of blessed luminaries move.\nLike the accordant twinkling of two eyes,\nTheir beamy circlets, dancing to the sounds.\n\n\n\n\nCANTO XXI\n\nAgain mine eyes were fix'd on Beatrice,\nAnd with mine eyes my soul, that in her looks\nFound all contentment.  Yet no smile she wore\nAnd, \"Did I smile,\" quoth she, \"thou wouldst be straight\nLike Semele when into ashes turn'd:\nFor, mounting these eternal palace-stairs,\nMy beauty, which the loftier it climbs,\nAs thou hast noted, still doth kindle more,\nSo shines, that, were no temp'ring interpos'd,\nThy mortal puissance would from its rays\nShrink, as the leaf doth from the thunderbolt.\nInto the seventh splendour are we wafted,\nThat underneath the burning lion's breast\nBeams, in this hour, commingled with his might,\nThy mind be with thine eyes: and in them mirror'd\nThe shape, which in this mirror shall be shown.\"\nWhoso can deem, how fondly I had fed\nMy sight upon her blissful countenance,\nMay know, when to new thoughts I chang'd, what joy\nTo do the bidding of my heav'nly guide:\nIn equal balance poising either weight.\n\nWithin the crystal, which records the name,\n(As its remoter circle girds the world)\nOf that lov'd monarch, in whose happy reign\nNo ill had power to harm, I saw rear'd up,\nIn colour like to sun-illumin'd gold.\n\nA ladder, which my ken pursued in vain,\nSo lofty was the summit; down whose steps\nI saw the splendours in such multitude\nDescending, ev'ry light in heav'n, methought,\nWas shed thence.  As the rooks, at dawn of day\nBestirring them to dry their feathers chill,\nSome speed their way a-field, and homeward some,\nReturning, cross their flight, while some abide\nAnd wheel around their airy lodge; so seem'd\nThat glitterance, wafted on alternate wing,\nAs upon certain stair it met, and clash'd\nIts shining. And one ling'ring near us, wax'd\nSo bright, that in my thought: said: \"The love,\nWhich this betokens me, admits no doubt.\"\n\nUnwillingly from question I refrain,\nTo her, by whom my silence and my speech\nAre order'd, looking for a sign: whence she,\nWho in the sight of Him, that seeth all,\nSaw wherefore I was silent, prompted me\nT' indulge the fervent wish; and I began:\n\"I am not worthy, of my own desert,\nThat thou shouldst answer me; but for her sake,\nWho hath vouchsaf'd my asking, spirit blest!\nThat in thy joy art shrouded! say the cause,\nWhich bringeth thee so near: and wherefore, say,\nDoth the sweet symphony of Paradise\nKeep silence here, pervading with such sounds\nOf rapt devotion ev'ry lower sphere?\"\n\"Mortal art thou in hearing as in sight;\"\nWas the reply: \"and what forbade the smile\nOf Beatrice interrupts our song.\nOnly to yield thee gladness of my voice,\nAnd of the light that vests me, I thus far\nDescend these hallow'd steps: not that more love\nInvites me; for lo! there aloft, as much\nOr more of love is witness'd in those flames:\nBut such my lot by charity assign'd,\nThat makes us ready servants, as thou seest,\nTo execute the counsel of the Highest.\"\n\"That in this court,\" said I, \"O sacred lamp!\nLove no compulsion needs, but follows free\nTh' eternal Providence, I well discern:\nThis harder find to deem, why of thy peers\nThou only to this office wert foredoom'd.\"\nI had not ended, when, like rapid mill,\nUpon its centre whirl'd the light; and then\nThe love, that did inhabit there, replied:\n\"Splendour eternal, piercing through these folds,\nIts virtue to my vision knits, and thus\nSupported, lifts me so above myself,\nThat on the sov'ran essence, which it wells from,\nI have the power to gaze: and hence the joy,\nWherewith I sparkle, equaling with my blaze\nThe keenness of my sight.

The ruggedness of\nthis task has often been increased by the use of disconnected\nsentences, or lessons as dry and uninteresting as finger exercises on\nthe piano. It is a sign of promise that the demand for reading matter\nof interest to the child has come from teachers. I have endeavored to\nmeet this requirement in the following stories.\n\nAs far as possible the words chosen have been such as are not\ndifficult to the little reader, either from their length or their\nunfamiliarity. The sentences and paragraphs are short. Learning to\nread is like climbing a steep hill, and it is a great relief to the\npanting child to find frequent breathing places.\n\nIt is one of the purposes of these stories to make the mind of the\npupil familiar with some of the leading figures in the history of our\ncountry by means of personal anecdote. Some of the stories are those\nthat every American child ought to know, because they have become a\nkind of national folklore. Such, for example, are \"Putnam and the\nWolf\" and the story of \"Franklin's Whistle.\" I have thought it\nimportant to present as great a variety of subjects as possible, so\nthat the pupil may learn something not only of great warriors and\npatriots, but also of great statesmen. The exploits of discoverers,\nthe triumphs of American inventors, and the achievements of men of\nletters and men of science, find place in these stories. All the\nnarratives are historical, or at least no stories have been told for\ntrue that are deemed fictitious. Every means which the writer's\nliterary experience could suggest has been used to make the stories\nengaging, in the hope that the interest of the narrative may prove a\nsufficient spur to exertion on the part of the pupil, and that this\nlittle book will make green and pleasant a pathway that has so often\nbeen dry and laborious. It will surely serve to excite an early\ninterest in our national history by giving some of the great\npersonages of that history a place among the heroes that impress the\nsusceptible imagination of a child. It is thus that biographical and\nhistorical incidents acquire something of the vitality of folk tales.\n\nThe illustrations that accompany the text have been planned with\nspecial reference to the awakening of the child's attention. To keep\nthe mind alert and at its best is more than half the battle in\nteaching. The publishers and the author of this little book believe\nthat in laying the foundation of a child's education the best work is\nnone too good.\n\nThe larger words have been divided by hyphens when a separation into\nsyllables is likely to help the learner. The use of the hyphen has\nbeen regulated entirely with a view to its utility. After a word not\ntoo difficult has been made familiar by its repeated occurrence, the\nhyphens are omitted.\n\n\n\n\n\nCONTENTS.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe First Governor in Boston\nMarquette in Iowa\nIndian Pictures\nWilliam Penn and the Indians\nOne Little Bag of Rice\nThe Story of a Wise Woman\nFranklin his own Teacher\nHow Franklin found out Things\nFranklin asks the Sunshine something\nFranklin and the Kite\nFranklin's Whistle\nToo much for the Whistle\nJohn Stark and the Indians\nA Great Good Man\nPutnam and the Wolf\nWashington and his Hatchet\nHow Benny West learned to be a Painter\nWashington's Christmas Gift\nHow Washington got out of a Trap\nWashington's Last Battle\nMarion's Tower\nClark and his Men\nDaniel Boone and his Grapevine Swing\nDaniel Boone's Daughter and her Friends\nDecatur and the Pirates\nStories about Jefferson\nA Long Journey\nCaptain Clark's Burning Glass\nQuicksilver Bob\nThe First Steamboat\nWashington Irving as a Boy\nDon't give up the Ship\nGrandfather's Rhyme\nThe Star-spangled Banner\nHow Audubon came to know about Birds\nAudubon in the Wild Woods\nHunting a Panther\nSome Boys who became Authors\nDaniel Webster and his Brother\nWebster and the Poor Woman\nThe India-rubber Man\nDoctor Kane in the Frozen Sea\nA Dinner on the Ice\nDoctor Kane gets out of the Frozen Sea\nLongfellow as a Boy\nKit Carson and the Bears\nHorace Greeley as a Boy\nHorace Greeley learning to Print\nA Wonderful Woman\nThe Author of \"Little Women\"\nMy Kingdom\nA Song from the Suds\n\n\n\n\n\nSTORIES OF GREAT AMERICANS.\n\n[Illustration: THE FIRST GOVERNOR IN BOSTON]\n\nBefore the white people came, there were no houses in this country but\nthe little huts of the In-di-ans. The In-di-an houses were made of\nbark, or mats, or skins, spread over poles.\n\nSome people came to one part of the country. Others started\nset-tle-ments in other places. When more people came, some of these\nset-tle-ments grew into towns. The woods were cut down. Farms were\nplanted. Roads were made. But it took many years for the country to\nfill with people.\n\nThe first white people that came to live in the woods where Boston is\nnow, settled there a long time ago. They had a gov-ern-or over them.\nHe was a good man, and did much for the people. His name was John\nWin-throp.\n\nThe first thing the people had to do was to cut down the trees. After\nthat they could plant corn. But at first they could not raise\nany-thing to eat. They had brought flour and oat-meal from England.\nBut they found that it was not enough to last till they could raise\ncorn on their new ground.\n\nWin-throp sent a ship to get more food for them. The ship was gone a\nlong time. The people ate up all their food. They were hungry. They\nwent to the sea-shore, and found clams and mussels. They were glad to\nget these to eat.\n\nAt last they set a day for every-body to fast and pray for food. The\ngov-ern-or had a little flour left. Nearly all of this was made into\nbread, and put into the oven to bake. He did not know when he would\nget any more.\n\nSoon after this a poor man came along. His flour was all gone. His\nbread had all been eaten up. His family were hungry. The gov-ern-or\ngave the poor man the very last flour that he had in the barrel.\n\nJust then a ship was seen. It sailed up toward Boston. It was loaded\nwith food for all the people.\n\nThe time for the fast day came. But there was now plenty of food. The\nfast day was turned into a thanks-giving day.\n\nOne day a man sent a very cross letter to Gov-ern-or Win-throp.\nWin-throp sent it back to him. He said, \"I cannot keep a letter that\nmight make me angry.\" Then the man that had written the cross letter\nwrote to Win-throp, \"By con-quer-ing yourself, you have\ncon-quered me.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMARQUETTE IN IOWA.\n\n\nThe first white men to go into the middle of our country were\nFrench-men. The French had settled in Can-a-da. They sent\nmis-sion-a-ries to preach to the Indians in the West. They also sent\ntraders to buy furs from the Indians.\n\nThe French-men heard the Indians talk about a great river in the West.\nBut no French-man had ever gone far enough to see the Mis-sis-sip-pi.\n\nMar-quette was a priest. Jo-li-et was a trader. These two men were\nsent to find the great river that the Indians talked about.\n\nThey trav-eled in two birch canoes. They took five men to paddle the\ncanoes. They took some smoked meat to eat on the way. They also took\nsome Indian corn. They had trinkets to trade to the Indians.\nHatchets, and beads, and bits of cloth were the money they used to pay\nthe Indians for what they wanted.\n\nThe friendly Indians in Wis-con-sin tried to per-suade them not to go.\nThey told them that the Indians on the great river would kill them.\n\nThe friendly Indians also told them that there was a demon in one part\nof the river. They said that this demon roared so loud that he could\nbe heard a long way off. They said that the demon would draw the\ntrav-el-ers down into the water. Then they told about great monsters\nthat ate up men and their canoes.\n\nBut Mar-quette and the men with him thought they would risk the\njourney. They would not turn back for fear of the demon or\nthe monsters.\n\nThe two little canoes went down the Wis-con-sin River. After some days\nthey came to the Mis-sis-sip-pi. More than a hundred years before, the\nSpaniards had seen the lower part of this river. But no white man had\never seen this part of the great river. Mar-quette did not know that\nany white man had ever seen any part of the Mis-sis-sip-pi.\n\nThe two little canoes now turned their bows down the river. Some-times\nthey saw great herds of buf-fa-loes. Some of these came to the bank of\nthe river to look at the men in the canoes. They had long, shaggy\nmanes, which hung down over their eyes.\n\nFor two weeks the trav-el-ers paddled down the river. In all this time\nthey did not see any Indians. After they had gone hundreds of miles in\nthis way, they came to a place where they saw tracks in the mud. It\nwas in what is now the State of I-o-wa.\n\nMar-quette and Jo-li-et left the men in their canoes, and followed the\ntracks. After walking two hours, they came to an Indian village. The\nFrenchmen came near enough to hear the Indians talking. The Indians\ndid not see them.\n\nJo-li-et and Mar-quette did not know whether the Indians would kill\nthem or not. They said a short prayer. Then they stood out in full\nview, and gave a loud shout.\n\nThe Indians came out of their tents like bees. They stared at the\nstrangers. Then four Indians came toward them. These Indians carried a\npeace pipe. They held this up toward the sun. This meant that they\nwere friendly.\n\nThe Indians now offered the peace pipe to the French-men. The\nFrench-men took it, and smoked with the Indians. This was the Indian\nway of saying, \"We are friends.\"\n\n[Illustration: Marquette and Joliet]\n\nMar-quette asked the Indians what tribe they belonged to.\nThey told him that they were of the tribe called the Il-li-nois.\n\nThey took Jo-li-et and Mar-quette into their village. They came to the\ndoor of a large wig-wam. A chief stood in the door. He shaded his eyes\nwith both hands, as if the sun were shining in his face. Then he made\na little speech.\n\nHe said, \"French-men, how bright the sun shines when you come to see\nus! We are all waiting for you. You shall now come into our houses\nin peace.\"\n\nThe Il-li-nois Indians made a feast for their new friends. First they\nhad mush of corn meal, with fat meat in it. One of the Indians fed the\nFrenchmen as though they were babies. He put mush into their mouths\nwith a large spoon.\n\nThen came some fish. The Indian that fed the vis-it-ors picked out the\nbones with his fingers. Then he put the pieces of fish into their\nmouths. After they had some roasted dog. The French-men did not like\nthis. Last, they were fed with buf-fa-lo meat.\n\nThe next morning six hundred Indians went to the canoes to tell the\nFrenchmen good-by. They gave Mar-quette a young Indian slave. And they\ngave him a peace pipe to carry with him.\n\n\n\n\n\nINDIAN PICTURES.\n\n\nWhen Mar-quette and his men left the Il-li-nois, they went on down the\nriver. The friendly Il-li-nois had told them that the Indians they\nwould see were bad, and that they would kill any one who came into\ntheir country.\n\nThe Frenchmen had heard before this that there were demons and\nmonsters in the river. One day they saw some high rocks with pictures\npainted on them. The ugly pictures made them think of these monsters.\nThey were painted in red, black, and green colors. They were pictures\nof two Indian demons or gods.\n\nEach one of these monsters was about the size of a calf. They had\nhorns as long as those of a deer. Their eyes were red. Their faces\nwere like a man's, but they were ugly and frightful. They had beards\nlike a tiger's. Their bodies were covered with scales like those on a\nfish. Their long tails were wound round their bodies, and over their\nheads, and down between their legs. The end of each tail was like that\nof a fish.\n\nThe Indians prayed to these ugly gods when they passed in their\ncanoes. Even Mar-quette and his men were a little frightened when they\nsaw such pictures in a place so lonely. The Frenchmen went down the\nriver about twelve hundred miles. Some-times the Indians tried to kill\nthem, but by showing the peace pipe they made friends. At last they\nturned back. Jo-li-et went to Can-a-da. Mar-quette preached to the\nIndians in the West till he died.\n\n\n\n\n\nWILLIAM PENN AND THE INDIANS.\n\n\nThe King of England gave all the land in Penn-syl-va-ni-a to William\nPenn. The King made Penn a kind of king over Penn-syl-va-ni-a. Penn\ncould make the laws of this new country. But he let the people make\ntheir own laws.\n\nPenn wanted to be friendly with the Indians. He paid them for all the\nland his people wanted to live on. Before he went to Penn-syl-va-ni-a\nhe wrote a letter to the Indians. He told them in this letter that he\nwould not let any of his people do any harm to the Indians. He said he\nwould punish any-body that did any wrong to an Indian. This letter was\nread to the Indians in their own lan-guage.\n\nSoon after this Penn got into a ship and sailed from England. He\nsailed to Penn-syl-va-ni-a. When he came there, he sent word to the\ntribes of Indians to come to meet him.\n\nThe Indians met under a great elm tree on the bank of the river.\nIndians like to hold their solemn meetings out of doors. They sit on\nthe ground. They say that the earth is the Indian's mother.\n\nWhen Penn came to the place of meeting, he found the woods full of\nIndians. As far as he could see, there were crowds of Indians. Penn's\nfriends were few. They had no guns.\n\nPenn had a bright blue sash round his waist. One of the Indian chiefs,\nwho was the great chief, put on a kind of cap or crown. In the middle\nof this was a small horn. The head chief wore this only at such great\nmeetings as this one.\n\nWhen the great chief had put on his horn, all the other chiefs and\ngreat men of the Indians put down their guns. Then they sat down in\nfront of Penn in the form of a half-moon. Then the great chief told\nPenn that the Indians were ready to hear what he had to say.\n\nPenn had a large paper in which he had written all the things that he\nand his friends had promised to the Indians. He had written all the\npromises that the Indians were to make to the white people. This was\nto make them friends. When Penn had read this to them, it was\nexplained to them in their own lan-guage. Penn told them that they\nmight stay in the country that they had sold to the white people. The\nland would belong to both the Indians and the white people.\n\nThen Penn laid the large paper down on the ground. That was to show\nthem, he said, that the ground was to belong to the Indians and the\nwhite people to-geth-er.\n\nHe said that there might be quarrels between some of the white people\nand some of the Indians. But they would settle any quarrels without\nfighting. When-ever there should be a quarrel, the Indians were to\npick out six Indians. The white people should also pick out six of\ntheir men. These were to meet, and settle the quarrel.\n\nPenn said, \"I will not call you my children, because fathers\nsome-times whip their children. I will not call you brothers, because\nbrothers sometimes fall out. But I will call you the same person as\nthe white people. We are the two parts of the same body.\"\n\nThe Indians could not write. But they had their way of putting down\nthings that they wished to have re-mem-bered. They gave Penn a belt of\nshell beads. These beads are called wam-pum. Some wam-pum is white.\nSome is purple.\n\nThey made this belt for Penn of white beads. In the middle of the belt\nthey made a picture of purple beads. It is a picture of a white man\nand an Indian. They have hold of each other's hands. When they gave\nthis belt to Penn, they said, \"We will live with William Penn and his\nchildren as long as the sun and moon shall last.\"\n\n[Illustration: Penn jumping with the Indians.]\n\nPenn took up the great paper from the ground. He handed it to the\ngreat chief that wore the horn on his head. He told the Indians to\nkeep it and hand it to their children's children, that they might know\nwhat he had said. Then he gave them many presents of such things as\nthey liked. They gave Penn a name in their own language. They named\nhim \"O-nas.\" That was their word for a feather. As the white people\nused a pen made out of a quill or feather, they called a pen \"o-nas.\"\nThat is why they called William Penn \"Brother O-nas.\"\n\nPenn sometimes went to see the Indians. He talked to them, and gave\nthem friendly advice. Once he saw some of them jumping. They were\ntrying to see who could jump the farthest.\n\nPenn had been a very active boy. He knew how to jump very well. He\nwent to the place where the Indians were jumping. He jumped farther\nthan any of them.\n\nWhen the great gov-ern-or took part in their sport, the Indians were\npleased. They loved Brother O-nas more than ever.\n\n\n\n\n\nONE LITTLE BAG OF RICE\n\n\nThe first white people that came to this country hardly knew how to\nget their living here. They did not know what would grow best in\nthis country.\n\nMany of the white people learned to hunt. All the land was covered\nwith trees. In the woods were many animals whose flesh was good to\neat. There were deer, and bears, and great shaggy buf-fa-loes. There\nwere rabbits and squirrels. And there were many kinds of birds. The\nhunters shot wild ducks, wild turkeys, wild geese, and pigeons. The\npeople also caught many fishes out of the rivers.\n\nThen there were animals with fur on their backs. The people killed\nthese and sold their skins. In this way many made their living.\n\nOther people spent their time in cutting down the trees. They sawed\nthe trees into timbers and boards. Some of it they split into staves\nto make barrels. They sent the staves and other sorts of timber to\nother countries to be sold. In South Car-o-li-na men made tar and\npitch out of the pine trees.\n\nBut there was a wise man in South Car-o-li-na. He was one of those men\nthat find out better ways of doing. His name was Thomas Smith.\n\nThomas Smith had once lived in a large island thousands of miles away\nfrom South Car-o-li-na. In that island he had seen the people raising\nrice. He saw that it was planted in wet ground. He said that he would\nlike to try it in South Car-o-li-na. But he could not get any seed\nrice to plant. The rice that people eat is not fit to sow.\n\nOne day a ship came to Charles-ton, where Thomas Smith lived. It had\nbeen driven there by storms. The ship came from the large island\nwhere Smith had seen rice grow. The captain of this ship was an old\nfriend of Smith.\n\nThe two old friends met once more. Thomas Smith told the captain that\nhe wanted some rice for seed. The captain called the cook of his ship,\nand asked him if he had any. The cook had one little bag of seed rice.\nThe captain gave this to his friend.\n\nThere was some wet ground at the back of Smith's garden. In this wet\nground he sowed some of the rice. It grew finely.\n\nHe gathered a good deal of rice in his garden that year. He gave part\nof this to his friends. They all sowed it. The next year there was a\ngreat deal of rice.\n\nAfter a while the wet land in South Car-o-li-na was turned to rice\nfields. Every year many thousands of barrels of rice were sent away\nto be sold.\n\nAll this came from one little bag of rice and one wise man.\n\n[Illustration: Rice Plant.]\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE STORY OF A WISE WOMAN.\n\n\nYou have read how Thomas Smith first raised rice in Car-o-li-na. After\nhis death there lived in South Car-o-li-na a wise young woman. She\nshowed the people how to raise another plant. Her name was\nEliza Lucas.\n\nThe father of Miss Lucas did not live in Car-o-li-na. He was\ngov-ern-or of one of the islands of the West Indies. Miss Lucas was\nfond of trying new things. She often got seeds from her father. These\nshe planted in South Carolina.\n\nHer father sent her some seeds of the in-di-go plant. She sowed some\nof these in March. But there came a frost. The in-di-go plant cannot\nstand frost. Her plants all died.\n\nBut Miss Lucas did not give up. She sowed some more seeds in April.\nThese grew very well until a cut-worm found them. The worm wished to\ntry new things, too. So he ate off the in-di-go plants.\n\nBut Miss Lucas was one of the people who try, try again. She had lost\nher indigo plants twice. Once more she sowed some of the seed. This\ntime the plants grew very well.\n\nMiss Lucas wrote to her father about it. He sent her a man who knew\nhow to get the indigo out of the plant.\n\nThe man tried not to show Miss Lucas how to make the indigo. He did\nnot wish the people in South Carolina to learn how to make it. He was\nafraid his own people would not get so much for their indigo.\n\nSo he would not explain just how it ought to be done. He spoiled the\nindigo on purpose.\n\nBut Miss Lucas watched him closely. She found out how the indigo ought\nto be made. Some of her father's land in South Carolina was now\nplanted with the indigo plants.\n\n[Illustration: Indigo Plant.]\n\nThen Miss Lucas was married. She became Mrs. Pinck-ney. Her father\ngave her all the indigo growing on his land in South Carolina. It was\nall saved for seed. Some of the seed Mrs. Pinck-ney gave to her\nfriends. Some of it her husband sowed. It all grew, and was made into\nthat blue dye that we call indigo. When it is used in washing clothes,\nit is called bluing.\n\nIn a few years, more than a million pounds of indigo were made in\nSouth Carolina every year. Many people got rich by it. And it was all\nbecause Miss Lucas did not give up.\n\n\n\n\n\nFRANKLIN HIS OWN TEACHER.\n\n\nFew people ever knew so many things as Franklin. Men said, \"How did he\never learn so many things?\" For he had been a poor boy who had to work\nfor a living. He could not go to school at all after he was ten\nyears old.\n\nHis father made soap and candles. Little Ben Frank-lin had to cut\nwicks for the candles. He also filled the candle molds. And he sold\nsoap and candles, and ran on errands. But when he was not at work he\nspent his time in reading good books. What little money he got he used\nto buy books with.\n\nHe read the old story of \"Pil-grim's Prog-ress,\" and liked it so well\nthat he bought all the other stories by the same man. But as he wanted\nmore books, and had not money to buy them, he sold all of these\nbooks. The next he bought were some little his-to-ry books. These were\nmade to sell very cheap, and they were sold by peddlers. He managed to\nbuy forty or fifty of these little books of his-to-ry.\n\nAnother way that he had of learning was by seeing things with his own\neyes. His father took him to see car-pen-ters at work with their saws\nand planes. He also saw masons laying bricks. And he went to see men\nmaking brass and copper kettles. And he saw a man with a turning lathe\nmaking the round legs of chairs. Other men were at work making knives.\nSome things people learn out of books, and some things they have to\nsee for them-selves.\n\nAs he was fond of books, Ben's father thought that it would be a good\nplan to send him to learn to print them. So the boy went to work in\nhis brother's printing office. Here he passed his spare time in\nreading. He borrowed some books out of the stores where books were\nsold. He would sit up a great part of the night sometimes to read one\nof these books. He wished to return it when the book-store opened in\nthe morning. One man who had many books lent to Ben such of his books\nas he wanted.\n\nIt was part of the bargain that Ben's brother should pay his board.\nThe boy offered to board himself if his brother would give him half\nwhat it cost to pay for his board.\n\n[Illustration: Franklin at Study.]\n\nHis brother was glad to do this, and Ben saved part of the money and\nbought books with it. He was a healthy boy, and it did not hurt him\nto live mostly on bread and butter. Sometimes he bought a little pie\nor a handful of raisins.\n\nLong before he was a man, people said, \"How much the boy knows!\" This\nwas because--\n\nHe did not waste his time.\n\nHe read good books.\n\nHe saw things for himself.\n\n\n\n\n\nHOW FRANKLIN FOUND OUT THINGS.\n\n\nFrank-lin thought that ants know how to tell things to one another. He\nthought that they talk by some kind of signs. When an ant has found a\ndead fly too big for him to drag away, he will run off and get some\nother ant to help him. Frank-lin thought that ants have some way of\ntelling other ants that there is work to do.\n\nOne day he found some ants eating mo-las-ses out of a little jar in a\ncloset. He shook them out. Then he tied a string to the jar, and hung\nit on a nail in the ceiling. But he had not got all the ants out of\nthe jar. One little ant liked sweet things so well that he staid in\nthe jar, and kept on eating like a greedy boy.\n\n[Illustration: Ants talking (magnified)]\n\nAt last when this greedy ant had eaten all that he could, he started\nto go home. Frank-lin saw him climb over the rim of the jar. Then the\nant ran down the outside of the jar. But when he got to the bottom, he\ndid not find any shelf there. He went all round the jar. There was no\nway to get down to the floor. The ant ran this way and that way, but\nhe could not get down.\n\n[Illustration: An Ants Feeler (magnified)]\n\nAt last the greedy ant thought he would see if he could go up. He\nclimbed up the string to the ceiling. Then he went down the wall. He\ncame to his own hole at last, no doubt.\n\nAfter a while he got hungry again, perhaps. He thought about that jar\nof sweets at the end of a string. Then perhaps he told the other ants.\nMaybe he let them know that there was a string by which they could get\ndown to the jar.\n\nIn about half an hour after the ant had gone up the string, Franklin\nsaw a swarm of ants going down the string. They marched in a line, one\nafter another. Soon there were two lines of ants on the string. The\nants in one line were going down to get at the sweet food. The ants in\nthe other line were marching up the other side of the string to go\nhome. Do you think that the greedy ant told the other ants about\nthe jar?\n\nAnd did he tell them that there was a string by which an ant could get\nthere?\n\nAnd did he tell it by speaking, or by signs that he made with his\nfeelers?\n\nIf you watch two ants when they meet, you will see that they touch\ntheir feelers together, as if they said \"Good-morning!\"\n\n[Illustration: FRANKLIN ASKS THE SUNSHINE SOMETHING.]\n\nOne day Franklin was eating dinner at the house of a friend. The lady\nof the house, when she poured out the coffee, found that it was\nnot hot.\n\nShe said, \"I am sorry that the coffee is cold. It is because the\nservant forgot to scour the coffee-pot. Coffee gets cold more quickly\nwhen the coffee-pot is not bright.\"\n\nThis set Franklin to thinking. He thought that a black or dull thing\nwould cool more quickly than a white or bright one. That made him\nthink that a black thing would take in heat more quickly than a\nwhite one.\n\nHe wanted to find out if this were true or not. There was no-body who\nknew, so there was no-body to ask. But Franklin thought that he would\nask the sunshine. Maybe the sunshine would tell him whether a black\nthing would heat more quickly than a white thing.\n\nBut how could he ask the sunshine?\n\nThere was snow on the ground. Franklin spread a white cloth on the\nsnow. Then he spread a black cloth on the snow near the white one.\nWhen he came to look at them, he saw that the snow under the black\ncloth melted away much sooner than that under the white cloth.\n\nThat is the way that the sunshine told him that black would take in\nheat more quickly than white. After he had found this out, many people\ngot white hats to wear in the summer time. A white hat is cooler than\na black one.\n\nSome time when there is snow on the ground, you can take a white and a\nblack cloth and ask the sunshine the same question.\n\n\n\n\n\nFRANKLIN AND THE KITE.\n\n\nWhen Franklin wanted to know whether the ants could talk or not, he\nasked the ants, and they told him. When he wanted to know some-thing\nelse, he asked the sunshine about it, as you have read in another\nstory. That is the way that Franklin came to know so many things. He\nknew how to ask questions of every-thing.\n\nOnce he asked the light-ning a question. And the light-ning gave him\nan answer.\n\nBefore the time of Franklin, people did not know what light-ning was.\nThey did not know what made the thunder. Franklin thought much about\nit. At last he proved what it was. He asked the lightning a question,\nand made it tell what it was. To tell you this story, I shall have\nto use one big word. Maybe it is too big for some of my little friends\nthat will read this book. Let us divide it into parts. Then you will\nnot be afraid of it. The big word is e-lec-tric-i-ty.\n\nThose of you who live in towns have seen the streets lighted by\ne-lec-tric-i-ty. But in Franklin's time there were no such lights.\nPeople knew very little about this strange thing with a big name.\n\nBut Franklin found out many things about it that nobody had ever known\nbefore. He began to think that the little sparks he got from\ne-lec-tric-i-ty were small flashes of lightning. He thought that the\nlittle cracking sound of these sparks was a kind of baby thunder.\n\nSo he thought that he would try to catch a little bit of lightning.\nPerhaps he could put it into one of the little bottles used to hold\ne-lec-tric-i-ty. Then if it behaved like e-lec-tric-i-ty, he would\nknow what it was. But catching lightning is not easy. How do you think\nhe did it?\n\nFirst he made a kite. It was not a kite just like a boy's kite. He\nwanted a kite that would fly when it rained. Rain would spoil a paper\nkite in a minute. So Franklin used a silk hand-ker-chief to cover his\nkite, instead of paper.\n\n[Illustration: Franklin's Discovery.]\n\nHe put a little sharp-pointed wire at the top of his kite. This was\na kind of lightning rod to draw the lightning into the kite. His kite\nstring was a common hemp string. To this he tied a key, because\nlightning will follow metal. The end of the string that he held in his\nhand was a silk ribbon, which was tied to the hemp string of the kite.\nE-lec-tric-ity will not follow silk.\n\nOne night when there was a storm coming, he went out with his son.\nThey stood under a cow shed, and he sent his kite up in the air.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nAfter a while he held his knuckle to the key. A tiny spark flashed\nbetween the key and his knuckle. It was a little flash of lightning.\n\nThen he took his little bottle fixed to hold e-lec-tric-i-ty. He\nfilled it with the e-lec-tric-i-ty that came from the key. He carried\nhome a bottle of lightning. So he found out what made it thunder\nand lighten.\n\nAfter that he used to bring the lightning into his house on rods and\nwires. He made the lightning ring bells and do many other\nstrange things.\n\n\n\n\n\nFRANKLIN'S WHISTLE.\n\n\nWhen Franklin was an old man, he wrote a cu-ri-ous letter. In that\nletter he told a story. It was about some-thing that happened to him\nwhen he was a boy.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nHere is the story put into verses, so that you will re-member it\nbetter. Some day you can read the story as Franklin told it himself.\nYou will hear people say, \"He paid too much for the whistle.\" The\nsaying came from this story.\n\n\n          TOO MUCH FOR THE WHISTLE\n\n     As Ben with pennies in his pocket\n       Went strolling down the street,\n     \"Toot-toot! toot-toot!\" there came a whistle\n       From a boy he chanced to meet,\n\n     Whistling fit to burst his buttons,\n       Blowing hard and stepping high.\n     Then Benny said, \"I'll buy your whistle;\"\n       But \"Toot! toot-toot!\" was the reply.\n\n     But Benny counted out his pennies,\n       The whistling boy began to smile;\n     With one last toot he gave the whistle\n       To Ben, and took his penny pile.\n\n     Now homeward goes the whistling Benny,\n       As proud as any foolish boy,\n     And in his pockets not a penny,\n       But in his mouth a noisy toy.\n\n     \"Ah, Benny, Benny!\" cries his mother,\n       \"I cannot stand your ugly noise.\"\n     \"Stop, Benny, Benny!\" says his father,\n       \"I cannot talk, you drown my voice.\"\n\n     At last the whistling boy re-mem-bers\n       How much his money might have bought\n     \"Too many pennies for a whistle,\"\n       Is little Benny's ugly thought.\n\n     Too many pennies for a whistle\n       Is what we all pay, you and I,\n     Just for a little foolish pleasure\n       Pay a price that's quite too high.\n\n\n\n\n\nJOHN STARK AND THE INDIANS.\n\n\nJohn Stark was a famous gen-er-al in the Rev-o-lu-tion. But this\nstory is not about the Rev-o-lu-tion. It is about Stark before he\nbecame a soldier.\n\nWhen he was a young man, Stark went into the woods. His brother and\ntwo other young men were with him. They lived in a camp. It was far\naway from any houses.\n\nThe young men set traps for animals in many places. They wanted to\ncatch the animals that have fur on them. They wanted to get the\nskins to sell.\n\nThe Indians were at war with the white people. One day the young men\nsaw the tracks of Indians. Then they knew that it was not safe for\nthem to stay in the woods any longer. They began to get ready to\ngo home.\n\nJohn Stark went out to bring in the traps set for animals. The Indians\nfound him, and made him a pris-on-er. They asked him where his\nfriends were.\n\nStark did not wish his friends to be taken. So he pointed the wrong\nway. He took the Indians a long way from the other young men.\n\nBut John Stark's friends did not know that he was a pris-on-er. When\nhe did not come back, they thought that he had lost his way. They\nfired their guns to let him know where they were.\n\nWhen the Indians heard the guns, they knew where the other hunters\nwere. They went down to the river, and waited for them. When one of\nthe men came down, they caught him.\n\nThen John Stark's brother and the other man came down the river in a\nboat. The Indians told Stark to call them. They wanted them to come\nover where the Indians were. Then they could take them.\n\nJohn knew that the Indians were cruel. He knew that if he did not do\nwhat they told him to, they might kill him. But he wished to save his\nbrother. He called to his brother to row for the other shore.\n\nWhen they turned toward the other shore, the Indians fired at them.\nBut Stark knocked up two of their guns. They did not hit the white\nmen. Then some of the other Indians fired. Stark knocked up their guns\nalso. But the man that was with his brother was killed.\n\nJohn now called to his brother, \"Run! for all the Indians' guns are\nempty.\"\n\nHis brother got away. The Indians were very angry with John. They did\nnot kill him. But they gave him a good beating. These Indians were\nfrom Can-a-da. They took their pris-on-ers to their own village. When\nthey were coming home, they shouted to let the people know that they\nhad prisoners.\n\n[Illustration: Stark running the Gauntlet]\n\nThe young Indian war-ri-ors stood in two rows in the village. Each\nprisoner had to run between these two rows of Indians. As he passed,\nevery one of the Indians hit him as hard as he could with a stick, or\na club, or a stone.\n\nThe young man who was with Stark was badly hurt in running between\nthese lines. But John Stark knew the Indians. He knew that they liked\na brave man.\n\nWhen it came his turn to run, he snatched a club from one of the\nIndians. With this club he fought his way down the lines. He hit hard,\nnow on this side, and now on that. The young Indians got out of his\nway. The old Indians who were looking on sat and laughed at the\nothers. They said that Stark was a brave man.\n\nOne day the Indians gave him a hoe and told him to hoe corn. He knew\nthat the Indian war-ri-ors would not work. They think it a shame for a\nman to work. Their work is left for slaves and women. So Stark\npre-tend-ed that he did not know how to hoe. He dug up the corn\ninstead of the weeds. Then he threw the hoe into the river. He said,\n\"That is work for slaves and women.\"\n\nThen the Indians were pleased with him. They called him the young\nchief.\n\nAfter a while some white men paid the Indians a hundred and three\ndollars to let Stark go home. They charged more for him than for the\nother man, because they thought that he must be a young chief. Stark\nwent hunting again. He had to get some furs to pay back the money the\nmen had paid the Indians for him. He took good care that the Indians\nshould not catch him again.\n\nHe af-ter-wards became a great fighter against the Indians. He had\nlearned their ways while he was among them. He knew better how to\nfight them than almost any-body else.\n\nIn the Rev-o-lu-tion he was a gen-er-al. He fought the British at\nBen-ning-ton, and won a great vic-to-ry.\n\n\n\n\n\nA GREAT GOOD MAN.\n\n\nSome men are great soldiers. Some are great law-makers. Some men write\ngreat books. Some men make great in-ven-tions. Some men are\ngreat speakers.\n\nNow you are going to read about a man that was great in none of these\nthings. He was not a soldier. He was not a great speaker. He was\nnever rich. He was a poor school-teacher. He never held any office.\n\nAnd yet he was a great man. He was great for his goodness.\n\nHe was born in France. But most of his life was passed in\nPhil-a-del-phi-a before the Rev-o-lu-tion.\n\nHe was twenty-five years old when he became a school-teacher. He\nthought that he could do more good in teaching than in any other way.\n\nSchool-masters in his time were not like our teachers. Children were\ntreated like little animals. In old times the school-master was a\nlittle king. He walked and talked as if he knew every-thing. He wanted\nall the children to be afraid of him.\n\nBut Ben-e-zet was not that kind of man. He was very gentle. He treated\nthe children more kindly than their fathers and mothers did. Nobody in\nthis country had ever seen a teacher like him.\n\nHe built a play-room for the children of his school. He used to take\nthem to this room during school time for a little a-muse-ment. He\nman-aged each child as he found best. Some he could persuade to be\ngood. Some he shamed into being good. But this was very dif-fer-ent\nfrom the cruel beatings that other teachers of that time gave\ntheir pupils.\n\nOf course the children came to love him very much. After they grew to\nbe men and women, they kept their love for the good little\nschoolmaster. As long as they lived they listened to his advice.\n\nThere were no good school-books in his time. He wrote some little\nbooks to make learning easier to his pupils. He taught them many\nthings not in their books. He taught them to be kind to brutes, and\ngentle with one another. He taught them to be noble. He made them\ndespise every kind of meanness.\n\nHe was a great teacher. That is better than being a great soldier.\n\nBen-e-zet was a good man in many ways. He was the friend of all poor\npeople. Once he found a poor man suf-fer-ing with cold for want of a\ncoat. He took off his own coat in the street and put it on the poor\nman, and then went home in his shirt sleeves.\n\nIn those days <DW64>s were stolen from Af-ri-ca to be sold into\nA-mer-i-ca. Ben-e-zet wrote little books against this wrong. He sent\nthese books over all the world almost. He also tried to persuade the\nwhite men of his own country to be honest and kind with the Indians.\nGreat men in other countries were pleased with his books. They wrote\nhim letters. When any of them came to this country, they went to see\nhim. They wanted to see a man that was good to everybody. His house\nwas a plain one. But great men liked to sit at the table of the good\nschoolmaster.\n\nThere was war between the English and French at that time. Can-a-da\nbelonged to the French. Our country belonged to the English. There was\na country called A-ca-di-a. It was a part of what is now No-va\nSco-ti-a. The people of A-ca-di-a were French.\n\n[Illustration: Departure of the Acadians]\n\nThe English took the A-ca-di-ans away from their homes. They sent them\nto various places. Many families were divided. The poor A-ca-di-ans\nlost their homes and all that they had.\n\nMany hundreds of these people were sent to Phil-a-del-phi-a. Benezet\nbecame their friend. As he was born in France, he could speak their\nlan-guage. He got a large house built for some of them to stay in. He\ngot food and clothing for them. He helped them to get work, and did\nthem good in many other ways.\n\nOne day Benezet's wife came to him with a troubled face. She said,\n\"There have been thieves in the house. Two of my blankets have\nbeen stolen.\"\n\n\"Never mind, my dear,\" said Benezet, \"I gave them to some of the poor\nA-ca-di-ans.\"\n\nOne old Acadian was afraid of Benezet. He did not see why Benezet\nshould take so much trouble for other people. He thought that Benezet\nwas only trying to get a chance to sell the Acadians for slaves. When\nBenezet heard this, he had a good laugh.\n\nMany years after this the Rev-o-lu-tion broke out. It brought trouble\nto many people. Benezet helped as many as he could.\n\nAfter a while the British army took Phil-a-del-phi-a. They sent their\nsoldiers to stay in the houses of the people. The people had to take\ncare of the soldiers. This was very hard for the poor people.\n\nOne day Benezet saw a poor woman. Her face showed that she was in\ntrouble.\n\n\"Friend, what is the matter?\" Benezet said to her. She told him that\nsix soldiers of the British army had been sent to stay in her house.\nShe was a washer-woman. But while the soldiers filled up the house she\ncould not do any washing. She and her children were in want.\n\nBenezet went right away to see the gen-er-al that was in command of\nthe soldiers. The good man was in such a hurry that he forgot to get a\npass. The soldiers at the gen-er-al's door would not let him go in.\n\nAt last some one told the gen-er-al that a queer-looking fellow wanted\nto see him.\n\n\"Let him come up,\" said the general.\n\nThe odd little man came in. He told the general all about the troubles\nof the poor washer-woman. The general sent word that the soldiers must\nnot stay any longer in her house.\n\nThe general liked the kind little man. He told him to come to see him\nagain. He told the soldiers at his door to let Benezet come in\nwhen-ever he wished to.\n\nSoon after the Rev-o-lu-tion was over, Benezet was taken ill. When the\npeople of Phil-a-del-phi-a heard that he was ill, they gathered in\ncrowds about his house. Every-body loved him. Every-body wanted to\nknow whether he was better or not. At last the doctors said he could\nnot get well. Then the people wished to see the good man once more.\nThe doors were opened. The rooms and halls of his house were filled\nwith people coming to say good-bye to Benezet, and going away again.\n\nWhen he was buried, it seemed as if all Phil-a-del-phi-a had come to\nhis fu-ner-al. The rich and the poor, the black and the white, crowded\nthe streets. The city had never seen so great a fu-ner-al.\n\nIn the company was an A-mer-i-can general. He said, \"I would rather be\nAn-tho-ny Benezet in that coffin than General Wash-ing-ton in all\nhis glory.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPUTNAM AND THE WOLF.\n\n\nPutnam was a brave soldier. He fought many battles against the\nIndians. After that he became a general in the Revolution. But this is\na story of his battle with a wolf. It took place when he was a young\nman, before he was a soldier.\n\nPutnam lived in Con-nect-i-cut. In the woods there were still a few\nwolves. One old wolf came to Putnam's neigh-bor-hood every winter. She\nalways brought a family of young wolves with her.\n\nThe hunters would always kill the young wolves. But they could not\nfind the old mother wolf. She knew how to keep out of the way.\n\nThe farmers tried to catch her in their traps. But she was too\ncunning. She had had one good lesson when she was young. She had put\nthe toes of one foot into a steel trap. The trap had snipped them off.\nAfter that she was more careful.\n\nOne winter night she went out to get some meat. She came to Putnam's\nflock of sheep and goats. She killed some of them. She found it\ngreat fun.\n\nThere were no dogs about. The poor sheep had nobody to protect them.\nSo the old wolf kept on killing. One sheep was enough for her supper.\nBut she killed the rest just for sport. She killed seventy sheep and\ngoats that night.\n\nPutnam and his friends set out to find the old sheep killer. There\nwere six men of them. They agreed that two of them should hunt for her\nat a time. Then another two should begin as soon as the first two\nshould stop. So she would be hunted day and night.\n\nThe hunters found her track in the snow. There could be no mistake\nabout it. The track made by one of her feet was shorter than those\nmade by the other feet. That was because one of her feet had been\ncaught in a trap.\n\nThe hunters found that the old wolf had gone a long way off. Perhaps\nshe felt guilty. She must have thought that she would be hunted. She\nhad trotted away for a whole night.\n\nThen she turned and went back again. She was getting hungry by this\ntime. She wanted some more sheep.\n\nThe men followed her tracks back again. The dogs drove her into a\nhole. It was not far from Putnam's house.\n\nAll the farmers came to help catch her. They sent the dogs into the\ncave where the wolf was. But the wolf bit the dogs, and drove them\nout again.\n\nThen the men put a pile of straw in the mouth of the cave. They set\nthe straw on fire. It filled the cave with smoke. But Mrs. Wolf did\nnot come out.\n\nThen they burned brim-stone in the cave. It must have made the wolf\nsneeze. But the cave was deep. She went as far in as she could, and\nstaid there. She thought that the smell of brimstone was not so bad as\nthe dogs and men who wanted to kill her.\n\nPutnam wanted to send his <DW64> into the cave to drive out the wolf.\nBut the <DW64> thought that he would rather stay out.\n\nThen Putnam said that he would go in himself. He tied a rope to his\nlegs. Then he got some pieces of birch-bark. He set fire to these. He\nknew that wild animals do not like to face a fire.\n\nHe got down on his hands and knees. He held the blazing bark in his\nhand. He crawled through the small hole into the cave. There was not\nroom for him to stand up.\n\nAt first the cave went downward into the ground. Then it was level a\nlittle way. Then it went upward. At the very back of this part of the\ncave was the wolf. Putnam crawled up until he could see the\nwolf's eyes.\n\nWhen the wolf saw the fire, she gave a sudden growl. Putnam jerked the\nrope that was tied to his leg. The men outside thought that the wolf\nhad caught him. They pulled on the other end of the rope.\n\nThe men pulled as fast as they could. When they had drawn Putnam out,\nhis clothes were torn. He was badly scratched by the rocks.\n\nHe now got his gun. He held it in one hand. He held the burning\nbirch-bark in the other. He crawled into the cave again.\n\nWhen the wolf saw him coming again, she was very angry. She snapped\nher teeth. She got ready to spring on him. She meant to kill him as\nshe had killed his sheep. Putnam fired at her head. As soon as his\ngun went off, he jerked the rope. His friends pulled him out.\n\nHe waited awhile for the smoke of his gun to clear up. Then he went in\nonce more. He wanted to see if the wolf was dead.\n\nHe found her lying down. He tapped her nose with his birch-bark. She\ndid not move. He took hold of her. Then he jerked the rope.\n\nThis time the men saw him come out, bringing the dead wolf. Now the\nsheep would have some peace.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON AND HIS HATCHET\n\n\nIt was Ar-bor Day in the Mos-sy Hill School, Johnny Little-john had to\nspeak a piece that had some-thing to do with trees. He thought it\nwould be a good plan to say some-thing about the little cherry tree\nthat Washington spoiled with his hatch-et, when he was a little boy.\nThis is what he said:\n\n[Illustration]\n\nHe had a hatch-et--little George--\n  A hatch-et bright and new,\nAnd sharp enough to cut a stick--\n  A little stick--in two.\n\nHe hacked and whacked and whacked and hacked,\n  This sturd-y little man;\nHe hacked a log and hacked a fence,\n  As round about he ran.\n\nHe hacked his father's cher-ry tree\n  And made an ug-ly spot;\nThe bark was soft, the hatch-et sharp,\n  And little George forgot.\n\nYou know the rest. The father frowned\n  And asked the rea-son why;\nYou know the good old story runs\n  He could not tell a lie.\n\nThe boy that chopped that cher-ry tree\n  Soon grew to be a youth;\nAt work and books he hacked away,\n  And still he told the truth:\n\nThe youth became a fa-mous man,\n  Above six feet in height,\nAnd when he had good work to do\n  He hacked with all his might.\n\nHe fought the ar-mies that the king\n  Had sent across the sea;\nHe bat-tled up and down the land\n  To set his country free.\n\nFor seven long years he, hacked and whacked\n  With all his might and main\nUntil the Brit-ish sailed away\n  And did not come again.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\n\nHOW BENNY WEST LEARNED TO BE A PAINTER.\n\n\nIn old times there lived in Penn-syl-va-ni-a a little\nfellow whose name was Ben-ja-min West. He\nlived in a long stone house.\n\n[Illustration: Painting Baby's Portrait]\n\nHe had never seen a picture. The country was new, and there were not many\npictures in it. Benny's father was a Friend or Quaker. The Friends of\nthat day did not think that pictures were useful things to make or to\nhave. Before he was seven years old, this little boy began to draw\npictures. One day he was watching the cradle of his sister's child.\nThe baby smiled. Benny was so pleased with her beauty, that he made a\npicture of her in red and black ink. The picture of the baby pleased\nhis mother when she saw it. That was very pleasant to the boy.\n\nHe made other pictures. At school he used to draw with a pen before he\ncould write. He made pictures of birds and of animals. Sometimes he\nwould draw flowers.\n\n[Illustration: Flower and Fruit of the Poke-Berry.]\n\nHe liked to draw so well, that sometimes he forgot to do his work. His\nfather sent him to work in the field one day. The father went out to\nsee how well he was doing his work. Benny was no-where to be found. At\nlast his father saw him sitting under a large poke-weed. He was making\npictures. He had squeezed the juice out of some poke-berries. The\njuice of poke-berries is deep red. With this the boy had made his\npictures. When the father looked at them, he was surprised. There were\nportraits of every member of the family. His father knew\nevery picture.\n\nUp to this time Benny had no paints nor any brushes. The Indians had\nnot all gone away from that neigh-bor-hood. The Indians paint their\nfaces with red and yellow colors. These colors they make them-selves.\nSometimes they prepare them from the juice of some plant. Sometimes\nthey get them by finding red or yellow earth. Some of the Indians can\nmake rough pictures with these colors.\n\nThe Indians near the house of Benny's father must have liked the boy.\nThey showed him how to make red and yellow colors for himself. He got\nsome of his mother's indigo to make blue. He now had red, yellow, and\nblue. By mixing these three, the other colors that he wanted could\nbe made.\n\nBut he had no brush to paint with. He took some long hairs from the\ncat's tail. Of these he made his brushes. He used so many of the cat's\nhairs, that her tail began to look bare. Everybody in the house began\nto wonder what was the matter with pussy's tail. At last Benny told\nwhere he got his brushes.\n\n[Illustration: Making a Paint Brush.]\n\nA cousin of Benny's came from the city on a visit. He saw some of the\nboy's drawings. When he went home, he sent Benny a box of paints. With\nthe paints were some brushes. And there was some canvas such as\npictures are painted on. And that was not all. There were in the box\nsix beautiful en-grav-ings.\n\nThe little painter now felt himself rich. He was so happy that he\ncould hardly sleep at all. At night he put the box that held his\ntreasures on a chair by his bed. As soon as daylight came, he carried\nthe precious box to the garret. The garret of the long stone house was\nhis stu-di-o. Here he worked away all day long. He did not go to\nschool at all. Perhaps he forgot that there was any school. Perhaps\nthe little artist could not tear himself away from his work.\n\nBut the schoolmaster missed him. He came to ask if Benny was ill. The\nmother was vexed when she found that he had staid away from school.\nShe went to look for the naughty boy. After a while she found the\nlittle truant. He was hard at work in his garret. She saw what he\nhad been doing. He had not copied any of his new en-grav-ings. He had\nmade up a new picture by taking one person out of one en-grav-ing, and\nanother out of another. He had copied these so that they made a\npicture that he had thought of for himself.\n\nHis mother could not find it in her heart to punish him. She was too\nmuch pleased with the picture he was making. This picture was not\nfinished. But his mother would not let him finish it. She was afraid\nhe would spoil it if he did anything more on it.\n\nThe good people called Friends did not like the making of pictures, as\nI said. But they thought that Benny West had a talent that he ought to\nuse. So he went to Phil-a-del-phi-a to study his art. After a while he\nsailed away to It-a-ly to see the pictures that great artists\nhad painted.\n\nAt last he settled in England. The King of England was at that time\nthe king of this country too. The king liked West's pictures. West\nbecame the king's painter. He came to be the most famous painter\nin England.\n\nHe liked to remember his boyish work. He liked to remember the time\nwhen he was a little Quaker boy making his paints of poke-juice and\nIndian colors.\n\n\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON'S CHRISTMAS GIFT.\n\n\nWashington was fighting to set this country free. But the army that\nthe King of England sent to fight him was stronger than Washington's\narmy. Washington was beaten and driven out of Brook-lyn. Then he had\nto leave New York. After that, he marched away into New Jersey to save\nhis army from being taken. At last he crossed the Del-a-ware River.\nHere he was safe for a while.\n\nSome of the Hes-sian soldiers that the king had hired to fight against\nthe Americans came to Trenton. Trenton is on the Del-a-ware River.\n\nWashington and his men were on the other side of the Del-a-ware River\nfrom the Hes-sians. Washington's men were dis-cour-aged. They had been\ndriven back all the way from Brook-lyn. It was winter, and they had no\nwarm houses to stay in. They had not even warm clothes. They were\ndressed in old clothes that people had given them. Some of them were\nbare-footed in this cold weather.\n\nThe Hes-sians and other soldiers of the king were waiting for the\nriver to freeze over. Then they would march across on the ice. They\nmeant to fight Washington once more, and break up his army. But\nWashington was thinking about something too.\n\nHe was waiting for Christmas. He knew that the Hessian soldiers on the\nother side of the river would eat and drink a great deal on\nChristmas Day.\n\n[Illustration: Marching to Trenton.]\n\nThe afternoon of Christmas came. The Hessians were singing and\ndrinking in Trenton. But Washington was marching up the river bank.\nSome of his bare-foot men left blood marks on the snow as\nthey marched.\n\nThe men and cannons were put into flat boats. These boats were pushed\nacross the river with poles. There were many great pieces of ice in\nthe river. But all night long the flat boats were pushed across and\nthen back again for more men. It was three o'clock on the morning\nafter Christmas when the last Americans crossed the river. It was\nhailing and snowing, and it was very cold. Two or three of the\nsoldiers were frozen to death.\n\nIt was eight o'clock in the morning when Washington got to Trenton.\nThe Hessians were sleeping soundly. The sound of the American drums\nwaked them. They jumped out of their beds. They ran into the streets.\nThey tried to fight the Americans.\n\nBut it was too late. Washington had already taken their cannons. His\nmen were firing these at the Hessians. The Hessians ran into the\nfields to get away. But the Americans caught them.\n\nThe battle was soon over. Washington had taken nine hundred prisoners.\n\nThis was called the battle of Trenton. It gave great joy to all the\nAmericans. It was Washington's Christmas gift to the country.\n\n\n\n\n\nHOW WASHINGTON GOT OUT OF A TRAP.\n\n\nAfter the battle of Trenton, Washington went back across the Delaware\nRiver. He had not men enough to fight the whole British army.\n\nBut the Americans were glad when they heard that he had beaten the\nHessians. They sent him more soldiers. Then he went back across the\nriver to Trenton again.\n\nThere was a British general named Corn-wal-lis. He marched to Trenton.\nHe fought against Washington. Corn-wal-lis had more men than\nWashington had. Night came, and they could not see to fight. There was\na little creek between the two armies.\n\nWashington had not boats enough to carry his men across the river.\nCorn-wal-lis was sure to beat him if they should fight a battle the\nnext morning.\n\nCornwallis said, \"I will catch the fox in the morning.\"\n\nHe called Washington a fox. He thought he had him in a trap.\nCornwallis sent for some more soldiers to come from Prince-ton in the\nmorning. He wanted them to help him catch the fox.\n\nBut foxes sometimes get out of traps.\n\nWhen it was dark, Washington had all his camp fires lighted. He put\nmen to digging where the British could hear them. He made Cornwallis\nthink that he was throwing up banks of earth and getting ready to\nfight in the morning.\n\nBut Washington did not stay in Trenton. He did not wish to be caught\nlike a fox in a trap. He could not get across the river. But he knew a\nroad that went round the place where Cornwallis and his army were. He\ntook that road and got behind the British army.\n\nIt was just like John waiting to catch James. James is in the house.\nJohn is waiting at the front door to catch James when he comes out.\nBut James slips out by the back way. John hears him call \"Hello!\"\nJames has gone round behind him and got away.\n\nWashington went out of Trenton in the darkness. You might say that he\nmarched out by the back door. He left Cornwallis watching the front\ndoor. The Americans went away quietly. They left a few men to keep up\nthe fires, and make a noise like digging. Before morning these\nslipped away too.\n\nWhen morning came, Cornwallis went to catch his fox. But the fox was\nnot there. He looked for the Americans. There was the place where\nthey had been digging. Their camp fires were still burning. But where\nhad they gone?\n\nCornwallis thought that Washington had crossed the river by some\nmeans. But soon he heard guns firing away back toward Princeton. He\nthought that it must be thunder. But he found that it was a battle.\nThen he knew that Washington had gone to Princeton.\n\nWashington had marched all night. When he got to Princeton, he met the\nBritish coming out to go to Trenton. They were going to help\nCornwallis to catch Washington. But Washington had come to Princeton\nto catch them. He had a hard fight with the British at Princeton. But\nat last he beat them.\n\nWhen Cornwallis knew that the Americans had gone to Princeton, he\nhurried there to help his men. But it was too late. Washington had\nbeaten the British at Princeton, and had gone on into the hills, where\nhe was safe.\n\nThe fox had got out of the trap.\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON'S LAST BATTLE.\n\nWashington had been fighting for seven years to drive the British\nsoldiers out of this country. But there were still two strong British\narmies in America.\n\nOne of these armies was in New York. It had been there for years. The\nother army was far away at Yorktown in Virginia. The British general\nat Yorktown was Cornwallis. You have read how Washington got away from\nhim at Trenton.\n\nThe King of France had sent ships and soldiers to help the Americans.\nBut still Washington had not enough men to take New York from the\nBritish. Yet he went on getting ready to attack the British in New\nYork. He had ovens built to bake bread for his men. He bought hay for\nhis horses. He had roads built to draw his cannons on.\n\nHe knew that the British in New York would hear about what he was\ndoing. He wanted them to think that he meant to come to New York and\nfight them. When the British heard what the Americans were doing, they\ngot ready for the coming of Washington and the French. All at once\nthey found that Washington had gone. He and his men had marched away.\nThe French soldiers that had come to help him had gone with him.\n\nNobody knew what it meant. Washington's own men did not know where\nthey were going. They went from New Jersey into Penn-syl-va-ni-a. Then\nthey marched across Penn-syl-va-ni-a. Then they went into Mary-land.\nThey marched across that State, and then they went into Vir-gin-i-a.\n\nBy this time everybody could tell where Washington was going. People\ncould see that he was going straight to York-town. They knew that\nWashington was going to fight his old enemy at York-town.\n\nBut he had kept his secret long enough. The British in New York could\nnot send help to Cornwallis. It was too late. The French ships sailed\nto Vir-gin-i-a, and shut up Yorktown on the side of the sea.\nWashington's men shut it up on the side of the land. They built great\nbanks of earth round it. On these banks of earth they put cannons.\n\nThe British could not get away. They fought bravely. But the Americans\nand French came closer and closer.\n\nThen the British tried to fight their way out. But they were driven\nback. Then Cornwallis tried to get his men across the river. He\nwanted to get out by the back door, as Washington had done. But the\nAmericans on the other side of the river drove them back again.\nWashington had now caught Cornwallis in a trap.\n\nThe Americans fired red-hot cannon balls into Yorktown. These set the\nhouses on fire. At last Cornwallis had to give up. The British marched\nout and laid down their guns and swords.\n\nThe British army in New York could not fight the Americans by itself.\nSo the British gave it up. Then there was peace after the long war.\nThe British pulled down the British flag and sailed away. The country\nwas free at last.\n\n\n\n\n\nMARION'S TOWER.\n\n\nGeneral Mar-i-on was one of the best fighters in the Revolution. He\nwas a homely little man. He was also a very good man. Another general\nsaid, \"Mar-i-on is good all over.\"\n\nThe American army had been beaten in South Car-o-li-na. Mar-i-on was\nsent there to keep the British from taking the whole country.\n\nMarion got to-geth-er a little army. His men had nothing but rough\nclothes to wear. They had no guns but the old ones they had used to\nshoot wild ducks and deer with.\n\nMarion's men wanted swords. There were no swords to be had. But Marion\nsent men to take the long saws out of the saw mills. These were taken\nto black-smiths. The black-smiths cut the saws into pieces. These\npieces they hammered out into long, sharp swords.\n\nMarion had not so many men as the British. He had no cannon. He could\nnot build forts. He could not stay long in one place, for fear the\nBritish should come with a strong army and take him. He and his men\nhid in the dark woods. Sometimes he changed his hiding place suddenly.\nEven his own friends had hard work to find him.\n\nFrom the dark woods he would come out suddenly. He would attack some\nparty of British soldiers. When the battle was over, he would go back\nto the woods again.\n\nWhen the British sent a strong army to catch him, he could not be\nfound. But soon he would be fighting the British in some new place. He\nwas always playing hide and seek.\n\nThe British called him the Swamp Fox. That was because he was so hard\nto catch. They could not conquer the country until they could catch\nMarion. And they never could catch the Swamp Fox. At one time Marion\ncame out of the woods to take a little British fort. This fort was on\nthe top of a high mound. It was one of the mounds built a long time\nago by the Indians.\n\nMarion put his men all round the fort, so that the men in the fort\ncould not get out to get water. He thought that they would have to\ngive up. But the men in the fort dug a well inside the fort. Then\nMarion had to think of another plan.\n\nMarion's men went to the woods and cut down stout poles. They got a\ngreat many poles. When night came, they laid a row of poles along-side\none another on the ground. Then they laid another row across these.\nThen they laid another row on top of the last ones, and across the\nother way again.\n\n[Illustration: Marion's Tower.]\n\nThey laid a great many rows of poles one on top of another. They\ncrossed them this way and that. As the night went on, the pile grew\nhigher. Still they handed poles to top of the pile.\n\nBefore morning came, they had built a kind of tower. It was higher\nthan the Indian mound.\n\nAs soon as it was light, the men on Marion's tower began to shoot. The\nBritish looked out. They saw a great tower with men on it. The men\ncould shoot down into the fort. The British could not stand it. They\nhad to give up. They were taken prisoners.\n\n\n\n\n\nCLARK AND HIS MEN.\n\n\nAt the time of the Revolution there were but few people living on the\nnorth side of the O-hi-o River. But there were many Indians there.\nThese Indians killed a great many white people in Ken-tuck-y.\n\nThe Indians were sent by British officers to do this killing. There\nwas a British fort at Vincennes in what is now In-di-an-a. There was\nanother British fort or post at Kas-kas-ki-a in what is now the State\nof Il-li-nois.\n\nGeorge Rogers Clark was an American colonel. He wanted to stop the\nmurder of the settlers by the Indians. He thought that he could do it\nby taking the British posts.\n\nHe had three hundred men. They went down the O-hi-o River in boats.\nThey landed near the mouth of the O-hi-o River. Then they marched a\nhundred and thirty miles to Kas-kas-ki-a.\n\nKas-kas-ki-a was far away from the Americans. The people there did not\nthink that the Americans would come so far to attack them. When Clark\ngot there, they were all asleep. He marched in and took the town\nbefore they waked up.\n\nThe people living in Kaskaskia were French. By treating them well,\nClark made them all friendly to the Americans.\n\nWhen the British at Vin-cennes heard that Clark had taken Kaskaskia,\nthey thought that they would take it back again. But it was winter.\nAll the streams were full of water. They could not march till spring.\nThen they would gather the Indians to help them, and take Clark\nand his men.\n\nBut Clark thought that he would not wait to be taken. He thought that\nhe would just go and take the British. If he could manage to get to\nVin-cennes in the winter, he would not be expected.\n\nClark started with a hundred and seventy men. The country was nearly\nall covered with water. The men were in the wet almost all the time.\nClark had hard work to keep his men cheerful. He did everything he\ncould to amuse them.\n\nThey had to wade through deep rivers. The water was icy cold. But\nClark made a joke of it. He kept them laughing whenever he could.\n\nAt one place the men refused to go through the freezing water. Clark\ncould not per-suade them to cross the river. He called to him a tall\nsol-dier. He was the very tallest man in Clark's little army. Clark\nsaid to him, \"Take the little drummer boy on your shoulders.\"\n\nThe little drummer was soon seated high on the shoulders of the tall\nman. \"Now go ahead!\" said Clark.\n\nThe soldier marched into the water. The little drummer beat a march on\nhis drum. Clark cried out, \"Forward!\" Then he plunged into the water\nafter the tall soldier. All the men went in after him. They were soon\nsafe on the other side.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nAt another river the little drummer was floated over on the top of his\ndrum. At last the men drew near to Vin-cennes. They could hear the\nmorning and evening gun in the British fort. But the worst of the way\nwas yet to pass. The Wa-bash River had risen over its banks. The water\nwas five miles wide. The men marched from one high ground to another\nthrough the cold water. They caught an Indian with a canoe. In this\nthey got across the main river. But there was more water to cross. The\nmen were so hungry that some of them fell down in the water. They had\nto be carried out.\n\nClark's men got frightened at last, and then they had no heart to go\nany farther. But Clark remembered what the Indians did when they went\nto war. He took a little gun-powder in his hand. He poured water on\nit. Then he rubbed it on his face. It made his face black.\n\nWith his face blackened like an Indian's, he gave an Indian war-whoop.\nThe men followed him again.\n\nThe men were tired and hungry. But they soon reached dry ground. They\nwere now in sight of the fort. Clark marched his little army round and\nround in such a way as to make it seem that he had many men with him.\nHe wrote a fierce letter to the British com-mand-er. He behaved like a\ngeneral with a large army.\n\nAfter some fighting, the British com-mand-er gave up. Clark's little\narmy took the British fort. This brave action saved to our country the\nland that lies between the Ohio River and the Lakes. It stopped the\nsending of Indians to kill the settlers in the West.\n\n\n\n\n\nDANIEL BOONE AND HIS GRAPEVINE SWING.\n\n\nDaniel Boone was the first settler of Ken-tuck-y. He knew all about\nliving in the woods. He knew how to hunt the wild animals. He knew how\nto fight Indians, and how to get away from them.\n\nNearly all the men that came with him to Kentucky the first time were\nkilled. One was eaten by wolves. Some of them were killed by Indians.\nSome of them went into the woods and never came back. Nobody knows\nwhat killed them.\n\nOnly Boone and his brother were left alive. They needed some powder\nand some bullets. They wanted some horses. Boone's brother went back\nacross the mountains to get these things. Boone staid in his little\ncabin all alone.\n\nBoone could hear the wolves howl near his cabin at night. He heard the\npanthers scream in the woods. But he did not mind being left all alone\nin these dark forests. The Indians came to his cabin when he was\naway. He did not want to see these vis-it-ors. He did not dare to\nsleep in his cabin all the time. Sometimes he slept under a rocky\ncliff. Sometimes he slept in a cane-brake. A cane-brake is a large\npatch of growing canes such as fishing rods are made of.\n\nOnce a mother bear tried to kill him. He fired his gun at her, but the\nbullet did not kill her. The bear ran at him. He held his long knife\nout in his hand. The bear ran against it and was killed.\n\nHe made long journeys alone in the woods. One day he looked back\nthrough the trees and saw four Indians. They were fol-low-ing Boone's\ntracks. They did not see him. He turned this way and that. But the\nIndians still fol-lowed his tracks.\n\nHe went over a little hill. Here he found a wild grape-vine. It was a\nvery long vine, reaching to the top of a high tree. There are many\nsuch vines in the Southern woods. Children cut such vines off near the\nroots. Then they use them for swings.\n\nBoone had swung on grape-vines when he was a boy. He now thought of a\nway to break his tracks. He cut the wild grape-vine off near the root.\nThen he took hold of it. He sprang out into the air with all his\nmight. The great swing carried him far out as it swung. Then he let\ngo. He fell to the ground, and then he ran away in a dif-fer-ent\ndi-rec-tion from that in which he had been going.\n\nWhen the Indians came to the place, they could not find his tracks.\nThey could not tell which way he had gone. He got to his cabin\nin safety.\n\nBoone had now been alone for many months. His brother did not get back\nat the time he had set for coming. Boone thought that his brother\nmight have been killed. Boone had not tasted anything but meat since\nhe left home. He had to get his food by shooting animals in the woods.\nBy this time he had hardly any powder or bullets left.\n\n[Illustration: Boone on the Grapevine Swing]\n\nOne evening he sat by his cabin. He heard some one coming. He thought\nthat it might be Indians. He heard the steps of horses. He looked\nthrough the trees. He saw his brother riding on one horse, and leading\nanother. The other horse was loaded with powder and bullets and\nclothes, and other things that Boone needed.\n\n\n\n\n\nDANIEL BOONE'S DAUGHTER AND HER FRIENDS.\n\n\nDaniel Boone and his brother picked out a good place in Ken-tuck-y to\nsettle. Then they went home to North Car-o-li-na. They took with them\nsuch things as were cu-ri-ous and val-u-a-ble. These were the skins of\nanimals they had killed, and no doubt some of the heads and tails.\n\nBoone was restless. He had seen Kentucky and he did not wish to settle\ndown to the life of North Carolina.\n\nIn two years Boone sold his farm in North Carolina and set out for\nKentucky. He took with him his wife and children and two brothers.\nSome of their neighbors went with them. They trav-eled by pack train.\nAll their goods were packed on horses.\n\nWhen they reached the place on the Kentucky River that Boone had\nchosen for a home they built a fort of log houses. These cabins all\nstood round a square. The backs of the houses were outward. There was\nno door or window in the back of a house. The outer walls were thus\nshut up. They made the place a fort. The houses at the four corners\nwere a little taller and stronger than the others. There were gates\nleading into the fort. These gates were kept shut at night.\n\nIn the evening the people danced and amused themselves in the square.\nIndians could not creep up and attack them.\n\nWhen the men went out to feed the horses and cows they carried their\nguns. They walked softly and turned their eyes quickly from point to\npoint to see if Indians were hiding near. They held their guns so they\ncould shoot quickly.\n\nThe women and children had to stay very near the fort so they could\nrun in if an Indian came in sight.\n\nDaniel Boone had a daughter named Je-mi-ma. She was about fourteen\nyears old. She had two friends named Frances and Betsey Cal-lo-way.\nFrances Galloway was about the same age as Jemima.\n\nOne summer afternoon these three girls went out of the fort. They went\nto the river and got into a canoe. It was not far from the fort. They\nfelt safe. They laughed and talked and splashed the water with\ntheir paddles.\n\nThe cur-rent carried them slowly near the other shore. They could\nstill see the fort. They did not think of danger.\n\nTrees and bushes grew thick down to the edge of the river. Five\nstrong Indians were hiding in the bushes.\n\nOne Indian crept care-ful-ly through the bushes. He made no more noise\nthan a snake. When he got to the edge of the water he put out his long\narm and caught hold of the rope that hung down from the canoe. In a\nmoment he had turned the boat around and drawn it out of sight\nfrom the fort. The girls screamed when they saw the Indian. Their\nfriends heard them but could not cross the river to help them. The\ngirls had taken the only canoe.\n\nBoone and Cal-lo-way were both gone from the fort. They got home too\nlate to start that day. No sleep came to their eyes while they waited\nfor light to travel by.\n\nAs soon as there was a glim-mer of light they and a party of their\nfriends set out. It was in July and they could start early.\n\nThey crossed the river and easily found the Indians' tracks where they\nstarted. The brush was broken down there.\n\nThe Indians were cun-ning. They did not keep close together after they\nset out. Each Indian walked by himself through the tall canes. Three\nof the Indians took the captives.\n\nBoone and his friends tried in vain to follow them. Sometimes they\nwould find a track but it would soon be lost in the thick canes.\n\nBoone's party gave up trying to find their path. They noticed which\nway the Indians were going. Then they walked as fast as they could the\nsame way for thirty miles. They thought the Indians would grow\ncareless about their tracks after traveling so far.\n\nThey turned so as to cross the path they thought the Indians had\ntaken. They looked carefully at the ground and at the bushes to see if\nany one had gone by.\n\nBefore long they found the Indians' tracks in a buffalo path.\nBuffaloes and other animals go often to lick salt from the rocks round\nsalt springs. They beat down the brush and make great roads. These\nroads run to the salt springs. The hunters call them streets.\n\nThe Indians took one of these roads after they got far from the fort.\nThey could travel more easily in it. They did not take pains to hide\ntheir tracks.\n\nAs fast as their feet could carry them, Boone and his friends traveled\nalong the trail. When they had gone about ten miles they saw\nthe Indians.\n\nThe Indians had stopped to rest and to eat. It was very warm and\nthey had put off their moc-ca-sins and laid down their arms. They were\nkindling a fire to cook by.\n\nIn a moment the Indians saw the white men. Boone and Galloway were\nafraid the Indians would kill the girls.\n\nFour of the white men shot at the Indians. Then all rushed at them.\n\nThe Indians ran away as fast as they could. They did not stop to pick\nup their guns or knives or hatchets. They had no time to put on their\nmoccasins.\n\nThe poor worn-out girls were soon safe in their fathers' arms.\n\nBack to Boones-bor-ough they went, not minding their tired feet. When\nthey got to the fort there was great joy to see them alive.\n\nI do not believe they ever played in the water again.\n\n\n\n\n\nDECATUR AND THE PIRATES.\n\n\nNearly a hundred years have passed since the ship \"Phil-a-del-phi-a\"\nwas burned. But the brave sailors who did it will never be\nfor-got-ten.\n\nThe people of Trip-o-li in Af-ri-ca were pirates. They took the ships\nof other nations at sea. They made slaves of their prisoners. The\nfriends of these slaves sometimes sent money to buy their freedom.\nSome countries paid money to these pirates to let their ships go safe.\n\nOur country had trouble with the pirates. This trouble brought on a\nwar. Our ships were sent to fight against Trip-o-li.\n\nOne of the ships fighting against the pirates was called the\n\"Phil-a-del-phi-a.\" One day she was chasing a ship of Trip-o-li. The\n\"Phil-a-del-phi-a\" ran on the rocks. The sailors could not get her\noff. The pirates came and fought her as she lay on the rocks. They\ntook her men prisoners. Then they went to work to get her off. After a\nlong time they got her into deep water. They took her to Tripoli. Our\nships could not go there after her, because there were so many great\ncannons on the shore near the ship.\n\nThe pirates got the \"Philadelphia\" ready to go to sea. They loaded her\ncannons. They meant to slip out past our ships of war. Then they would\ntake a great many smaller American ships.\n\nBut the Americans laid a plan to burn the \"Philadelphia.\" It was a\nvery dan-ger-ous thing to try to do. The pirates had ships of war near\nthe \"Philadelphia.\" They had great guns on the shore. There was no way\nto do it in the day-time. It could only be done by stealing into the\nBay of Tripoli at night.\n\nThe Americans had taken a little vessel from the pirates. She was of\nthe kind that is called a ketch. She had sails. She also had long\noars. When there was no wind to sail with, the sailors could row her\nwith the oars.\n\nThis little ketch was sent one night to burn the \"Philadelphia.\" The\ncaptain of this boat was Ste-phen De-ca-tur. He was a young man, and\nvery brave.\n\nDe-ca-tur made his men lie down, so that the pirates would not know\nhow many men he had on his ketch. Only about ten men were in sight.\nThe rest were lying hidden on the boat.\n\nThey came near to the \"Philadelphia.\" It was about ten o'clock at\nnight. The pirates called to them. The pilot of the ketch told them\nthat he was from Mal-ta. He told them that he had come to sell things\nto the people of Tripoli. He said that the ketch had lost her anchor.\nHe asked them to let him tie her to the big ship till morning.\n\nThe pirates sent out a rope to them. But when the ketch came nearer,\nthe pirates saw that they had been fooled. They cried out, \"Americans,\nAmericans!\"\n\nThen the Americans lying down took hold of the rope and pulled with\nall their might, and drew the ketch close to the ship. They were so\nclose, that the ship's cannons were over their heads. The pirates\ncould not fire at them.\n\nThe men who had been lying still now rose up. There were eighty of\nthem. In a minute they were scram-bling up the sides of the big ship.\nSome went in one way, some another. They did not shoot. They fought\nwith swords and pikes, or short spears.\n\nSoon they drove the pirates to one side of the ship. Then they could\nhear the pirates jumping over into the water. In a few minutes the\npirates had all gone.\n\nBut the Americans could not stay long. They must burn the ship before\nthe pirates on the shore should find out what they were doing.\n\nThey had brought a lot of kin-dling on the ketch. They built fires in\nall parts of the ship. The fire ran so fast, that some of the men had\ntrouble to get off the ship.\n\nWhen the Americans got back on the ketch, they could not untie the\nrope that held the ketch to the ship. The big ship was bursting into\nflames. The ketch would soon take fire.\n\nThey took swords and hacked the big rope in two. Then they pushed hard\nto get away from the fire. The ketch began to move. The sailors took\nthe large oars and rowed. They were soon safe from the fire.\n\nAll this they had done without any noise. But, now that they had got\naway, they looked back. The fire was shooting up toward the sky. The\nmen stopped rowing, and they gave three cheers. They were so glad,\nthat they could not help it.\n\nBy this time the pirates on shore had waked up. They began to fire\ngreat cannon balls at the little ketch. One of the balls went through\nher sails. Ah! how the sailors rowed!\n\nThe whole sky was now lighted up by the fire. The pirates' cannons\nwere thundering. The cannon balls were splashing the water all round\nthe ketch. But the Americans got away. At last they were safe in their\nown ships.\n\n\n\nSTORIES ABOUT JEFFERSON.\n\nThomas Jef-fer-son was one of the great men of the Revolution. He was\nnot a soldier. He was not a great speaker. But he was a great thinker.\nAnd he was a great writer.\n\nHe wrote a paper that was the very beginning of the United States. It\nwas a paper that said that we would be free from England, and be a\ncoun-try by our-selves. We call that paper the Dec-la-ra-tion of\nIn-de-pend-ence.\n\nWhen he was a boy, Jef-fer-son was fond of boyish plays. But when he\nwas tired of play, he took up a book. It pleased him to learn things.\nFrom the time when he was a boy he never sat down to rest without\na book.\n\nAt school he learned what other boys did. But the dif-fer-ence between\nhim and most other boys was this: he did not stop with knowing just\nwhat the other boys knew. Most boys want to learn what other boys\nlearn. Most girls would like to know what their school-mates know. But\nJef-fer-son wanted to know a great deal more.\n\nAs a young man, Jefferson knew Latin and Greek. He also knew French\nand Span-ish and I-tal-ian.\n\nHe did not talk to show off what he knew. He tried to learn what other\npeople knew. When he talked to a wagon maker, he asked him about such\nthings as a wagon maker knows most about. He would sometimes ask how a\nwagon maker would go to work to make a wheel.\n\nWhen Jefferson talked to a learn-ed man, he asked him about those\nthings that this man knew most about. When he talked with Indians, he\ngot them to tell him about their lan-guage. That is the way he came\nto know so much about so many things. Whenever anybody told him\nanything worth while, he wrote it down as soon as he could.\n\nOne day Jefferson was trav-el-ing. He went on horse-back. That was a\ncommon way of trav-el-ing at that time. He stopped at a country\ntavern. At this tavern he talked with a stranger who was\nstaying there.\n\nAfter a while Jefferson rode away. Then the stranger said to the\nland-lord, \"Who is that man? He knew so much about law, that I was\nsure he was a lawyer. But when we talked about med-i-cine, he knew so\nmuch about that, that I thought he must be a doctor. And after a while\nhe seemed to know so much about re-li-gion, that I was sure he was a\nmin-is-ter. Who is he?\"\n\nThe stranger was very much surprised to hear that the man he had\ntalked with was Thomas Jefferson.\n\nJefferson was a very polite man. One day his grand-son was riding with\nhim. They met a <DW64>. The <DW64> lifted his cap and bowed. Jefferson\nbowed to the <DW64>. But his grand-son did not think it worth while\nto bow.\n\nThen Jefferson said to his grand-son, \"Do not let a poor <DW64> be more\nof a gen-tle-man than you are.\"  In the Dec-la-ra-tion of\nIn-de-pend-ence, Jefferson wrote these words: \"All men are created\nequal.\" He also said that the poor man had the same right as the rich\nman to live, and to be free, and to try to make himself happy.\n\n\n\n\n\nA LONG JOURNEY.\n\n\nA long time ago, when Thomas Jefferson was Pres-i-dent, most of the\npeople in this country lived in the East. Nobody knew anything about\nthe Far West. The only people that lived there were Indians. Many of\nthese Indians had never seen a white man.\n\n[Illustration: An Elk]\n\nThe Pres-i-dent sent men to travel into this wild part of the country.\nHe told them to go up to the upper end of the Mis-sou-ri River. Then\nthey were to go across the Rocky Mountains. They were to keep on till\nthey got to the Pa-cif-ic O-cean. Then they were to come back again.\nThey were to find out the best way to get through the mountains. And\nthey were to find out what kind of people the Indians in that country\nwere. They were also to tell about the animals.\n\nThere were two captains of this company. Their names were Lewis and\nClark. There were forty-five men in the party.\n\nThey were gone two years and four months. For most of that time they\ndid not see any white men but their own party. They did not hear a\nword from home for more than two years.\n\nThey got their food mostly by hunting. They killed a great many\nbuf-fa-loes and elks and deer. They also shot wild geese and other\nlarge birds. Sometimes they had nothing but fish to eat. Sometimes\nthey had to eat wolves. When they had no other meat, they were glad to\nbuy dogs from the Indians and eat them. Sometimes they ate horses.\nThey became fond of the meat of dogs and horses.\n\nWhen they were very hungry, they had to live on roots if they could\nget them. Some of the Indians made a kind of bread out of roots. The\nwhite men bought this when they could not get meat. But there were\ndays when they did not have anything to eat.\n\nThey were very friendly with the Indians. One day some of the men went\nto make a visit to an Indian village. The Indians gave them\nsomething to eat.\n\nIn the Indian wig-wam where they were, there was a head of a dead\nbuffalo. When dinner was over, the Indians filled a bowl full of meat.\nThey set this down in front of the head. Then they said to the head,\n\"Eat that.\"\n\n[Illustration: Feeding the Spirit of the Buffalo.]\n\nThe Indians believed, that, if they treated this buffalo head\npolitely, the live buffaloes would come to their hunting ground. Then\nthey would have plenty of meat. They think the spirit of the buffalo\nis a kind of a god. They are very careful to please this god.\n\n\n\n\n\nCAPTAIN CLARK'S BURNING GLASS.\n\n\nThe Indians among whom Captain Clark and Captain Lewis traveled had\nmany strange ways of doing things. They had nothing like our matches\nfor making fire. One tribe of Indians had this way of lighting a fire.\nAn Indian would lay down a dry stick. He would rub this stick with the\nend of another stick. After a while this rubbing would make something\nlike saw-dust on the stick that was lying down. The Indian would keep\non rubbing till the wood grew hot. Then the fine wood dust would\nsmoke. Then it would burn. The Indian would put a little kin-dling\nwood on it. Soon he would have a large fire.\n\nIn that time the white people had not yet found out how to make\nmatches. They lighted a fire by striking a piece of flint against a\npiece of steel. This would make a spark of fire. By letting this spark\nfall on something that would burn easily, they started a fire.\n\nWhite men had another way of lighting a fire when the sun was shining.\nThey used what was called a burning glass. This was a round piece of\nglass. It was thick in the middle, and thin at the edge. When you held\nup a burning glass in the sun, it drew the sun's heat so as to make a\nlittle hot spot. If you put paper under this spot of hot sunshine, it\nwould burn. Men could light the to-bac-co in their pipes with one of\nthese glasses.\n\nCaptain Clark had something funny happen to him on account of his\nburning glass. He had walked ahead of the rest of his men. He sat down\non a rock. There were some Indians on the other side of the river.\nThey did not see the captain. Captain Clark saw a large bird called a\ncrane flying over his head. He raised his gun and shot it.\n\n[Illustration: Cranes]\n\nThe Indians on the other side of the river had never seen a white man\nin their lives. They had never heard a gun. They used bows and arrows.\n\nThey heard the sound of Clark's gun. They looked up and saw the large\nbird falling from the sky. It fell close to where Captain Clark sat.\nJust as it fell they caught sight of Captain Clark sitting on the\nrocks. They thought they had seen him fall out of the sky. They\nthought that the sound of his gun was a sound like thunder that was\nmade when he came down.\n\nThe Indians all ran away as fast as they could. They went into their\nwig-warns and closed them.\n\nCaptain Clark wished to be friendly with them. So he got a canoe and\npaddled to the other side of the river. He came to the Indian houses.\nHe found the flaps which they use for doors shut. He opened one of\nthem and went in. The Indians were sitting down, and they were all\ncrying and trembling.\n\nAmong the Indians the sign of peace is to smoke to-geth-er. Captain\nClark held out his pipe to them. That was to say, \"I am your friend.\"\nHe shook hands with them and gave some of them presents. Then they\nwere not so much afraid.\n\n[Illustration: Lighting a Pipe with a Burning Glass.]\n\nHe wished to light his pipe for them to smoke. So he took out his\nburning glass. He held it in the sun. He held his pipe under it. The\nsunshine was drawn together into a bright little spot on the tobacco.\nSoon the pipe began to smoke.\n\nThen he held out his pipe for the Indians to smoke with him. That is\ntheir way of making friends. But none of the Indians would touch the\npipe. They thought that he had brought fire down from heaven to light\nhis pipe. They were now sure that he fell down from the sky. They were\nmore afraid of him than ever.\n\nAt last Captain Clark's Indian man came. He told the other Indians\nthat the white man did not come out of the sky. Then they smoked the\npipe, and were not afraid.\n\n\n\n\n\nQUICKSILVER BOB.\n\n\nRobert Fulton was the man who set steam-boats to running on the\nrivers. Other men had made such boats before. But Fulton made the\nfirst good one.\n\nWhen he was a boy, he lived in the town of Lan-cas-ter in\nPenn-syl-van-ia. Many guns were made in Lancaster. The men who made\nthese guns put little pictures on them. That was to make them sell to\nthe hunters who liked a gun with pictures. Little Robert Fulton could\ndraw very well for a boy. He made some pretty little drawings. These\nthe gun makers put on their guns.\n\nFulton went to the gun shops a great deal. He liked to see how things\nwere made. He tried to make a small air gun for himself.\n\nHe was always trying to make things. He got some quick-sil-ver. He was\ntrying to do something with it. But he would not tell what he wanted\nto do. So the gun-smiths called him Quick-sil-ver Bob.\n\nHe was so much in-ter-est-ed in such things, that he sometimes\nneg-lect-ed his lessons. He said that his head was so full of new\nnotions, that he had not much room left for school learning.\n\nOne morning he came to school late.\n\n\"What makes you so late?\" asked the teacher.\n\n\"I went to one of the shops to make myself a lead pencil,\" said little\nBob. \"Here it is. It is the best one I ever had.\"\n\nThe teacher tried it, and found it very good. Lead pencils in that day\nwere made of a long piece of lead sharpened at the end.\n\nQuick-sil-ver Bob was a very odd little boy. He said many cu-ri-ous\nthings. Once the teacher punished him for not getting his lessons. He\nrapped Robert on the knuckles with a fer-ule. Robert did not like this\nany more than any other boy would.\n\n\"Sir,\" said the boy, \"I came here to have something beaten into my\nhead, not into my knuckles.\"\n\nIn that day people used to light candles and stand them in the window\non the Fourth of July. These candles in every window lighted up the\nwhole town. But one year candles were scarce and high. The city asked\nthe people not to light up their windows on the Fourth.\n\nBob did not like to miss the fun of his Fourth of July. He went to\nwork to make something like rockets or Roman candles. It was a very\ndan-ger-ous business for a boy.\n\n\"What are you doing, Bob?\" some one asked him.\n\n\"The city does not want us to burn our candles on the Fourth,\" he\nsaid. \"I am going to shoot mine into the air.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nHe used to go fishing with a boy named Chris Gumpf. The father of\nChris went with them. They fished from a flat boat. The two boys had\nto push the boat to the fishing place with poles.\n\n\"I am tired of poling that boat,\" said Robert to Chris one day when\nthey came home.\n\nSo he set to work to think out a plan to move the boat in an easier\nway than by poles. He whittled out the model of a tiny paddle wheel.\nThen he went to work with Chris Gumpf, and they made a larger paddle\nwheel. This they set up in the fishing boat. The wheel was turned by\nthe boys with a crank. They did not use the poles any more.\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE FIRST STEAMBOAT.\n\n\nThe first good steam-boat was built in New York. She was built by\nRobert Fulton. Her name was \"Clermont.\" When the people saw her, they\nlaughed. They said that such a boat would never go. For thousands of\nyears boat-men had made their boats go by using sails and oars. People\nhad never seen any such boat as this. It seemed foolish to believe\nthat a boat could be pushed along by steam.\n\nThe time came for Fulton to start his boat. A crowd of people were\nstanding on the shore. The black smoke was coming out of the\nsmoke-stack. The people were laughing at the boat. They were sure that\nit would not go. At last the boat's wheels began to turn round. Then\nthe boat began to move. There were no oars. There were no sails. But\nstill the boat kept moving. Faster and faster she went. All the people\nnow saw that she could go by steam. They did not laugh any more. They\nbegan to cheer.\n\n[Illustration: Seeing the First Steam boat]\n\nThe little steam-boat ran up to Al-ba-ny. The people who lived on the\nriver did not know what to make of it. They had never heard of a\nsteam-boat. They could not see what made the boat go.\n\nThere were many sailing vessels on the river. Fulton's boat passed\nsome of these in the night. The sailors were afraid when they saw\nthe fire and smoke. The sound of the steam seemed dreadful to them.\nSome of them went down-stairs in their ships for fear. Some of them\nwent ashore. Perhaps they thought it was a living animal that would\neat them up.\n\nBut soon there were steam-boats on all the large rivers.\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON IRVING AS A BOY.\n\nThe Revolution was about over. Americans were very happy. Their\ncountry was to be free.\n\nAt this time a little boy was born in New York. His family was named\nIr-ving. What should this little boy be named?\n\nHis mother said, \"Washington's work is done. Let us name the baby\nWashington.\" So he was called Washington Ir-ving.\n\nWhen this baby grew to be a little boy, he was one day walking with\nhis nurse. The nurse was a Scotch girl. She saw General Washington go\ninto a shop. She led the little boy into the shop also.\n\nThe nurse said to General Washington, \"Please, your Honor, here is a\nbairn that is named for you.\"\n\n\"Bairn\" is a Scotch word for child. Washington put his hand on the\nlittle boy's head and gave him his blessing. When Irving became an\nauthor, he wrote a life of Washington.\n\nLittle Irving was a merry, playful boy. He was full of mischief.\n\nSometimes he would climb out of a window to the roof of his father's\nhouse. From this he would go to roofs of other houses. Then the little\nrascal would drop a pebble down a neighbor's chimney. Then he would\nhurry back and get into the window again. He would wonder what the\npeople thought when the pebble came rattling down their chimney. Of\ncourse he was punished when his tricks were found out. But he was a\nfavorite with his teacher. With all his faults, he would not tell a\nlie. The teacher called the little fellow \"General.\"\n\n[Illustration: Irving in Mischief.]\n\nIn those days naughty school-boys were whipped. Irving could not\nbear to see another boy suffer. When a boy was to be whipped, the\ngirls were sent out. Irving always asked the schoolmaster to let him\ngo out with the girls.\n\nLike other boys, Irving was fond of stories. He liked to read about\nSind-bad the Sailor, and Rob-in-son Cru-soe. But most of all he liked\nto read about other countries. He had twenty small volumes called \"The\nWorld Dis-played.\" They told about the people and countries of the\nworld. Irving read these little books a great deal.\n\nOne day the schoolmaster caught him reading in school. The master\nslipped behind him and grabbed the book. Then he told Irving to stay\nafter school.\n\nIrving expected a pun-ish-ment. But the master told him he was pleased\nto find that he liked to read such good books. He told him not to read\nthem in school.\n\nReading about other countries made Irving wish to see them. He thought\nhe would like to travel. Like other wild boys, he thought of running\naway. He wanted to go to sea.\n\nBut he knew that sailors had to eat salt pork. He did not like salt\npork. He thought he would learn to like it. When he got a chance, he\nate pork. And sometimes he would sleep all night on the floor. He\nwanted to get used to a hard bed.\n\nBut the more he ate pork, the more he disliked it. And the more he\nslept on the floor, the more he liked a good bed. So he gave up his\nfoolish notion of being a sailor boy.\n\nSome day you will read Irving's \"Sketch Book.\" You will find some\nfamous stories in it. There is the story of Rip Van Win-kle, who slept\ntwenty years. And there is the funny story of the Head-less Horse-man.\nWhen you read these a-mus-ing stories, you will remember the playful\nboy who became a great author.\n\n[Illustration: Rip Van Winkle wakes up]\n\n\n\nDON'T GIVE UP THE SHIP.\n\nFred was talking to his sister one day. He said,--\n\n\"Alice, what makes people say, 'Don't give up the ship'?\"\n\nAlice said, \"I don't know. That's what the teacher said to me\nyes-ter-day when I thought that I could not get my lesson.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Fred, \"and that's what father said to me. I told him I\nnever could learn to write well.\" He only said, \"You must not give up\nthe ship, my boy.\"\n\n\"I haven't any ship to give up,\" said Alice.\n\n\"And what has a ship to do with my writing?\" said Fred.\n\n\"There must be some story about a ship,\" Alice said.\n\n\"Maybe grand-father would know,\" said Fred. \"Let's ask him.\"\n\nThey found their grand-father writing in the next room. They did not\nwish to disturb him. They turned to leave the room.\n\nBut grand-father looked up just then. He smiled, and laid down his\npen.\n\n\"Did you want something?\" he asked. \"We wanted to ask you a\nquestion,\" said Alice. \"We want to know why people say, 'Don't give up\nthe ship.'\"\n\n\"We thought maybe there is a story to it,\" said Fred.\n\n\"Yes, there is,\" said their grandfather. \"And I know a little rhyme\nthat tells the story.\"\n\n\"Could you say it to us?\" asked Alice.\n\n\"Yes, if I can think of it. Let me see. How does it begin?\"\n\nGrandfather leaned his head back in the chair. He shut his eyes for a\nmoment. He was trying to remember.\n\n\"Oh, now I remember it!\" he said.\n\nThen he said to them these little verses:--\n\n\n          GRANDFATHER'S RHYME.\n\n     When I was but a boy,\n       I heard the people tell\n     How gallant Captain Law-rence\n       So bravely fought and fell.\n\n     The ships lay close together,\n       I heard the people say,\n     And many guns were roaring\n       Upon that battle day.\n\n     A grape-shot struck the captain,\n       He laid him down to die:\n     They say the smoke of powder\n       Made dark the sea and sky.\n\n     The sailors heard a whisper\n       Upon the captain's lip:\n     The last command of Law-rence\n       Was, \"Don't give up the ship.\"\n\n     And ever since that battle\n       The people like to tell\n     How gallant Captain Lawrence\n       So bravely fought and fell.\n\n     When disappointment happens,\n       And fear your heart annoys,\n     Be brave, like Captain Lawrence--\n       And don't give up, my boys!\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE STAR-SPANGLED BANNER.\n\n\nEverybody in the United States has heard the song about the\nstar-span-gled banner. Nearly everybody has sung it. It was written by\nFrancis Scott Key.\n\nKey was a young lawyer. In the War of 1812 he fought with the\nAmerican army. The British landed soldiers in Mary-land. At\nBla-dens-burg they fought and beat the Americans. Key was in this\nbattle on the American side.\n\nAfter the battle the British army took Washington, and burned the\npublic buildings. Key had a friend who was taken prisoner by the\nBritish. He was on one of the British ships. Key went to the ships\nwith a flag of truce. A flag of truce is a white flag. It is carried\nin war when one side sends a message to the other.\n\nWhen Key got to the British ships, they were sailing to Bal-ti-more.\nThey were going to try to take Bal-ti-more. The British com-mand-er\nwould not let Key go back. He was afraid that he would let the\nAmericans know where the ships were going.\n\nKey was kept a kind of prisoner while the ships attacked Bal-ti-more.\nThe ships tried to take the city by firing at it from the water. The\nBritish army tried to take the city on the land side.\n\nThe ships did their worst firing at night. They tried to take the\nlittle fort near the city.\n\nKey could see the battle. He watched the little fort. He was afraid\nthat the men in it would give up. He was afraid that the fort would be\nbroken down by the cannon balls.\n\nThe British fired bomb-shells and rockets at the fort. When these\nburst, they made a light. By this light Key could see that the little\nfort was still standing. He could see the flag still waving over it.\nHe tells this in his song in these words:--\n\n\n     \"And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air\n     Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there.\"\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nBut after many hours of fighting the British became dis-cour-aged.\nThey found that they could not take the city. The ships almost\nceased to fire.\n\nKey did not know whether the fort had been knocked down or not. He\ncould not see whether the flag was still flying or not. He thought\nthat the Americans might have given up. He felt what he wrote in\nthe song:--\n\n\n     \"Oh! say, does that star-span-gled banner yet wave\n     O'er the land of the free, and the home of the brave?\"\n\n\nWhen the break of day came, Key looked toward the fort. It was still\nstanding. There was a flag flying over it. It grew lighter. He could\nsee that it was the American flag. His feelings are told in two lines\nof the song:--\n\n\n     \"Tis the star spangled banner, oh, long may it wave\n     O'er the land of the free, and the home of the brave!\"\n\n\nKey was full of joy. He took an old letter from his pocket. The back\nof this letter had no writing on it. Here he wrote the song about the\nstar-spangled banner.\n\nThe British com-mand-er now let Key go ashore. When he got to\nBaltimore, he wrote out his song. He gave it to a friend. This friend\ntook it to a printing office. But the printers had all turned\nsoldiers. They had all gone to defend the city.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThere was one boy left in the office. He knew how to print. He took\nthe verses and printed them on a broad sheet of paper.\n\nThe printed song was soon in the hands of the soldiers around\nBaltimore. It was sung in the streets. It was sung in the\nthe-a-ters. It traveled all over the country. Everybody learned to\nsing:--\n\n\n     \"Then conquer we must, for our cause it is just;\n     And this be our motto--'In God is our trust'--\n     And the star-span-gled banner in triumph shall wave\n     O'er the land of the free, and the home of the brave.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHOW AUDUBON CAME TO KNOW ABOUT BIRDS.\n\n\nJohn James Au-du-bon knew more about the birds of this country than\nany man had ever known before. He was born in the State of\nLou-is-i-a-na. His father took him to France when he was a boy. He\nwent to school in France.\n\nThe little John James was fond of stud-y-ing about wild animals. But\nmost of all he wished to know about birds. Seeing that the boy liked\nsuch things, his father took pains to get birds and flowers for him.\n\nWhile he was yet a boy at school, he began to gather birds and other\nanimals for himself. He learned to skin and stuff them. But his\nstuffed birds did not please him. Their feathers did not look bright,\nlike those of live birds. He wanted living birds to study.\n\nHis father told him that he could not keep so many birds alive. To\nplease the boy he got him a book with pictures in it. Looking at these\npictures made John James wish to draw. He thought that he could make\npictures that would look like the live birds.\n\nBut when he tried to paint a picture of a bird, it looked worse than\nhis stuffed birds. The birds he drew were not much like real birds. He\ncalled them a \"family of <DW36>s.\" As often as his birthday came\nround, he made a bon-fire of his bad pictures. Then he would begin\nover again.\n\nAll this time he was learning to draw birds. But he was not willing to\nmake pictures that were not just like the real birds. So when he grew\nto be a man he went to a great French painter whose name was David.\nDavid taught him to draw and paint things as they are.\n\nThen he came back to this country, and lived awhile in Pennsylvania.\nHere his chief study was the wild creatures of the woods.\n\nHe gathered many eggs of birds. He made pictures of these eggs. He did\nnot take birds' eggs to break up the nests. He was not cruel. He took\nonly what he needed to study.\n\nHe would make two little holes in each egg. Then he would shake the\negg, or stir it up with a little stick or straw, or a long pin. This\nwould break up the inside of the egg. Then he would blow into one of\nthe holes. That would blow the inside of the egg out through the\nother hole.\n\nThese egg shells he strung together by running strings through the\nholes. He hung these strings of egg shells all over the walls of his\nroom. On the man-tel-piece he put the stuffed skins of squirrels,\nraccoons, o-pos-sums, and other small animals. On the shelves his\nfriends could see frogs, snakes, and other animals.\n\nHe married a young lady, and brought her to live in this mu-se-um with\nhis dead snakes, frogs, and strings of birds' eggs. She liked what he\ndid, and was sure that he would come to be a great man.\n\nHe made up his mind to write a great book about American birds. He\nmeant to tell all about the birds in one book. Then in another book he\nwould print pictures of the birds, just as large as the birds\nthem-selves. He meant to have them look just like the birds.\n\nTo do this he must travel many thousands of miles. He must live for\nyears almost all of the time in the woods. He would have to find and\nshoot the birds, in order to make pictures of them. And he must see\nhow the birds lived, and how they built their nests, so that he could\ntell all about them. It would take a great deal of work and trouble.\nBut he was not afraid of trouble.\n\nThat was many years ago. Much of our country was then covered with\ngreat trees. Au-du-bon sometimes went in a boat down a lone-some\nriver. Sometimes he rode on horse-back. Often he had to travel on foot\nthrough woods where there were no roads. Many a time he had to sleep\nout of doors.\n\nHe lost his money and became poor. Sometimes he had to paint portraits\nto get money to live on. Once he turned dancing master for a while.\nBut he did not give up his great idea. He still studied birds, and\nworked to make his books about American birds. His wife went to\nteaching to help make a living.\n\nAfter years of hard work, he made paintings of nearly a thousand\nbirds. That was almost enough for his books. But, while he was\ntraveling, two large rats got into the box in which he kept his\npictures. They cut up all his paintings with their teeth, and made a\nnest of the pieces. This almost broke his heart for a while. For many\nnights he could not sleep, because he had lost all his work.\n\nBut he did not give up. After some days he took his gun, and went into\nthe woods. He said to himself, \"I will begin over again. I can make\nbetter paintings than those that the rats spoiled.\"  But it took him\nfour long years and a half to find the birds, and make the\npictures again.\n\nHe was so careful to have his drawings just like the birds, that he\nwould measure them in every way. Thus he made his pictures just the\nsize of the birds themselves.\n\nAt last the great books were printed. In this country, in France, and\nin England, people praised the won-der-ful books. They knew that\nAu-du-bon was indeed a great man.\n\n\n\n\n\nAUDUBON IN THE WILD WOODS.\n\n\nWhen Au-du-bon was making his great book about birds, he had to live\nmuch in the woods. Sometimes he lived among the Indians. He once saw\nan Indian go into a hollow tree. There was a bear in the tree. The\nIndian had a knife in his hand. He fought with the bear in the tree,\nand killed it.\n\nAu-du-bon could shoot very well. A friend of his one day threw up his\ncap in the air. He told Au-du-bon to shoot at it. When the cap came\ndown, it had a hole in it.\n\nBut the hunters who lived in the woods could shoot better. They would\nlight a candle. Then one of the hunters would take his gun, and go a\nhundred steps away from the candle. He would then shoot at the candle.\nHe would shoot so as to snuff it. He would not put out the candle. He\nwould only cut off a bit of the wick with the bullet. But he would\nleave the candle burning.\n\n[Illustration: Snuffing the Candle.]\n\nOnce Audubon came near being killed by some robbers. He stopped at a\ncabin where lived an old white woman. He found a young Indian in the\nhouse. The Indian had hurt himself with an arrow. He had come to the\nhouse to spend the night.\n\nThe old woman saw Audubon's fine gold watch. She asked him to let her\nlook at it. He put it into her hands for a minute. Then the Indian\npassed by Audubon, and pinched him two or three times. That was to let\nhim know that the woman was bad, and that she might rob him.\n\nAudubon went and lay down with his hand on his gun. After a while two\nmen came in. They were the sons of the old woman. Then the old woman\nsharpened a large knife. She told the young men to kill the Indian\nfirst, and then to kill Audubon and take his watch. She thought that\nAudubon was asleep. But he drew up his gun ready to fire.\n\nJust then two hunters came to the cabin. Audubon told them what the\nrobbers were going to do. They took the old woman and her sons, and\ntied their hands and feet. The Indian, though he was in pain from his\nhurt, danced for joy when he saw that the robbers were caught. The\nwoman and her sons were afterward punished.\n\n\n\n\n\nHUNTING A PANTHER.\n\n\nAudubon was traveling in the woods in Mis-sis-sip-pi. He found the\nlittle cabin of a settler. He staid there for the night. The settler\ntold him that there was a panther in the swamp near his house. A\npanther is a very large and fierce animal. It is large enough to kill\na man. This was a very bad panther. It had killed some of the\nsettler's dogs.\n\nAudubon said, \"Let us hunt this panther, and kill it.\"\n\nSo the settler sent out for his neigh-bors to come and help kill the\npanther. Five men came. Audubon and the settler made seven. They were\nall on horse-back.\n\nWhen they came to the edge of the swamp, each man went a dif-fer-ent\nway. They each took their dogs with them to find the track of the wild\nbeast. All of the hunters carried horns. Who-ever should find the\ntrack first was to blow his horn to let the others know.\n\nIn about two hours after they had started, they heard the sound of a\nhorn. It told them that the track had been found. Every man now went\ntoward the sound of the horn. Soon all the yelping dogs were\nfol-low-ing the track of the fierce panther. The panther was running\ninto the swamp farther and farther.\n\nI suppose that the panther thought that there were too many dogs and\nmen for him to fight. All the hunters came after the dogs. They held\ntheir guns ready to shoot if the panther should make up his mind to\nfight them.\n\nAfter a while the sound of the dogs' voices changed. The hunters knew\nfrom this that the panther had stopped running, and gone up into\na tree.\n\nAt last the men came to the place where the dogs were. They were all\nbarking round a tree. Far up in the tree was the dan-ger-ous beast.\nThe hunters came up care-ful-ly. One of them fired. The bullet hit the\npanther, but did not kill him.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe panther sprang to the ground, and ran off again. The dogs ran\nafter. The men got on their horses, and rode after.\n\nBut the horses were tired, and the men had to get down, and follow the\ndogs on foot.\n\nThe hunters now had to wade through little ponds of water. Sometimes\nthey had to climb over fallen trees. Their clothes were badly torn by\nthe bushes. After two hours more, they came to a place where the\npanther had again gone up into a tree.\n\nThis time three of the hunters shot at him. The fierce panther came\ntumbling to the ground. But he was still able to fight. The men fought\nthe savage beast on all sides. At last they killed him. Then they gave\nhis skin to the settler. They wanted him to know that his en-e-my\nwas dead.\n\n\n\n\n\nSOME BOYS WHO BECAME AUTHORS.\n\n\nWil-liam Cul-len Bry-ant was the first great poet in this country. He\nwas a small man. When he was a baby, his head was too big for his\nbody. His father used to send the baby to be dipped in a cold spring\nevery day. The father thought that putting his head into cold water\nwould keep it from growing.\n\nBry-ant knew his letters before he was a year and a half old. He began\nto write rhymes when he was a very little fellow. He wanted to be a\npoet. He used to pray that he might be a poet. His father printed some\nverses of his when he was only ten years old.\n\nBry-ant wrote many fine poems. Here are some lines of his about the\nbird we call a bob-o-link:--\n\n\n     Rob-ert of Lin-coln is gayly dressed,\n       Wearing a bright black wedding coat,\n     White are his shoulders and white his crest.\n       Hear him call in his merry note:\n         Bob-o'-link, bob-o'-link,\n         Spink, spank, spink;\n     Look, what a nice new coat is mine,\n     Sure there was never a bird so fine.\n         Chee, chee, chee.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nHaw-thorne was one of our greatest writers of stories. He was a pretty\nboy with golden curls. He was fond of all the great poets, and he read\nShake-speare and Mil-ton and many other poets as soon as he was old\nenough to un-der-stand them.\n\nHaw-thorne grew up a very hand-some young fellow. One day he was\nwalking in the woods. He met an old gypsy woman. She had never seen\nanybody so fine-looking.\n\n\"Are you a man, or an angel?\" she asked him.\n\nSome of Haw-thorne's best books are written for girls and boys. One of\nthese is called \"The Won-der Book.\" Another of his books for young\npeople is \"Tan-gle-wood Tales.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPres-cott wrote beautiful his-to-ries. When Pres-cott was a boy, a\nschool-mate threw a crust of bread at him. It hit him in the eye. He\nbecame almost blind.\n\nHe had to do his writing with a machine. This machine was made for the\nuse of the blind. There were no type-writ-ers in those days.\n\nIt was hard work to write his-to-ry without good eyes. But Pres-cott\ndid not give up. He had a man to read to him. It took him ten years to\nwrite his first book.\n\nWhen Prescott had finished his book, he was afraid to print it. But\nhis father said, \"The man who writes a book, and is afraid to print\nit, is a cow-ard.\"\n\nThen Prescott printed his book. Everybody praised it. When you are\nolder, you will like to read his his-to-ries.\n\nDoctor Holmes, the poet, was a boy full of fancies. He lived in an old\nhouse. Soldiers had staid in the house at the time of the Revolution.\nThe floor of one room was all battered by the butts of the\nsoldiers' muskets.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nLittle Ol-i-ver Holmes used to think he could hear soldiers in the\nhouse. He thought he could hear their spurs rattling in the dark\npassages. Sometimes he thought he could hear their swords clanking.\n\nThe little boy was afraid of a sign that hung over the sidewalk. It\nwas a great, big, wooden hand. It was the sign of a place where gloves\nwere made. This big hand swung in the air. Little Ol-i-ver Holmes had\nto walk under it on his way to school. He thought the great fingers\nwould grab him some day. Then he thought he would never get home\nagain. He even thought that his other pair of shoes would be put away\ntill his little brother grew big enough to wear them.\n\nBut the big wooden hand never caught him.\n\nHere are some verses that Doctor Holmes wrote about a very old man:--\n\n\n     \"My grand-mam-ma has said--\n     Poor old lady, she is dead\n         Long ago--\n     That he had a Roman nose,\n     And his cheek was like a rose\n         In the snow.\n\n     \"But now his nose is thin,\n     And it rests upon his chin\n         Like a staff;\n     And a crook is in his back,\n     And a mel-an-chol-y crack\n         In his laugh.\n\n     \"I know it is a sin\n     For me to sit and grin\n         At him here;\n     But the old three-cor-nered hat,\n     And the breeches, and all that,\n         Are so queer!\n\n     \"And if I should live to be\n     The last leaf upon the tree\n         In the spring,\n     Let them smile, as I do now,\n     At the old for-sak-en bough\n         Where I cling.\"\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\n\nDANIEL WEBSTER AND HIS BROTHER.\n\n\nDan-iel Web-ster was a great states-man. As a little boy he was called\n\"Little Black Dan.\" When he grew larger, he was thin and\nsickly-looking. But he had large, dark eyes. People called him\n\"All Eyes.\"\n\nHe was very fond of his brother E-ze-ki-el. E-ze-ki-el was a little\nolder than Dan-iel. Both the boys had fine minds. They wanted to go to\ncollege. But their father was poor.\n\nDan-iel had not much strength for work on the farm. So little \"All\nEyes\" was sent to school, and then to college. E-ze-ki-el staid at\nhome, and worked on the farm.\n\nWhile Daniel was at school, he was unhappy to think that Ezekiel could\nnot go to college also. He went home on a visit. He talked to Ezekiel\nabout going to college. The brothers talked about it all night. The\nnext day Daniel talked to his father about it. The father said he was\ntoo poor to send both of his sons to college. He said he would lose\nall his little property if he tried to send Ezekiel to college. But he\nsaid, that, if their mother and sisters were willing to be poor, he\nwould send the other son to college.\n\nSo the mother and sisters were asked. It seemed hard to risk the loss\nof all they had. It seemed hard not to give Ezekiel a chance. They all\nshed tears over it.\n\nThe boys promised to take care of their mother and sisters if the\nproperty should be lost. Then they all agreed that Ezekiel should go\nto college too.\n\nDaniel taught school while he was studying. That helped to pay the\nexpenses. After Daniel was through his studies in college, he taught a\nschool in order to help his brother. When his school closed, he went\nhome. On his way he went round to the college to see his brother.\nFinding that Ezekiel needed money, he gave him a hundred dollars. He\nkept but three dollars to get home with.\n\nThe father's property was not sold. The two boys helped the family.\nDaniel soon began to make money as a lawyer. He knew that his father\nwas in debt. He went home to see him. He said, \"Father, I am going\nto pay your debts.\"\n\nThe father said, \"You cannot do it, Daniel. You have not money\nenough.\"\n\n\"I can do it,\" said Daniel; \"and I will do it before Monday evening.\"\n\nWhen Monday evening came round, the father's debts were all paid.\n\nWhen Daniel became a famous man, it made Ezekiel very happy. But\nEzekiel died first. When Daniel Web-ster made his greatest speech, all\nthe people praised him.\n\nBut Web-ster said, \"I wish that my poor brother had lived to this\ntime. It would have made him very happy.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWEBSTER AND THE POOR WOMAN.\n\n\nWhen Daniel Webster was a young lawyer, he was going home one night.\nThere was snow on the ground. It was very cold. It was late, and there\nwas nobody to be seen.\n\nBut after a while he saw a poor woman. She was ahead of him. He\nwondered what had brought her out on so cold a night.\n\nSometimes she stopped and looked around. Then she would stand and\nlisten. Then she would go on again. [Illustration: Webster and the\nPoor Woman]\n\nWebster kept out of her sight. But he watched her. After looking\naround, she turned down the street in which Webster lived. She stopped\nin front of Webster's house. She looked around and listened.\n\nWebster had put down some loose boards to walk on. They reached from\nthe gate to the door of his house. After standing still a minute, the\nwoman took one of the boards, and went off quickly.\n\nWebster followed her. But he kept out of her sight. She went to a\ndistant part of the town. She went into a poor little house.\n\nWebster went home without saying anything to the woman. He knew that\nshe had stolen the board for fire-wood.\n\nThe next day the poor woman got a present It was a nice load of wood.\n\nCan you guess who sent it to her?\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE INDIA-RUBBER MAN.\n\n\nMany years ago a strange-looking man was sometimes seen in the streets\nof New York. His cap was made of In-di-a rubber. So was his coat. He\nwore a rubber waist-coat. Even his cravat was of In-di-a rubber. He\nwore rubber shoes in dry weather. People called this man \"The\nIn-di-a-rubber man.\"\n\nHis name was Charles Good-year. He was very poor. He was trying to\nfind out how to make India rubber useful.\n\nIndia-rubber trees grow in South America. The juice of these trees is\nsomething like milk or cream. By drying this juice, India rubber\nis made.\n\nThe Indians in Bra-zil have no glass to make bottles with. A long time\nago they learned to make bottles out of rubber. More than a hundred\nyears ago some of these rubber bottles were brought to this country.\nThe people in this country had never seen India rubber before. They\nthought the bottles made out of it by the Indians very cu-ri-ous.\n\nIn this country, rubber was used only to rub out pencil marks. That is\nwhy we call it rubber. People in South America learned to make a kind\nof heavy shoe out of it. But these shoes were hard to make. They cost\na great deal when they were sold in this country.\n\nMen tried to make rubber shoes in this country. They got the rubber\nfrom Bra-zil. Rubber shoes made in this country were cheaper than\nthose brought from South America. But they were not good. They would\nfreeze till they were as hard as stones in winter. That was not the\nworst of it. In summer they would melt. Goodyear was trying to find\nout a way to make rubber better. He wanted to get it so that it would\nnot melt in summer. He wanted to get a rubber that would not get hard\nin cold weather. The first rubber coats that were made were so hard in\ncold weather, that they would stand alone, and look like a man.\n\nGoodyear wanted to try his rubber. That is why he wore a rubber coat\nand a rubber waist-coat and a rubber cravat. That is why he wore a\nrubber cap and rubber shoes when it was not raining. He made paper out\nof rubber, and wrote a book on it. He had a door-plate made of it. He\neven carried a cane made of India rubber. It is no wonder people\ncalled him the India-rubber man.\n\nHe was very poor. Sometimes he had to borrow money to buy rubber with.\nSometimes his friends gave him money to keep his family from starving.\nSometimes there was no wood and no coal in the house in cold weather.\n\nBut Goodyear kept on trying. He thought that he was just going to find\nout. Years went by, and still he kept on trying.\n\nOne day he was mixing some rubber with sulphur. It slipped out of his\nhand. It fell on the hot stove. But it did not melt. Goodyear was\nhappy at last. That night it was cold. Goodyear took the burned\npiece of rubber out of doors, and nailed it to the kitchen door. When\nmorning came, he went and got it. It had not frozen.\n\nHe was now sure that he was on the right track. But he had to find out\nhow to mix and heat his rubber and sulphur. He was too poor to buy\nrubber to try with. Nobody would lend him any more money. His family\nhad to live by the help of his friends. He had already sold almost\neverything that he had. Now he had to sell his children's school-books\nto get money to buy rubber with.\n\nAt last his rubber goods were made and sold. Poor men who had to stand\nin the rain could now keep themselves dry. People could walk in the\nwet with dry feet. A great many people are alive who would have died\nif they had not been kept dry by India rubber.\n\nYou may count up, if you can, how many useful things are made of\nrubber. We owe them all to one man. People laughed at Goodyear once.\nBut at last they praised him. To be \"The India-rubber man\" was\nsomething to be proud of.\n\n\n\n\n\nDOCTOR KANE IN THE FROZEN SEA.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nKane was a doctor in one of the war ships of the United States. He had\nsailed about the world a great deal.\n\nWhen he heard that ships were to be sent into the icy seas of the\nnorth, he asked to be sent along. He went the first time as a doctor.\nThen he wanted to find out more about the frozen ocean. So he went\nagain as captain of a ship. His ship was called the \"Advance.\"\n\nKane sailed into the icy seas. His ship was driven far into the ice by\na fu-ri-ous storm. She was crowded by ice-bergs. At one time she was\nlifted clear out of the water. The ship seemed ready to fall over on\nher side. But the ice let her down again. Then she was squeezed till\nthe men thought that she would be crushed like an egg shell  At last\nthe storm stopped. Then came the awful cold. The ship was frozen into\nthe ice. The ice never let go of her. She was farther north than any\nship had ever been before. But she was so fast in the ice that she\nnever could get away.\n\nIn that part of the world it is night nearly all winter. For months\nthere was no sun at all. Daylight came again. It was now summer, but\nit did not get warm. Doctor Kane took sleds, and went about on the ice\nto see what he could see. The sleds were drawn by large dogs. But\nnearly all of the dogs died in the long winter night.\n\n[Illustration: A Dog Sled]\n\nDoctor Kane thought that the ice would melt. He wanted to get the ship\nout. But the ice did not melt at all.\n\nAt last the summer passed away. Another awful winter came. The sun did\nnot rise any more. It was dark for months and months. The men were\nill. Some of them died. They were much dis-cour-aged. But Kane kept\nup his heart, and did the best he could.\n\nAt last the least little streak of light could be seen. It got a\nlittle lighter each day. But the sick men down in the cabin of the\nship could not see the light.\n\nDoctor Kane said to himself, \"If my poor men could see this sunlight,\nit would cheer them up. It might save their lives.\" But they were too\nill to get out where they could see the sun. It would be many days\nbefore the sun would shine into the cabin of the ship. The men might\ndie before that time.\n\nSo Doctor Kane took some looking glasses up to the deck or top of the\nship. He fixed one of these so it would catch the light of the sun.\nThen he fixed another so that the first one would throw the light on\nthis one. The last one would throw the sunlight down into the cabin\nwhere the sick men were.\n\nOne day the poor fellows were ready to give up. Then the sun fell on\nthe looking glasses, and flashed down into the cabin. It was the first\ndaylight the sick men had seen for months. The long winter night was\nover. Think how happy they were!\n\n\n\n\nA DINNER ON THE ICE.\n\n\nAfter two winters of cold and darkness, Doctor Kane made up his mind\nto leave the ship fast in the ice. He wanted to get to a place in\nGreen-land where there were people living. Then he might find some way\nof getting home again.\n\nThe men started out, drawing the boats on sleds. Whenever they came to\nopen water, they put the boats into the water, and took the sleds in\nthe boats. When they came to the ice again, they had to draw out their\nboats, and carry them on the sleds. At first they could travel only\nabout a mile a day.\n\nIt was a hard journey. Some of the men were ill. These had to be drawn\non the sleds by the rest. They had not enough food. At one time they\nrested three days in a kind of cave. Here they found many birds' eggs.\nThese made very good food for them. At another place they staid a\nweek. They staid just to eat the eggs of the wild birds.\n\nAfter they left this place, they were hungry. The men grew thinner and\nthinner. It seemed that they must die for want of food. But one day\nthey saw a large seal. He was floating on a piece of ice. The hungry\nmen thought, \"What a fine din-ner he would make for us!\" If they\ncould get the seal, they would not die of hunger.\n\nEvery one of the poor fellows trembled for fear the seal would wake\nup. A man named Pe-ter-sen took a gun, and got ready to shoot. The men\nrowed the boat toward the seal. They rowed slowly and quietly. But the\nseal waked up. He raised his head. The men thought that he would jump\noff into the water. Then they might all die for want of food.\n\nDoctor Kane made a motion to Pe-ter-sen. That was to tell him to shoot\nquickly. But Peter-sen did not shoot. He was so much afraid that the\nseal would get away, that he could not shoot. The seal now raised\nhimself a little more. He was getting ready to jump into the water.\nJust then Petersen fired. The seal fell dead on the ice.\n\n[Illustration: A Seal]\n\nThe men were wild with joy. They rowed the boats with all their might.\nWhen they got to the seal, they dragged it farther away from the\nwater. They were so happy, that they danced on the ice. Some of them\nlaughed. Some were so glad, that they cried. [Illustration: Shooting\nthe Seal.]\n\nThen they took their knives and began to cut up the seal. They had no\nfire on the ice, and they were too hungry to think of lighting one. So\nthey ate the meat of the seal without waiting to cook it.\n\n\n\n\n\nDOCTOR KANE GETS OUT OF THE FROZEN SEA.\n\n\nAfter they got the seal, Doctor Kane and his men traveled on.\nSometimes they were on the ice. Sometimes they were in the boats. The\nmen were so weak, that they could hardly row the boats. They were so\nhungry, that they could not sleep well at night.\n\nOne day they were rowing, when they heard a sound. It came to them\nacross the water. It did not sound like the cry of sea birds. It\nsounded like people's voices.\n\n\"Listen!\" Doctor Kane said to Pe-ter-sen.\n\nPetersen spoke the same language as the people of Greenland. He\nlistened. The sound came again. Pe-ter-sen was so glad, that he could\nhardly speak. He told Kane in a half whisper, that it was the voice of\nsome one speaking his own language. It was some Greenland men in\na boat.\n\nThe next day they got to a Greenland town. Then they got into a little\nship going to England. They knew that they could get home from\nEngland. But the ship stopped at another Green-land town. While they\nwere there, a steamer was seen. It came nearer. They could see the\nstars and stripes flying from her mast. It was an American steamer\nsent to find Doctor Kane.\n\nDoctor Kane and his men were full of joy. They pushed their little\nboat into the water once more. This little boat was called the\n\"Faith.\" It had carried Kane and his men hundreds of miles in\nicy seas.\n\nOnce more the men took their oars, and rowed. This time they rowed\nwith all their might. They held up the little flag that they had\ncarried farther north than anybody had ever been before. They rowed\nstraight to the steamer.\n\nIn the bow of the boat was a little man with a tattered red shirt. He\ncould see that the captain of the boat was looking at him through a\nspy-glass.\n\nThe captain shouted to the little man, \"Is that Doctor Kane?\"\n\nThe little man in the red shirt shouted back, \"Yes!\"\n\nDoctor Kane and his men had been gone more than two years. People had\nbegun to think that they had all died. This steamer had been sent to\nfind out what had become of them. When the men on the steamer heard\nthat this little man in the red shirt was Doctor Kane himself, they\nsent up cheer after cheer. In a few minutes more, Doctor Kane and\nhis men were on the steamer. They were now safe among friends. They\nwere sailing away toward their homes.\n\n\n\n\n\nLONGFELLOW AS A BOY.\n\n\n[Illustration: Longfellow and the Bird]\n\nLong-fel-low was a noble boy.

So on a certain night early in December Vishnu\ncalled all his caste-brethren into the room where Chandra had died, having\nfirst arranged there a brass salver containing a ball of flour loosely\nencased in thread, a miniature cot with the legs fashioned out of the\nberries of the \"bhendi,\" and several small silver rings and bangles, a\ncoral necklace and a quaint silver chain, which were destined to be hung in\ndue season upon the wooden peg symbolical of his dead wife's spirit in the\n\"devaghar,\" or gods' room, of his house. And he called thither also Rama\nthe \"Gondhali,\" master of occult ceremonies, Vishram, his disciple, and\nKrishna the \"Bhagat\" or medium, who is beloved of the ghosts of the\ndeparted and often bears their messages unto the living.\n\nWhen all are assembled, the women of the community raise the brass salver\nand head a procession to the seashore, none being left in the dead woman's\nroom save Krishna the medium who sits motionless in the centre thereof; and\non the dry shingle the women place the salver and two brass \"lotas\" filled\nwith milk and water, while the company ranges itself in a semi-circle\naround Rama the Gondhali, squatting directly in front of the platter. For a\nmoment he sits wrapped in thought, and then commences a weird chant of\ninvocation to the spirit of the dead woman, during which her relations in\nturn drop a copper coin into the salver. \"Chandrabai,\" he wails \"take this\nthy husband's gift of sorrow;\" and as the company echoes his lament, Vishnu\nrises and drops his coin into the plate. Then her four brothers drop a coin\napiece; her sister-in-law, whispering \"It is for food\" does likewise; also\nher mother with the words \"choli patal\" or \"Tis a robe and bodice for\nthee\";--and so on until all the relatives have cast down their\nofferings,--one promising a fair couch, another an umbrella, a third a\npair of shoes, and little Moti, the dead woman's eldest child, \"a pair of\nbangles for my mother,\" until in truth all the small luxuries that the\ndead woman may require in the life beyond have been granted. Meanwhile\nthe strange invocation proceeds. All the dead ancestors of the family, who\nare represented by the quaint ghost-pegs in the gods' room of Vishnu's\nhome, are solemnly addressed and besought to receive the dead woman in\nkindly fashion; and as each copper coin tinkles in the salver, Rama cries,\n\"Receive this, Chandrabai, and hie thee to thy last resting-place.\"\n\nWhen the last offering has been made, the women again raise the salver and\nthe party fares back to Vishnu's house, where a rude shrine of Satvai (the\nSixth Mother) has been prepared. \"For,\" whispers our guide, \"Chandrabai\ndied without worshipping Satvai and her spirit must perforce fulfil those\nrites.\" Close to the shrine sits a midwife keeping guard over a new gauze\ncloth, a sari and a bodice, purchased for the spirit of Chandrabai; and on\na plate close at hand are vermilion for her brow, antimony for her eyes, a\nnose-ring, a comb, bangles and sweetmeats, such as she liked during her\nlife-time. When the shrine is reached, one of the brothers steps forward\nwith a winnowing-fan, the edge of which is plastered with ghi and supports\na lighted wick; and as he steps up to the shrine, the relations and friends\nof the deceased again press forward and place offerings of fruit and\nflowers in the fan. There he stands, holding the gifts towards the\namorphous simulacrum of the primeval Mother, while Rama the hierophant\nbeseeches her to send the spirit of the dead Chandrabai into the\nwinnowing-fan.\n\nAnd lo! on a sudden the ghostly flame on the lip of the fan dies out! The\nspirit of Chandrabai has come! Straightway Rama seizes the fan and followed\nby the rest dashes into the room where Krishna the medium is still sitting.\nFour or five men commence a wild refrain to the accompaniment of brazen\ncymbals, and Rama passes the winnowing-fan, containing the dead woman's\nspirit, over the head of the medium. \"Let the spirit appear\" shrieks Rama\namid the clashing of the cymbals.\n\n\"Let the spirit appear\" he cries, as he blows a cloud of incense into\nKrishna's face. The medium quivers like an aspen leaf; the dead woman's\nbrothers crawl forward and lay their foreheads upon his feet; he shakes\nmore violently as the spirit takes firmer hold upon him; and then with a\nwild shriek he rolls upon the ground and lies, rent with paroxysms, his\nface stretched upwards to the winnowing-fan. Louder and louder crash the\ncymbals; louder rises the chant. \"Who art thou?\" cries Rama. \"I am\nChandrabai,\" comes the answer. \"Hast thou any wish unfulfilled?\" asks the\nmidwife. \"Nay, all my wishes have been met,\" cries the spirit through the\nlips of the medium, \"I am in very truth Chandrabai, who was, but am not\nnow, of this world.\" As the last words die away the men dash forward, twist\nKrishna's hair into a knot behind, dress him, as he struggles, in the\nfemale attire which the midwife has been guarding, and place in his hand a\nwooden slab rudely carved into the semblance of a woman and child. \"Away,\naway to the underworld\" chant the singers; and at the command Krishna\nwrenches himself free from the men who are holding him and dashes out with\na yell into the night.\n\nStraight as an arrow he heads for the seashore, his hands clutching the air\nconvulsively, his'sari' streaming in the night-breeze; and behind, like\nhounds on the trail of the deer, come Rama, the brethren, the sisters, and\nrest of the community. Over the shingle they stream and down on to the hard\nwet sand. Some one digs a hole; another produces a black cock; and Rama\nwith a knife cuts its throat over the hole, imploring the spirit's\ndeparture, at the very moment that Krishna with a final shriek plunges into\nthe sea. They follow him, carry him out of danger, and lay him, stark and\nspeechless, upon the margin of the waves.\n\nThence, after a pause and a final prayer, they bear him homeward, as men\nbear a corpse, nor leave him until he has regained consciousness and his\nvery self. For with that last shrill cry the ghost of Chandrabai fled\nacross the waste waters to meet the pale ancestral dead and dwell with them\nfor evermore: and the house of Vishnu the fisherman was freed from the\ncurse of her vagrant and unpropitiated spirit. \"She has never troubled me\nsince that day,\" says Vishnu; \"but at times when I am out in my\nfishing-boat and the wind blows softly from the west, I hear her voice\ncalling to me across the waters. And one day, if the gods are kind, I\nshall sail westward to meet her!\"\n\n\n\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\nII.\n\nBOMBAY SCENES.\n\nMORNING.\n\n\n  \"Binishin bar sari juyo guzari umr bibin\n   kin isharat zi jahani guzeran mara bas.\"\n\n\nSo wrote the great poet of Persia: \"Sit thou on the bank of a stream and in\nthe flow of its waters watch the passing of thy life. Than this a vain and\nfleeting world can grant thee no higher lesson.\" Of the human tides which\nroll through the streets of the cities of the world, none are brighter or\nmore varied than that which fills the streets of Bombay. Here are Memon and\nKhoja women in shirt and trousers (\"kurta\" and \"izzar\") of green and gold\nor pink or yellow, with dark blue sheets used as veils, wandering along\nwith their children dressed in all the hues of the rainbow. Here are sleek\nHindus from northern India in soft muslin and neat  turbans:\nGujarathis in red head-gear and close-fitting white garments; Cutchi\nsea-farers, descendants of the pirates of dead centuries, with clear-cut\nbronzed features that show a lingering strain of Med or Jat, clad in white\nturbans, tight jackets, and waist cloths girded tightly over trousers that\nbutton at the ankle. There, mark you, are many Bombay Mahomedans of\nthe lower class with their long white shirts, white trousers and skull-caps\nof silk or brocade: there too is every type of European from the almost\nalbino Finn to the swarthy Italian,--sailors most of them, accompanied by a\nfew Bombay roughs as land-pilots; petty officers of merchant ships, in\nblack or blue dress, making up a small private cargo of Indian goods with\nthe help of a Native broker; English sailors of the Royal Navy; English\nsoldiers in khaki; Arabs from Syria and the valley of the Euphrates;\nhalf-Arab, half-Persian traders from the Gulf, in Arab or old Persian\ncostumes and black turbans with a red border. Here again comes a Persian\nof the old school with arched embroidered turban of white silk, white \"aba\"\nor undercoat reaching to the ankles, open grey \"shaya,\" and soft yellow\nleather shoes; and he is followed by Persians of the modern school in small\nstiff black hats, dark coats drawn in at the waist, and English trousers\nand boots. After them come tall Afghans, their hair well-oiled, in the\nbaggiest of trousers; Makranis dressed like Afghans but distinguished by\ntheir sharper nose and more closely-set eyes; Sindis in many-buttoned\nwaistcoats; <DW64>s from Africa clad in striped waist cloths, creeping\nslowly through the streets and pausing in wonder at every new sight;\n<DW64>s in the Bombay Mahomedan dress and red fez; Chinese with pig-tails:\nJapanese in the latest European attire; Malays in English jackets and loose\nturbans; Bukharans in tall sheep skin caps and woollen gabardines, begging\ntheir way from Mecca to to their Central Asian homes, singing hymns in\nhonour of the Prophet, or showing plans of the Ka'aba or of the\nshrine of the saint of saints, Maulana Abdul Kadir Gilani, at Baghdad.\n\n[Illustration: A Millhand.]\n\n[Illustration: A Marwari selling Batassa.]\n\nThe ebb and flow of life remains much the same from day to day. The\nearliest street sound, before the dawn breaks, is the rattle of the trams,\nthe meat-carts on their way to the markets, the dust-carts and the\nwatering-carts; and then, just as the grey thread of the dawn fringes the\nhorizon, the hymn of the Fakir rings forth, praising the open-handed Ali\nand imploring the charity of the early-riser who knows full well that a\ncopper bestowed unseen during the morning watch is worth far more than\nsilver bestowed in the sight of men. On a sudden while the penurious widows\nand broken respectables are yet prosecuting their rounds of begging, the\ngreat cry \"Allaho Akbar\" breaks from the mosques and the Faithful troop\nforth from their homes to prayer--prayer which is better than sleep. More\ncommonplace sounds now fill the air, the hoarse \"Batasaa, Batasaa\" of the\nfat Marwari with the cakes, the \"Lo phote, lo phote\" (Buy my cocoa-cakes)\nof a little old Malabari woman, dressed in a red \"lungi\" and white cotton\njacket, and the cry of the \"bajri\" and \"chaval\" seller, clad simply in a\ncoarse \"dhoti\" and second-hand skull-cap, purchased at the nearest\nrag-shop. And as he passes, bending under the weight of his sacks, you\ncatch the chink of the little empty coffee-cups without handles, which the\nitinerant Arab is soon to fill for his patrons from the portable coffee-pot\nin his left hand, or the tremulous \"malpurwa jaleibi\" of the lean Hindu\nfrom Kathiawar who caters for the early breakfast of the millhand. Mark him\nas he pauses to oblige a customer; mark his oil-stained shirt, and loose\nturban, once white but now deep-brown from continual contact with the\nbottom of his tray of oil-fried sweetmeats: watch him as he worships with\nclasped hands the first coin that has fallen to his share this morning,\ncalling it his \"Boni\" or lucky handsel and striking it twice or thrice\nagainst the edge of his tray to ward off the fiend of \"No Custom.\" But\nhark! the children have heard of his arrival; a shrill cry of \"Come in,\njaleibiwala\" forces him to drop the first coin into his empty pocket; and\nwith silent steps he disappears down the dark passage of the neighbouring\nchal.\n\n[Illustration: The seller of \"Malpurwa jaleibi\".]\n\nNow, as the Faithful wend their way homewards, bands of cheerful millhands\nhasten past you to the mills, and are followed by files of Koli\nfisherfolk,--the men unclad and red-hatted, with heavy creels, the women\ntight-girt and flower-decked, bearing their headloads of shining fish at a\ntrot towards the markets. The houses disgorge a continuous stream of\npeople, bound upon their daily visit to the market, both men and women\ncarrying baskets of palm-leaf matting for their purchases; and a little\nlater the verandahs, \"otlas,\" and the streets are crowded with Arabs,\nPersians, and north-country Indians, seated in groups to sip their coffee\nor sherbet and smoke the Persian or Indian pipe. Baluchis and Makranis\nwander into the ghi and flour shops and purchase sufficient to hand over to\nthe baker, who daily prepares their bread for them; the \"panseller\" sings\nthe virtue of his wares in front of the cook-shop; the hawkers--the Daudi\nBohra of \"zari purana\" fame, the Kathiawar Memon, the Persian \"pashmak-\nseller\" crying \"Phul mitai\" (flower sweets), start forth upon their daily\npilgrimage; while in the centre of the thoroughfare the \"reckla,\" the\nlandau, the victoria and the shigram bear their owners towards the\nbusiness quarters of the city. \"Mera churan mazedar uso khate hain,\nsirdar,\" and past you move a couple of drug-sellers, offering a word\nof morning welcome to their friend the Attar (perfumer) from the Deccan;\nwhile above your head the balconies are gradually filling with the mothers\nand children of the city, playing, working, talking and watching the human\npanorama unfold before their eyes.\n\n[Illustration: A Koli woman.]\n\nSo the morning passes into mid-day, amid a hundred sounds symbolical of the\nvarious phases of life in the Western capital,--the shout of the driver,\nthe twang of the cotton-cleaner, the warning call of the anxious mother,\nthe rattle of the showman's drum, the yell of the devotee, the curse of the\ncartman, the clang of the coppersmith, the chaffering of buyer and seller\nand the wail of the mourner. And above all the roar of life broods the echo\nof the call to prayer in honour of Allah, the All-Powerful and All-Pitiful,\nthe Giver of Life and Giver of Death.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEVENING.\n\n[Illustration: The \"Pan\" Seller.]\n\nAs the sun sinks low in the west, a stream of worshippers flows through the\nmosque-gates--rich black-coated Persian merchants, picturesque full-bearded\nMoulvis, smart sepoys from Hindustan, gold-turbaned shrewd-eyed Memon\ntraders, ruddy Jats from Multan, high-cheeked Sidis, heavily dressed\nBukharans, Arabs, Afghans and pallid embroiderers from Surat, who grudge\nthe half-hour stolen from the daylight. At the main entrance of the mosques\ngather groups of men and women with sick children in their arms, waiting\nuntil the prayers are over and the worshippers file out; for the\nprayer-laden breath of the truly devout is powerful to exorcise the demons\nof disease, and the child over whom the breath of the worshipper has passed\nhas fairer surety of recovery than can be gained from all the nostrums and\ncharms of the Syed and Hakim. Just before and after sunset the streets wear\ntheir busiest air. Here are millhands and other labourers returning from\ntheir daily labours, merchants faring home from their offices, beggars,\nhawkers, fruit-sellers and sweetmeat-vendors, while crowds enter the\ncookshops and sherbet shops, and groups of Arabs and others settle\nthemselves for recreation on the threshold of the coffee-sellers' domain.\n\nThere in a quiet backwater of traffic a small crowd gathers round a\nshabbily-dressed Panjabi, who, producing a roll of pink papers and waving\nthem before his audience, describes them as the Prayer-treasure of the\nHeavenly Throne (\"Duai Ganjul Arsh\"), Allah's greatest gift to the Prophet.\n\"The Prophet and his children,\" he continues, \"treasured this prayer; for\nbefore it fled the evil spirits of possession, disease and difficulty. Nor\nhath its virtue faded in these later days. In Saharanpur, hark ye, dwelt a\nwoman, rich, prosperous and childless, and unto her I gave this prayer\ntelling her to soak it in water once a month and drink thereafter. And lo!\nin two months by the favour of Allah she conceived, and my fame was spread\nabroad among men. The troubles of others also have I lightened with this\nprayer,--even a woman possessed by a Jinn, under whose face I burned the\nprayer, so that the evil spirit fled.\" He asks from two to four annas for\nthe prayer sheet and finds many a purchaser in the crowd; and now and again\nhe rolls the sheet into a thin tube and ties it round the neck of a sick\nchild or round the arm of a sick woman, whom faith in Allah urges into the\npresence of the peripathetic healer. \"Oh, ye lovers of the beauties of the\nProphet,\" he cries, \"Faith is the greatest of cures. Have faith and ye have\nall! Know ye not that Allah bade the Prophet never pray for them that\nlacked faith nor pray over the graves of those of little faith!\"\n\nHark, through the hum of the crowd, above the rumble of wheels and the\njangle of bullock-bells, rises the plaintive chant of the Arab\nhymn-singers, leading the corpse of a brother to the last \"mukam\"\nor resting-place; while but a short distance away,--only a narrow\nstreet's length,--the drum and flageolets escort the stalwart young\nMemon bridegroom unto the house of the bride. Thus is it ever in\nthis city of strange contrasts. Life and Death in closest juxtaposition,\nthe hymn in honour of the Prophet's birth blending with the elegy\nto the dead. Bag-pipes are not unknown in the Musalman quarters of\nBombay; and not infrequently you may watch a crescent of ten or twelve\nwild Arab sailors in flowing brown gowns and parti-<DW52> head-scarves\ntreading a measure to the rhythm of the bagpipes blown by a younger\nmember of their crew. The words of the tune are the old words \"La\nillaha illallah,\" set to an air endeared from centuries past to the\ndesert-roving Bedawin, and long after distance has dulled the tread of\nthe dancing feet the plaintive notes of the refrain reach you upon the\nnight breeze. About midnight the silent streets are filled with the\nlong-drawn cry of the shampooer or barber, who by kneading and patting the\nmuscles induces sleep for the modest sum of 4 annas; and barely has his\nvoice died away than the Muezzin's call to prayer falls on the ear of the\nsleeper, arouses in his heart thoughts of the past glory of his Faith, and\nforces him from his couch to wash and bend in prayer before Him \"Who\nfainteth not, Whom neither sleep nor fatigue overtaketh.\"\n\nDuring the hot months of the year the closeness of the rooms and the\nattacks of mosquitoes force many a respectable householder to shoulder his\nbedding and join the great army of street-sleepers, who crowd the footpaths\nand open spaces like shrouded corpses. All sorts and conditions of men thus\ntake their night's rest beneath the moon,--Rangaris, Kasais, bakers,\nbeggars, wanderers, and artisans,--the householder taking up a small\nposition on the flags near his house, the younger and unmarried men\nwandering further afield to the nearest open space, but all lying with\ntheir head towards the north for fear of the anger of the Kutb or Pole\nstar.\n\n    \"Kibla muaf karta hai, par Kutb hargiz nahin!\"\n    The Kibla forgives, but the Kutb never!\n\nThe sights and sounds vary somewhat at different seasons of the year.\nDuring Ramazan, for example, the streets are lined with booths and stalls\nfor the sale of the rice-gruel or \"Faludah\" which is so grateful a posset\nto the famishing Faithful, hurrying dinnerless to the nearest mosque. When\nthe evening prayer is over and the first meal has been taken, the\ncoffee-shops are filled with smokers, the verandahs with men playing\n'chausar' or drafts, while the air is filled with the cries of iced\ndrink sellers and of beggars longing to break their fast also. Then\nabout 8 p.m., as the hour of the special Ramazan or \"Tarawih\" prayer\ndraws nigh, the mosque beadle, followed by a body of shrill-voiced\nboys, makes his round of the streets, crying \"Namaz tayar hai, cha-lo-o,\"\nand all the dwellers in the Musalman quarter hie them to the house\nof prayer.\n\nIt is in the comparative quiet of the streets by night that one hears more\ndistinctly the sounds in the houses. Here rises the bright note of the\n\"shadi\" or luck songs with which during the livelong night the women of the\nhouse dispel the evil influences that gather around a birth, a circumcision\nor a \"bismillah\" ceremony. There one catches the passionate outcry of the\nhusband vainly trying to pierce the deaf ear of death. For life in the city\nhas hardened the hearts of the Faithful, and has led them to forget the\nkindly injunction of the Prophet, still observed in small towns or villages\nup-country:--\"Neither shall the merry songs of birth or of marriage deepen\nthe sorrow of a bereaved brother.\" The last sound that reaches you as you\nturn homewards, is the appeal of the \"Sawale\" or begging Fakir for a\nhundred rupees to help him on his pilgrimage. All night long he tramps\nthrough the darkness, stopping every twenty or thirty paces to deliver his\nsonorous prayer for help, nor ceases until the Muezzin voices the summons\nto morning prayer. He is the last person you see, this strange and\nportionless Darwesh of the Shadows, and long after he has passed from your\nsight, you hear his monotonous cry:--\"Hazrat Shah Ali, Kalandar Hazrat Zar\nZari zar Baksh, Hazrat Shah Gisu Daroz Khwajah Bande Nawaz Hazrat Lal\nShahbaz ke nam sau rupai Hajjul Beit ka kharch dilwao!\" He has elevated\nbegging to a fine art, and the Twelve Imams guard him from disappointment.\n\n\n\n\nIII.\n\nSHADOWS OF NIGHT.\n\n\nThere are certain clubs in the city where a man may purchase nightly\noblivion for the modest sum of two or three annas; and hither come\nregularly, like homing pigeons at nightfall, the human flotsam and jetsam,\nwhich the tide of urban life now tosses into sight for a brief moment and\nnow submerges within her bosom. Halt in that squalid lane which looks out\nupon the traffic of one of the most crowded thoroughfares and listen, if\nyou will, for some sign of life in the dark, ungarnished house which towers\nabove you. All is hushed in silence; no voice, no cry from within reaches\nthe ear; the chal must be tenanted only by the shadows. Not so! At the far\nend of a passage, into which the sullage water drips, forming ill-smelling\npools, a greasy curtain is suddenly lifted for a minute, disclosing several\nflickering lights girt about with what in the distance appear to be\namorphous blocks of wood or washerman's bundles. Grope your way down the\npassage, push aside the curtain with your stick--it is far too foul to\ntouch with the hand--and the mystery is made plain. The room with its\ntightly-closed shutters and smoke-blackened walls is filled with recumbent\nmen, in various stages of _deshabille_, all sunk in the sleep which\nthe bamboo-pipe and the little black pellets of opium ensure. The room is\nnot a large one, for the habitual smoker prefers a small apartment, in\nwhich the fumes of the drug hang about easily; and its reeking walls are\nunadorned save with a chromo plan of the chief buildings at Mecca, a crude\nportrait of a Hindu goddess, and oleographs of British royalty. It were all\nthe same if these were absent; for the opium-smoker comes not hither to see\npictures, save those which the drugged brain fashions, and cares not for\ndistinctions of race, creed or sovereignty. The proprietor of the club may\nbe a Musalman; his patrons may be Hindus, Christians or Chinese; and the\ndreams which riot across the semi-consciousness of the latter are not\nconcerned as a rule with heroes of either the spiritual or temporal kind.\n\n[Illustration: An Opium Club.]\n\nThe smokers lie all over the room in groups of four or five, each of whom\nis provided with a little wooden head-rest and lies curled up like a tired\ndog with his face towards the lamp in the centre of the group. In his hand\nis the bamboo-stemmed pipe, the bowl of which reminds one of the cheap\nchina ink-bottles used in native offices, and close by lies the long thin\nneedle which from time to time he dips in the saucer of opium-juice and\nholds in the flame until the juice frizzles into a tiny pellet fit for\ninsertion in the bowl of the pipe. The room is heavy with vapour that\nclutches at the throat, for every cranny and interstice is covered with\nfragments of old sacking defying the passage of the night air. As you turn\ntowards the door, a fat Mughal rises slowly from the ground and makes\nobeisance, saying that he is the proprietor. \"Your club seems to pay,\nshet-ji! Is it always as well patronised as it is this evening?\" \"Aye,\nalways,\" comes the sleepy answer, \"for my opium is good, the daily\nsubscription but small; and there be many whom trouble and sorrow have\ntaught the road to peace. They come hither daily about sundown and dream\ntill day-break, and again set forth upon their day's work. But they return,\nthey always return until Sonapur claims them. They are of all kinds, my\ncustomers. There, mark you, is a Sikh embroiderer from Lahore; here is a\nMahomedan fitter from the railway work-shops; this one keeps a tea shop in\nthe Nall Bazaar, that one is a pedlar; and him you see smiling in his\nsleep, he is a seaman just arrived from a long voyage.\"\n\nYou hazard the question whether any of the customers ever die in this\nparadise of smoke-begotten dreams; and the answer comes: \"Not often; for\nthey that smoke opium are immune from plague and other sudden diseases. But\nthe parrot which you see in the cage overhead was left to me by one who\ndied just where the saheb now stands. He was a merchant of some status and\nused to travel to Singapore and South Africa before he came here. But once,\nafter a longer journey than usual, he returned to find that his only son\nhad died of the plague and that his wife had forgotten him for another.\nTherefore he cast aside his business and came hither in quest of\nforgetfulness. Here he daily smoked until his money was well-nigh spent,\nand then one night he died quietly, leaving me the parrot.\" You peer up\nthrough the fumes and discern one bright black eye fixed upon you half in\nanger, half in inquiry. The bird's plumage is soiled and smoke-darkened;\nbut the eye is clear, wickedly clear, suggesting that its owner is the one\ncreature in this languid atmosphere that never sleeps. What stories it\ncould tell, if it could but speak-stories of sorrow, stories of evil, tales\nof the little kindnesses which the freemasonry of the opium-club teaches\nmen to do unto one another. But, as if it shunned inquiry, it retreats to\nthe back of its perch and drops a film over its eye, just as the smoke-film\nshutters in the consciousness of those over whom it mounts guard.\n\nFurther down the indescribable passage is a similar room, the occupants of\nwhich are engaged in a novel game. Two men squat against the wall on either\nside, surrounded by their adherents, each holding between his knees a\nlong-stemmed pipe built somewhat on the German fashion. Into the bowls\nthey push at intervals a round ball of lighted opium or some other drug,\nand then after a long pull blow with all the force of their lungs down the\nstem, so that the lighted ball leaps forth in the direction of the\nadversary. The game is to make seven points by hitting the adversary as\nmany times, and he who wins receives the exiguous stakes for which they\nplay. \"What do you call this game,\" you ask; and an obvious Sidi in\nthe corner replies:--\"This Russian and Japanese war, Sar; Japanese\nwinning!\" The game moves very slowly, for both the players and onlookers\nare in a condition of semi-coma, but the interest which they take in an\noccasional coup is by no means feigned, and is perhaps natural to people\nwhose daily lives are fraught with little joy. Round the corner lies\na third room or club, likewise filled with starved and sleepy humanity.\nNear the door squats a figure without arms, who can scratch his head\nwith his toes without altering his position, \"What do you do for a living,\nBaba?\" you ask; \"I beg, saheb. I beg from sunrise until noon, wandering\nabout the streets and past the \"pedhis\" of the rich merchants, and with\nluck I obtain six or eight annas. That gives me the one meal I need,\nfor I am a small man; and the balance I spend in the club, where\nI may smoke and lie at peace. No, I am not a Maratha; I am a Panchkalshi;\nbut I reck nothing of caste now. That belongs to the past.\"\n\nA light chuckle behind you, as the last words are spoken, brings you sharp\nround on your heels; and you discern huddled in the semi-darkness of the\ncorner what appears in the miserable light of the cocoanut oil lamp to be a\nGoanese boy. There are the short gray knickers and the thin white shirt\naffected by the Native Christian boy; there is the short black hair; but\nthe skin is white, unusually white for a native of Goa, and there is\nsomething curious about the face which prompts you to ask the owner who he\nis and whence he comes. The only reply is a vacant but not unpleasant\nsmile; and the armless wastrel then volunteers the information that the\nchild--for she is little more--is not a boy but a girl. Merciful Heaven!\nHow comes she here amid this refuse of humanity? \"She is an orphan,\" says\nthe armless one, \"and she is half-mad. Her parents died when she was very\nyoung, and her mind became somehow weak. There was none to take charge of\nher; so we of the opium-club brought her here, and in return for our\nsupport she runs errands for us and prepares the room for the nightly\nconclave. She is a Mahomedan.\" You look again at the dark-eyed child\nsmiling in the corner and you wonder what horror, what ill-treatment\nor what grief brought her to this pass. Peradventure it is a mercy\nthat her mind has gone and cannot therefore revolt against the squalor\nof her surroundings. It is useless to ask her of herself; she can only\nsmile in her scanty boyish garb. It is the saddest sight in this\nvalley of the abyss, where men purchase draughts of nepenthe to fortify\nthemselves against the cares that the day brings. The opium-club\nkills religion, kills nationality. In this case it has killed sex also!\n\n[Illustration: A \"Madak-Khana.\"]\n\n\n\n\nIV.\n\nTHE BIRTHPLACE OF SHIVAJI.\n\n\nAbout half a mile westward of the town of Junnar there rises from the plain\na colossal hill, the lower portion whereof consists of steep <DW72>s covered\nwith rough grass and a few trees, and the upper part of two nearly\nperpendicular tiers of scarped rock, surmounted by an undulating and\ntriangular-shaped summit. The upper tier commences at a height of six\nhundred feet from the level of the plain and, rising another 200 feet,\nextends dark and repellant round the entire circumference of the hill.\nViewed from the outskirts of the town, the upper scarp, which runs straight\nto a point in the north, bears the strongest similarity to the side of a\nhuge battleship, riding over billows long since petrified and grass grown:\nand the similarity is accentuated by the presence in both scarps of a line\nof small Buddhist cells, the apertures of which are visible at a\nconsiderable distance and appear like the portholes or gun-ports of the\nfossilised vessel. Unless one has a predilection for pushing one's way\nthrough a perpendicular jungle or crawling over jagged and sunbaked rock,\nthe only way to ascend the hill is from the south-western side, from the\nupper portion of which still frown the outworks and bastioned walls which\nonce rendered the fortress impregnable. The road from the town of Junnar is\nin tolerable repair and leads you across a stream, past the ruined mud\nwalls of an old fortified enclosure, and past the camping-ground of the\nTwelve Wells, until you reach a group of trees overshadowing the ruined\ntombs of a former captain of the fort and other Musulmans. The grave of the\nKilledar is still in fair condition; but the walls which enclose it are\nsorely dilapidated, and the wild thorn and prickly pear, creeping unchecked\nthrough the interstices, have run riot over the whole enclosure.\n\nAt this point one must leave the main road, which runs forward to the crest\nof the Pirpadi Pass, and after crossing a level stretch of rock, set one's\nsteps upon the pathway which, flanked on one side by the lofty\nrock-bastions of the hill and on the other by the rolling <DW72>s, leads\nupwards to the First Gate. At your feet lies the deserted and ruined\nvillage of Bhatkala, which once supplied the Musulman garrison with food\nand other necessaries, and is now but a memory; and above your head the\nwall and outwork of the Phatak Tower mark the vicinity of the shrine of\nShivabai, the family goddess of the founder of the Maratha Empire. The\npathway yields place to a steep and roughly-paved ascent, girt with dense\nclumps of prickly pear, extending as far as the first gateway of the\nfortress. There are in all seven great gateways guarding the approach\nto the hill-top, of which the first already mentioned, the second or\n\"Parvangicha Darvaja,\" the fourth or Saint's gate, and the fifth\nor Shivabai gate are perhaps more interesting than the rest. One\nwonders why there should be seven gateways, no more and no less.\nWas it merely an accident or the physical formation of the hill-side\nwhich led to the choice of this number? Or was it perhaps a memory\nof the mysterious power of the number seven exemplified in both Hebrew\nand Hindu writings, which induced the Musulman to build that number\nof entrances to his hill-citadel? The coincidence merits passing thought.\nThe second gateway originally bore on either side, at the level of the\npoint of its arch, a mystic tiger, carved on the face of a stone slab,\nholding in its right forepaw some animal, which the _Gazetteer_\ndeclares is an elephant but which more closely resembles a dog. The tiger\non the left of the arch alone abides in its place; the other lies on the\nground at the threshold of the gate. Local wiseacres believe the tiger to\nhave been the crest of the Killedar who built the gate and to have\nsignified to the public of those lawless days much the same as the famous\nescutcheon in \"Marmion,\" with its legend, \"who laughs at me to Death is\ndight!\"\n\nThe Saint's gate, so called from the tomb of a \"Pir\" hidden in the\nsurrounding growth of prickly pear, is the largest of all the gates and is\nformed of splendid slabs of dressed stone, each about 8 feet in length. On\neither side of the gateway are rectangular recesses, which were doubtless\nused as dwellings or guardrooms by the soldiers in charge of the gate.\nThence the pathway divides; one track, intended for cavalry, leading round\nto the north-western side of the hill, and the other for foot-passengers,\ncomposed of rock-hewn steps and passing directly upwards to the Shivabai\ngate, where still hangs the great teak-door, studded with iron spikes,\nagainst which the mad elephants of an opposing force might fruitlessly hurl\ntheir titanic bulk.\n\nLeaving for a moment the direct path, which climbs to the crest of the hill\npast the Buddhist caves and cisterns, we walk along a dainty terrace lined\nwith champak and sandalwood trees and passing under a carved stone gateway\nhalt before the shrine dedicated to Shivaji's family goddess. The dark\ninner shrine must have once been a Buddhist cave, carved out of the wall of\nrock; and to it later generations added the outer hall, with its carved\npillars of teakwood, which hangs over the very edge of a precipitous\ndescent. Repairs to the shrine are at present in progress; and on the day\nof our visit two bullocks were tethered in the outer chamber, the materials\nof the stone-mason were lying here and there among the carved pillars, and\na painfully modern stone wall is rising in face of the austere threshold of\nthe inner sanctuary. The lintel of the shrine is surmounted with inferior\n pictures of Hindu deities, and two printed and tolerably faithful\nportraits of the great Maratha chieftain. \"Thence,\" in the words of the\npoet, \"we turned and slowly clomb the last hard footstep of that iron\ncrag,\" and traversing the seventh and last gate reached the ruined\n_Ambarkhana_ or Elephant-stable on the hill top. It is a picture of\ngreat desolation which meets the eye. The fragment of a wall or plinth,\ncovered with rank creepers, an archway of which the stones are sagging into\nfinal disruption, and many a tumulus of coarse brown grass are all that\nremain of the wide buildings which once surrounded the _Ambarkhana_.\nThe latter, gray and time-scarred, still rears on high its double row of\narched vaults; but Vandalism, in the guise of the local shepherd and\ngrass-cutter, has claimed it as her own and has bricked up in the rudest\nfashion, for the shelter of goats and kine, the pointed stone arches which\nwere once its pride.\n\nAnother noteworthy feature of the summit of the hill is a collection of\nstone cisterns of varying ages, still containing water. The smaller open\ncisterns, in which the water is thick and covered with slime, are of\nMusalman origin, but there are one or two in other parts of the hill which\nclearly date from Buddhist ages and are coeval with the rock-cells. The\nmost important and interesting of all are four large reservoirs, supported\non massive pillars and hewn out of the side of the hill, which date from\nabout 1100 A.D., and were in all probability built by the Yadav dynasty of\nDeogiri. One of them known as Ganga and Jamna is full of clear cool water\nwhich, the people say, is excellent for drinking. Here again the hand of\nthe vandal has not been idle; for such names as Gopal, Ramchandra, etc.,\nare scrawled in English characters over the face of the chief reservoir--\nthe holiday work no doubt of school-boys from Junnar. The presence of\nthese four reservoirs, coupled with other disappearing clues, proves that\nbetween the Buddhist era and the date of the Musulman conquest, the hill\nmust have been fortified and held by Hindu chieftains, probably the\nYadavas already mentioned. The purely Musulman remains include the\n_Ambarkhana_, a prayer-wall or _Idga_, the skeleton of a mosque, with a\ndelicate flying arch, and a domed tomb. In front of the prayer wall still\nstands the stone pulpit from which the _moulvis_ of the fortress preached\nand intoned the daily prayers; but neither the prayer-wall nor the mosque\nhave withstood the attacks of time as bravely as the tomb. For here scarce\na stone has become displaced, and the four pointed arches which rise\nupwards to the circular dome are as unblemished as on the day when the\nbuilder gazed upon his finished work and found it good. The _Gazetteer_\nspeaks of it as a man's tomb; but the flat burial-slab within the arches\npoints to it being a woman's grave; and local tradition declares that it\nis the body of the mother of one Daulat Khan which lies here. Had those\nshe left behind sought to bring peace to her dust, they could have chosen\nno more fitting site for her entombment. For each face of the grave\ncommands a wide prospect of mountain and valley, the massive hills rising\ntier after tier in the distance until they are but faint shadows on the\nhorizon; the intense solitude peculiar to mountain-country is broken but\nfitfully by the wild-dove's lamentation; and even when the sun in\nmid-heaven beats down fiercely upon the grassy barrows of the hill top,\nthe breeze blows chill through the open arches and the dome casts a deep\nshadow over all.\n\nAt a little distance from the flying-arch mosque are two rooms built of\nstone, in one of which according to our Muhammadan guide Shivaji was born.\nWhether it was actually upon the rough walls of this small chamber that\nShivaji's eyes first rested is open to considerable doubt, and probably\nthey are but a small portion of a once spacious mansion which covered the\nsurrounding area, now relic-strewn and desolate, and in which the family of\nthe chieftain resided. These crumbling halls, the shrine of Shivabai, and\nthe outwork at the extreme north point of the hill are the only remains\ndirectly connected with Maratha supremacy. The out-work which overhangs the\nsheer northern scarp performed the same function as the famous Tarpeian\nRock of old Rome. Thence the malefactor of Maratha days was hurled down to\nswift death; and history records one instance of seven outlaws being cast\n\"unrespited, unpitied, unreprieved\" into space from this inaccessible eyrie\nby an officer of the Peshwa. Viewed from this point the whole plain seems a\nvast brown sea streaked here and there with green: and the smaller hills\nrise like islands from it, their feet folded in the mist which creeps\nacross the levels. To the north beyond the larger ranges which encircle the\nvalley the peak of Harischandragad is dimly visible, towering above the\nSahyadris; and across the plain to eastward the Suleman range ends in the\nhuge rounded shoulders of the Ganesh Lena spur.\n\nShivner has known many changes. It gave shelter to the Buddhist in the\nfirst and second centuries of the Christian era; It was excavated and\nfortified by early Hindu Kings who in turn yielded place to the \"imperial\nbanditti,\" and they held it until the English came and cried a truce to the\nold fierce wars. And all these have left traces of their sovereignty amid\nthe rocks, the grass and the rank weeds of the hill. It is a living\nillustration of the words of the poet:--\n\n  \"Think, in this batter'd Caravanserai\n    Whose Portals are alternate Night and Day,\n  How Sultan after Sultan with his Pomp.\n    Abode his destined Hour and went his way.\"\n\n\n\n\nV.\n\nTHE STORY OF IMTIAZAN.\n\n\nThe scene of her earliest memories was a small room with spotless\nfloor-cloth, the windows whereof looked out upon the foliage of \"ber\" and\ntamarind. During the day a black-bearded man would recline upon the\ncushions, idly fondling her and calling her \"Piyari\" ( dearest); and at\nnight a pretty young woman would place her in a brightly-painted \"jhula\"\n(swinging-cot) and sing her to sleep. Then the scene changes. He of the\nblack beard is away, and the form of the beloved lies stark beneath a white\nsheet while mysterious women folk go to and fro within the house. A\nkindly-faced old man, who in earlier days had helped her build little\ndust-heaps beneath the trees, takes her from the warm cot and hands her\nover to a woman of stern face and rasping tongue, with whom she dwells\ndisconsolate until one fateful day she finds herself alone in a\nmarket-place, weeping the passionate tears of the waif and orphan. But\ndeliverance is at hand.\n\nThe sight of the weeping child touches a chord in the heart of Gowhar Jan,\nthe famous dancing girl of Lahore. She takes the orphan home, christens her\nImtiazan, and does her best to blunt the evil memories of her desertion.\n\nGowhar Jan did her duty by the child according to her lights. She engaged\nthe best \"Gawayyas\" to teach her music, the best \"Kath-thaks\" to teach her\ndancing, the best \"Ustads\" to teach her elocution and deportment, and the\nbest of Munshis to ground her in Urdu and Persian _belles lettres_; so\nthat when Imtiazan reached her fifteenth year her accomplishments were\nnoised abroad in the bazaar. Beautiful too she was, with the fair\ncomplexion of the border-races, slightly aquiline nose, large dark eyes and\nraven hair, the latter unadorned and drawn simply back in accordance with\nthe custom of her mother's people which forbids the unmarried girl to part\nher hair or deck it with flowers. Her Indo-Punjabi dress, the loose\nmany-folded trousers, the white bodice and the silver-bordered scarf of\nrose pink--but added to her charm. Yet was Gowhar Jan troubled at heart,\nfor the girl was in her eyes too modest, too retiring, and cared not at\nall whether her songs and dances found favour with the rich landholders,\nSikh Sardars and the sons of Babu millionaires, who crowded to Gowhar\nJan's house. \"Alas,\" sighed Gowhar Jan, \"she will never be like Chanda\nMalika, gay, witty and famous for generations; her education has been\nwasted, and her name will die!\" But Imtiazan only pouted and answered;\n\"I care not to throw good saffron before asses!\"\n\n[Illustration: Imtiazan.]\n\nThen Fate cast the die. Her Munshi one day brought to the house a Musulman,\ndressed in the modern attire of young India, who had acquired such skill in\nplaying the \"Sitar\", that he was able straightway and without mistake to\naccompany Imtiazan's most difficult songs. Thereafter he came often\nto the house and gradually played himself into the affection of the\nyoung girl, who after some hesitation consented to marry him and elope\nwith him to a distant city. Thus Imtiazan left the house of her girlhood\nand fled with her husband to Bombay. Money they had not, where-fore\nImtiazan, not without a pang, sold her necklace of gold beads and\nbravely started house-keeping in the one small room they chose as\ntheir home, while he went forth to seek employment worthy of his\ndegree at the Calcutta University and of his Rohilla ancestry But alas!\nwork came not to his hands: and as the money slowly dwindled, he grew\nmorose and irritable and often made her weep silently as she sat stitching\nthe embroidery designed to provide the daily meal. She knew full well that\nvain pride baulked his employment; and after many a struggle she prevailed\nupon him to become a letter-writer. \"An undergraduate, who has read\nHerbert Spencer, Comte and Voltaire,\" said he, \"cannot demean himself to\nletter-writing for the public,\" to which she justly replied that an\neducation which prevents a man earning his daily bread must be worthless.\n\nSo in due course he installed himself with an ill grace upon the footpath\nof Bhendi Bazaar with portfolio and inkhorn, writing letters for uneducated\nMusulmans, petitions for candidates and English accounts for butlers. And\nthe more he wrote the more convinced he became that he was sacrificing\nhimself for a woman who could not realize the measure of his fall. Thus for\na time matters remained--little Imtiazan wearing her delicate fingers out\nat home, he plying his pen in the street, until one day a dancing-girl from\nLucknow called him to her house to write an important missive on her\nbehalf. This chance acquaintance ripened into a friendship that boded no\ngood for Imtiazan: for within a month, amid specious statements of\nlucrative employment and fair promises of future well-being, he bade her\nprepare to leave the small room and accompany him to a larger house,\nfronting a main thoroughfare, which, said he, would henceforth be their\nhome. The sight of the unscreened windows of her new home struck a chill\ninto Imtiazan's heart; and when the door opened and she was met by three\nelderly Muhammadans who saluted her as their \"Bai-Saheb,\" fear took\npossession of her soul. The thin red cases hanging on the wall told her\nthat the men were musicians; and in response to the mute appeal in her eyes\nher husband bade her with almost brutal candour prepare to adopt her old\nprofession of dancing and singing in order to save him from the hateful\nduties of a public letter-writer.\n\nFor two days Imtiazan tended by the musicians and their wives was a prey to\nthe blackest despair, and then deeming it useless to protest, she set\nherself courageously to do her husband's bidding and to dance as she had\ndanced in the house of Gowhar Jan. But she little knew the true depths of\nher husband's selfishness. \"Money comes not fast enough\" was his perpetual\ncry and he urged her, at first gently but with ever-increasing vehemence,\nto sink still lower. The memory of the past and who knows what higher\ninstinct helped her to withstand his sordid demands for many days; but at\nlength, realizing that this was _kismet_ and tired of the perpetual\nupbraiding, she consented to do his bidding. So for three weary years the\nwaters closed over Imtiazan. One day she awoke to find that her husband had\ncrowned his villainy by decamping with her valuables and all her savings.\nShe followed and found him, and, pressing into his hand a little extra\nmoney that he had in his hurry overlooked, she bade him a bitter farewell\nfor ever. She rested a day or two to get herself properly divorced from\nhim, and then returned alone to the hated life in Bombay.\n\nThere Fortune smiled upon her and wealth poured into her lap. Two years\nlater by dint of careful inquiry she discovered that the stern-faced woman\nwho had abandoned her in the Lahore market was her uncle's wife, now\nwidowed and in poverty; and to her she of her bounty gave a pension. For\nImtiazan, though she never forgot, could always forgive and had never lost\nthe sense of her duty to relations. She also provided for the old man who\nhad helped her when a child to build the dust-castles beneath the trees of\nher old home; and then, while still young and with enough money left to\nkeep herself in comparative affluence, she turned her back for ever upon\nthe profession which she loathed and devoted the rest of her life to the\ncareful rearing of an orphan girl, whom the desire for a child of her own\nand the memories of her own youth urged her to adopt. When she died, the\nchild who had grown up and under her guidance had married a respectable\nmerchant, mourned for her as one mourns for those who have lovingly\nshielded our infancy and youth; and many of the neighbours were sincerely\ngrieved that Imtiazan had departed for ever.\n\nSuch is the life-history of Imtiazan, one of the most famous dancing-girls\nBombay has ever known--a history that lacks not pathos. After her final\nrenunciation of the profession of singing and dancing she might have\nremarried and in fact received more than one offer from men who were\nattracted by her kindliness of heart and by her beauty. But she declined\nthem all with the words \"Marriage is not my _kismet_,\" which is but\nthe Indian equivalent of \"My faith hath departed and my heart is broken.\"\nSurely the earth lies very lightly upon Imtiazan.\n\n\n\n\nVI.\n\nTHE BOMBAY MOHURRUM.\n\nSTRAY SCENES.\n\n\nThe luxury of grief seems common to mankind all the world over, and the\nmourning of the Mohurrum finds its counterpart in the old lamentation for\nthe slain Adonis, the emotional tale of Sohrab's death at the hand of his\nsire Rustom, and the long-drawn sorrow of the Christian Passion. The\nPersian inclination towards the emotional side of human nature was not slow\nto discover amid the early martyrs of the Faith one figure whose pathetic\nend was powerful to awaken every chord of human pity. The picture of the\nwomen and children of high lineage deceived, deserted and tortured with\nthirst, of the child's arms lopped at the wrist even at the moment they\nwere stretched forth for the blessing of the Imam, of the noblest chief of\nIslam betrayed and choosing death to dishonour, of his last lonely onset,\nhis death and mutilation at the hand of a former friend and fellow-champion\nof the faith,--this picture indeed appealed and still appeals, as no other\ncan, to the hidden depths of the Persian heart. The Sunni may object to the\nchoice of Hasan and Husain as the martyrs most worthy of lamentation,\nputting forward in their stead Omar, companion of the Prophet himself, who\nlingered for three days in the agony of death, or Othman, the third\nKhalifa, who died of thirst, or \"the Lion of God,\" whose life came to so\ndisastrous a close. But the Shia, while admitting that the death of the\nfirst martyrs may have wrought severer loss to Islam, cannot admit that\ntheir end surpasses in pathos the tale of the bitter tenth of Mohurrum when\nthe stars quivered in a bloodied sky and the very walls of the palace of\nKufa rained tears of blood as the head of the Martyr was borne before them.\nHe cannot also approve the Sunni practice of converting a season of\nmourning into one of revelry and brawl, for he does not realize the\ninfluence of the local Hindu element upon the Mohurrum and cannot\ncomprehend that the Indian additions to the festival have their roots in\nthe deep soil of Hindu spirit-belief. For to the Hindu, and to the Sunni\nMahomedan who has borrowed somewhat from him, all seasons of death and\nmourning act as a lode-stone to the unhoused and naked spirits who are ever\nwandering through the silent spaces of the East. Some of these spirits we\ncan appease or coax into becoming guardian-angels by housing them in\nhandsome cenotaphs; others we can lodge in the horse-shoe or in that great\nspirit-house, the tiger, letting them sport for a day or two in the bodies\nof our men and youths, who are adorned with yellow stripes symbolical of\ntheir role; while other more malevolent spirits can only be driven away by\nshouting, buffeting and drumming, such as characterize the Mohurrum season\nin Bombay. The Indian element of nervous excitement might in course of ages\nhave been sobered by the puritanism of Islam but for the presence of the\nAfrican, who unites with a firm belief in spirits a phenomenal desire for\nnoise and brawling; and it is the union of this jovial African element with\nthe sentimentality of Persia and the spirit-worship of pure Hinduism which\nrenders the Bombay Mohurrum more lively and more varied than any Mahomedan\ncelebration in Cairo, Damascus or Constantinople.\n\nAlthough the regular Mohurrum ceremonies do not commence until the fifth\nday of the Mohurrum moon, the Mahomedan quarters of the city are astir on\nthe first of the month. From morn till eve the streets are filled with\nbands of boys, and sometimes girls, blowing raucous blasts on hollow\nbamboos, which are adorned with a tin 'panja,' the sacred open hand\nemblematical of the Prophet, his daughter Fatima, her husband Ali and their\ntwo martyred sons. The sacred five, in the form of the outstretched hand,\nadorn nearly all Mohurrum symbols, from the toy trumpet and the top of the\nbanner-pole to the horseshoe rod of the devotee and the 'tazia' or domed\nbier. Youths, preceded by drummers and clarionet-players, wander through\nthe streets laying all the shop-keepers under contribution for\nsubscriptions; the well-to-do householder sets to building a'sabil' or\ncharity-fountain in one corner of his verandah or on a site somewhat\nremoved from the fairway of traffic; while a continuous stream of people\nafflicted by the evil-eye flows into the courtyard of the Bara Imam Chilla\nnear the Nal Bazaar to receive absolution from the peacock-feather brush\nand sword there preserved. Meanwhile in almost every street where a 'tabut'\nis being prepared elegiac discourses ('waaz') are nightly delivered up to\nthe tenth of the month by a _maulvi_, who draws from Rs. 30 to Rs. 100\nfor his five nights' description of the martyrdom of Husain; while but a\nlittle distance away boys painted to resemble tigers leap to the rhythm of\na drum, and the Arab mummer with the split bamboo shatters the nerves of\nthe passerby by suddenly cracking it behind his back. The fact that this\nArab usually takes up a strong position near a 'tazia' suggests the idea\nthat he must originally have represented a guardian or scapegoat, designed\nto break by means of his abuse, buffoonery and laughter the spell of the\nspirits who long for quarters within the rich mimic tomb; and the fact that\nthe crowds who come to gaze in admiration on the 'tazia' never retort or\nround upon him for the sudden fright or anger that he evokes gives one the\nimpression that the crack of the bamboo is in their belief a potent scarer\nof unhoused and malignant spirits.\n\nTurn off the main thoroughfare and you may perhaps find a lean Musalman,\nwith a green silk skullcap, sitting in a raised and well-lighted recess in\nfront of an urn in which frankincense is burning. He has taken a vow to be\na \"Dula\" or bridegroom during the Mohurrum. There he sits craning his neck\nover the smoke from the urn and swaying from side to side, while at\nintervals three companions who squat beside him give vent to a cry of \"Bara\nImam ki dosti yaro din\" (cry \"din\" for the friendship of the twelve Imams).\nThen on a sudden the friends rise and bind on to the Dula's chest a pole\nsurmounted with the holy hand, place in his hand a brush of peacock's\nfeathers and lead him thus bound and ornamented out into the highway.\nAlmost on the threshold of his passage a stout Punjabi Musulman comes\nforward to consult him. \"Away, away\" cry the friends \"Naya jhar hai\" (this\nis a new tree), meaning thereby that the man is a new spirit-house and has\nnever before been possessed. A little further on the procession, which has\nnow swelled to considerable size, is stopped by a Mahomedan from Ahmednagar\nwho seeks relief. He places his hand upon the Dula's shoulder and asks for\na sign. \"Repeat the creed,\" mutters the ecstatic bridegroom. \"Repeat the\ndurud,\" say the Dula's supporters; and all present commence to repeat the\n\"Kalmah\" or creed and the \"Durud\" or blessing. Then turning to the\nMahomedan who stopped him, the bridegroom of Husein cries: \"Sheikh\nMuhammad, thou art possessed by a jinn--come to my shrine on Thursday\nnext,\" and with these words sets forth again upon his wanderings. Further\ndown the Bhendi Bazaar a Deccan Mhar woman comes forward for enlightenment,\nand the Dula, after repeating the Kalmah, promises that she will become a\nmother before the year expires; while close to Phulgali a Konkani Musulman\nwoman, who has been possessed for six months by a witch (Dakan), is flicked\nthrice with the peacock-feather brush and bidden to the Dula's shrine on\nthe following Thursday. So the Dula fares gradually forward, now stopped by\na Kunbi with a sick child, now by some Musulman mill-hands, until he\nreaches the Bismillah shrine, where he falls forward on his face with\nfrothing mouth and convulsed body. The friends help the spirit which racks\nhim to depart by blowing into his ear a few verses of the Koran; whereat\nthe Dula, after a possession of about four hours, regains consciousness,\nlooks around in surprise, and retires to his home fatigued but at last\nsane.\n\nWherever a \"tazia\" or tomb is a-building, there gather all the Mohurrum\nperformers, the Nal Sahebs or Lord Horse-shoes, the tigers and the mummers\nof Protean disguise. The spot becomes an \"Akhada\" or tryst at which the\ntomb-builders entertain all comers with draughts of sherbet or sugared\nwater, but not with betel which has no place in seasons of mourning. Here\nfor example comes a band of Marathas and Kamathis with bells upon their\nankles, who form a ring in front of the \"tazia\", while their leader chants\nin a loud voice:--\n\n  \"Alif se Allah; Be se Bismillah; Jum se meri\n  Jan. Tajun Imam Husein Ki nyaz dharun.\"\n\n  \"Alif for Allah; B for Bismillah; J for my life.\n    An offering is this to Husein.\"\n\nThe chorus take up the refrain at intervals accompanying it with the tinkle\nof the ankle-bells; and then as distant drumming heralds the approach of a\nfresh party, they repeat the Mohurrum farewell \"Ishki Husein\" (Love of\nHusein) and pass away with the answer of the tryst-folk: \"Yadi Husein\"\n(Memory of Husein) still ringing in their ears. The new party is composed\nof Bombay Musulman youths, the tallest of whom carries an umbrella made out\nof pink, green and white paper, under which the rest crowd and sing the\nfollowing couplet relating to the wife and daughter of Husein:--\n\n  \"Bano ne Sakinah se kaha. Tum ko khabar hai\n  Baba gae mare!\"\n\n  \"Bano said unto Sakinah. Have you heard that\n  your father is dead?\"\n\nThis party in turn yields place to a band of pipers and drummers,\naccompanying men who whirl torches round their head so skilfully that the\neye sees nought but a moving circle of flame; and they are succeeded by\nMusulman men and boys, disguised as Konkani fishermen and fishwives, who\nchant elegies to Husein and keep the rhythm by clapping their hands or by\nswinging to and fro small earthen pots pierced to serve as a lamp. The last\ntroupe, dressed in long yellow shirts and loose yellow turbans, represent\nSwami Narayan priests and pass in silence before the glittering simulacrum\nof the Martyr's tomb.\n\nThe most curious feature of the Mohurrum celebration is the roystering and\nbrawling of the _Tolis_ or street-bands which takes places for two or\nthree nights after the fifth day of the month. Each street has its own band\nready to parade the various quarters of the city and fight with the bands\nof rival streets. If the rivalry is good-humoured, little harm accrues; but\nif, as is sometimes the case, feelings of real resentment are cherished,\nheads are apt to be broken and the leaders find themselves consigned to the\ncare of the Police. It is difficult to see the connection between these\nbrawling street-companies and the lamentation for Hasan and Husein; but the\nrivalry of the _mohollas_ recalls the free-fighting which used once to\ntake place between the various quarters of Gujarat and Kathiawar towns\nduring the Holi festival, while the beating, shouting and general\npandemonium evoked by the _Tolis_ are probably akin to the\nextravagance once practised at the beating of the bounds in England and\nScotland and are primarily designed to scare away evil-spirits from the\nvarious quarters of the city. The _Tolis_ are indeed a relic of pure\nHinduism--of aboriginal spirit-belief, and have in the course of centuries\nbeen gradually associated with the great Mahomedan Festival of Tears.\nOriginally they can have had no connection with the Mohurrum and are in\nessence as much divorced from the lamentation over the slaughter at Karbala\nas are the mummers, the Nal Sahebs and the Lords of the conchshell (Sain\nKowra) of the modern celebration from the true Mahomedan who wanders back\nfrom the sea-shore uttering the cry of grief--\n\n  \"Albida, re albida, Ya Huseini albida.\"\n  \"Farewell, farewell, ah, my Husein, farewell!\"\n\n\n\n\nVII.\n\nTHE POSSESSION OF AFIZA.\n\n\nIt was quite evident that something was seriously wrong with Abdulla the\nDhobi. His features had lost their former placidity and wore an aspect of\ntroubled wonder; the clothes which he erstwhiles washed and returned to\ntheir owners with such regularity were now brought back long after the\nproper date and occasionally were not returned at all; and the easy good\ntemper which once characterized his conversation had yielded place to\nsudden outbursts of anger or protracted spells of sulkiness. The major-domo\nconsulted on the point could only suggest that Abdulla's ill-temper was\ntypical of the inherent \"badmashi\" of the Dhobi nature and that probably\nAbdulla had taken to nocturnal potations, while the youngest member of the\nhousehold unhesitatingly laid down that Abdulla had been seized by a \"bhut\"\nor in other words was possessed of a devil. When the former suggestion was\nlaid before Abdulla, he contemned it with unmeasured scorn and then turned\nand rent the spirit of the butler with winged words, but the small boy's\nopinion seemed to give him pause. He held his peace for a moment, gazing\nearthwards and rubbing a small heap of dust towards him with his toe; and\nthen on a sudden he burst out into the tale which is here set down in his\nown words:--\n\n\"Nay, Saheb, I am possessed of no devil, but my wife Afiza is sore troubled\nby one. Only three months ago I sent for her from my village, as she was\nexpecting to become a mother and I was desirous of looking early upon my\nfirst-born child; and for six weeks she dwelt contentedly with me in the\nhouse which I have rented near the ghat. And then the child was born--a\nchild without blemish; and Afiza and I were happy. But, Saheb, the shadow\nof evil was even then drawing nigh unto us. For on the sixth day after\nbirth, when the midwife was about to light the four-wicked lamp for the\n'chatti' ceremony, Afiza suddenly cast the child from her, leaped wildly\nfrom the couch, tearing at her hair and swaying to and fro as one demented,\nand broke the lamp with her hands. And the midwife fled from the room\ncrying for help, and brought my mother and my sister in to try and soothe\nher. And even while they wrestled with her spirit someone set light to the\nurn of frankincense, for it was the evening of Thursday; and as the thick\nsmoke curled upwards towards Afiza, she trembled and gasped out: 'This is\nmy house; and this woman hath been delivered on the spot where I died in\nchildbirth five years ago! I will never cease troubling her, for she hath\nforgotten even to burn a little 'loban' (frankincense) for the repose of my\nspirit.' So saying my wife fell senseless on the ground and remained\nmotionless for thirty minutes until the spirit had fled. And, Saheb, from\nthat day forward not an evening passes but the'suwandi' (the spirit of a\nwoman who has died in travail) lays hold upon her, and my house has become\na place of evil and a byword among the neighbours. Several exorcists,\nSiyanas and Syeds have we consulted, but all in vain. Their ministrations\nonly make her worse. What can be done!\"\n\nOne can hardly conjecture the ultimate fate of Abdulla and his family, had\nnot some one who took an interest in the case suggested a final resort to\nthe Syed from Cambay, who some little time ago opened in Goghari street a\nbranch of the famous Gujarat shrine of Miran Datar. To him Abdulla\nhalf-hopeful, half-desperate, repaired: and the Syed came into his house\nand gave Afiza a potion composed of incense-ashes and water from the Miran\nshrine. But the evil spirit was terribly violent; and it required regular\ntreatment of this nature for fully twenty days ere it could be dislodged.\nEvening after evening Afiza was taken into the presence of Syed, who\nsummoned forth the spirit with a drink of the sacrosanct water; and at home\nAbdulla and his mother who had been supplied with water and ashes by the\nSyed, were wont likewise to summon the spirit at any hour which they felt\nwould cause it inconvenience. Thus the struggle between the powers of light\nand darkness for the soul of Afiza continued, until at length the evil\nspirit deemed it wise to depart; and on the twenty-first day, when it was\nracking Afiza for the last time, it demanded as the final price of its\ndeparture the liver of a black-goat. So Abdulla hearkened to the spirit's\nwill and buried the pledge of his wife's recovery in a new earthen pot just\nat the spot where the four roads meet near his house And Afiza was at\npeace.\n\n[Illustration: Possession of Afiza.]\n\nSince that date nought has occurred to disturb Abdulla's peace of mind. The\nSyed of Goghari street has earned well-merited fame among the poorer\nMusulman inhabitants of that quarter; Abdulla has cast off his ill temper\nas it were a garment; Afiza the possessed has become Afiza the\nself-possessed, helping Abdulla to earn his livelihood and obtain the\napproval of his masters; and the child, unharmed by the Evil Eye and\nbeloved of his parents, is daily waxing in favour with God and man.\nAccording to Abdulla the only spirit which occasionally attacks him is a\nspirit of mischief not unknown to the parents of healthy little boys.\n\n\n\n\nVIII.\n\nA KASUMBA DEN.\n\n\nWander down one of the greatest arteries of the city and you will perhaps\nnotice on the east side of the street a double-storied house bearing all\nthe appearance of prolonged neglect and decay. Enter the low door and take\na sharp turn to the right and you will find yourself at length on an ill-\nsmelling landing with a creaking ladder-like staircase in one corner,\nenveloped from top to bottom in darkness so profound that one can almost\nconjure up visions of sudden death from the assassin's dagger. After a\nmoment's hesitation you commence to grope your way upwards: the staircase\nsways and creaks beneath your feet; the air is heavy with strange odours;\nsomething,--probably a cat--scuttles past you and nearly upsets your\nbalance; and putting out your hand to steady yourself your fingers touch\nsomething clammy and corpselike which turns out to be a Ghati labourer,\nnaked save for a loin-cloth, asleep in the narrow niche between the walls\nof the ground-floor and the first storey. One wonders what he pays for this\nprecarious accommodation, in which a sudden movement during sleep may mean\na sheer drop down the dark staircase. But fortunately he sleeps motionless,\nlike one physically tired out, perchance after dragging bales about the\ndock sheds since early morn or wandering all day round the city with heavy\nloads upon his head.\n\nAt length on the second storey a half-open door casts an arrow of light\nupon your path. You hail it with joy after the Cimmerian gloom of the lower\nfloors; and, pushing the door further ajar, you find yourself in a square\nlow room lit by two windows which command a view of the street below. It is\ncarpeted with cheap date-leaf mats and a faded polychrome \"dhurri\"; dirty\nwhite cushions are propped against the wall below the windows; a few square\ndesk-like boxes lie in front of the cushions; and in a semi-recumbent\nattitude around the room are some 20 or 30 men--Bombay and Gujarat\nMahomedans, men from Hindustan and one or two Daudi Bohras, the regular\ncustomers of the \"Kasumba\" saloon. There is one woman in the room--a member\nof the frail sisterhood, now turned faithful, nursing an elderly and\npeevish Lothario with a cup of sago-milk gruel, which opium-eaters consider\nsuch a delicacy: while the other customers sit in groups talking with the\npreternatural solemnity born of their favourite drug, and now and again\npassing a remark to the cheery-looking landlord with the white skull-cap\nand henna-tinged beard.\n\nEach occupant of the room has been provided with a tiny glass of weak\nopium-water from the large China jar on the landlord's desk, paying a pice\nper glass for the beverage. Some drink one glass, some two, some three or\nmore; but as a rule the \"kasumba\" drinker confines himself to two glasses,\nbeing ashamed to own even to a brother \"Tiryaki\" the real quantity of the\ndrug consumed by him: while a few, strengthened by prolonged habit, pay\nsomewhat more than the ordinary price for a thicker and stronger dilution.\nWhen the glasses are empty the company calls for desert; for the\nopium-drinker must always have his \"_kharbhanjan_\" or bitter taste\nremover; and the landlord straightway produces sweets, fruit, parched\ngrain, or sago-gruel known as \"_khir_\" according to the taste of his\ncustomers. Hardly has dessert ended when an elderly Mahomedan in shabby\ngarb falls out of the group and clearing his throat to attract attention\ncommences to recite a flowery prelude in verse. He is the \"Dastan-Shah,\"\nown brother (professionally) of the \"Sammar\" or story-teller of Arabia and\nthe \"Shayir\" of Persia and Cairo: and his stories, which he delivers in\na quaint sing-song fashion, richly interspersed with quotations from the\npoets of Persia, are usually culled from the immortal \"Thousand and one\nNights\" or are concerned with the exploits and adventures of one of the\ngreat heroes of Islam. Amir-Hamza for example is a favourite subject of\nthe imaginative eastern story-teller. Amir-Hamza according to Professor\nDryasdust died before the Prophet, but according to the Troubadours of\nIslam was the hero of a thousand stirring deeds by flood and field and\nby the might of his right hand converted to the Faith the Davs and the\nPeris of Mount Kaf (the Caucasus). You will hear, if you care to, of his\nresourceful and trusty squire Umar Ayyar, owner of the magic \"zambil\" or\nsatchel which could contain everything, and master of a rude wit, similar\nto that of Sancho Panza, which serves as an agreeable contrast to the\nsomewhat ponderous chivalry of the knight-errant of Islam.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThus the Dastan-Shah whiles away time until about 8 p.m. when the club\nbreaks up and the faded Aspasia helps her fractious Pericles down the\nrotten staircase and out into the night. Ere the company departs each\nmember subscribes a pice for the story-teller, who in this way earns about\nforty pice a day, no inconsiderable income in truth for the mere retail of\nsecond-hand fables: and then with a word of peace to the landlord the men\ntroop slowly forth to their homes. As we pass down the rotten staircase,\nlit this time for our benefit with a moribund cocoanut oil lamp, we mark\nthe Maratha labourer still sleeping heavily in his niche, dreaming perhaps\namid the heavy odours of the house of the fresh wind-swept uplands of his\nDeccan home.\n\n\n\n\nIX.\n\nTHE GANESH CAVES.\n\n\nFifty-six miles to the north of Poona lies the old town of Junner, which\nowing to its proximity to the historic Nana Ghat was in the earliest times\nan important centre of trade. As early as 100 years before the birth of\nChrist, the Nana Pass was one of the chief highways of trade between\nAparantaka or the Northern Konkan and the Deccan; and although the steep\nand slippery nature of the ascent must have prevented cart-traffic, the\nnumber of pack-bullocks and ponies that were annually driven upwards\ntowards the cooler atmosphere and richer soil of Junner must have been\nconsiderable. Once the Nana Ghat had been crossed the traveller found\nhimself in a land marked out by Nature herself for sojourn and settlement:\nfor there lay before his eyes a fruitful plain, well-shaded, well-watered\nand girt with mighty hills of rock, which needed but the skill of man to be\ntransformed into a chain of those \"Viharas\" or places of rest and\nrecreation, which the Buddhists of pre-Christian and early Christian ages\nsought to establish. Thus it happens that in each of the mountain ranges\nwhich rise around Junner are found caves and shrines hewn out of the solid\nrock by the followers of Buddhism, some with inscriptions in obsolete\ncharacters and all of them in a wonderful state of preservation,\nconsidering the ages that have passed since their foundation.\n\nAmong those most easy of access are the Ganesh Lena, as they are called,\nhollowed out of the vast rounded scarp, which rising a hundred feet above\nthe plain projects from the Hatkeshvar and Suleman ranges about a mile\nnorthward of the town. A fairly smooth but dusty road leads the traveller\ndown to the Kukdi river dried by the fair weather into stagnant pools, in\nwhich the women wash their clothes and the buffaloes lounge heavily, and\nthence through garden-land and clumps of mango-trees to the under-<DW72>s of\nthe mountain. There the road proper merges into a rocky pathway, which in\nturn yields place some little distance further on to a series of well-laid\nmasonry steps, of comparatively recent date, which, as they curve upwards,\nrecall to one's mind the well-known Hundred Steps at Windsor Castle. The\nsteps are divided into about ten flights, and are said to have been built\nat different times by devotees of God Ganesh in gratitude for his having\ngranted their prayers. What prompted the first worshipper to prove his\ngratitude in this form none can say: he might have so easily satisfied his\nconscience with a presentation to the God or by the erection of a small\nshrine in the plains. But happily for all men he adopted the more\nphilanthropic course of smoothing the road to the presence of the kindly\nDeity. Others, the recipients of like favours and fired by his example,\nadded each in their turn to the work, until the once rude track was\ntransformed into a massive stone-approach fit for the feet of princes.\n\nThe caves are twenty-six in number and consist mainly of dwellings and\ncells, with three water-cisterns two of which bear inscriptions, and a\nchapel. The cells are all hewn into somewhat similar pattern and shape,\ncontaining on one and sometimes two sides long stone benches, which served\ndoubtless as the resting-place of their Buddhist occupants. The \"Chaitya\nVihara\" or chapel cave alone is worth a visit. Pillars and pilasters with\neight-sided shafts and waterpot-bases, which scholars attribute to the\nperiod B. C. 90 to A. D. 300, stand sentinel over verandahs stretching away\ninto darkness on either side of the main aisle. Their capitals are\nsurmounted with crouching animals, twin elephants, a sphinx and lion, twin\ntigers, all beautifully carved through in places broken; while above them\nthe main walls of the cave rise steep into a pointed vault, the centre of\nwhich is some twenty-four feet from the ground-floor. The relic-shrine or\n\"Daghoba\" at the far end of the chapel stands upon a high plinth, and is\ncrowned by a rounded dome, similar to the \"Daghoba\" at Vyaravali which\noverlooks the dead city of Pratappur in Salsette. One of the members of our\nparty struck the plinth with a _dhotar_ to awaken the echoes which\neddy loudly round the vault and rouse the wild birds that have built their\nnests in the holes and cornices. The birds as well as the bats which lurk\nin the darker recesses of the chapel are said to be responsible for the\nvery pungent and unpleasant odour which greets one on entering and forces\none to cut short one's visit. And what of him who built the shrine? Deep in\nthe back wall of the verandah is graven, in characters long since obsolete,\nan inscription interpreted some time ago by scholars, which tells how\nSulasadata, the illustrious son of Heranika of Kalyana, presented the\nchapel to the monastery, to the glory of God and his own lasting merit. The\nrock-hewn words are headed and ended with the \"Swastika\" or symbol of good\nfortune, which appears in so many messages from Buddhist ages.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOn the left of the chapel at a slightly higher level stands the largest of\nthis group of caves, a large hall with a verandah and twenty cells around\nit. Later ages have converted the whole cave into a temple of Ganpati,\nwhence the caves obtain their name of Ganesh Lena; and the once plain\nwalls, whose very austerity reflected perhaps the life of the monks\ndwelling within them, have been rudely plastered, white-washed and covered\nwith inferior representations of incidents in the lives of Devi, Krishna,\nShiv and Ganpati. In the centre of the back wall, between two ancient stone\nseats, glowers a rude \"eidolon,\" aflame with red lead and _ghi_, so\nthickly smeared indeed that the original features and form of the god have\nwell-nigh disappeared. Yet this is Ganesh, the kindly Ganesh, who turns not\na deaf ear to the prayers of his servants and in whose honour the stone\nsteps were hewn and laid. Two _pujaris_ of the Yajurvedi Brahman stock\nand three or four women, who are attached to the shrine, crave alms for the\nGod. They and their forbears, they tell you, have been the officiating\npriests for years; wherefore, desirous of testing their knowledge, you\nenquire who built these mighty dwelling-places. \"Hindus of a thousand years\nago,\" say they, \"who desired to acquire merit.\" But ask the untutored\nvillager who has guided you up the hill; and straightway comes the\nanswer:--\"Sahib, these were not built by man, but by the Gods ere man\ncame hither!\"\n\nOutside the cave is a pleasant verandah and balus trade, whence you look\ndown over the bare lower <DW72>s to the garden-studded course of the river.\nBeyond lies a long low trail of vapour, which marks the position of Junner,\nand behind that again climb heaven-ward the Manmoda hills. On the right,\nwith its ruined mosque and conning-tower grey in the morning light, the\nmassive pile of Shivner frowns over the valley, like some dismasted\nbattleship, hurled upwards into sudden petrifaction by the hands of Titans.\nIt is an impressive scene--the pre-Christian monastery behind you; the\nrelics of Musulman and Maratha sovereignty in front; and below, bathed in a\nsea of morning-mist which Surya is hastening to disperse, Junner, the town\nof ancient memories, in her latest _avatar_ of a British Taluka\nHeadquarter station. Let us hope that the monuments which we raise will\nlast as long as those of Buddhist monk or Mahomedan Killedar.\n\n\n\n\nX.\n\nA BHANDARI MYSTERY.\n\n\n[Illustration: A Bhandari Mystery.]\n\nIn the heart of the great palm-groves to the north-west of Dadar lies an\n\"oart\" known as Borkar's Wadi, shaded by tall well-tended trees whose\ndensely-foliaged summits ward off the noon-day sun and form a glistening\nscreen at nights, what time the moon rises full-faced above the eastern\nhills. Not very long ago, at a time when cholera had appeared in the city\nand was taking a daily toll of life, this oart was the scene of a bi-weekly\nceremony organized by the Bhandaris of Dadar and Mahim and designed to\npropitiate the wrath of the cholera-goddess, who had slain several members\nof that ancient and worthy community. For the Bhandaris, be it noted, know\nlittle of western theories of disease and sanitation; and such precautions\nas the boiling of water, even were there time to boil it, and abstention\nfrom fruit seem to them utterly beside the mark and valueless, so long as\nthe goddess of cholera, Jarimari, and the thirty-eight Cholera Mothers are\nwroth with them. Thus at the time we speak of, when many deaths among their\nkith and kin had afforded full proof that the goddess was enraged, they met\nin solemn conclave and decided to perform every Sunday and Tuesday night\nfor a month such a ceremony as would delight the heart of that powerful\ndeity and stave off further mortality. The limitation of the period\nof propitiation to one month was based not so much upon religious\ngrounds as upon the fact that a Municipality, with purely Western\nideas of sanitation and of combating epidemics, refused to allow\nthe maintenance of the shed, which was to be the temporary home of\nJarimari, for more than thirty days. Yet it matters but little, this\ntime-limit: for a month is quite long enough for the complete assuagement\nof the anger of one who, though proverbially capricious, is by no means\nunkindly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLet us glance at the ceremony as performed on a Tuesday night towards the\nmiddle of the month of propitiation. In the darkest portion of the\n_wadi_ stands a rude hut, containing the emblems of the Mother,\noccupied for the time being by Rama Bhandari, who acts as a species of\nmedium between the goddess and his kinsmen. In front of the hut a space has\nbeen cleared and levelled, flanked on one side by mats for the Bhandari\nmusicians, singers, drummers and cymbal-players, and on the other by four\nor five chairs and a few wooden benches for the initiates in the mysteries;\nand to the stems of several neighbouring trees lamps have been affixed\nabout five feet from the ground, which cast weird shadows across the\nthreshold of the goddess's home. Rama, the high-priest of this woodland\nrite--a dark, thin man with a look of anxiety upon his face--enters the hut\nwith his assistant, Govind, while several fresh looking Bhandari boys take\nup their position near the gong, cymbals, and drum, prepared when the hour\ncomes to hammer them with might and main. A pause--and Rama returns bearing\nthe symbol or idol of the Mother, followed by Govind carrying a lighted\nsaucer-lamp. The idol, for such we must perforce style it, is nothing more\nnor less than a bright brass pot, full of water, set on a wooden stool\nwhich is thickly covered with flowers. In the mouth of the water-pot rests\na husked cocoanut, with a hole in the upper end into which are thrust the\nstems of a bouquet of jasmine, with long arms of jasmine hanging down on\neither side. Now the water-pot is the shrine, the very home of Jarimari and\nthe thirty-eight cholera mothers. Behind the jasmine-wreathed stool Govind\nplaces another stool bearing a tin tray full of uncooked rice, camphor, and\nblack and red scented powder; and close to it he piles the cocoanuts,\nsugar, camphor, cakes, betel-nuts, and marigolds which the Bhandari\ninitiates have sent as an offering to Rama. He next produces a pile of\nincense-sprinkled cinders, which he places in front of the goddess, and\nseveral incense-cones which he lights, while Rama lays down a handful of\nlight canes for use at the forthcoming ceremony. And while the rich scented\nsmoke rises in clouds into the still night-air, shrouding the goddess's\nface, Govind takes a little rice from the tray and a few flowers, and\nplaces them on a Tulsi or sweet basil shrine which stands a little\nnorthward of the hut.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\nAll is now ready. Rama bids the boys sound the note of gathering, and at\nonce such a clashing and drumming arises as would frighten all the devils\nof the palm-groves. The people come but slowly, for many of them work late\nin the mills and have to go home and cook and eat their evening-meal before\nthey can take part in the rites of the Mother. But at last groups of women\nappear out of the darkness, bareheaded save for flower-wreaths and a few\ngold ornaments, their saris wound tightly round waist and shoulder. They\ncluster silent and close-packed round the door of the hut; for they are the\nwomen whom the thirty-eight Mothers love to possess and to lash into the\ndivine frenzy which only the human form can adequately portray. Govind\nstirs the incense-heap; the dense smoke rolls forth again and shrouds all;\nthere is a feeling of witchery in the air and in the midst of the\nsmoke-pall one can just descry Rama bending low before the Mother. Now he\nrises, draws the rattan-canes through his hands, and then leans against a\npalm-tree with eyes tightly closed and hands quivering as if in pain. But\nhark! there is something toward in the hut, and out of the darkness dash\ntwo young women right in front of the goddess, leaping and tossing their\narms. They sway and twist their lithe forms in the smoke but utter no\nword. Only one can see their breasts heaving beneath the sari and can\ncatch the sharp \"Hoo, hoo\" of their breathing, as their frenzy heightens.\nNow from the other end of the hut two more rush forth, staggering, towards\nthe Tulsi shrine, and after the same mad gyrations dance towards the\nMother and bury their heads in the smoke; and they are followed at\nmomentary intervals by others who fly, some to the Tulsi shrine, others\nto the Goddess but all mad with frenzy, dancing, leaping, swaying, until\nthey sink overpowered by fatigue. Meanwhile Rama is performing a devil\ndance of his own in the smoke-clouds; the gong is ringing, cymbals\nclashing, onlookers shouting; the tresses of the women have fallen down\nand in the half-light look like black snakes writhing in torture; the\nwomen themselves are as mad as the Bacchantes and Menads of old fable:\nin a word, it is Pandemonium let loose!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe noise ebbs and flows, now dying down as the first frenzy fades away,\nnow rising more shrill as the spirit of the Mother wracks her devotees more\nfiercely. That tall finely-formed young woman, who dances like a puppet\nwithout will and who never seems to tire, is Moti, leader of the dancers\nand the favourite choice of Jarimari. There behind her is Ganga, the\nslightly-built, beloved of Devi, and in the midst of the smoke, swaying\nfrog-like, is Godavari, lashed to madness by Mother Ankai. Around them\ndance by twos and threes the rest of the women with dishevelled locks and\nloosened robes, whom Rama taps from time to time with his cane whenever\nthey show signs of giving in. But at length Nature reasserts her sway, and\nthe dancers one and all crouch down in the smoke, their dark sides heaving\npainfully in the dim light like the implements of some ghostly forge. Now\nGovind appears again with a tray and marks the brows of the women with a\nfinger-tip of vermilion, his own brow being marked by them in turn. He\nplaces a cake of camphor on the tray and sets light to it; and as the clear\nflame bursts forth in front of the Mother, the whole congregation rises and\nshouts \"Devi ki Jaya\" (Victory to the Goddess). Then Moti takes the tray\nand, balancing it on her head, dances slowly with long swinging stride\nround the Mother, while the music bursts out with renewed vigour, urging\nthe other women, the human tabernacles of the cholera deities, to follow\nsuit. Thereafter the camphor-cake is handed round to both women and men in\nturn who plunge their hands in the ashes and smear their faces with them;\nand so, after distribution of the offering of cocoanuts, sugar, and betel,\nthe celebration closes. A few girls still dance and jerk their shining\nbodies before the altar, but Rama who is getting weary touches them with\nhis hands, commanding the frenzy to cease, and with a sigh they withdraw\none by one into the dark shadows of the palm-grove.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSuch is in brief the ceremony of propitiation of the Cholera-Goddess. What\ndoes it signify? It appears that according to Bhandari belief the disease\nis the outcome of neglect of the Mother. The present conditions of life in\nthe cramped and fetid chawls of the city, the long hours of work\nnecessitated by higher rentals and a higher standard of living, leave her\ndevotees but little leisure for her worship. She is maddened by neglect and\nin revenge she slays her ten or fifteen in a night. Yet is she not by\nnature cruel. Fashion for her a pleasant shrine, flower-decked, burn\nincense before her, beat the drum in her honour, let the women offer\nthemselves as the sport and play-thing of her madness and of a surety will\nshe repent her of the evil she hath done and will stay the slaughter. In\nspirit-parlance a woman chosen by the spirit, into whom as into a shrine\nthe mother enters, is known as a \"Jhad\" or tree: for just as a tree yields\nrustling and quivering to the lightest breath of the gale, bends its head\nand moves its branches to and fro, so the women, losing all consciousness\nof self, play as the breath of the Mother stirs them, quivering beneath her\ngentler gusts, bending their bodies and tossing their arms beneath the\nstronger blasts, and casting themselves low with bowed heads and streaming\nhair as the full force of the storm enwraps them. They are in very truth as\ntrees shaken by the wind. Nay more, the Mother herself once lived in human\nform: she knows the pleasure, the comforts of the body and she is fain, by\nentering the bodies of her female devotees, to renew the memories and\nsuggestions of her former life.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn conclusion one may briefly record what the Bhandaris thought of the\npresence of a European at their sacred rite. Some feared him as one that\ncontemplated the imposition of a new tax; others viewed him askance as a\ndoctor from the Hospital despatched by higher authority to put an end to\nthe ceremony; and yet others,--the larger number insooth,--deemed that here\nat last was a Saheb who had found physic a failure and had learned that the\nMother alone has power to allay grievous sickness.\n\n\n\n\nXI.\n\nSCENES IN BOMBAY.\n\nA MUSULMAN HOLIDAY.\n\n\nNearly all the Mahomedan inhabitants of Bombay observe as a general picnic\nday the last Wednesday of the month of 'Safar' which is known as 'Akhiri\nChar Shamba' or 'Chela Budh'; for on this day the Prophet, convalescent\nafter a severe illness, hied him to a pleasance on the outskirts of Mecca.\nDuring the greater portion of the previous night the women of the house are\nastir, preparing sweetmeats and salt cakes, tinging their hands with henna,\nbathing and donning new clothes and ornaments; and when morning comes, all\nMahomedans, rich and poor, set forth for the open grounds of Malabar Hill,\nMahalakshmi, Mahim or Bandora, the Victoria Gardens, or the ancient shrine\nof Mama Hajiyani (Mother Pilgrim) which crowns the north end of the Hornby\nVellard. To the Victoria Gardens the tram cars bring hundreds of holiday-\nmakers, most of whom remain in the outer or free zone of the gardens and\nhelp to illumine its grass plots and shady paths with the green, blue, pink\nand yellow glories of their silk attire. Here a group of men and women are\nenjoying a cold luncheon; there a small party of Memons are discussing\naffairs over their 'bidis' while on all sides are children playing with the\npaper toys, rattles and tin wheels which the hawkers offer at such seasons\nof merry-making. Coal-black Africans, ruddy Pathans and yellow Bukharans\nsquat on the open turf to the west of the Victoria and Albert Museum;\nMughals in long loose coats and white arch-fronted turbans wander about\nsmoking cigars and chatting volubly, while Bombay Memons in gold turbans or\ngold-brocade skullcaps, embroidered waistcoats and long white shirts stand\non guard over their romping children.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe road leading from Mahalakshmi to the shrine of Mama Hajiyani is\nparticularly gay, and the Vellard is lined throughout its entire length\nwith carriages full of men, women and children in their finest attire;\nwhile under the palms on the east side of the road the hum of a great crowd\nis broken from time to time by the cry of the sellers of sweets, toasted\ngrain, parched pistachio nuts and salted almonds, or by the chink of the\ncoffee seller's cups. A happy, orderly crowd it is, free from all signs of\nquarrelling and excess, packed more densely than usual around the shrine of\nMama Hajiyani, where every little vacant space is monopolised by merry-go-\nrounds and by the booths of bakers and pastry-sellers. Here are men playing\ncards; others are flying kites; many are thronging the tea, coffee, and\ncold drink stalls; while in the very heart of the crowd wander Jewish,\nPanjabi and Hindustani dancing-girls, who have driven hither in hired\ncarriages to display their beauty and their jewels. Mendicants elbow one at\nevery step,--Mahomedan and Jewish beggars and gipsy-like Wagri women from\nNorth Gujarat, who persistently turn a deaf ear to the \"Maf-karo\" or\n\"Pardon\" of those whom they persecute for alms.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMany of the holiday-makers carry packets of basil leaves and flowers, which\nthey place upon the grave of the Mother Pilgrim, silently repeating as they\ndo so the 'Fatiha' or prayers for the dead. Others more Puritanical,\nperchance more sceptical, utter not their prayers to the grave; but as the\nwords pass their lips, turn their faces seawards, remembering Holy Mecca in\nthe far west. Glance for a minute within the room that enshrines the tomb,\nand you will see the walls hung with tiny toy cradles,--the votive\nofferings of heartsick women from whom the grace of Mama Hajiyani has\nlifted the curse of childlessness. So, as the sun sinks, you pass back from\nthe peace of the Mother Pilgrim's grave to the noise of the holiday-making\ncrowd; and turning homewards you hear above you the message of the green\nparrakeets skimming towards the tomb \"like a flight of emerald arrows\nstolen from the golden quiver of the Twilight.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA BOMBAY MOSQUE.\n\n\nWho does not know the Mahomedan quarters of the city of Bombay, with their\nserried ranks of many-storeyed mansions extending as far as eye can reach?\n\nDark and forbidding seem many of these houses; and to few is it given to\nknow the secrets they enshrine. But these square battalions of brick and\nplaster are not wholly continuous. For here and there the ranks are broken\nby the plain guard-wall and deep-eaved porch, or by the glistening domes\nand balcony-girt minarets of a mosque: and at such points one may, if one\nso wish, see more of the people who dwell in the silent houses than one\ncould hope to see during the course of a month's peregrinations up and down\nthe streets devoted to the followers of the Prophet.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nStand with me at sundown opposite the gateway of the mosque and watch the\nstream of worshippers flowing in through the portals of the house of\nprayer. Here are the rich purse-proud merchants of Persia, clad in their\nlong black coats; there the full-bearded Maulavis. Behind them come smart\nsepoys hailing from Northern India, golden-turbaned, shrewd-eyed Memon\ntraders and ruddy-complexioned close-bearded Jats from Multan. Nor is our\nfriend the dark Sidi wanting to the throng: and he is followed by the Arab\nwith his well-known head-gear, by the handsome Afghan, and by the broad-\nshouldered native of Bokhara in his heavy robes. Mark too the hurried steps\nof the brocade-worker from Surat, and note the contrast of colour as the\ngrimy fitter or black-smith passes through the porch side by side with the\nspotlessly-clad Konkani Musulman, whose high features and olive skin betray\nhis Indo-Arab origin. Rich and poor, clean and unclean, all pass in to\nprayer. As the concourse increases the shoes of the Faithful gather in\nheaps along the inner edge of the porch: only the newer shoes are permitted\nto lie, sole against sole, close to their owners, each of whom after\nwashing in the shaded cistern takes his place in the hindmost line of\nworshippers.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs the service proceeds the ranks of the congregation kneel, stand, fall\nprostrate, and press the brow upon the ground with a rhythm so reverential\nand so dignified that the watcher forgets for a time the torn or tawdry\nraiment, the grime of the factory, the dust of the streets, and feels that\neach fresh attitude of devotion is indeed the true posture of prayer. It is\nas a sea troubled by the breath of some unseen spirit,--wave upon wave\nrising, bending, and finally casting itself low in humility and self-\nsacrifice at the very footstool of the Most High. But all the worshippers\nare men. \"Where are the women,\" you ask; \"do they not repeat the daily\nprayers also?\" \"Verily yes,\" replies our guide; \"they are all praying in\ntheir homes at this hour. More regular, more reverent are they than we are;\nand if we men but prayed as the women pray, no shadow would dim the\nbrightness of Islam.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n[Illustration: An Arab.]\n\nAs the evening-prayer progresses groups of men and women with children in\ntheir arms gather at the main entrance of the mosque. For the children are\nvexed with sickness against which medicine has availed nought, and in a\nhigher healing lies their only chance of recovery. So, as the congregation\npasses out through the gateway, the parents hold out their ailing\nchildren; and well-nigh every worshipper, rich or poor, young or\nold, turning his face downwards lets his prayer-laden breath pass\nover the face of the sick child that needs his aid. A picturesque custom is\nthis, which illustrates two ancient and universal beliefs, namely that all\ndisease is spirit-caused and that the holy book is charm-laden. He who\nrepeats the inspired words of the Koran is purged of all evil, and his\nbreath alone, surcharged with the utterances of divinity, has power to cast\nout the devils of sickness. Thus to this day all classes of Mahomedans, but\nparticularly the lower classes, carry their sick children to the mosques to\nreceive the prayer-laden breath of the Musallis (prayer-sayers): and\nsometimes in cases of grievous disease a Pir or Mashaikh is asked to\nperform the healing office, prefacing the brief ceremony with that famous\nverse of the Koran:--\"Wa nunaz-zilo minal Kuraani ma huwa Shifaun wa rah\nmatun lil moaminina\" which being interpreted means, \"We send down from the\nKoran that which is a cure and a mercy unto true believers.\" So the mosques\nof the City are homes of healing as well as of prayer.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOccasionally, when the prayer-breath of the ordinary worshipper has failed\nto effect a cure, a Mussulman mother will take her sick child to some Syed\nor other holy man in the city for what she calls \"Jhada dalwana\"\n(_i.e._ the sweeping-over). The Syed questions her about the symptoms\nand duration of the disease. \"Ay me,\" moans the mother, \"I cannot say what\nails the child, Syed Saheb! He was full of life and health till the other\nday when I left him on the threshold sucking a sweetmeat. There came by an\nold Wagri woman who stared at him, whining for alms. I gave her a little\nbread, wishing her well away: but alack! no sooner had she gone than my\nchild sickened and hath not recovered since.\" The Syed then asks her to\ndrop a pice upon a paper covered with magic squares; which being done, he\nconsults a thumb-marked manuscript and decides that the child is a victim\nof the Evil Eye. Accordingly he proceeds to pass the end of a twisted\nhandkerchief seven times over the child's body, murmuring at the same time\ncertain mystic formulae which he, as it were, blows over the child from\nhead to foot. This operation is performed daily for three or four days;\nafter which in many cases the child actually gets better, and the mother in\ngratitude pays the Syed from eight annas to a rupee for his kind offices.\nSo too it is the Syed and the prayers he breathes which exorcise the spirit\nof hysteria that so often lays hold of young maidens; and it is likewise\nthe prayer-laden breath of the devout man which fortifies the souls of them\nthat have journeyed unto the turnstiles of Night.\n\n\n\n\nXII.\n\nCITIZENS OF BOMBAY.\n\nTHE MEMON AND RANGARI.\n\n\n[Illustration: A Bombay Memon.]\n\nWould you learn how the Memon and the Rangari--two of the most notable\ninhabitants of the city--pass the waking hours? They are early risers as a\nrule and are ready to repair to the nearest mosque directly the Muezzin's\ncall to prayer breaks the silence of the approaching dawn, and when the\nprayers are over they return to a frugal breakfast of bread soaked in milk\nor tea and then open their shops for the day's business. If his trade\npermits it, the middle-class Memon will himself go a-marketing, taking with\nhim a \"jambil\" or Arab-made basket of date-leaves in which to place his\nvegetables, his green spices, his meat and a little of such fruit as may be\nin season. His other requisites,--flour, pulse, sugar and molasses,--come\nto him in what he calls his \"khata,\"--his account with a neighbouring\nretail-dealer. He is by no means beloved of the Bombay shop-keeper, for he\nis strict in his observance of the \"sunna\" which bids him haggle \"till his\nforehead perspires, just as it did in winning the money\". The Bombay\nshop-keeper commences by asking an exorbitant price for his commodities;\nour Memon retorts by offering the least they could possibly fetch; and the\nbattle between the maximum and the minimum eventually settles itself\nsomewhere about the golden mean, whereupon the Memon hies him homewards as\nfull of satisfaction as Thackeray's Jew. In many cases the mother of the\nhouse or the sister, if old, widowed and in the words of the Koran\n\"despairing of a marriage,\" performs the business of shopping and proves\nherself no less adept than her kinsman at driving a bargain.\n\nAbout mid-day the Memon or Rangari has his chief meal consisting of\nleavened or unleavened bread, meat curry or stew or two \"kababs\" or fried\nfish, followed perhaps by mangoes, when in season; and when this is over he\nindulges in a siesta whenever his business allows of it. The afternoon\nprayers are followed by re-application to business, which keeps him busy in\nhis shop until 8 or 9 p.m., when he again returns home to a frugal supper\nof \"khichdi.\" It is hardly a satisfying meal, and many young Memons indulge\nin a fresh collation before retiring to rest. The \"khichdi\" finished, the\nyoung members of the family set forth for their evening resorts, nor\nforbear to take such refreshment as the city offers on their journey. They\npurchase a glass of ice-cream here, accept a cup of tea offered by a friend\nthere or purchase a tumbler of \"faludah,\" which plays the same part in the\nMahomedan life of Bombay as macaroni does in the life of the Neapolitan. It\nconsists of rice-gruel, cooked and allowed to cool in large copper-trays\nand sold at the corners of Mahomedan streets. On receiving a demand, the\nFaludah-seller cuts out a slice from the seemingly frozen mass, puts it\ninto a large tumbler mixes sugar and sherbet with it, and then hands it to\nhis customer who swallows the mixture with every sign of deep satisfaction.\nIf possessed of a conveyance the middle-class Memon will drive about sunset\nto the Apollo Bunder, Breach Candy or the Bandstand. Happy possessor of a\ntolerably decent horse and victoria, he considers himself above the\nconventionalities of dress, and thus may be seen in the skull-cap,\nwaist-coat, long white shirt and trousers which constitute his shop or\nbusiness-attire, attended not infrequently by little miniatures of himself\nin similar garb. Reaching the Bunder he silences the importunity of the\nchildren by a liberal purchase of salted almonds and pistachios or grain\nfried in oil, and passes an hour or so in discussing with a friend the\nmarket-rate of grain, cotton, _ghi_, or indigo.\n\nIf young, the middle-class Memon and Rangari is fond of the native theatres\nwhere he rewards Parsi histrionic talent by assiduous attention and\nexclamations of approval. He and his friends break their journey home by a\nvisit to an Irani or Anglo-Indian soda-water shop, where they repeat the\nmonotonous strain of the theatre songs and assure themselves of the\nhappiness of the moment by asking one another again and again:--\"Kevi\nmajha\" (what bliss!) to which comes the reply \"Ghani majha\" or \"sari majha\"\n(great bliss!). Then perhaps, if the night is still young, they will knock\nup the household of a singer and demand a song or two from her. Phryne\ncannot refuse, however late the hour may be, but she has her revenge by\ncharging a very high price for her songs, which her \"ustads\" or musicians\ntake care to pocket beforehand. Home is at length reached, and there after\na final supper of \"malai ke piyale\" (cups of cream) and hard-boiled eggs\nthe young Memon disappears until the morrow. The older and more settled\nmembers of the community amuse themselves till mid-night by congregating in\nthe tea and coffee shops of the city and there discussing the general trend\nof trade. Others have formed unions, which assemble at the house of each\nmember in turn and spend a few hours in singing the \"maulud\" or hymns on\nthe birth of the Prophet (upon whom be peace). These hymns, in pure Hejazi\nverse, are sung in different measures and are not unpleasant to the ear at\na distance. Another peculiar Memon custom is the street-praying for rain. A\nnumber of men and boys assemble about 9 p.m., in the street and sing chants\nset to music by some poet of Gujarat or Hindustan. The chants are really\nprayers to God for rain, for forgiveness of sins and for absolution from\ningratitude for former bounties. One with a strong voice sings the\nrecitative, and then the chorus breaks in with the words \"Order, O Lord,\nthe rain-cloud of thy mercy!\" Thus chanting the company wanders from street\nto street till midnight and continues the practice nightly until the rain\nfalls.\n\nA Rangari betrothal though simple enough in itself contains certain\nelements of interest. The father of the bridegroom usually informs the\nPatel of the caste that his son's betrothal will take place on a certain\nday, and on the evening of that day the bridegroom's retinue, accompanied\nby the Patel and various friends and relations, journeys to the house of\nthe bride. After the company has fully assembled someone brings forward a\ncocoanut on a tray with a few copper coins beside it. The Patel then asks\nwhy the cocoanut has been brought, to which one of the bride's supporters\nreplies \"It is for the betrothal of the daughter of Zeid with Omar.\" This\nfeature of the ceremony is obviously of Hindu origin and must be a legacy\nof the days when the Rangaris, not yet converted to Islam, belonged to the\nHindu Khatri or Kshattriya caste of Gujarat and Cutch. For the loose copper\ncoins, which till recently were styled \"dharam-paisa,\" must be lingering\nremnants of the Brahman \"dakshina,\" which always accompanied the \"shripal\"\nor auspicious fruit; while among Hindus from the very earliest ages\ncocoanuts have been sent by the bride to the bridegroom, sometimes as\nearnest of an offer of marriage, sometimes in token of acceptance. After\nthis ceremony is complete the parties cannot retract, the ceremony being\nconsidered equivalent to a \"nikah\" or actual registration by the Kazi; and\nthis fact again discovers the Hindu origin of the Mahomedan Rangaris and of\ntheir customs, for among foreign Musulmans the betrothal is a mere period\nof probation and is terminable at the desire of either party. The\n\"dharam-paisa\" usually finds its way into the pocket of the street-Mulla,\nwho has a room in the neighbouring mosque and is charged with the\ncirculation of invitations to all members of the Rangari jamat to\nassemble at the bride-groom's house for the betrothal-ceremony.\n\n\n\n\nXIII.\n\nTHE SIDIS OF BOMBAY.\n\nAN AFRICAN REEL.\n\n\nAmong the most curious of the modern portions of Bombay City one may reckon\nMadanpura, which lies off Ripon Road and is commonly known as the home of\nthe Julhais or Muhammadan weavers from Northern India. It is a rapidly\ngrowing quarter, for new chals and new shops spring up every year and\nquickly find a full complement of tenants from among the lower classes of\nthe population. Amongst those who like the Julhais have moved northward\nfrom the older urban area are the Sidis or Musulmans of African descent,\nwho supply the steamship companies with stokers, firemen and engine-room\nassistants, and the dockyards and workshops with fitters and mechanics. A\nhardy race they are, with their muscular frames, thick lips and crisp black\nhair--the very last men you would wish to meet in a rough-and-tumble, and\nyet withal a jovial people, well-disposed and hospitable to anyone whom\nthey regard as a friend. If they trust you fully they will give you\n_carte blanche_ to witness one of their periodical dances, in which\nboth sexes participate and, which commencing about 10-30 p.m., usually last\nuntil 3 or 4 o'clock the following morning. They are worth seeing once, if\nonly for the sake of learning how the Sidis amuse themselves when the\nspirit moves them.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\nImagine a bare white-washed room, opening directly upon the street, the\nwalls of which boast of no ornament save a row of tom-toms, and the sides\nand window ledges of which are lined with an expectant crowd of Sidis of\nvarying age, from the small boy of eight years to the elderly headman or\npatel, who is responsible for the good behaviour of the community and is\nthe general arbiter of their internal disputes. This is the Sidi Jamatkhana\nor caste-hall: and long before you reach the door threading your way\nthrough a crowd of squatting hawkers, your ears are assailed by the most\ndeafening noise, reminding you forcibly of the coppersmith's bazaar with an\naccompaniment of rythmic drumming. The cause is not far to seek. In the\ncentre of the room two Sidis are sitting, in cock-horse fashion, astride\nwhat appear to be wooden imitations of a cannon and beating the parchment-\ncovered mouths of their pseudo-steeds with their hands; at their feet a\nthird Sidi is playing a kind of _reveille_ upon a flattened kerosine\noil-tin; and in the corner, with his back to the audience, an immense\nAfrican--an ebony Pan blowing frenzy through his wide lips--is forcing the\nwhole weight of his lungs into a narrow reed pipe. The noise is phenomenal,\noverpowering, but is plainly attractive to Sidi ears; for the room is\nrapidly filling, and more than one of the spectators suddenly leaps from\nhis seat and circles round the drummers, keeping time to the rythm with\nqueer movements of his body and feet and whirling a \"lathi\" round his head\nin much the same fashion as the proverbial Irishman at Donneybrook Fair.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMeanwhile there is some movement toward in the half-light of the inner\nroom. From time to time you catch a glimpse of the black sphinx-faces,\nimmobile and heavy-eyed, framed in scarves bearing a bold pattern of red\nmonkeys and blue palm-trees: and as the din increases the owners of those\ninscrutable faces creep out and sink down upon a strip of china matting on\nthe far side of the room. They are the wives and daughters of the\ncommunity--some of them young and, from the Sidi point of view, good to\nlook upon, others emulating the elephant in bulk, but all preternaturally\nsolemn and immovable. Here and there among the faces you miss the well-\nknown type. The thick prominent lips yield place to more delicate mouths,\nthe shapeless nose to the slightly aquiline, for there are half-breeds\nhere, who take more after their Indian fathers than their African mothers,\nand who serve as a living example of the tricks that Nature can play in the\nintermingling of races.\n\n[Illustration: Sidis of Bombay.]\n\nAnd now the piper in the corner sets up a wilder strain; the drummers work\ntill their muscles crack, now looking as if they were undergoing torture,\nnow turning half-round to have a joke with a fresh arrival, until the\ntension reaches breaking-point and with a shout some ten men dash forward\nand forming a ring round the musicians commence the wild \"Bomo\" dance, even\nas their savage ancestors were wont to do in past ages round the camp-fires\nof Africa. Watch them as they move round. They are obviously inspired\nby the noise and are bent heart and soul upon encouraging the laggards\nto join in, One of them, as he passes, shouts out that he sails by\nthe P. and O. \"Dindigul\" the next day and intends to make a night\nof it; another is wearing the South African medal and says he earned\nit as fireman-serang on a troopship from these shores; while a third,\nin deference to the English guest, gives vent at intervals to a resonant\n\"Hip, hip, Hurrah,\" which almost drowns the unmelodious efforts of\nthe \"maestro\" with the kerosine-tin. The \"Bomo\" dance is followed\nwith scarce a pause by the \"Lewa,\" a kind of festal revel, in which\nthe dancers move inwards and outwards as they circle round; and this\nin turn yields place to the \"Bondogaya\" and two religious figures,\nthe \"Damali\" and \"Chinughi,\" which are said when properly performed to give\nmen the power of divination.\n\nLong ere the \"Lewa\" draws to a close, the women have joined in. First two\nof the younger women move from the corner, one of them with eyes half-\nclosed and preserving a curious rigidity of body even while her feet are\nrythmically tapping the floor: then two more join and so on, until the\ncircumference of the dancing-circle is expanded as far as the size of the\nroom will allow and not a single woman is left on the china matting. Some\nof them are as completely under the spell of the music as the men, but they\nexhibit little sign of pleasure or excitement on their faces; and were it\nnot for an occasional smile or the weird shriek they raise at intervals,\none might suppose them all to be in a state of hypnotism. Perchance they\nare. The most vivacious of them all is the old Patelni, who since the death\nof Queen Sophie has been in almost complete control of the female portion\nof the Sidi community. She has no place in the chain of dancing fanatics\nbut stands in the centre near the drummers, now breaking into a \"pas seul\"\non her own account, now urging a laggard with all the force of a powerful\nvocabulary, beating time the while upon the shoulder of the nearest\ndrummer.\n\nSo the revel progresses, sometimes dying down into a slow movement in which\nonly the hoarse breathing of the men, the tap-tap of female heels, is\nheard; and anon breaking into a kind of gallop, punctuated with shouts of\n\"Bravo\" \"Hip, hip, Hurrah\" and the queer dental shriek, which our friendly\nserang tells us is the peculiar note of the African reveller. But at length\nNature asserts her sway; and after the dancing has lasted almost without\ninterruption for three hours, the Sidi Patel, Hassan, gives permission for\na brief recess, during which he introduces to the spectators the son of the\nSidi chief Makanda,--a fine specimen of manhood whose six-foot stature\nbelies the fact that he is still according to Sidi views a minor incapable\nof looking after his own interests. At this juncture too an itinerant\ncoffee-seller limps into the room with his tin can and cups and is\nstraightway pounced upon by the breathless performers, who apparently find\ncoffee better dancing-powder than any other beverage.\n\n\"How much\" you ask him \"do you charge per cup?\"\n\n\"Saheb,\" comes the answer, \"for two rupees you can treat the whole\ngathering, men, women and children to a cup apiece; for this coffee is of\nthe best!\" So we pay our footing in kind and bid adieu to the dancers who\nare prepared to continue the revels till the early hours of the morning. As\nwe turn the corner into Ripon Road, we catch a final glimpse of our\nbemedalled serang executing a fandango on the door-step, and of the Sidi\nPatel with a cup of hot coffee in his hand shouting in broken English,\n\"Good-night, God Save the King!\"\n\n\n\n\nXIV.\n\nA KONKAN LEGEND.\n\n\nLegend and tradition have rendered many a spot in India sacrosanct for all\ntime; and to no tract perhaps have such traditions clung with greater\ntenacity than to the western littoral which in the dawn of the centuries\nwatched the traders of the ancient world sail down from the horizon to\nbarter in its ports. As with Gujarat and the Coast of Kathiawar, so with\nthe Konkan it is a broken tale of strange arrivals, strange building,\nstrange trafficking in human and inanimate freight that greets the student\nof ancient history and bewilders the ethnologist. The Konkan, in which in\nearliest days \"the beasts with man divided empire claimed,\" and which\nitself is dowered with a legendary origin not wholly dissimilar in kind\nfrom the story of Rameses III and his naval conquest, offers a fair sample\nof these semi-historical myths in the tale of the arrival of the Chitpavans\nat Chiplun in Ratnagiri. For, so runs the tale, on a day long buried in the\nabyss of Time it chanced that a terrific storm gathered over the western\nwaters; and as night drew on the sky, black with serried ranks of clouds,\nburst into sharp jets of fire, the rain poured forth in torrents\nunquenchable, and the shriek of a mighty whirlwind, mingling with the deep\nechoes of Indra's thunder, drowned even the roar of the storm-lashed seas.\nAmong the ships abroad on that night was one of strange device with high\npeaked prow, manned by a crew of fair-skinned and blue-eyed men, which was\nforging its way from a northern port to some fair city of Southern India;\nand when the storm struck her, she was not many miles from what we now call\nthe Ratnagiri coast. Bravely did she battle with the tempest; bravely did\nher men essay to keep her on her course, bringing to play their hereditary\nknowledge of sea-craft, their innate dexterity of brain. But all their\nscheming, all their courage proved fruitless. As a bridegroom of old time\nscattering the bridal procession by the might of a powerful right arm, the\nsea swept away her protectors and carried her, lone and defenceless, on to\nthe surge-beaten shore. And when morning broke Surya, rising red above the\neastern hills, watched the hungry waves cast up beside her fourteen white\ncorpses, the remnants of her crew--silent suppliants for the last great\nrites which open to man the passage into the next world.\n\nNow at the ebb of the tide the dark people that dwelt upon the marge of the\nsea fared shorewards and found the blue-eyed mariners lying dead beside\ntheir vessel; and they, marvelling greatly what manner of men these might\nhave been, took counsel among themselves and decided to bestow upon them\nthe last rites of the dead. So they built a mighty funeral pyre for them\nwith logs of resinous wood hewn in the dark forest that stretched inland,\nand they fortified the souls of the dead seamen with prayer and\nlamentation. But lo! a miracle: for as the flames hissed upwards,\npurging the bodies of all earthly taint, life returned to them by the grace\nof Parashurama; and they rose one and all from the pyre and praised Him of\nthe Axe, in that he had raised them from the dead and made them truly\n\"Chitta-Pavana\" or the \"Pyre Purified.\" And they dwelt henceforth in the\nland of the arrow of their Deliverer and were at peace, forgetting their\nformer home and their drear wandering over the pathless sea, and taking\nperchance unto themselves wives from among the ancient holders of the soil.\nNow the place where they abode is called Chittapolana or Chiplun unto this\nday.\n\n[Illustration: Parashurama and the Chitpavans.]\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd it came to pass in the fulness of time, as the Sahyadri-khand tells,\nthat Parashurama called all Brahmans to a great festival in the new land\nwhich he had created between the mountains and the sea. But the twice-born\nhearkened not to his words; whereas the God waxing wroth determined to\ncreate new Brahmans who would not turn a deaf ear to his counsel. Revolving\nthis decision in his heart he walked down to the shore, and there in the\nseaward-gazing burning-ground he met a stranger-people, white-skinned,\nblue-eyed, and fair to look upon, and asked them who they were and whence\nthey came. \"Fishermen (or hunters) are we,\" they answered, \"and dwell upon\nthe seashore, sixty families of us in all.\" And the God was pleased with\nthem and raising them to the rank of Brahmans, divided them into fourteen\n\"Gotras,\" and made them a solemn promise that should they ever call him to\nmind in any real emergency he would come to their assistance. So they dwelt\nfor many a day, waxing by the favour of God both numerous and learned,\nuntil by ill-hap they hearkened into evil counsel and called upon the God\nwithout just reason. And He, when he learned what they had done, was\nexceeding wroth and cursed them, dooming them to sorrow and to the service\nof other men so long as the sun and moon should endure. Thus the Chitpavans\ngained their Brahmanhood, but lost their right to superiority in that they\nflouted the promise of their God.\n\nSuch are the legends, popular and Puranic, of the coming of the Chitpavans\nto Western India. That some historic truth lies below the garbled tale of\nshipwreck and resurrection is partly proved by the physical traits of their\ndescendants,--of those men, in fact, whose immediate ancestors, employed at\nfirst as messengers or spies of Maratha chieftains, by innate cleverness,\ntact, and faculty for management gradually welded together the loose\nMaratha confederacy and became directors of the internal and external\npolitics of the Peshwa's dominions. For to this day the true Chitpavan\nperserves the fair skin, the strange grey eyes, the aspect of refined\nstrength and intelligence, which must have characterized the shipwrecked\nmariners of old fable and marked them out in later years as strangers in a\nstrange land. But whence came they, these foreign immigrants, who after\nlong sojourn in the country of their adoption moved upwards to the Deccan\nand stood within the shadow of the Peshwa's throne? Much has been written\nof their origin, much that is but empty theory: but, as 'Historicus' has\nremarked in the columns of a local journal, the lesson to be learned from\ntheir home dialect and from their strange surnames,--Gogte, Lele, Karve,\nGadre, Hingne and so on,--is that the Chitpavan Brahmans of Western India\ncame in legendary ages from Gedrosia, Kirman and the Makran coast, and that\nprior to their domicile in those latitudes they probably formed part of the\npopulation of ancient Egypt or Africa. That they were once a seafaring and\nfishing people is proved by the large number of words of oceanic origin\nwhich still characterize their home-speech, while according to the\nauthority above mentioned the \"Chandrakant\" which they recognize is not the\nsweating crystal of Northern India and ancient Sanskrit lore, but a fossil\ncoral found upon the Makran coast. Forty years ago Rao Saheb V. N. Mandlik\nremarked that \"the ancestors of the tribe probably came by ships either\nfrom some other port in India or from the opposite coast of Africa;\" and in\nthese later days his theory is corroborated by General Haig, who traces\nthem back to the great marts on the Indus and thence still further back to\nthe Persian Gulf and Egypt. Why or at what date they left the famous\ncountry of the Pharaohs, none can say: but that these white-skinned\nBrahmans are descendants of such people as the Berbers, who belonged of\nright to the European races, seems the most plausible theory of their\norigin yet put forward, and serves as an additional proof of the enormous\ninfluence exercised upon posterity by the famous country of the Nile.\n\nThus perhaps the legend of storm and shipwreck is not false, but records in\npoetic diction the arrival on these shores of men who presumably had in\nsome degree inherited the genius of the most famous and most civilized\ncountry of prehistoric ages, and who had by long trafficking in dangerous\nwaters and by the hardships of long migration acquired that self-reliance\nand love of mastery which has been bequeathed almost unchanged to their\nBrahmanised descendants. The Chitpavans were indeed the children of the\nstorm, and something of the spirit of the storm lives in them still. Some\ntrace is theirs of the old obstinacy which taught those pale ancestors to\nfight against insuperable forces until they were cast naked and broken upon\nthe seashore. And peradventure the secret lesson of the ancient folk-tale\nis this, that the God of the Axe, despite the curse, is still at hand to\nhelp them along the path to new birth, provided always that their cause is\nfair, that they invoke not his aid for trivial or unjust ends, and that\nthey have been truly purified in the pyres of affliction.\n\n\n\n\nXV.\n\nNUR JAN.\n\n  \"The singer only sang the Joy of Life,\n    For all too well, alas! the singer knew,\n  How hard the daily toil, how keen the strife,\n    How salt the falling tear, the joys how few.\"\n\n\n\"Nay, Saheb, I accept no money for my songs from you and your friend; for\nyou have taken a kindly interest in me and my past history, and have shewn\nme the respect which my birth warrants, but which alas! my occupation hath\nmade forfeit in the eyes of the world. But,--if you have found satisfaction\nin my singing, then write somewhat of me and of my Mimi to the paper, even\nas you did of Imtiazan, that thus your people--the people who know not the\ninner life of India may learn that I was not born amid the saringis and the\nbells, and that I, the singer, hide within my heart a life-long regret.\"\n\n[Illustration: Nur Jan.]\n\nSo she spake, seated on the clean white floor-cloth of the brightly-lighted\n\"diwankhana,\" like some delicate flower cradled on a crystal lake. We had\nseen her once before at the house of an Indian friend, who had hospitably\ninvited a company to witness her songs and dances; we had heard her chant\nthe subtle melodies of Hindustan and even old English roundelays\nfor the special delectation of the English guests; we had remarked her\ndelicate hands, the great dark eyes, the dainty profile, the little ivory\nfeet, and above all the gentle voice and courteous bearing; and we realized\nthat Nur Jan had not been bred to this uncurtained life, but must once have\nknown the care, affection and the gentle training of a patrician home.\n\nBy what caprice of evil fortune had she come to this, hiring out her voice\nand her nimble feet to enhance the pleasure of a chance entertainment, far\nfrom her own people and from her northern Indian home? What secret lay in\nthe song of the frail maiden on the banks of the Jamna, in the earnest\nrequest she made to us not to mention the name of dead Royalty before her\nattendant-musicians? The mystery remained unsolved for that evening; and it\nwas not till some weeks later that the chances of an official enquiry\nbrought us face to face again. But this time the ill-starred dancing-skirt\nand bells had been locked away; and in their stead we saw the silken\njacket, the spangled pale-blue sari, covered by a diaphanous black veil,\nlike a thin cloud half-veiling the summer heavens, the necklace of pearls\nround the olive pillar of her throat, and above them the calm face and the\nwealth of dark hair that scorned all artificial adornment. There she sat in\nher own house, singing to two rich Arabs and a subordinate agent of one of\nthe greatest rulers of Asia, while behind her Mimi, aged two years,--the\nlegacy of a dead affection, crooned and tried to clap her small hands in\nrythm with her mother's song. And in the pauses of her singing, while the\nmusicians tightened their bows and the silver \"pan-box\" was passed round to\nher Indian-guests, she lifted a little way, a very little way the curtain\nof the past.\n\n\"Yea, Saheb, you have rightly spoken. I come of a good family, and as a\nchild I was sent to school in Calcutta and learned your English tongue.\nWhen I grew to girlhood I determined to study medicine and serve the women\nof my faith as a doctor. But barely had I commenced the preliminary lessons\nof compounding when the trouble came upon our house, and my sister and I\nwere brought away from the old home to Bombay and bidden to find the\nwherewithal to support those to whom we owed respect and affection. Saheb,\nwith us the word of near relations is law, and their support a sacred duty.\nWhat could we, gently-bred Mahomedan girls, do in a strange city? We had\nalways liked singing and had taken lessons in our home; and it seemed that\nherein lay the only chance of supporting ourselves and others. Therefore,\nnot without hesitation, not without tears, we bade adieu to the 'pardah' of\nour people and cast the pearls of our singing before the public. Thus has\nit been since that day. My sister by good-hap has married well and regained\nthe shelter of the curtain: but I am still unwed and must sing until the\nend comes.\"\n\n\"How can I seek help of my grandsire? Have I not disgraced his name by\nadopting this life? And were I mean enough to ask his favour, would he not\nfirst insist that I become once more 'pardahnashin'? I cannot live again\nbehind the screen, for too long have I been independent. The filly that has\nonce run free cares not afterwards for the stall and bridle. It has been an\nevil mistake, Saheb, but one not of my making. I sometimes loathe the\nlights, the tinsel, the bells, aye even the old songs; for they remind me\nof what I might have been, but for another's fault, and, of what I am. You\nask of Mimi's future? So long as I live, she never shall play a part in\nthis work. Mated with a good man of mine own faith she will never know\nregret. That is my great wish, Saheb. The issue lies with Allah.\"\n\nSo the tale ran on with its accompaniment of song, its suggestion of\nregret. Once in the middle of a ballad a funeral passes in the street\nbelow. The mourner's chant sounds above the bourdon of the tom-tom, the\nwail of the saringis. \"Hush, hush\" cries Nur Jan, \"let the dead pass in\npeace. It is not meet that the song of the dancing-girl should be heard\nupon the final journey.\" One more refrain, one more question on\n\n### Summary:\n\n"}

Mrs. Blatch's aim is to stir the\nwomen of this country to the knowledge that this is their war, and also\nto make all our people feel that we, and especially our government,\nshould welcome the service of women, and make use of it to the utmost.\nIn other words, the appeal of Mrs. Blatch is essentially an appeal for\nservice. No one has more vividly realized that service benefits the one\nwho serves precisely as it benefits the one who is served. I join with\nher in the appeal that the women shall back the men with service, and\nthat the men in their turn shall frankly and eagerly welcome the\nrendering of such service _on the basis of service by equals for a\ncommon end_.\n\nMrs. Blatch makes her appeal primarily because of the war needs of the\nmoment. But she has in view no less the great tasks of the future. I\nwelcome her book as an answer to the cry that the admission of women to\nan equal share in the right of self government will tend to soften the\nbody politic. Most certainly I will ever set my face like flint against\nany unhealthy softening of our civilization, and as an answer in advance\nto hyper-criticism I explain that I do not mean softness in the sense of\ntender-heartedness; I mean the softness which, extends to the head and\nto the moral fibre, I mean the softness which manifests itself either in\nunhealthy sentimentality or in a materialism which may be either\nthoughtless and pleasure-loving or sordid and money-getting. I believe\nthat the best women, when thoroughly aroused, and when the right appeal\nis made to them, will offer our surest means of resisting this unhealthy\nsoftening.\n\nNo man who is not blind can fail to see that we have entered a new day\nin the great epic march of the ages. For good or for evil the old days\nhave passed; and it rests with us, the men and women now alive, to\ndecide whether in the new days the world is to be a better or a worse\nplace to live in, for our descendants.\n\nIn this new world women are to stand on an equal footing with men, in\nways and to an extent never hitherto dreamed of. In this country they\nare on the eve of securing, and in much of the country have already\nsecured, their full political rights. It is imperative that they should\nunderstand, exactly as it is imperative that men should understand, that\nsuch rights are of worse than no avail, unless the will for the\nperformance of duty goes hand in hand with the acquirement of the\nprivilege.\n\nIf the women in this country reinforce the elements that tend to a\nsoftening of the moral fibre, to a weakening of the will, and\nunwillingness to look ahead or to face hardship and labor and danger for\na high ideal--then all of us alike, men and women, will suffer. But if\nthey show, under the new conditions, the will to develop strength, and\nthe high idealism and the iron resolution which under less favorable\ncircumstances were shown by the women of the Revolution and of the Civil\nWar, then our nation has before it a career of greatness never hitherto\nequaled. This book is fundamentally an appeal, not that woman shall\nenjoy any privilege unearned, but that hers shall be the right to do\nmore than she has ever yet done, and to do it on terms of\nself-respecting partnership with men. Equality of right does not mean\nidentity of function; but it does necessarily imply identity of purpose\nin the performance of duty.\n\nMrs. Blatch shows why every woman who inherits the womanly virtues of\nthe past, and who has grasped the ideal of the added womanly virtues of\nthe present and the future, should support this war with all her\nstrength and soul. She testifies from personal knowledge to the hideous\nbrutalities shown toward women and children by the Germany of to-day;\nand she adds the fine sentence: \"Women fight for a place in the sun for\nthose who hold right above might.\"\n\nShe shows why women must unstintedly give their labor in order to win\nthis war; and why the labor of the women must be used to back up both\nthe labor and the fighting work of the men, for the fighting men leave\ngaps in the labor world which must be filled by the work of women. She\nsays in another sentence worth remembering, \"The man behind the counter\nshould of course be moved to a muscular employment; but we must not\ninterpret his dalliance with tapes and ribbons as a proof of a\nsuperfluity of men.\"\n\nParticularly valuable is her description of the mobilization of women in\nGreat Britain and France. From these facts she draws the conclusion as\nto America's needs along this very line. She paints as vividly as I have\never known painted, the truth as to why it is a merit that women should\nbe forced to work, a merit that _every one_ should be forced to work! It\nis just as good for women as for men that they should have to use body\nand mind, that they should not be idlers. As she puts it, \"Active\nmothers insure a virile race. The peaceful nation, if its women fall\nvictims to the luxury which rapidly increasing wealth brings, will\ndecay.\" \"Man power must give itself unreservedly at the front. Woman\npower must show not only eagerness but fitness to substitute for\nman power.\"\n\nI commend especially the chapter containing the sentence, \"This war may\nprove to us the wisdom and economy of devoting public funds to mothers\nrather than to creches and juvenile asylums;\" and also the chapter in\nwhich the author tells women that if they are merely looking for a soft\nplace in life their collective demand for a fair field and no favor will\nbe wholly ineffective. The doors for service now stand open, and it\nrests with the women themselves to say whether they will enter in!\n\nThe last chapter is itself an unconscious justification of woman's right\nto a share in the great governmental decisions which to-day are vital.\nNo statesman or publicist could set forth more clearly than Mrs. Blatch\nthe need of winning this war, in order to prevent either endless and\nruinous wars in the future, or else a world despotism which would mean\nthe atrophy of everything that really tends to the elevation of mankind.\n\nMrs. Blatch has herself rendered a very real service by this appeal that\nwomen should serve, and that men should let them serve.\n\nTheodore Roosevelt\n\n\n\n\nI\n\nOUR FOE\n\n\nThe nations in which women have influenced national aims face the nation\nthat glorifies brute force. America opposes the exaltation of the\nglittering sword; opposes the determination of one nation to dominate\nthe world; opposes the claim that the head of one ruling family is the\ndirect and only representative of the Creator; and, above all, America\nopposes the idea that might makes right.\n\nLet us admit the full weight of the paradox that a people in the name of\npeace turns to force of arms. The tragedy for us lay in there being no\nchoice of ways, since pacific groups had failed to create machinery to\nadjust vital international differences, and since the Allies each in\nturn, we the last, had been struck by a foe determined to settle\ndisagreements by force.\n\nNever did a nation make a crusade more just than this of ours. We were\npatient, too long patient, perhaps, with challenges. We seek no\nconquest. We fight to protect the freedom of our citizens. On America's\nstandard is written democracy, on that of Germany autocracy. Without\nreservation women can give their all to attain our end.\n\nThere may be a cleavage between the German people and the ruling class.\nIt may be that our foe is merely the military caste, though I am\ninclined to believe that we have the entire German nation on our hands.\nThe supremacy of might may be a doctrine merely instilled in the minds\nof the people by its rulers. Perhaps the weed is not indigenous, but it\nflourishes, nevertheless. Rabbits did not belong in Australia, nor\npondweed in England, but there they are, and dominating the situation.\nArrogance of the strong towards the weak, of the better placed towards\nthe less well placed, is part of the government teaching in Germany. The\npeasant woman harries the dog that strains at the market cart, her\nhusband harries her as she helps the cow drag the plough, the petty\nofficer harries the peasant when he is a raw recruit, and the young\nlieutenant harries the petty officer, and so it goes up to the\nhighest,--a well-planned system on the part of the superior to bring the\ninferior to a high point of material efficiency. The propelling spirit\nis devotion to the Fatherland: each believes himself a cog in the\nmachine chosen of God to achieve His purposes on earth. The world hears\nof the Kaiser's \"Ich und Gott,\" of his mailed fist beating down his\nenemies, but those who have lived in Germany know that exactly the same\nspirit reigns in every class. The strong in chastizing his inferior has\nthe conviction that since might makes right he is the direct\nrepresentative of Deity on the particular occasion.\n\nThe overbearing spirit of the Prussian military caste has drilled a race\nto worship might; men are overbearing towards women, women towards\nchildren, and the laws reflect the cruelties of the strong towards\nthe weak.\n\nAs the recent petition of German suffragists to the Reichstag states,\ntheir country stands \"in the lowest rank of nations as regards women's\nrights.\" It is a platitude just now worth repeating that the\ncivilization of a people is indicated by the position accorded to its\nwomen. On that head, then, the Teutonic Kultur stands challenged.\n\nAn English friend of mine threw down the gauntlet thirty years ago. She\nhad married a German officer. After living at army posts all over the\nEmpire, she declared, \"What we foreigners take as simple childlikeness\nin the Germans is merely lack of civilization.\" This keen analysis came\nfrom a woman trained as an investigator, and equipped with perfect\ncommand of the language of her adopted country.\n\n\"Lack of civilization,\"--perhaps that explains my having seen again and\nagain officers striking the soldiers they were drilling, and journeys\nmade torture through witnessing slapping and brow-beating of children by\ntheir parents. The memory of a father's conduct towards his little son\nwill never be wiped out. He twisted the child's arm, struck him savagely\nfrom time to time, and for no reason but that the child did not sit bolt\nupright and keep absolutely motionless. The witnesses of the brutality\nsmiled approvingly at the man, and scowled at the child. My own protest\nbeing met with amazed silence and in no way regarded, I left the\ncompartment. I was near Eisenach, and I wished some good fairy would put\nin my hand that inkpot which Luther threw at the devil. Severity towards\nchildren is the rule. The child for weal or woe is in the complete\ncontrol of its parents, and corporal punishment is allowed in the\nschools. The grim saying, \"Saure Wochen, frohe Feste,\" seems to express\nthe pedagogic philosophy. The only trouble is that nature does not give\nthis attitude her sanction, for Germany reveals to us that figure, the\nmost pathetic in life, the child suicide.\n\nThe man responding to his stern upbringing is in turn cruel to his\ninferiors, and full of subterfuge in dealing with equals. He is at home\nin the intrigues which have startled the world. In such a society the\nfrank and gentle go to the wall, or--get into trouble and emigrate. We\nhave profited--let us not forget it--by the plucky German immigrants who\nthrew off the yoke, and who now have the satisfaction of finding\nthemselves fighting shoulder to shoulder with the men of their adopted\ncountry to free the Fatherland of the taskmaster.\n\nThe philosophy of might quite naturally reflects itself in the education\nof girls. Once when I visited a Hoehere Toechter Schule, the principal had\na class in geometry recite for my edification. I soon saw that the young\ngirl who had been chosen as the star pupil to wrestle with the pons\nasinorum was giving an exhibition of memorizing and not of mathematical\nreasoning. I asked the principal if my surmise were correct. He replied\nwithout hesitation, \"Yes, it was entirely a feat in memory. Females have\nonly low reasoning power.\" I urged that if this were so, it would be\nwell to train the faculty, but he countered with the assertion, \"We\nGermans do not think so. Women are happier and more useful\nwithout logic.\"\n\nIt would be difficult to surpass in its subtle cruelty the etiquette at\na military function. The lieutenant and his wife come early,--this is\nexpected of them. For a few moments they play the role of honored\nguests. The wife is shown by her hostess to the sofa and is seated there\nas a mark of distinction. Then arrive the captain and his wife. They are\nimmediately the distinguished guests. The wife is shown to the sofa and\nthe lieutenant's little Frau must get herself out of the way as best\nshe can.\n\nMy speculation, often indulged in, as to what would happen if the\nmajor's wife did not move from the sofa when the colonel's wife\nappeared, ended in assurance that a severe punishment would be meted out\nto her, when I heard from an officer the story of the way his regiment\ndealt with a woman who ignored another bit of military etiquette. A\ndebutant, once honored by being asked to dance with an officer at a\nball, must never, it seems, demean herself by accepting a civilian\npartner. But in a town where my friend's regiment was stationed a very\npretty and popular young girl who had been taken, so to speak, to the\nbosom of the regiment, danced one night at the Kurhaus early in the\nsummer season with a civilian, distinguished, undeniably, but\nunmistakably civilian. The officers of the regiment met, weighed the\nmighty question of the girl's offense, and solemnly resolved never again\nto ask the culprit for a dance. I protested at the cruelty of a body of\nmen deliberately turning a pretty young thing into a wall-flower for an\nentire season. The officer took my protest as an added reason for\ncongratulation upon their conduct. They meant to be cruel. My words\nproved how well they had succeeded.\n\nAnother little straw showing the set of the wind: we were sitting, four\nAmericans, one lovely early summer day, in a restaurant at Swinemuende.\nWe had the window open, looking out over the sea. At the next table were\nsome officers, one of whom with an \"Es zieht,\" but not with a \"by your\nleave,\" came over to our table and shut the window with a bang. The\ngentleman with us asked if we wanted the window closed, and on being\nassured we did not, quietly rose and opened it again. No one who does\nnot know Prussia can imagine the threatening atmosphere which filled\nthat cafe.\n\nWe met the officers the same night at the Kurhaus dance. They were\nintroduced, and almost immediately one of them brought up the window\nincident and said most impressively that if ladies had not been at the\ntable, our escort would have been \"called out.\" We could see they\nregarded us as unworthy of being even transient participants of Kultur\nwhen we opined that no American man would accept a challenge, and if so\nunwise as to do so, his womenfolk would lock him up until he reached a\nsounder judgment! The swords rattled in their sabres when the frivolous\nmember of our party said with a tone of finality, \"You see we wouldn't\nlike our men's faces to look as if they had got into their mothers'\nchopping bowls!\"\n\nAlthough I had often lived months on end with all these petty tyrannies\nof the mailed fist, and although life had taught me later that peoples\ngrow by what they feed upon, yet when I read the Bryce report,[1] German\nfrightfulness seemed too inhuman for belief. While still holding my\njudgment in reserve, I met an intimate friend, a Prussian officer. He\nhappened to mention letters he had received from his relatives in Berlin\nand at the front, and when I expressed a wish to hear them, kindly asked\nwhether he should translate them or read them in German as they stood.\nLaughingly I ventured on the German, saying I would at least find out\nhow much I had forgotten. So I sat and listened with ears pricked up.\nSome of the letters were from women folk and told of war conditions in\nthe capital. They were interesting at the time but not worth repeating\nnow. Then came a letter from a nephew, a lieutenant. He gave his\nexperience in crossing Belgium, told how in one village his men asked a\nyoung woman with her tiny baby on her arm for water, how she answered\nresentfully, and then, how he shot her--and her baby. I exclaimed,\nthinking I had lost the thread of the letter, \"Not the baby?\" And the\nman I supposed I knew as civilized, replied with a cruel smile,\n\"Yes--discipline!\" That was frank, frank as a child would have been,\nwith no realization of the self-revelation of it. The young officer did\nthe deed, wrote of it to his uncle, and the uncle, without vision and\nunderstanding, perverted by his training, did not feel shame and bury\nthe secret in his own heart, but treasured the evidence against his own\nnephew, and laid it open before an American woman.\n\nI believed the Bryce report--every word of it!\n\nAnd I hate the system that has so bent and crippled a great race.\nRevenge we must not feel, that would be to innoculate ourselves with the\nenemy's virus. But let us be awake to the fact that might making right\ncuts athwart our ideals. German Kultur, through worship of efficiency,\ncramps originality and initiative, while our aim--why not be frank about\nit!--is the protection of inefficiency, which means sympathy with\nchildhood, and opportunity for the spirit of art. German Kultur fixes an\ninflexible limit to the aspirations of women, while our goal is complete\nfreedom for the mothers of men.\n\nThe women of the Allies can fight for all that their men fight for--for\nnational self-respect, for protection of citizens, for the sacredness of\ninternational agreements, for the rights of small nations, for the\nsecurity of democracy, and then our women can be inspired by one thing\nmore--the safety and development of all those things which they have\nwon for human welfare in a long and bloodless battle.\n\nWomen fight for a place in the sun for those who hold right above might.\n\n\n[Footnote 1: Report of the Committee on Alleged German Outrages\nappointed by his Britannic Majesty's Government, 1915.

Whether\nit is food or big guns that are wanted, ships or coal, we can only get\nour heart's desire by toil. Where are the workers who will win the war?\n\nWe are a bit spoiled in the United States. We have been accustomed to\nrub our Aladdin's lamp of opportunity and the good genii have sent us\nworkers. But suddenly, no matter how great our efforts, no one answers\nour appeal. The reservoir of immigrant labor has run dry. We are in\nsorry plight, for we have suffered from emigration, too. Thousands of\nalien workers have been called back to serve in the armies of the\nAllies. In my own little village on Long Island the industrious Italian\ncolony was broken up by the call to return to the colors in Piedmont.\n\nThen, too, while Europe suffers loss of labor, as do we, when men are\nmobilized, our situation is peculiarly poignant, for when our armies are\ngone they are gone. At first this was true in Europe. Men entered the\narmy and were employed as soldiers only. After a time it was realized\nthat the war would not be short, that fields must not lie untilled for\nyears, nor men undergo the deteriorating effects of trench warfare\ncontinuously. The fallow field and the stale soldier were\nbrought together.\n\nWe have all chanced on photographs of European soldiers helping the\nwomen plough in springtime, and reap the harvest in the autumn. Perhaps\nwe have regarded the scene as a mere pastoral episode in a happy leave\nfrom the battle front, instead of realizing that it is a snapshot\nillustrating a well organized plan of securing labor. The soldiers are\ngiven a furlough and are sent where the agricultural need is pressing.\nBut the American soldier will not be able to lend his skill in giving\nthe home fields a rich seed time and harvest. The two needs, the field\nfor the touch of the human hand, and the soldier for labor under calm\nskies, cannot in our case be cooerdinated.\n\nScarcity of labor is not only certain to grow, but the demands upon the\nUnited States for service are increasing by leaps and bounds. America\nmust throw man-power into the trenches, must feed herself, must\ncontribute more and ever more food to the hungry populations of Europe,\nmust meet the old industrial obligations, and respond to a whole range\nof new business requirements. And she is called upon for this effort at\na time when national prosperity is already making full use of man-power.\n\nWhen Europe went to war, the world had been suffering from depression a\nyear and more. Immediately on the outbreak of hostilities whole lines of\nbusiness shut down. Unemployment became serious. There were idle hands\neverywhere. Germany, of all the belligerents, rallied most quickly to\nmeet war conditions. Unemployment gave place to a shortage of labor\nsooner there than elsewhere. Great Britain did not begin to get the pace\nuntil the middle of 1915.\n\nThe business situation in the United States upon its entrance into the\nwar was the antithesis of this. For over a year, depression had been\nsuperseded by increased industry, high wages, and greater demand for\nlabor. The country as measured by the ordinary financial signs, by its\ncommerce, by its labor market, was more prosperous than it had been for\nyears. Tremendous requisitions were being made upon us by Europe, and to\nthe limit of available labor we were answering them. Then into our\neconomic life, with industrial forces already working at high pressure,\nwere injected the new demands arising from changing the United States\nfrom a people as unprepared for effective hostilities as a baby in its\ncradle, into a nation equipped for war. There was no unemployment, but\non the contrary, shortage of labor.\n\nThe country calls for everything, and all at once, like the spoiled\nchild on suddenly waking. It must have, and without delay, ships, coal,\ncars, cantonments, uniforms, rules, and food, food, food. How can the\nneeds be supplied and with a million and a half of men dropping work\nbesides? By woman-power or coolie labor. Those are the horns of the\ndilemma presented to puzzled America. The Senate of the United States\ndirects its Committee of Agriculture to ponder well the coolie problem,\nfor men hesitate to have women put their shoulder to the wheel. Trade\nunionists are right in urging that a republic has no place for a\ndisfranchised class of imported toilers. Equally true is it that as a\nnation we have shown no gift for dealing with less developed races. And\nyet labor we must have. Will American women supply it, will they, loving\nease, favor contract labor from the outside, or will they accept the\noptimistic view that lack of labor is not acute?\n\nThe procrastinator queries, \"Cannot American man-power meet the demand?\"\nIt can, for a time perhaps, if the draft for the army goes as slowly in\nthe future as it has in the past.\n\nHowever, at any moment a full realization may come to us of the\nsignificance of the fact that while the United States is putting only\nthree percent of its workers into the fighting forces, Great Britain has\nput twenty-five percent, and is now combing its industrial army over to\nfind an additional five hundred thousand men to throw on the French\nfront. It is probable that it will be felt by this country in the near\nfuture that such a contrast of fulfillment of obligation cannot continue\nwithout serious reflection on our national honor. Roughly speaking,\nGreat Britain has twenty million persons in gainful pursuits. Of these,\nfive million have already been taken for the army. The contribution of\nFrance is still greater. Her military force has reached the appalling\nproportion of one-fifth of her entire population. But we who have\nthirty-five million in gainful occupations are giving a paltry one\nmillion, five hundred thousand in service with our Allies. The situation\nis not creditable to us, and one of the things which stands in the way\nof the United States reaching a more worthy position is reluctance to\nsee its women shouldering economic burdens.\n\n[Illustration: They wear the uniforms of the Edinburgh trams and the\nNew York City subway and trolley guards, with pride and purpose.]\n\nWhile it is quite true that shifting of man-power is needed, mere\nshuffling of the cards, as labor leaders suggest, won't give a bigger\npack. Fifty-two cards it remains, though the Jack may be put into a more\nsuitable position. The man behind the counter should of course be moved\nto a muscular employment, but we must not interpret his dalliance with\ntapes and ribbons as proof of a superfluity of men.\n\nThe latest reports of the New York State Department of Labor reflect the\nmeagerness of the supply. Here are some dull figures to prove\nit:--comparing the situation with a year ago, we find in a corresponding\nmonth, only one percent more employees this year, with a wage advance of\nseventeen percent. Drawing the comparison between this year and two\nyears ago, there is an advance of \"fifteen percent in employees and\nfifty-one percent in wages;\" and an increase of \"thirty percent in\nemployees and eighty-seven percent in wages,\" if this year is compared\nwith the conditions when the world was suffering from industrial\ndepression. The State employment offices report eight thousand three\nhundred and seventy-six requests for workers against seven thousand, six\nhundred and fifty applicants for employment, and of the latter only\nseventy-three percent were fitted for the grades of work open to them,\nand were placed in situations.\n\nThe last records of conditions in the Wilkes-Barre coal regions confirm\nthe fact of labor scarcity. There are one hundred and fifty-two thousand\nmen and boys at work today in the anthracite fields, twenty-five\nthousand less than the number employed in 1916. These miners, owing to\nthe <DW8> of the highest wages ever received--the skilled man earning\nfrom forty dollars to seventy-five dollars a week--and to appeals to\ntheir patriotism, are individually producing a larger output than ever\nbefore. It is considered that production, with the present labor force,\nis at its maximum, and if a yield of coal commensurate with the world's\nneed is to be attained, at least seventy percent more men must\nbe supplied.\n\nThis is a call for man-power in addition to that suggested by the Fuel\nAdministrator to the effect that lack of coal is partly lack of cars and\nthat \"back of the transportation shortage lies labor shortage.\" An order\nwas sent out by the Director General of Railways, soon after his\nappointment, that mechanics from the repair shops of the west were to be\nshifted to the east to supply the call for help on the Atlantic border.\n\nSuggestive of the cause of all this shortage, float the service flags of\nthe mining and railway companies, the hundreds of glowing stars telling\ntheir tale of men gone to the front, and of just so many stars torn from\nthe standards of the industrial army at home.\n\nThe Shipping Board recently called for two hundred and fifty thousand\nmen to be gradually recruited as a skilled army for work in shipyards.\nAt the same time the Congress passed an appropriation of fifty million\ndollars for building houses to accommodate ship labor. Six months ago\nonly fifty thousand men were employed in ship-building, today there are\none hundred and forty-five thousand. This rapid drawing of men to new\ncenters creates a housing problem so huge that it must he met by the\ngovernment; and it need hardly be pointed out, shelter can be built only\nby human hands.\n\nOne state official, prompted no doubt by a wise hostility to coolie\nlabor, and dread of woman labor, has gone so far as to declare publicly\nthat any employer who will pay \"adequate wages can get all the labor he\nrequires.\" This view suggests that we may soon have to adopt the methods\nof other belligerents and stop employers by law from stealing a\nneighbor's working force. I know of a shipyard with a normal pay-roll of\nfive hundred hands, which in one year engaged and lost to nearby\nmunition factories thirteen thousand laborers. Such \"shifting,\" hiding\nas it does shortage of manpower, leads to serious loss in our productive\nefficiency and should not be allowed to go unchecked.\n\nThe manager of one of the New York City street railways met with\ncomplete denial the easy optimism that adequate remuneration will\ncommand a sufficient supply of men. He told me that he had introduced\nwomen at the same wage as male conductors, not because he wanted women,\nbut because he now had only five applications by fit men to thirty or\nforty formerly. There were men to be had, he said, and at lower wages\nthan his company was paying; but they were \"not of the class capable of\nfulfilling the requirements of the position.\"\n\nThe Labor Administration announced on its creation that its \"policy\nwould be to prevent woman labor in positions for which men are\navailable,\" and one of the deputy commissioners of the Industrial\nCommission of the State of New York declared quite frankly at a labor\nconference that \"if he could, he would exclude women from industry\naltogether.\"\n\nWe may try to prevent the oncoming tide of the economic independence of\nwomen, but it will not be possible to force the business world to accept\npermanently the service of the inefficient in place of that of the alert\nand intelligent. To carry on the economic life of a nation with its\nlabor flotsam and jetsam is loss at any time; in time of storm and\nstress it is suicide.\n\nMan-power is short, seriously so. The farm is always the best barometer\nto give warning of scarcity of labor. The land has been drained of its\nworkers. A fair wage would keep them on the farm--this is the philosophy\nof laissez faire. Without stopping to inquire as to what the munition\nworks would then do, we can still see that it is doubtful whether the\nfarm can act as magnet. Even men, let us venture the suggestion, like\nchange for the mere sake of change. A middle-aged man, who had taken up\nwork at Bridgeport, said to me, \"I've mulled around on the farm all my\ndays. I grabbed the first chance to get away.\" And then there's a finer\nspirit prompting the desertion of the hoe. A man of thirty-three gave me\nthe point of view. \"My brother is 'over there,' and I feel as if I were\nbacking him up by making guns.\"\n\nThe only thing that can change the idea that farming is \"mulling\naround,\" and making a gun \"backs up\" the man at the front more\nthoroughly than raising turnips, is to bring to the farm new workers who\nrealize the vital part played by food in the winning of the war. As the\nmodern industrial system has developed with its marvels of specialized\nmachinery, its army of employees gathered and dispersed on the stroke of\nthe clock, and strong organizations created to protect the interests of\nthe worker, the calm and quiet processes of agriculture have in\ncomparison grown colorless. The average farmhand has never found push\nand drive and group action on the farm, but only individualism to the\nextreme of isolation. And now in war time, when in addition to its usual\nlife of stirring contacts, the factory takes on an intimate and striking\nrelation to the intense experience of the battle front, the work of the\nfarm seems as flat as it is likely to be unprofitable. The man in the\nfurrow has no idea that he is \"backing up\" the boy in the trench.\n\nThe farmer in his turn does not find himself part of the wider relations\nthat attract and support the manufacturer. Crops are not grown on order.\nThe marketing is as uncertain as the weather. The farmer could by higher\nwages attract more labor, but as the selling of the harvest remains a\nhaphazard matter, the venture might mean ruin all the more certain and\nserious were wage outlay large. In response to a call for food and an\nappeal to his patriotism, the farmer has repeatedly made unusual efforts\nto bring his land to the maximum fertility, only to find his crops often\na dead loss, as he could not secure the labor to harvest them. I saw,\none summer, acres of garden truck at its prime ploughed under in\nConnecticut because of a shortage of labor. I saw fruit left rotting by\nthe bushel in the orchards near Rochester because of scarcity of pickers\nand a doubt of the reliability of the market. The industry which means\nmore than any other to the well-being of humanity at this crisis, is the\nsport of methods outgrown and of servants who lack understanding and\ninspiration. The war may furnish the spark for the needed revolution.\nMan-power is not available, woman-power is at hand. A new labor force\nalways brings ideas and ideals peculiar to itself. May not women as\nfresh recruits in a land army stamp their likes and dislikes on farm\nlife? Their enthusiasm may put staleness to rout, and the group system\nof women land workers, already tested in the crucible of experience, may\nbring to the farm the needed antidote to isolation.\n\nTo win the war we must have man-power in the trenches sufficient to win\nit with. To win, every soldier, every sailor, must be well fed, well\nclothed, well equipped. To win, behind the armed forces must stand\ndetermined peoples. To win, the people of America and her Allies must be\nheartened by care and food.\n\nThe sun shines on the fertile land, the earth teems with forests, with\ncoal, with every necessary mineral and food, but labor, labor alone can\ntransform all to meet our necessities. Man-power unaided cannot supply\nthe demand. Women in America must shoulder as nobly as have the women of\nEurope, this duty. They must answer their country's call. Let them see\nclearly that the desire of their men to shield them from possible injury\nexposes the nation and the world to actual danger.\n\nOur winning of the war depends upon the full use of the energy of our\nentire people. Every muscle, every brain, must be mobilized if the\nnational aim is to be achieved.\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\nMOBILIZING WOMEN IN GREAT BRITAIN [2]\n\n\nIn no country have women reached a mobilization so complete and\nsystematized as in Great Britain. This mobilization covers the whole\nfield of war service--in industry, business and professional life, and\nin government administration. Women serve on the Ministry of Food and\nare included in the membership of twenty-five of the important\ngovernment committees, not auxiliary or advisory, but administrative\ncommittees, such as those on War Pensions, on Disabled Officers and Men,\non Education after the War, and the Labor Commission to Deal with\nIndustrial Unrest.\n\nIn short, the women of Great Britain are working side by side with men\nin the initiation and execution of plans to solve the problems which\nconfront the nation.\n\nFour committees, as for instance those making investigations and\nrecommendations on Women's Wages and Drink Among Women, are entirely\ncomposed of women, and great departments, such as the Women's Land Army,\nthe Women's Army Auxiliary Corps, are officered throughout by them.\nHospitals under the War Office have been placed in complete control of\nmedical women; they take rank with medical men in the army and receive\nthe pay going with their commissions.\n\nWhen Great Britain recognized that the war could not be won by merely\nsending splendid fighters to the front and meeting the wastage by steady\ndrafts upon the manhood of the country, she began to build an efficient\norganization of industry at home.\n\nTo the call for labor-power British women gave instant response. In\nmunitions a million are mobilized, in the Land Army there have been\ndrafted and actually placed on the farms over three hundred thousand,\nand in the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps fourteen thousand women are\nworking in direct connection with the fighting force, and an additional\nten thousand are being called out for service each month. In the\nclerical force of the government departments, some of which had never\nseen women before in their sacred precincts, over one hundred and\nninety-eight thousand are now working. And the women civil servants are\nnot only engaged in indoor service, but outside too, most of the\ncarrying of mail being in their hands.\n\nWomen are dock-laborers, some seven thousand strong. Four thousand act\nas patrols and police, forty thousand are in banks and various financial\nhouses. It is said that there are in Great Britain scarce a million\nwomen--and they are mostly occupied as housewives--who could render\ngreater service to their country than that which they are now giving.\n\nThe wide inclusion of women in government administration is very\nstriking to us in America. But we must not forget that the contrast\nbetween the two countries in the participation of women in political\nlife and public service has always been great. The women of the United\nKingdom have enjoyed the municipal and county franchise for years. For a\nlong time large numbers of women have been called to administrative\npositions. They have had thorough training in government as Poor Law\nGuardians, District and County Councilors, members of School Boards. No\nwomen, the whole world over, are equipped as those of Great Britain for\nservice to the state.\n\nIn the glamor of the extremely striking government service of British\nwomen, we must not overlook their non-official organizations. Perhaps\nthese offer the most valuable suggestions for America. They are near\nenough to our experience to be quite understandable.\n\nThe mother country is not under regimentation. Originality and\ninitiative have full play. Perhaps it was well that the government\nfailed to appreciate what women could do, and neglected them so long.\nMost of the effective work was started in volunteer societies and had\nproved a success before there was an official laying on of hands.\nAnglo-Saxons--it is our strong point--always work from below, up.\n\nA glance at any account of the mobilization of woman-power in Great\nBritain, Miss Fraser's admirable \"Women and War Work,\" for instance,\nwill reveal the printed page dotted thick with the names of volunteer\nassociations. A woman with sympathy sees a need, she gets an idea and\ncalls others about her. Quickly, there being no red tape, the need\nbegins to be met. What more admirable service could have been performed\nthan that inaugurated in the early months of the war under the Queen's\nWork for Women Fund, when work was secured for the women in luxury\ntrades which were collapsing under war pressure? A hundred and thirty\nfirms employing women were kept running.\n\nWhat more thrilling example of courage and forethought has been shown\nthan by the Scottish Women's Hospitals in putting on the western front\nthe first X-ray car to move from point to point near the lines? It but\nadds to the appeal of the work that those great scientists, Mrs. Ayrton\nand Madame Curie, selected the equipment.\n\nIt was a non-official body, the National Union of Women's Suffrage\nSocieties, which opened before the war was two weeks old the Women's\nService Bureau, and soon placed forty thousand women as paid and\nvolunteer workers. It was this bureau that furnished the government with\nits supervisors for the arsenals. The Women's Farm and Garden Union was\nthe fore-runner of the official Land Army, and to it still is left the\nimportant work of enrolling those women who, while willing to undertake\nagricultural work, are disinclined to sign up for service \"for the\nduration of the war.\"\n\nNot only have unnumbered voluntary associations achieved miracles in\nnecessary work, but many of them have gained untold discipline in the\nridicule they have had to endure from a doubting public. I remember\nhunting in vain all about Oxford Circus for the tucked-away office of\nthe Women's Signalling Corps. My inquiries only made the London bobbies\ngrin. Everyone laughed at the idea of women signalling, but to-day the\nmembers are recognized officially, one holding an important appointment\nin the college of wireless telegraphy.\n\nHow Scotland Yard smiled, at first, at Miss Damer Dawson and her Women\nPolice Service! But now the metropolitan police are calling for the help\nof her splendidly trained and reliable force.\n\nAnd the Women's Reserve Ambulance Corps--I climbed and climbed to an\nattic to visit their headquarters! There was the commandant in her\nkhaki, very gracious, but very upstanding, and maintaining the strictest\ndiscipline. No member of the corps entered or left her office without\nclapping heels together and saluting. The ambulance about which the\ncorps revolved, I often met in the streets--empty. But those women had\nvision. They saw that England would need them some day. They had faith\nin their ability to serve. So on and on they went, training themselves\nto higher efficiency in body and mind. And to-day--well, theirs is\nalways the first ambulance on the spot to care for the injured in the\nair-raids. The scoffers have remained to pray.\n\nIf Britain has a lesson for us it is an all-hail to non-official\nsocieties, an encouragement to every idea, a blessing on every effort\nwhich has behind it honesty of purpose. Great Britain's activities are\nas refreshingly diversified as her talents. They are not all under\none hat.\n\nIn the training for new industrial openings this same spirit of\nnon-official service showed itself. In munitions, for instance, private\nemployers were the first to recognize that they had in women-workers a\nlabor force worth the cost of training. The best of the skilled men in\nmany cases were told off to give the necessary instruction. The will to\ndo was in the learner; she soon mastered even complex processes, and at\nthe end of a few weeks was doing even better than men in the light work,\nand achieving commendable output in the heavy. The suffrage\norganizations, whenever a new line of skilled work was opened to women,\nestablished well-equipped centers to give the necessary teaching. Not\nuntil it became apparent that the new labor-power only needed training\nto reach a high grade of proficiency, did County Councils establish, at\ngovernment expense, technical classes for girls and women.\n\n[Illustration: Then--the offered service of the Women's Reserve\nAmbulance Corps in England was spurned. Now--they wear shrapnel helmets\nwhile working during the Zeppelin raids.]\n\nEquipment of the army was obviously the first and pressing obligation.\nFields might lie fallow, for food in the early days could easily be\nbrought from abroad, but men had to be registered, soldiers clothed and\nequipped. It was natural, then, that the new workers were principally\nused in registration work and in making military supplies.\n\nBut in the second year of the war came the conviction that the contest\nwas not soon to be ended, and that the matter of raising food at home\nmust be met. Women were again appealed to. A Land Army mobilized by\nwomen was created. At first this work was carried on under a centralized\ndivision of the National Service Department, but there has been\ndecentralization and the Land Army is now a department of the Board of\nAgriculture. It is headed by Miss M. Talbot as director. Under this\ncentral body are Women's Agricultural Committees in each county, with an\norganizing secretary whose duty it is to secure full-time recruits.\n\nThe part-time workers in a locality are obtained by the wife of the\nsquire or vicar acting as a volunteer registrar. Many of these\npart-time workers register to do the domestic work of the lusty young\nvillage housewife or mother while she is absent from home performing her\nallotted task on a nearby farm. The full-time recruits are not only\nsecured by the organizers, but through registrations at every post\noffice. Any woman can ask for a registration card and fill it out, and\nthe postmaster then forwards the application to the committee. The next\nstep is that likely applicants are called to the nearest center for\nexamination and presentation of credentials. When finally accepted they\nare usually sent for six weeks' or three months' training to a farm\nbelonging to some large estate. The landlord contributes the training,\nand the government gives the recruit her uniform and fifteen shillings a\nweek to cover her board and lodging. At the end of her course she\nreceives an armlet signifying her rank in the Land Army and is ready to\ngo wherever the authorities send her.\n\nThe farmer in Great Britain no longer needs to be converted to the value\nof the new workers. He knows they can do every kind of farm work as well\nas men, and are more reliable and conscientious than boys, and he is\nready, therefore, to pay the required minimum wage of eighteen\nshillings a week, or above that amount if the rate ruling in the\ndistrict is higher.\n\nEqually well organized is the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps, familiarly\nknown as the Waacs. The director is Mrs. Chalmers Watson. A would-be\nWaac goes to the center in her county for examination, and then is\nassigned to work at home or \"somewhere in France\" according to training\nand capacity. She may be fitted as a cook, a storekeeper, a telephone or\ntelegraph operator, or for signalling or salvage work. Let us not say\nshe will supplant a man, but rather set a man free for fuller service.\n\nMy niece, a slip of a girl, felt the call of duty at the beginning of\nthe war. Her brothers were early volunteers in Kitchener's Army. They\nwere in the trenches and she longed for the sensation of bearing a\nburden of hard work. She went to Woolwich Arsenal and toiled twelve\nhours a day. She broke under the strain, recuperated, and took up\nmunition work again. She became expert, and was in time an overseer told\noff to train other women. But she was never satisfied, and always\nanxious to be nearer the great struggle. She broke away one day and went\nto Southampton for a Waac examination, and found herself one of a group\nof a hundred and fifty gentlewomen all anxious to enter active service\nand all prepared for some definite work. They stood their tests, and\nDolly--that's the little niece's pet name, given to her because she is\nso tiny--is now working as an \"engine fitter\" just behind the fighting\nlines. Dainty Dolly, whom we have always treated as a fragile bit of\nSevres china, clad in breeches and puttees, under the booming of the\ngreat guns, is fitting patiently, part to part, the beating engine which\nwill lift on wings some English boy in his flight through the blue skies\nof France.\n\nBut it must not be supposed that the magnificent service of British\nwomen, devoted, efficient and well-organized from top to bottom,\nrealized itself without friction, any more than it will here. There were\ncertainly two wars going on in Great Britain for a long time, and the\ninternal strife was little less bitter than the international conflict.\nThe most active center of this contest of which we have heard so little\nwas in industry, and the combatants were the government, trade unions\nand women. The unions were doing battle because of fear of unskilled\nworkers, especially when intelligent and easily trained; the government,\nin sore need of munition hands, was bargaining with the unskilled for\nlong hours and low pay. Finally the government and the unions\nreluctantly agreed that women must be employed; both wanted them to be\nskillful, but not too skillful, and above all, to remain amenable. It\nhas been made clear, too, that women enter their new positions \"for the\nwar only.\" At the end of hostilities--international hostilities--women\nare to hand over their work and wages to men and go home and be content.\nWill the program be fulfilled?\n\nThe wishes of women themselves may play some part. How do they feel?\nObviously, every day the war lasts they get wider experience of the\nsorrows and pleasures of financial independence. Women are called the\npractical sex, and I certainly found them in England facing the fact\nthat peace will mean an insufficient number of breadwinners to go around\nand that a maimed man may have low earning power. The women I met were\nnot dejected at the prospect; they showed, on the contrary, a spirit not\nfar removed from elation in finding new opportunities of service. After\nI had sat and listened to speech after speech at the annual conference\nof the National Union of Women Workers, with delegates from all parts of\nthe country, presided over by Mrs. Creighton, widow of the late Bishop\nof London, there was no doubt in my mind that British women desired to\nenter paid fields of work, and regarded as permanent the great increase\nin their employment. No regrets or hesitations were expressed in a\nsingle speech, and the solutions of the problems inherent in the new\nsituation all lay in the direction of equality of preparation and\nequality of pay with men.\n\nThe strongest element in the women's trade unions takes the same stand.\nThe great rise in the employment of women is not regarded as a \"war\nmeasure,\" and all the suggestions made to meet the hardships of\nreadjustment, such as a \"minimum wage for all unskilled workers, men as\nwell as women,\" are based on the idea of the new workers being permanent\nfactors in the labor market.\n\nThe same conclusion was reached in the report presented to the British\nAssociation by the committee appointed to investigate the \"Replacement\nof Male by Female Labor.\" The committee found itself in entire\ndisagreement with the opinion that the increased employment of women was\na passing phase, and made recommendations bearing on such measures as\nimproved technical training for girls as well as for boys, a minimum\nwage for unskilled men as well as women, equal pay for equal work, and\nthe abolition of \"half-timers.\" But while it was obvious that the\ngreatest asset of belligerent nations is the labor of women, while\nlearned societies and organizations of women laid down rules for their\nsafe and permanent employment, the British Government showed marked\nopposition to the new workers. If the Cabinet did not believe the war\nwould be brief, it certainly acted as if Great Britain alone among the\nbelligerents would have no shortage of male industrial hands. At a time\nwhen Germany had five hundred thousand women in munition factories,\nEngland had but ten thousand.\n\nThere is no doubt that the country was at first organized merely for a\nspurt. Boys and girls were pressed into service, wages were cut down for\nwomen, hours lengthened for men. Government reports read like the\nShaftesbury attacks on the conditions of early factory days. We hear\nagain of beds that are never cold, the occupant of one shift succeeding\nthe occupant of the next, of the boy sleeping in the same bed with two\nmen, and three girls in a cot in the same room. Labor unrest was met at\nfirst by the Munitions War Act prohibiting strikes and lockouts,\nestablishing compulsory arbitration and suspending all trade-union rules\nwhich might \"hamper production.\" Under the law a \"voluntary army of\nworkers\" signed up as ready to go anywhere their labor was needed, and\nlocal munition committees became labor courts endowed with power to\nchange wage rates, to inflict fines on slackers, and on those who broke\nthe agreements of the \"voluntary army.\"\n\nTo meet the threatening rebellion, a Health of Munition Workers\nCommittee under the Ministry of Munitions was appointed to \"consider and\nadvise on questions of industrial fatigue, hours of labor and other\nmatters affecting the physical health and physical efficiency of workers\nin munition factories and workshops.\" On this committee there were\ndistinguished medical men, labor experts, members of parliament and two\nwomen, Miss R.E. Squire of the Factory Department and Mrs. H.J. Tennant.\n\nThe committee was guided by a desire to have immense quantities of\nmunitions turned out, and faced squarely the probability that the war\nwould be of long duration. Its findings, embodied in a series of\nmemoranda, have lessons for us, not only for war times, but for peace\ntimes, for all time.\n\nOn a seven day week the verdict was that \"if the maximum output is to be\nsecured and maintained for any length of time, a weekly period of rest\nmust be allowed.\" Overtime was advised against, a double or triple shift\nbeing recommended.\n\nIn July, 1916, the committee published a most interesting memorandum on\nexperiments in the relation of output to hours. In one case the output\nwas increased eight percent by reducing the weekly hours from\nsixty-eight to fifty-nine, and it was found that a decrease to fifty-six\nhours per week gave the same output as fifty-nine. It need hardly be\nsaid that there was no change in machinery, tools, raw material or\nworkers. All elements except hours of work were identical. Twenty-seven\nworkers doing very heavy work increased their output ten percent by\ncutting weekly hours from sixty-one to fifty-five. In a munition plant\nemploying thirty-six thousand hands it was found that the sick rate\nranged from five to eight percent when the employees were working\novertime, and was only three percent when they were on a double shift.\n\nThe war has forced Great Britain to carry out the findings of this\ncommittee and to consider more seriously than ever before, and for both\nmen and women, the problem of industrial fatigue, the relation of\naccidents to hours of labor, industrial diseases, housing, transit, and\nindustrial canteens. The munition worker is as important as the soldier\nand must have the best of care.\n\nWhile the friction in the ranks of industrial women workers was still\nfar from being adjusted, the government met its Waterloo in the contest\nwith medical women. The service which they freely offered their country\nwas at first sternly refused. Undaunted, they sought recognition outside\nthe mother country. They knew their skill and they knew the soldiers'\nneed. They turned to hospitable France, and received official\nrecognition. On December 14, 1914, the first hospital at the front under\nBritish medical women was opened in Abbaye Royaumont, near Creil. It\ncarries the official designation, \"Hopital Auxiliaire 301.\" The doctors,\nthe nurses, the cooks, are all women. One of the capable chauffeurs I\nsaw running the ambulance when I was in Creil. She was getting the\nwounded as they came down from the front. The French Government\nappreciated what the women were doing and urged them to give more help.\nAt Troyes another unit gave the French army its first experience of\nnursing under canvas.\n\nAfter France had been profiting by the skill of British women for\nmonths, Sir Alfred Keogh, Medical Director General, wisely insisted that\nthe War Office yield and place a hospital in the hands of women. The\nWar Hospital in Endell Street, London, is now under Dr. Flora Murray,\nand every office, except that of gateman, is filled by women. From the\ndoctors, who rank as majors, down to the cooks, who rank as\nnon-commissioned officers, every one connected with Endell Street has\nmilitary standing. It indicated the long, hard road these women had\ntraveled to secure official recognition that the doctor who showed me\nover the hospital told me, as a matter for congratulation, that at night\nthe police brought in drunken soldiers to be sobered. \"Every war\nhospital must receive them,\" she explained, \"and we are glad we are not\npassed over, for that gives the stamp to our official standing.\"\n\nIt was a beautiful autumn day when I visited Endell Street. The great\ncourt was full of convalescents, and the orderlies in khaki, with veils\nfloating back from their close-fitting toques, were carefully and\nskillfully lifting the wounded from an ambulance. I spoke to one of the\nsoldier boys about the absence of men doctors and orderlies, and his\nquick query was, \"And what should we want men for?\" It seems that they\nalways take that stand after a day or two. At first the patient is\npuzzled; he calls the doctor \"sister\" and the orderly \"nurse,\" but ends\nby being an enthusiastic champion of the new order. Not a misogynist did\nI find. One poor fellow who had been wounded again and again and had\nbeen in many hospitals, declared, \"I don't mean no flattery, but this\nplace leaves nothink wanting.\"\n\nThe first woman I met on my last visit to England upset my expectation\nof finding that war pushed women back into primitive conditions of toil,\ncrushed them under the idea that physical force rules the world, and\nmade them subservient. I chanced upon her as she was acting as\nticket-puncher at the Yarmouth station. She was well set-up, alert,\nefficient, helpful in giving information, and, above all, cheerful.\nThere were two capable young women at the bookstall, too. One had lost a\nbrother at the front, the other her lover. I felt that they regarded\ntheir loss as one item in the big national accounting. They were\nheroically cheerful in \"doing their bit.\"\n\nThroughout my stay in England I searched for, but could not find, the\nself-effacing spinster of former days. In her place was a capable woman,\nbright-eyed, happy. She was occupied and bustled at her work. She jumped\non and off moving vehicles with the alertness, if not the\nunconsciousness, of the expert male. She never let me stand in omnibus\nor subway, but quickly gave me her seat, as indeed she insisted upon\ndoing for elderly gentlemen as well. The British woman had found herself\nand her muscles. England was a world of women--women in uniforms; there\nwas the army of nurses, and then the messengers, porters, elevator\nhands, tram conductors, bank clerks, bookkeepers, shop attendants. They\neach seemed to challenge the humble stranger, \"Superfluous? Not I, I'm a\nrecruit for national service!\" Even a woman doing time-honored womanly\nwork moved with an air of distinction; she dusted a room for the good of\nher country. Just one glimpse was I given of the old-time daughter of\nEve, when a ticket-collector at Reading said: \"I can't punch your\nticket. Don't you see I'm eating an apple!\"\n\nOne of the reactions of the wider functioning of brain and muscle which\nstruck me most forcibly was the increased joyfulness of women. They were\nhappy in their work, happy in the thought of rendering service, so happy\nthat the poignancy of individual loss was carried more easily.\n\nThis cheerfulness is somewhat gruesomely voiced in a cartoon in _Punch_\ntouching on the allowance given to the soldier's wife. She remarks,\n\"This war is 'eaven--twenty-five shillings a week and no 'usband\nbothering about!\" We have always credited _Punch_ with knowing England.\nTruth stands revealed by a thrust, however cynical, when softened by\nchallenging humor.\n\nThere was no discipline in the pension system. No work was required. The\ncase of a girl I met in a country town was common. She was working in a\nfactory earning eleven shillings a week. A day or two later I saw her,\nand she told me she had stopped work, as she had \"married a soldier, and\n'e's gone to France, and I get twelve and six separation allowance a\nweek.\" Never did the strange English name, \"separation allowance,\" seem\nmore appropriate for the wife's pension than in this girl's story.\nLittle wonder was it that in the early months of the war there was some\nriotous living among soldiers' wives!\n\nAnd the comments of women of influence on the drunkenness and waste of\nmoney on foolish finery were as striking to me as the sordid condition\nitself. The woman chairman of a Board of Poor Law Guardians in the north\nof England told me that when her fellow-members suggested that\nParliament ought to appoint committees to disburse the separation\nallowances, she opposed them with the heroic philosophy that women can\nbe trained in wisdom only by freedom to err, that a sense of\nresponsibility had never been cultivated in them, and the country would\nhave to bear the consequences. In reply to my inquiry as to how the\nGuardians received these theories, I learned that \"they knew she was\nright and dropped their plan.\"\n\nThe faith of leading women that experience would be the best teacher for\nthe soldier's wife has been justified. A labor leader in the Midlands\ntold me that an investigation by his trade union showed that only one\nhundred women in the ten thousand cases inquired into were mis-spending\ntheir allowances. And when I was visiting a board school in a poor\ndistrict of London, and remarked to the head teacher that the children\nlooked well cared for, she told me that never had they been so well fed\nand clothed. There seemed no doubt in her mind that it was best to have\nthe family budget in the hands of the mother. In the sordid surroundings\nof the mean streets of great cities, there is developing in women\npractical wisdom and a fine sense of individual responsibility.\n\nPerhaps of greater significance than just how separation allowances are\nbeing spent is the fact that women have discovered that their work as\nhousewives and mothers has a value recognized by governments in hard\ncash. It makes one speculate as to whether wives in the warring nations\nwill step back without a murmur into the old-time dependence on one man,\nor whether these simple women may contribute valuable ideas towards the\nworking out of sound schemes of motherhood pensions.\n\nThe women of Great Britain are experiencing economic independence, they\nare living in an atmosphere of recognition of the value of their work as\nhousewives and mothers. Women leaders in all classes give no indication\nof regarding pensions or remuneration in gainful pursuits as other than\npermanent factors in social development, and much of the best thought of\nmen as well as women is centered on group experiments in domestic\ncooeperation, in factory canteens, in municipal kitchens, which are a\nnatural concomitant to the wider functioning of women.\n\nGreat Britain is not talking about feminism, it is living it. Perhaps\nnothing better illustrates the national acceptance of the fact than the\nwidespread amusement touched with derision caused by the story of the\ncholeric gentlemen who, on being asked at the time of one of the\ngovernment registrations whether his wife was dependent upon him or not,\nroared in rage, \"Well, if my wife isn't dependent on me, I'd like to\nknow what man she is dependent on!\"\n\nOnly second to Britain's lesson for us in the self-reliance of its\nwomen, and the thorough mobilization of their labor-power and executive\nability, is its lesson in protection for all industrial workers. It\nstands as one people against the present enemy, and in its effort does\nnot fail to give thought to race conservation for the future.\n\n\n[Footnote 2: Through the courtesy of the Editors of _The Outlook_, I am\nat liberty to use in this and the following chapter, some of the\nmaterial published in an article by me in _The Outlook_ of June\n28, 1916.]\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\nMOBILIZING WOMEN IN FRANCE\n\n\nCompared with the friction in the mobilization of woman-power in Great\nBritain, the readjustment in the lives of women in France was like the\nopening out of some harmonious pageant in full accord with popular\nsympathy. But who has not said, \"France is different!\"\n\nIt is different, and in nothing more so than in its attitude toward its\nwomen. Without discussion with organizations of men, without hindrance\nfrom the government, women filled the gaps in the industrial army. It\nwas obvious that the new workers, being unskilled, would need training;\nthe government threw open the technical schools to them. A spirit of\nhospitality, of helpfulness, of common sense, reigned.\n\n[Illustration: The French poilu on furlough is put to work harrowing.]\n\nAnd it was not only in industry that France showed herself wise. I found\nthat the government had cooeperated unreservedly with all the\nphilanthropic work of women and had given them a wide sphere in which\nthey could rise above amateurish effort and carry out plans calling for\nadministrative ability.\n\nWhen the Conseil National des Femmes Francaises inaugurated its work to\nbring together the scattered families of Belgium and northern France,\nand when the Association pour l'Aide Fraternelle aux Evacues\nAlsaciens-Lorrains began its work for the dispersed peoples of the\nprovinces, an order was issued by the government to every prefect to\nfurnish lists of all refugees in his district to the headquarters of the\nwomen's societies in Paris. It was through this good will on the part of\nthe central government that these societies were able to bring together\nforty thousand Belgian families, and to clothe and place in school, or\nat work, the entire dispersed population of the reconquered districts of\nAlsace-Lorraine.\n\nNor did these societies cease work with the completion of their initial\neffort. They turned themselves into employment bureaus and with the aid\nand sanction of the government found work for the thousands of women who\nwere thrown out of employment. They had the machinery to accomplish\ntheir object, the Council being an old established society organized\nthroughout the country, and the Association to Aid the Refugees from\nAlsace-Lorraine (a nonpartisan name adopted, by the way, at the request\nof the Minister of the Interior to cover for the moment the patriotic\nwork of the leading suffrage society) had active units in every\nprefecture.\n\nOne of the admirable private philanthropies was the canteen at the St.\nLazarre station in Paris. I am tempted to single it out because its\norganizer, Countess de Berkaim, told me that in all the months she had\nbeen running it--and it was open twenty-four hours of the day--not a\nsingle volunteer had been five minutes late. The canteen was opened in\nFebruary, 1915, with a reading and rest room. Six hundred soldiers a day\nhave been fed. The two big rooms donated by the railway for the work\nwere charming with their blue and white checked curtains, dividing\nkitchen from restaurant and rest room from reading room. The work is no\nsmall monument to the reliability and organizing faculty of\nFrench women.\n\nIt was in France, too, that I found the group of women who realized that\nthe permanent change which the war was making in the relation of women\nto society needed fundamental handling. Mlle. Valentine Thomson, founder\nof La Vie Feminine, held that not only was the war an economic struggle\nand not only must the financial power of the combatants rest on the\nlabor of women, but the future of the nations will largely depend upon\nthe attitude which women take toward their new obligations. Realizing\nthat business education would be a determining factor in that attitude,\nMlle. Thomson persuaded her father, who was then Minister of Commerce,\nto send out an official recommendation to the Chambers of Commerce to\nopen the commercial schools to girls. The advice was very generally\nfollowed, but as Paris refused, a group of women, backed by the\nMinistry, founded a school in which were given courses of instruction in\nthe usual business subjects, and lectures on finance, commercial law and\ninternational trade.\n\nMlle. Thomson herself turned her business gifts to good use in a\nsuccessful effort to build up for the immediate benefit of artists and\nworkers the doll trade of which France was once supreme mistress.\nExhibitions of the art, old and new, were held in many cities in the\nUnited States, in South America and in England. The dolls went to the\nhearts of lovers of beauty, and what promised surer financial return, to\nthe hearts of the children.\n\nTo do something for France--that stood first in the minds of the\ninitiators of this commercial project. They knew her people must be\nemployed. And next, the desire to bring back charm to an old art\nprompted their effort. Mlle. Thomson fully realizes just what \"Made in\nGermany\" signifies. The peoples of the world have had their taste\ncorrupted by floods of the cheap and tawdry. Germany has been steadily\neducating us to demand quantity, quantity mountains high. There is\npromise that the doll at least will be rescued by France and made worth\nthe child's devotion.\n\nIn industry, as well as in all else, one feels that in France there has\nnot been so much a revolution as an orderly development. Women were in\nmunition factories even before the war, the number has merely swelled.\nThe women of the upper and lower bourgeois class always knew their\nhusband's business, the one could manage the shop, the other could\nbargain with the best of them as to contracts and output. Women were\ntrained as bookkeepers and clerks under Napoleon I; he wanted men as\nsoldiers, and so decreed women should go into business. And the woman of\nthe aristocratic class has merely slipped out of her seclusion as if\nputting aside an old-fashioned garment, and now carries on her\nphilanthropies in more serious and cooerdinated manner. We know the\npractical business experience possessed by French women, and so are\nprepared to learn that many a big commercial enterprise, the owner\nhaving gone to the front, is now directed by his capable wife. That is\nbut a development, too, is it not? For we had all heard long ago of Mme.\nDuval, even if we had not eaten at her restaurants, and though we had\nnever bought a ribbon or a carpet at the Bon Marche, we had heard of the\nwoman who helped break through old merchant habits and gave the world\nthe department store.\n\nBut nothing has been more significant in its growth during the war than\nthe small enterprises in which the husband and wife in the domestic\nmunition shop, laboring side by side with a little group of assistants,\nhave been turning out marvels of skill. The man is now in the trenches\nfighting for France, and the woman takes command and leads the\nindustrial battalion to victory. She knows she fights for France.\n\nA word more about her business, for she is playing an economic part that\nbrings us up at attention. She may be solving the problem of adjustment\nof home and work so puzzling to women. There are just such domestic\nshops dotted all over the map of France; in the Paris district alone\nthere are over eighteen hundred of them. The conditions are so\nexcellent and the ruling wages so high, that the minimum wage law passed\nin 1915 applied only to the sweated home workers in the clothing trade,\nand not to the domestic munition shops.\n\nA commission which included in its membership a trade unionist, sent by\nthe British government in the darkest days to find why it was that\nFrance could produce so much more ammunition than England, found these\ntiny workshops, with their primitive equipment, performing miracles. The\noutput was huge and of the best. The woman, when at the head, seemed to\nturn out more than the man, she worked with such undying energy. The\ncommission said it was the \"spirit of France\" that drove the workers\nforward and renewed the flagging energies. But even the trade unionist\nreferred to the absence of all opposition to women on the part of\norganizations of men. Perhaps the spirit of France is undying because in\nit is a spirit of unity and harmony.\n\nIt seemed to me there was one very practical explanation of the\nunmistakable energy of the French worker, both man and woman. The whole\nnation has the wise custom of taking meal time with due seriousness. The\nbreak at noon in the great manufactories, as well as in the family\nworkshop, is long, averaging one hour and a half, and reaching often to\ntwo hours. The French never gobble. Because food is necessary to animal\nlife, they do not on that account take a puritanical view of it. They\ndare enjoy it, in spite of its physiological bearing. They sit down to\nit, dwell upon it, get its flavor, and after the meal they sit still and\nas a nation permit themselves unabashed to enjoy the sensation of hunger\nappeased. That's the common sense spirit of France.\n\nOf course the worker is renewed, hurls herself on the work again with\nardor, and losing no time through fatigue, throws off an\nenormous output.\n\nWages perform their material share in spurring the worker. Louis Barthou\nsays that the woman's average is eight francs a day. Long ago--it seems\nlong ago--she could earn at best five francs in the Paris district. She\nworks on piece work now, getting the same rate as men. And think of\nit!--this must indeed be because of the spirit of France--this woman\ndoes better than men on the light munition work, and equals, yes, equals\nher menfolk on the heavy shells. I do not say this, a commission of men\nsays it, a commission with a trade union member to boot. The coming of\nthe woman-worker with the spirit of win-the-war in her heart is the same\nin France as elsewhere, only here her coming is more gracious. Twelve\nhundred easily take up work on the Paris subway. They are the wives of\nmobilized employees. The offices of the Post, the Telegraph and\nTelephone bristle with women, of course, for eleven thousand have taken\nthe places of men. Some seven thousand fill up the empty positions on\nthe railways, serving even as conductors on through trains. Their number\nhas swollen to a half million in munitions, and to over half that number\nin powder mills and marine workshops; in civil establishments over three\nhundred thousand render service; and even the conservative banking world\nwelcomes the help of some three thousand women.\n\n[Illustration: Has there ever been anything impossible to French women\nsince the time of Jeanne d'Arc? The fields must be harrowed--they have\nno horses.]\n\nOut on the land the tally is greatest of all. Every woman from the\nvillage bends over the bosom of France, urging fertility. The government\ncalled them in the first hours of the conflict. Viviani spoke\nthe word:--\n\n\"The departure for the army of all those who can carry arms, leaves the\nwork in the fields undone; the harvest is not yet gathered in; the\nvintage season is near. In the name of the entire nation united behind\nit, I make an appeal to your courage, and to that of your children,\nwhose age alone and not their valour, keeps them from the war.\n\n\"I ask you to keep on the work in the fields, to finish gathering in the\nyear's harvest, to prepare that of the coming year. You cannot render\nyour country a greater service.\n\n\"It is not for you, but for her, that I appeal to your hearts.\n\n\"You must safeguard your own living, the feeding of the urban\npopulations and especially the feeding of those who are defending the\nfrontier, as well as the independence of the country, civilization\nand justice.\n\n\"Up, then, French women, young children, daughters and sons of the\ncountry! Replace on the field of work those who are on the field of\nbattle. Strive to show them to-morrow the cultivated soil, the harvests\nall gathered in, the fields sown.\n\n\"In hours of stress like the present, there is no ignoble work.\nEverything that helps the country is great. Up! Act! To work! To-morrow\nthere will be glory for everyone.\n\n\"Long live the Republic! Long live France!\"\n\nWomen instantly responded to the proclamation. Only the old men were\nleft to help, only decrepit horses, rejected by the military\nrequisition. More than once I journeyed far into the country, but I\nnever saw an able-bodied man. What a gap to be filled!--but the French\npeasant woman filled it. She harvested that first year, she has sowed\nand garnered season by season ever since. Men, horses, machinery were\nlacking, the debit yawned, but she piled up a credit to meet it by\nunflagging toil.\n\nWith equal devotion and with initiative and power of organization the\nwoman of leisure has \"carried on.\" The three great societies\ncorresponding with our Red Cross, the Societe de Secours aux Blesses,\nthe Union des Femmes de France, and the Association des Dames\nFrancaises, have established fifteen hundred hospitals with one hundred\nand fifteen thousand beds, and put forty-three thousand nurses in active\nservice. Efficiency has kept pace with this superb effort, as is\ntestified to by many a war cross, many a medal, and the cross of the\nLegion of Honor.\n\nUp to the level of her means France sets examples in works of human\nsalvage worthy the imitation of all nations. The mairie in each\narrondissement has become no less than a community center. The XIV\narrondissement in Paris is but the pattern for many. Here the wife of\nthe mayor, Mme. Brunot, has made the stiff old building a human place.\nThe card catalogue carrying information about every soldier from the\ndistrict, gives its overwhelming news each day gently to wife or mother,\nthrough the lips of Mme. Brunot or her women assistants. The work of Les\nAmis des Orphelins de Guerre centers here, the \"adopted\" child receiving\nfrom the good maire the gifts in money and presents sent by the\nAmericans who are generously filling the role of parent. The widows of\nthe soldiers gather here for comfort and advice.\n\nAnd the mairie holds a spirit of experiment. It houses not only courage\nand sympathy, but progress. The \"XIV\" has ventured on a Cuisine\nPopulaire under Mme. Brunot's wholesome guidance. And so many other\narrondissements have followed suit that Paris may be regarded as making\na great experiment in the municipal feeding of her people. It is not\ncharity, the food is paid for. In the \"XIV\" fifteen hundred persons eat\na meal or two at the mairie each day. The charge is seventy-five\ncentimes--fifteen cents, and one gets a soup, meat and a vegetable,\nand fruit.\n\nThe world seems to be counselling us that if we wish to be well and\ncheaply fed we must go where there are experts to cook, where buying is\ndone in quantity, and where the manager knows about nutritive values.\n\nIf a word of praise is extended to the maire of the XIV arrondissement\nfor his very splendid work, an example to all France, he quickly urges,\n\"Ah, but Mme. Brunot!\" And so it is always, if you exclaim, \"Oh, the\nspirit of the men of France!\" and a Frenchman's ears catch your words,\nhe will correct, \"Ah, but the women!\"\n\nAnd the women do stand above all other women, they have had such\nopportunity for heroism. Whose heart does not beat the faster when the\nnames Soisson and Mme. Macherez are spoken! The mayor and the council\ngone, she assumes the office and keeps order while German shells fall\nthick on the town. And then the enemy enters, and asks for the mayor,\nand she replies, \"Le maire, c'est moi.\" And then do we women not like to\nthink of Mlle. Deletete staying at her post in the telegraph office in\nHouplines in spite of German bombardments, and calmly facing tormentors,\nwhen they smashed her instruments and threatened her with death.\nOne-tenth of France in the enemy's hands, and in each village and town\nsome woman staying behind to nurse the sick and wounded, to calm the\npopulation when panic threatens, to stand invincible between the people\nand their conquerors!\n\nIt is very splendid!--the French man holding steady at the front, the\nFrench woman an unyielding second line of defense. But what of France?\nWords of praise must not swallow our sense of obligation. Let us with\nour hundred millions of people face the figures. The death rate in\nFrance, not counting the military loss, is twenty per thousand, with a\nbirth rate of eight per thousand. In Paris for the year ending August,\n1914, there were forty-eight thousand nine hundred and seventeen births;\nin the year ending in the same month, 1916, the births dropped to\ntwenty-six thousand one hundred and seventy-nine. The total deaths for\nthat year in all France were one million, one hundred thousand, and the\nbirths three hundred and twelve thousand.\n\nFrance is profoundly, infinitely sad. She has cause. I shall never\nforget looking into the very depths of her sorrow when I was at Creil. A\ngreat drive was in progress, the wounded were being brought down from\nthe front, troops hurried forward. Four different regiments passed as I\nsat at dejeuner. The restaurant, full of its noonday patrons, was a\ntypical French cafe giving on the street. We could have reached out and\ntouched the soldiers. They marched without music, without song or word,\nmarched in silence. Some of the men were from this very town; their\nlittle sons, with set faces, too, walked beside them and had brought\nthem bunches of flowers. The people in the restaurant never spoke above\na whisper, and when the troops passed were as silent as death. There was\nno cheer, but just a long, wistful gaze, the soldiers looking into their\neyes, they into the soldiers'.\n\nBut France can bear her burden, can solve her problem if we lift our\nfull share from her bent shoulders. Her women can save the children if\nthe older men, relieved by our young soldiers, come back from the\ntrenches, setting women free for the work of child saving. France can\nrebuild her villages if her supreme architects, her skilled workers are\nreplaced in the trenches by our armies. France can renew her spirit and\nsave her body if her experts in science, if her poets and artists are\nsent back to her, and our less great bare their breasts to the Huns.\n\n\n\n\nV\n\nMOBILIZING WOMEN IN GERMANY\n\n\nThe military mobilization of Germany was no more immediate and effective\nthan the call to arms for women. On August 1, 1914, the summons went\nout, and German women were at once part of the smooth running machine of\nefficiency.\n\nThe world says the Kaiser has been preparing for war for forty years.\nThe world means that he has been preparing the fighting force. The sword\nand guns were to be ready. But the military arm of the nation, the\nGerman government believes, is but the first line of attack; the people\nare the second line, and so they, too, in all their life activities,\nwere not forgotten. The military aristocracy has never neglected the\nfunction of women in the state. The definition of their function may\ndiffer from ours, but that there is a function is recognized, and it is\nrelated to the other vital social organs.\n\nSlowly, through the last half of the nineteenth century, there had grown\nup clubs among German women focusing on a definite bit of work, or\ncrystallizing about an idea. Germany even had suffrage societies.\nPolitics, however, were forbidden by the government; women were not\nallowed to hang on the fringe of a meeting held to discuss men's\npolitics. But the women of the Fatherland were free to pool their ideas\nin philanthropic and hygienic corners, and venture out at times on\neducational highways. The Froebel societies had many a contest with the\ngovernment, for to the military mind, the gentle pedagogue's theories\nseemed subversive of discipline as enforced by spurs and bayonets.\n\nThese clubs, covering every trade and profession, every duty and every\naspiration of women, were dotted over the German Empire. At last they\ndrew together in a federation. The government looked on. It saw a\nmachine created, and believing in thorough organization, no doubt gave\nthought to the possibilities of the Bund deutscher, Frauenvereine. At\nthe outbreak of war, Dr. Gertrud Baumer was president of the Bund. She\nwas a leader of great ability, marshalling half a million of women. No\nother organization was so widespread and well-knit, except perhaps Der\nVaterlandische Frauenverein with its two thousand one hundred and fifty\nbranches. It was evangelical and military. The Empress was its patron.\nIts popular name is the \"Armee der Kaiserin.\"\n\nThere the two great national societies stood--one aristocratic, the\nother democratic, one appealing to the ruling class, the other holding\nin bonds of fellowship the rich and the poor, the urban and the rural,\nthe professional and the industrial woman.\n\nEvery belligerent president or premier has faced exactly the same\nperplexity. What woman, what society, is to be recognized as leader? The\nquestion has brought beads of perspiration to the foreheads of\nstatesmen.\n\nFrance solved the difficulty urbanely. It said \"yes\" to each and all. It\npromised cooeperation and kept the promise. By affably--always affably\nand hospitably--accepting this service from one society, and suggesting\nanother pressing need to its competitor, it sorted out capabilities, and\nwarded off duplication. Perhaps this did not bring the fullest\nefficiency, but the loss was more than made up, no doubt, by a free\nfield for initiative. Britain ignored all existing organizations of\nwomen, and after a year and a half of puzzlement created a separate\ngovernment department for their mobilization. America struck out still\nanother course. It took the heads of several national societies, bound\nthem in one committee, to which it gave, perhaps with the idea of\navoiding any danger of friction, neither power nor funds.\n\nGermany faced the same critical moment for decision. The government\nwanted efficient use of woman-power on the land, in the factory, in the\nhome, and that quickly. It made use of the best existing machinery. Dr.\nGertrud Baumer visited the Ministerium des Innern, and on August 1 she\nissued a call for the mobilization of women for service to the\nFatherland in the Nationale Frauendienst. Under the aegis of the\ngovernment, with the national treasury behind her, Dr. Baumer summoned\nthe women of the Empire. By order, every woman and every organization of\nwomen was to fall in line under the Frauendienst in each village and\ncity for \"the duration of the war.\" [3]\n\nIn each army district, the government appointed a woman as directress,\nand by order to town and provincial authorities made the Frauendienst\npart of local executive affairs.\n\nAmong the immediate duties laid upon the Frauendienst by the authorities\nwas the task of registering all needy persons, of providing cheap eating\nplaces, opening workrooms, and setting up nurseries for children,\nespecially for those who were motherless and those whose fathers had\nfallen at the front and whose mothers were in some gainful pursuit. With\nthese duties went the administrative service of cooeperating with the\ngovernment in \"keeping up an even supply of foodstuffs, and controlling\nthe buying and selling of food.\"\n\nGermany anticipated as did no other belligerent the unemployment which\nwould follow a declaration of war, and prepared to meet the condition. A\ngreat deal of army work, such as tent sewing, belts for cartridges,\nbread sacks, and sheets for hospitals, was made immediately available\nfor the women thrown out of luxury trades. In the first month of the war\nthe Frauendienst opened work-rooms in all great centers; machinery was\ninstalled by magic and through the six work-rooms in Berlin alone\ntwenty-three thousand women were given paid employment in one week.\n\nSuch efforts could not, of course, absorb the surplus labor, for\nunemployment was very great. Eighty percent of the women's hat-makers\nand milliners were out of work, seventy-two percent of the workers in\nglass and fifty-eight percent in china. The Frauendienst investigated\ntwo hundred and fifty-five thousand needy cases, and in Berlin alone\nfound sixty thousand women who had lost their employment. Charity had to\nrender help. Here, again, it is an example of the alertness of the\norganization and its close connection with the government that the\nBerlin magistracy deputed to twenty-three Hilfscommissionen from the\nFrauendienst the work of giving advice and charity relief to the\nunemployed. Knitting rooms were opened, clothing depots, mending rooms,\nwhere donated clothing was repaired, and in one month fifty-six thousand\norders for milk, five hundred thousand for bread, and three hundred\nthousand for meals were distributed for the city authorities.\n\nThe adjustment to war requirements went on more quickly in Germany than\nin any other country. Before a year had passed the surplus hands had\nbeen absorbed, and a shortage of labor power was beginning to be felt.\n\nAnd now opens the war drama set with the same scene everywhere. Women\nhurry forward to take up the burden laid down by men, and to assume the\nnew occupations made necessary by the organization of the world for\nmilitary conflict. To tell of Germany is merely to speak in bigger\nnumbers. Women in munitions? Of course, well over the million mark.\nTrolley conductors? Of course, six hundred in Berlin alone before the\nfirst Christmas. Women are making the fuses, fashioning the big shells,\nand at the same heavy machines used by the men. That speaks volumes--the\nsame heavy machines. Great Britain and France have in every case\nintroduced lighter machinery for their women. But, whatever the\nconditions, in Germany the women are handling high explosives, sewing\nheavy saddlery, operating the heaviest drill machines. Women have been\nput on the \"hardest jobs hitherto filled by men.\" In the\nGerman-Luxemburg Mining and Furnace Company at Differdingen, they are\nfound doing work at the slag and blast furnaces which had always\nrequired men of great endurance. They work on the same shifts as the\nmen, receive the same pay, but are not worked overtime \"because they\nmust go home and perform their domestic duties.\"\n\nOne feels the weight of the German system. Patient women shoulder double\nburdens. They always did.\n\nIn the Post and Telegraph department there is an army of fifty thousand\nwomen. The telephone service is entirely in their hands, and running\nmore smoothly than formerly. Dr. Kaethe Schirmacher declares comfortingly\nin the _Kriegsfrau_ that \"one must not forget that these women know many\nimportant bits of information--and keep silent.\" Women have learned to\nkeep a secret!\n\nOne hundred and eighty nurses, experts with the X-ray, were in the front\nline dressing stations in the early days of the war, and before a week\nof conflict had passed women were in the Field Post, and Frau Reimer,\norganizer of official chauffeurs, was on the western line of attack.\n\nAgriculture claims more women than any occupation in Germany. They were\nalways on the farm, perhaps they are happier there now since they\nthemselves are in command. It is said that \"the peasants work in the\nboots and trousers of their husbands and ride in the saddle.\" War has\nliberated German women from the collar and put them on horseback!\n\nBut strangest and most unexpected of all is the professional and\nadministrative use of women. The government has sent women architects\nand interior decorators to East Prussia to plan and carry through\nreconstruction work. Over a hundred--to be exact, one hundred and\nsixteen at last accounts--have taken the places of men in\nadministrative departments connected with the railways. Many widows who\nhave shown capacity have been put in government positions of importance\nformerly held by their husbands. Women have become farm managers,\nsuperintendents of dairy industries, and representatives of landed\nproprietors.\n\nThe disseminating of all instruction and information for women on war\neconomies was delegated to the League of Women's Domestic Science Clubs.\nThe Berlin course was held in no less a place than the Abgeordnetenhaus,\nand the Herrenhaus opened its doors wide on Rural Women's Day when\nAgricultural Week was held at the capital.\n\nWhen the full history of the war comes to be written, no doubt one\nreason for Germany's marvelous power to stand so long against the world\nwill be found in her use of every brain and muscle of the nation. This\nhas been for her no exclusive war. Her entire people to their last ounce\nof energy have been engaged.\n\nAnd this supreme service on the part of German women seeks democratic\nexpression. From them comes the clearest, bravest word that has reached\nus across the border. The most hopeful sign is this manifesto from the\nsuffrage organizations to the government: \"Up to the present Germany\nhas stood in the lowest rank of nations as regards women's rights. In\nmost civilized lands women already have been given a large share in\npublic affairs. German women have been granted nothing except within the\nmost insignificant limits. In New Zealand, Australia and most American\nStates, and even before the war in Finland and Norway, they had been\ngiven political rights; to-day, Sweden, Russia and many other countries\ngive them a full or limited franchise. The war has brought a full\nvictory to the women of England, Canada, Russia and Denmark, and large\nconcessions are within sight in France, Holland and Hungary.\n\n\"Among us Germans not only the national but even the commercial\nfranchise is denied, and even a share in the industrial and commercial\ncourts. In the demand for the democratization of German public life our\nlegislators do not seem even to admit the existence of women.\n\n\"But during the war the cooperation of women in public life has\nunostentatiously grown from year to year until to-day the number of\nwomen engaged in various callings in Germany exceeds the number of men.\n\n\"The work they are doing includes all spheres of male activity; without\nthem it would no longer be possible to support the economic life of the\npeople. Women have done their full share in the work of the community.\n\n\"Does not this performance of duty involve the right to share in the\nbuilding up and extension of the social order?\n\n\"The women protest against this lack of political rights, in virtue both\nof their work for the community and of their work as human beings. They\ndemand political equality with men. They demand the direct, equal and\nsecret franchise for all legislative bodies, full equality in the\ncommunes and in legal representation of their interests.\n\n\"This first joint pronouncement on women's demands will be followed by\nothers until the victory of our cause is won.\"\n\n\n[Footnote 3: \"Die Frauenvereine jeder Stadt verbinden sich fuer die Dauer\ndes Krieges zur Organization Nationaler Frauendienst die zu Berlin am\n1ten August begruendet wurde.\"]\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\nWOMEN OVER THE TOP IN AMERICA\n\n\nAmerican women have begun to go over the top. They are going up the\nscaling-ladder and out into All Man's Land. Perhaps love of adventure\ntempts them, perhaps love of money, or a fine spirit of service, but\nwhatever the propelling motive, we are seeing them make the venture.\n\nThere is nothing new in our day in a woman's being paid for her\nwork--some of it. But she has never before been seen in America\nemployed, for instance, as a section hand on a railway. The gangs are\nfew and small as yet, but there the women are big and strong specimens\nof foreign birth. They \"trim\" the ballast and wield the heavy \"tamping\"\ntool with zest. They certainly have muscles, and are tempted to use them\nvigorously at three dollars a day.\n\nIn the machine shops where more skill than strength is called for, the\nAmerican element with its quick wits and deft fingers predominates.\nYoung women are working at the lathe with so much precision and accuracy\nthat solicitude as to what would become of the world if all its men\nmarched off to war is in a measure assuaged. In the push and drive of\nthe industrial world, women are handling dangerous chemicals in making\nflash lights, and T.N.T. for high explosive shells. The American college\ngirl is not as yet transmuting her prowess of the athletic field into\nwork on the anvil, as is the university woman in England, but she has\ndemonstrated her manual strength and skill on the farm with plough\nand harrow.\n\nWomen and girls answer our call for messenger service, and their\nintelligence and courtesy are an improvement upon the manners of the\nyoung barbarians of the race. Women operate elevators, lifting us with\nsafety to the seventh heaven, or plunging us with precision to the\ndepths. There were those at first who refused to entrust their lives to\nsuch frail hands, and there are still some who look concerned when they\nsee a woman at the lever; but on the whole the elevator \"girl\" has\ngained the confidence of her public, and has gained it by skill, not by\nfeminine wiles, for even men won't shoot into space with a woman at the\nhelm whose sole equipment is charm. With need of less skill than the\nelevator operator, but more patience and tact in managing human nature,\nthe woman conductor is getting her patrons into line. We are still a\nlittle embarrassed in her presence. We try not to stare at the\nwell-set-up woman in her sensible uniform, while she on her part tries\nto look unconscious, and with much dignity accomplishes the common aim\nmuch more successfully than do we. She is so attentive to her duties, so\ncourteous, and, withal, so calm and serious that I hope she will abide\nwith us longer than the \"duration of the war.\"\n\nIn short, America is witnessing the beginning of a great industrial and\nsocial change, and even those who regard the situation as temporary\ncannot doubt that the experience will have important reactions. The\ndevelopment is more advanced than it was in Great Britain at a\ncorresponding time, for even before the United States entered the\nconflict women were being recruited in war industries. They have opened\nup every line of service. There is not an occupation in which a woman is\nnot found.\n\nWhen men go a-warring, women go to work.\n\nA distinguished general at the end of the Cuban War, enlarging upon the\npoet's idea of woman's weeping role in wartime, said in a public speech:\n\"When the country called, women put guns in the hands of their soldier\nboys and bravely sent them away. After the good-byes were said there was\nnothing for these women to do but to go back and wait, wait, wait. The\nexcitement of battle was not for them. It was simply a season of anxiety\nand heartrending inactivity.\" Now the fact is, when a great call to arms\nis sounded for the men of a nation, women enlist in the industrial army.\nIf women did indeed sit at home and weep, the enemy would soon conquer.\n\nThe dull census tells the thrilling story. Before our Civil War women\nwere found in less than a hundred trades, at its close in over four\nhundred. The census of 1860 gives two hundred and eighty-five thousand\nwomen in gainful pursuits; that of 1870, one million, eight hundred and\nthirty-six thousand. Of the Transvaal at war, this story was told to me\nby an English officer. He led a small band of soldiers down into the\nBoer country, on the north from Rhodesia, as far as he dared. He \"did\nnot see a man,\" even boys as young as fifteen had joined the army. But\nat the post of economic duty stood the Boer woman; she was tending the\nherds and carrying on all the work of the farm. She was the base of\nsupplies. That was why the British finally put her in a concentration\ncamp. Her man could not be beaten with her at his back.\n\nWar compels women to work. That is one of its merits. Women are forced\nto use body and mind, they are not, cannot be idlers. Perhaps that is\nthe reason military nations hold sway so long; their reign continues,\nnot because they draw strength from the conquered nation, but because\ntheir women are roused to exertion. Active mothers ensure a virile race.\n\nThe peaceful nation, if its women fall victims to the luxury which\nrapidly increasing wealth brings, will decay. If there come no spiritual\nawakening, no sense of responsibility of service, then perhaps war alone\ncan save it. The routing of idleness and ease by compulsory labor is the\ngood counterbalancing some of the evil.\n\nThe rapidly increasing employment of women to-day, then, is the usual,\nand happy, accompaniment of war. But the development has its opponents,\nand that is nothing new, either. Let us look them over one by one. The\nmost mischievous objector is the person, oftenest a woman, who says the\nwar will be short, and fundamental changes, therefore, should not be\nmade. This agreeable prophecy does not spring from a heartening belief\nin victory, but only from the procrastinating attitude, \"Why get ready?\"\nTo prepare for anything less certain than death seems folly to many of\nthe sex, over-trained in patient waiting.\n\nThen there is the official who constantly sees the seamy side of\nindustrial life and who concludes--we can scarcely blame him--that \"it\nwould be well if women were excluded entirely from factory life.\" The\nbad condition of industrial surroundings bulks large in his mind, and\nthe value of organized work to us mortals bulks small. We are all too\ninclined to forget that the need for work cannot be eliminated, but the\nunhealthy process in a dangerous trade can. Clean up the factory, rather\nthan clean out the women, is a sound slogan.\n\nAnd then comes the objector who is exercised as to the effect of paid\nwork upon woman's charm. Solicitude on this score is often buried in a\nwoman's heart. It was a woman, the owner of a large estate, who when\nproposing to employ women asked how many men she would have to hire in\naddition, \"to dig, plough and do all the hard work.\" On learning that\nthe college units do everything on a farm, she queried anxiously, \"But\nhow about their corsets?\" To the explanation, \"They don't wear any,\"\ncame the regret, \"What a pity to make themselves so unattractive!\"\n\nI have heard fear expressed, too, lest sex attraction be lost through\nwork on army hats, the machinery being noisy and the operative, if she\ntalk, running the danger of acquiring a sharp, high voice. One could but\nwonder if most American women work on army hats.\n\nAmong the women actually employed, I have found without exception a fine\nspirit of service. So many of them have a friend or brother \"over\nthere,\" that backing up the boys makes a strong personal appeal. But\nsome of the women who have left factory life behind are adopting an\nattitude towards the present industrial situation as lacking in vision\nas in patriotism. Throughout a long discussion in which some of these\nwomen participated I was able to follow and get their point of view. To\nthem a woman acting as a messenger, an elevator operator, or a trolley\nconductor, was anathema, and the tempting of women into these\nemployments seemed but the latest vicious trick of the capitalist. The\nconductor in her becoming uniform was most reprehensible, and her\nevident satisfaction in her job suggested to her critics that she merely\nwas trying to play a melodramatic part \"as a war hero.\" In any case, the\nconductor's occupation was one no woman should be in, \"crowded and\npushed about as she is.\" It was puzzling to know why it was regarded as\nright for a woman to pay five cents and be pushed, and unbecoming for\nanother woman to be paid eighteen dollars and ninety cents a week and\nrun the risk of a jolt when stepping outside her barrier.\n\nBut the ideals of yesterday fail to make their appeal. It is not the\npsychological moment to urge, on the ground of comfort, the woman's\nright to protection. The contrast between the trenches and the street\ncar or factory is too striking. But it is, however, the exact moment to\nplead for better care of workers, both women and men, because their\nhealth and skill are as necessary in attaining the national aim as the\nsoldiers' prowess and well-being. It is the time to advocate the\nprotection of the worker from long hours, because the experience of\nEurope has proved that a greater and better output is achieved when a\nshort day is strictly adhered to, when the weekly half-holiday is\nenjoyed, and Sunday rest respected. The United States is behind other\ngreat industrial countries in legal protection for the workers. War\nrequirements may force us to see in the health of the worker the\ngreatest of national assets. Meantime, whether approved or not, the\nAmerican woman is going over the top. Four hundred and more are busy on\naeroplanes at the Curtiss works. The manager of a munition shop where\nto-day but fifty women are employed, is putting up a dormitory to\naccommodate five hundred. An index of expectation! Five thousand are\nemployed by the Remington Arms Company at Bridgeport. At the\nInternational Arms and Fuse Company at Bloomfield, New Jersey, two\nthousand, eight hundred are employed. The day I visited the place, in\none of the largest shops women had only just been put on the work, but\nit was expected that in less than a month they would be found handling\nall of the twelve hundred machines under that one roof alone.\n\nThe skill of the women staggers one. After a week or two they master the\noperations on the \"turret,\" gauging and routing machines. The best\nworker on the \"facing\" machine is a woman. She is a piece worker, as\nmany of the women are, and is paid at the same rate as men. This woman\nearned, the day I saw her, five dollars and forty cents. She tossed\nabout the fuse parts, and played with that machine, as I would with a\nbaby. Perhaps it was in somewhat the same spirit--she seemed to\nlove her toy.\n\nMost of the testers and inspectors are women. They measure the parts\nstep by step, and weigh the completed fuse, carrying off the palm for\nreliability. The manager put it, \"for inspection the women are more\nconscientious than men. They don't measure or weigh just one piece,\nshoving along a half-dozen untouched and let it go at that. They test\neach.\" That did not surprise me, but I was not prepared to hear that the\nwomen do not have so many accidents as men, or break the machines so\noften. In explanation, the manager threw over an imaginary lever with\nvigor sufficient to shake the factory, \"Men put their whole strength on,\nwomen are more gentle and patient.\"\n\nNor are the railways neglecting to fill up gaps in their working force\nwith women. The Pennsylvania road, it is said, has recruited some seven\nhundred of them. In the Erie Railroad women are not only engaged as\n\"work classifiers\" in the locomotive clerical department, but hardy\nPolish women are employed in the car repair shops. They move great\nwheels as if possessed of the strength of Hercules. And in the\nlocomotive shops I found women working on drill-press machines with\nease and skill. Just as I came up to one operator, she lifted an engine\ntruck-box to the table and started drilling out the studs. She had been\nat the work only a month, and explained her skill by the information\nthat she was Swedish, and had always worked with her husband in their\nauto-repair shop. All the other drill-press hands and the \"shapers,\"\ntoo, were Americans whose husbands, old employees, were now \"over\nthere.\" Not one seemed to have any sense of the unusual; even the little\nblond check-clerk seated in her booth at the gates of the works with her\nbrass discs about her had in a few months' time changed a revolution\ninto an established custom. She and the discs seemed old friends. Women\nare adaptable.\n\n[Illustration: _Copyright by Underwood and Underwood_\nThe daily round in the Erie Railroad workshops.]\n\nBut everywhere I gathered the impression that the men are a bit uneasy.\nA foreman in one factory pointed out a man who \"would not have voted for\nsuffrage\" had he guessed that women were \"to rush in and gobble\neverything up.\" I tried to make him see that it wasn't the vote that\ngave the voracious appetite, but necessity or desire to serve. And in\nany case, women do not push men out, they push them up. In not a single\ninstance did I hear of a man being turned off to make a place for a\nwoman. He had left his job to go into the army, or was advanced to\nheavier or more skilled work.\n\nAs to how many women have supplanted men, or poured into the new war\nindustries, no figures are available. One guess has put it at a million.\nBut that is merely a guess. I have seen them by the tens, the hundreds,\nthe thousands. The number is large and rapidly increasing. We may know\nthat something important is happening when even the government takes\nnote. The United States Labor Department has recognized the new-comers\nby establishing a Division of Women's Work with branches in every State.\nIt looks as if these bureaus of employment would not be idle, with a\nshowing of one thousand, five hundred applicants the first week the New\nYork office was opened. It is to be hoped that this government effort\nwill save the round pegs from getting into the square holes.\n\nBut even the round peg in the round hole brings difficulties. When Adam\nSmith asserted that of all sorts of luggage man was the most difficult\nto move, he forgot woman! The instant women are carried into a new\nindustry, they bring with them puzzling problems. Where shall we put\ntheir coats and picture hats, how shall we cover up their hair, what\nshall we feed them with? They must have lockers and rest rooms, caps\nand overalls, and above all, canteens. The munition workers, the\nconductors, in fact, all women in active work, get prodigiously hungry.\nThey have made a regiment of dietitians think about calories. Here is\nwhat one of the street railways in New York City offered them on a\ngiven day:--\n\nTomato soup         10c. or with an order 5c.\nRoast leg of veal   16c.\nBeef                16c.\nLamb fricassee      16c.\nHam steak           16c.\nLiver and onions    16c.\nSirloin steak       30c.\nSmall steak         20c.\nHam and eggs        20c.\nHam omelet          20c.\n_Regular dinner_\n  Soup, meat,\n  Vegetable,\n  Dessert, coffee   25c.\nRice pudding         5c.\nPie                  5c.\nCake                 5c.\nBanana or orange     5c.\n\nThe canteen is open every hour of the twenty-four, and the women\nconductors at the end of each run usually take a bite, and then have a\nsubstantial meal during the long break of an hour and a half in the\nmiddle of the ten-hour day.\n\nAnother problem brought to us by women in industry is, how can we house\nthem? The war industries have drawn large numbers to new centers. The\nhaphazard accommodation which men win put up with, won't satisfy women.\nThey demand more, and get more. To attract the best type of women the\nmunition plants are putting up dormitories to accommodate hundreds of\nworkers, and are making their plants more attractive, with rest rooms\nand hospital accommodation. Take, for instance, the Briggs and Stratton\nCompany, which in order to draw high grade workers built its new factory\nin one of the best sections of Milwaukee. The workrooms are as clean as\nthe proverbial Dutch woman's doorstep. From the top of the benches to\nthe ceiling the walls are glass to ensure daylight in every corner, and\nby night the system of indirect lighting gives such perfectly diffused\nlight that not a heavy shadow falls anywhere. And the hospital room and\nnurse--well, one would rejoice to have an accident daily!\n\nThe factory may become the exemplar for the home. The professional\nwoman is going over the top, and with a good opinion of herself. \"I can\ndo this work better than any man,\" was the announcement made by a young\nwoman from the Pacific Coast as she descended upon the city hall in an\neastern town, credentials in her hand, and asked for the position of\ncity chemist. There was not a microbe she did not know to its undoing,\nor a deadly poison she could not bring from its hiding place. The town\nhad suffered from graft, and the mayor, thinking a woman might scare the\nthieves as well as the bacteria, appointed the chemist who believed in\nherself. And she is just one of many who have been taking up such work.\n\nFormerly two-thirds of the positions filled by the New York\nIntercollegiate Bureau of Occupations were secretarial or teaching\npositions; now three-fourths of its applicants have been placed as\nphysicists, chemists, office managers, sanitary experts, exhibit\nsecretaries, and the like. The temporary positions used to outnumber the\npermanent placements; at present the reverse is true. Of the women\nplaced, four times as many as formerly get salaries ranging above\neighteen hundred dollars a year.\n\nThe story told at the employment bureaus in connection with professional\nsocieties and clubs such as the Chemists' Club is the same. Women are\nbeing placed not merely as teachers of chemistry or as routine\nlaboratory workers in hospitals, but also as experimental and control\nchemists in industrial plants. In the great rolling mills they are\ntesting steel, at the copper smelters they are found in the\nlaboratories. The government has thrown doors wide open to\ncollege-trained women. They are physicists and chemists in the United\nStates Bureaus of Standards, Mines, and Soils, sanitary experts in\nmilitary camps, research chemists in animal nutrition and fertilizers at\nstate experiment stations.\n\nBut the industrial barrier is the one most recently scaled. Women are\nnow found as analytical, research or control chemists in the canneries,\nin dye and electrical works, in flour and paper mills, in insecticide\ncompanies, and cement works. They test the steel that will carry us\nsafely on our journeys, they pass upon the chemical composition of the\nflavor in our cake, as heads of departments in metal refining companies\nthey determine the kind of copper battery we shall use, and they have a\nfinger in our liquid glues, household oils and polishes.\n\nAnd the awakened spirit of social responsibility has opened new\ncallings. The college woman not only is beginning to fill welfare\npositions inside the factory, but is acting as protective officer in\ntowns near military camps. Perhaps one of the newest and most\ninteresting positions is that of \"employment secretary.\" The losing of\nemployees has become so serious and general that big industries have\nengaged women who devote their time to looking up absentees and finding\nout why each worker left.\n\nAnd so we see on all hands women breaking through the old accustomed\nbounds.\n\nNot only as workers but as voters, the war has called women over the\ntop. Since that fateful August, 1914, four provinces of Canada and the\nDominion itself have raised the banner of votes for women. Nevada and\nMontana declared for suffrage before the war was four months old, and\nDenmark enfranchised its women before the year was out. And when America\nwent forth to fight for democracy abroad, Arkansas, Michigan, Vermont,\nNebraska, North Dakota, Rhode Island, began to lay the foundations of\nfreedom at home, and New York in no faltering voice proclaimed full\nliberty for all its people. Lastly Great Britain has enfranchised its\nwomen, and surely the Congress of the United States will not lag behind\nthe Mother of Parliaments!\n\nThe world is facing changes as great as the breaking up of the feudal\nsystem. Causes as fundamental, more wide-spread, and more cataclysmic\nare at work than at the end of the Middle Ages. Among the changes none\nis more marked than the intensified development in what one may call,\nfor lack of a better term, the woman movement. The advance in political\nfreedom has moved steadily forward during the past quarter of a century,\nbut in the last three years progress has been intense and striking.\n\nThe peculiarity in attainment of political democracy for women has lain\nin the fact that while for men economic freedom invariably preceded\npolitical enfranchisement, in the case of women the conferring of the\nvote in no single case was related to the stage which the enfranchised\ngroup had attained in the matter of economic independence. Nowhere were\neven those women who were entirely lacking in economic freedom, excluded\non that account from any extension of suffrage. Even in discussions of\nthe right of suffrage no reference has ever been made, in dealing with\nwomen's claim, to the relation, universally recognized in the case of\nmen, of political enfranchisement to economic status. Serfdom gave way\nto the wage system before democracy developed for men, and the <DW52>\nman was emancipated before he was enfranchised. For this reason the\ncoming of women as paid workers over the top may be regarded as\nepoch-making.\n\nIn any case, self-determination is certainly a strong element in\nattaining any real political freedom.\n\nComplete service to their country in this crisis may lead women to that\neconomic freedom which will change a political possession into a\npolitical power. But the requirement is readiness to do, and to do well,\nthe task which offers. Man-power must give itself unreservedly at the\nfront. Women must show not only eagerness but fitness to substitute for\nman-power. It will hearten the nation, help to make the path clear, if\nindividual women declare that though the call to them has not yet come\nfor a definite service, the time of waiting will not be spent in\ncomplaint, nor yet in foolish busy-ness, but in careful and\nconscientious training for useful work.\n\nEach woman must prepare so that when the nation's need arises, she can\nstand at salute and say, \"Here is your servant, trained and ready.\"\nWomen are not driven over the top. Through self-discipline, they go over\nit of their own accord.\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\nEVE'S PAY ENVELOPE\n\n\nNo woman is a cross between an angel and a goose. She is a very human\ncreature. She has many of man's sins and some virtues of her own.\n\nMoving up from slavery through all the various forms of\nserfdom--attachment to the soil, confinement to a given trade, exclusion\nfrom citizenship, payment in kind, on to full economic freedom, men have\nshown definite reactions at each step. Women respond to the\nsame stimuli.\n\nThe free man is a better worker than slave or serf. So is the free\nwoman. All the old gibes at her ineptitudes have broken their points\nagainst the actualities of her ability as a wage worker. The free man is\nmore alert to obligation, more conscientious in performance, than the\nbond servant. So is the free woman. With pay envelope, or pension, Eve\nis a better helpmate and mother than ever before.\n\nThe free man carries a lighter heart than the villain. So does the free\nwoman. Men have always borne personal grief more easily than women;\nobservers remarked the fact. The reason is the same. An absorbing\noccupation, ordered and regarded as important, which brings a return\nallowing the recipient to patronize what he or she thinks wise, that\nbrings happiness, not boisterous, but dignified. It may be a holocaust\nthrough which Eve gains that pay envelope, but the material possession\nbrings gratification nevertheless. It is a tiny straw showing the set of\nthe wind that leisure class British women, however large their unearned\nbank account, show no reluctance to accept pay for their work, and full\nresponsibility in their new position of employee.\n\nWomen are supposed to have liked to serve for mere love of service, for\nlove of child, love of husband. There is, of course, many a subtle\nrelation which can't be weighed and paid for; but toil, even for one's\nvery own hearthstone, can be valued in hard cash. The daughters of Eve,\nno less than the sons of Adam, react happily to a recognition that\nexpresses itself in a fair wage.\n\nThe verdict comes from all sides that women were never more content. Of\ncourse they are content. The weight of suppression is being lifted. For\nmany their drudgery is for the first time paid for. Is not that\ninvigorating? The pay envelope is equal to that of men. Is not that a\nnew experience giving self-respect? Eve often finds her pay envelope\nheavier than that of the man working at her side. Right there in her\nhand, then, she holds proof that the old prejudice against her as an\ninferior worker is ill-founded.\n\nWomen are finding themselves. Even America's Eve discovers that pains\nand aches are not \"woman's lot.\" She is under no curse in the twentieth\ncentury. With eighteen dollars a week for ringing up fares, and a\npossible thirty-five for \"facing\" fuse-parts, nothing can persuade her\nto be poor-spirited. She radiates the atmosphere, \"I am needed!\" Doors\nfly open to her. She is welcome everywhere. No one seems to be able to\nget too many of her kind. Politicians compete for her favor, employers\nquarrel over her. It makes her breathe deep to have the Secretary of the\nNavy summon her to the United States arsenals, pay her for her work, and\ncall her a patriot.\n\n[Illustration: In the well-lighted factory of the Briggs and Stratton\nCompany, Milwaukee, the girls are comfortably and becomingly garbed\nfor work.]\n\nAnd with the pay envelope women remain clearly human. Their purchases\noften reflect past denials, rather than present needs or even tastes.\nWhen set free one always buys what the days of dependence deprived one\nof. One of Boston's leading merchants told me that Selfridge in London\nwas selling more jaunty ready-to-wear dresses than ever before. It was\npart of John Bull's discipline in ante-bellum dependent days to keep his\nwomen folk dowdy. The Lancashire lass with head shawl and pattens, the\nwearer of the universal sailor hat, in these days of independence and\npounds, shillings and pence, are taking note of the shop windows. And\nJohn is not turning his eyes away from his women folk in their day of\nself-determination.\n\nBut it is not to be concluded that it is all beer and skittles for Eve.\nWith a pay envelope and a vote come responsibilities. Public sympathy\nhas backed up laws cutting down long hours of work for women. The trade\nunions, with a thought to possible competitors, have favored protecting\nthem from night work. Has Eve been a bit spoiled? Has she let herself\ntoo easily be classed with children and allowed a line to be drawn\nbetween men and women in industry? Is it a bit of woman's proverbial\nlogic to demand special protection, and at the same time insist upon\n\"equal pay for equal work\"?\n\nThe hopelessness of attaining the promise of the slogan is well\nillustrated in the case of a gray haired woman I once met in a London\nprinting shop. In her early days she had been one of the women taken on\nby the famous printing firm of McCorquodale. That was before protective\nlegislation applied to women. She became a highly skilled printer,\nearning more than any man in the shop. When there was pressure of work\nshe was always one of the group of experts chosen to carry through the\nrush order. That meant on occasion overtime or night work. Then she went\non to tell me how her skill was checked in her very prime. Regulations\nas to women's labor were gradually fixed in the law. All the printers in\nthe shop, she said, favored the laws limiting her freedom but not\ntheirs. Soon her wages reflected the contrast. Her employer called her\nto his office one day and explained, \"I cannot afford to pay you as much\nas the men any longer. You are not worth as much to me, not being able\nto work Saturday afternoon, at night, or overtime.\" She was put on lower\ngrade work and her pay envelope grew slight.\n\nThis woman was not discussing the value of shorter working hours, she\nwas pointing out that \"equal pay\" cannot rule for an entire group of\nworkers when restrictions apply to part of the group and not to the\nwhole body. We meet here, not a theory, but an incontrovertible fact.\nPay is not equal, and cannot be, where conditions are wholly unequal.\nProtection for the woman worker means exactly what it would mean for the\nalien man if by law he were forbidden to work Saturday afternoon,\novertime or at night, while the citizen worker was without restriction.\nThe alien would be cut off from advancement in every trade in which he\ndid not by overwhelming numbers dominate the situation, he would be kept\nto lower grade processes, he would receive much lower pay than the\nunprotected worker.\n\nWhat common sense would lead us to expect in the hypothetical case of an\nalien man, has happened for the woman worker. Oddly enough she has not\nherself asked for this protection, but it has been urged very largely by\nwomen not of the industrial class. Women teachers, doctors, lawyers,\nwomen of leisure are the advocates of special legislation for industrial\nwomen. And yet in their own case they are entirely reasonable, and ask\nno favors. The woman teacher, and quite truly, insists that she works as\nhard and as long hours as the man in her grade of service, and on that\nsound foundation she builds her just demand for equal pay. Women doctors\nand lawyers have never asked for other than a square deal in their\nprofessions.\n\nIt would be well, perhaps, if industrial women were permitted to guide\ntheir own ship. They have knowledge enough to reach a safe harbor. There\nwas a hint that they were about to assume the helm when the rank and\nfile of union workers voted down at the conference of the Women's Trade\nUnion League the resolution proposing a law to forbid women acting as\nconductors. It was also suggestive when a woman rose and asked of the\nspeaker on dangerous trades, whether \"men did not suffer from exposure\nto fumes, acids and dust.\"\n\nWomen have so long been urging that they are people, that they have\nforgotten, perchance, that men are people also. Men respond to rest and\nrecreation as do human beings of the opposite sex. All workers need, and\nboth sexes should have, protection. But if only one sex in industrial\nlife can have bulwarks thrown up about it, men should be the favored\nones just now. They are few, they are precious, they should be wrapped\nin cotton wool.\n\nThe industrial woman should stand unqualifiedly for the exclusion of\nchildren from gainful pursuits. Many years ago the British government\nhad Miss Collett, one of the Labor Correspondents of the Board of\nTrade, make a special study of the influence of the employment of\nmarried women on infant mortality. The object was to prove that there\nwas direct cause and effect. The investigator, after an exhaustive study\ncovering many industrial centers, brought back the report, \"Not proven.\"\nBut the statistics showed one most interesting relation. In districts\nwhere the prevailing custom permitted the employment of children as\nearly as the law allowed, infant mortality was high, and in districts\nwhere few children were employed, infant mortality was low. No\nexplanation of this striking revelation was made in the report, but many\nwho commented on the tables, pointed out that the wide-spread employment\nof the population in its early years sapped the vitality of the\ncommunity to such an extent that its offspring were weakened. In other\nwords, the employment of the immature child, more than the employment of\nthat child when grown and married, works harm to the race.\n\nThe woman with a pay envelope must not, then, be willing to swell the\nfamily budget by turning her children into the wage market. For if she\ndoes, she creates a dangerous competitor for herself, and puts in\ncertain jeopardy the virility of her nation. But in this war time women\nhave secured more than new and larger pay envelopes, for each\nbelligerent has reckoned up the woman's worth as mother in coin of the\nrealm. It is enough to turn Eve's head--pay and pensions accorded her\nall at once.\n\nAllowances to dependents are more, however, than financial expedients.\nThey are part of the psychological stage-setting of the Great War. The\nfighting man must be more than well-fed, well-clothed, well-equipped,\nmore than assured of care if ill or wounded; he must have his mind\nundisturbed by conditions at home. Governments now know that there must\nbe no just cause for complaint in the family at the rear, if the man at\nthe front is to be fully effective. In the interest of the fighting\nline, governments dare not leave the home to the haphazard care\nof charity.\n\nAnd so the great belligerents have adopted systems for an uninterrupted\nflow of money aid to the hearthstone. The wife feels dependence on the\nnation for which she and her man are making sacrifices, the soldier has\na sense of closer relationship with the country's cause for which he\nfights. Content at home and sense of gratitude in the trenches build up\nloyalty everywhere. The state allowance answers an economic want and a\npsychological necessity.\n\nIt is part of our national lack of technique that we were slow to make\nprovision for the dependents of enlisted men, and even then were not\nwhole hearted. It may have been our inherited distrust of the conscript\nthat led us to feel that only by his volunteering something will a\nprecious antidote be administered to the spirit of the drafted man. To\nprotect his individualism from taint, the United States soldier must\nbear part of the financial burden. Europe, on the other hand, is working\non a basis of reciprocity. The nation exacts service from the man and\ngives complete service to his dependents. In America the man is bound to\nserve the community, but the community is not bound to serve him. And\nyet in our case there is peculiar need of this even exchange of\nobligations. The care of parents in the United States falls directly\nupon their children, while some of our allies had, even before the war,\ncarefully devised laws regulating pensions to the aged.\n\nBut first let us get the simple skeleton of the various allowance laws\nin mind. The scale of the allowance in different countries adapts itself\nto national standards and varying cost of living. The Canadian allowance\nseems the most generous. At least one-half of the soldier's pay is\ngiven directly to his dependents. The government gives an additional\ntwenty dollars and the donations of the Patriotic Fund bring up the\nmonthly allowance of a wife with three children to sixty dollars. The\nallowance, as might be expected, is low in Italy. The soldier's wife\ngets eight-tenths of a lira a day, each child four-tenths lira, and\neither a father or mother alone eight-tenths lira, or if both are\nliving, one and three-tenths lire together. The British allowance is\nmuch higher, the wife getting twelve shillings and sixpence a week. If\nshe has one child, the weekly allowance rises to nineteen and sixpence;\nif two children, to twenty-four and sixpence; if three, to twenty-eight\nshillings; and if there are four or more children, the mother receives\nthree shillings a week for each extra child.\n\nBetween the extremes of Italy and England stands France, the wife\nreceiving one franc twenty-five centimes a day, each child under sixteen\nyears of age twenty-five centimes, and a dependent parent seventy-five\ncentimes. Japan grants no government allowance. A Japanese official, in\nresponse to my inquiry, wrote, \"Relations the first and friends the next\ntry to help the dependents as far as possible, but if they have neither\nrelatives nor friends who have sufficient means to help them, then the\nassociation consisting of ladies or the municipal officials afford\nsubvention to them.\"\n\nUnder the law passed by Congress in October, 1917, an American private\nreceiving thirty-three dollars a month when on service abroad must allot\nfifteen dollars a month to his wife, and the government adds to this\ntwenty-five dollars, and if there is one child, an additional ten\ndollars, with five dollars for each additional child. A man can secure\nan allowance from the government of ten dollars a month to a dependent\nparent, if he allots five dollars a month. Such are the bare bones of\nthe allowance schemes of the Allies on the western front.\n\nIn the United States the general policy of exemption boards, as\nsuggested by the central authorities, is most disciplinary as regards\nwomen. Their capacity for self-support is rigidly inquired into. Our men\nare definitely urging women to a position of economic independence. The\naim is, while securing soldiers for the army, to relieve the government\nof the expense of dependency on the part of women. There is no doubt\nthat our men at least are faced toward the future. No less indicative\nis it of a new world that the allowance laws of all the western\nbelligerents recognize common-law marriages. In our own law, marriage is\n\"presumed if the man and woman have lived together in the openly\nacknowledged relation of husband and wife during two years immediately\npreceding the date of the declaration of war.\" And the illegitimate\nchild stands equal with the legitimate provided the father acknowledges\nthe child or has been \"judicially ordered or decreed to contribute\" to\nthe child's support.\n\nMen are feminists. Their hearts have softened even towards the wife's\nrelatives, for the word \"parent\" is not only broad enough to cover the\nfather, mother, grandparents or stepfather and mother of the man, but\n\"of the spouse\" also. Thus passeth the curse of the mother-in-law.\n\nOne need not be endowed with the spirit of prophecy to foretell that\n\"allowances\" in war time will broaden out into motherhood pensions in\npeace times. It would be an ordinary human reaction should the woman\nenjoying a pension refuse to give up, on the day peace is declared, her\nquickly acquired habit of holding the purse strings. That would be\naccepting international calm at the expense of domestic differences.\nThe social value of encouraging the mother's natural feeling of\nresponsibility toward her child by putting into her hands a state\npension is being, let us note, widely tested, and may demonstrate the\nwisdom and economy of devoting public funds to mothers rather than to\ncreches and juvenile asylums.\n\nThe allowance laws may prove the charter of woman's liberties;\nher pay envelope may become her contract securing the right of\nself-determination.\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\nPOOLING BRAINS\n\n\n\"Employ them.\" This was the advice given to a large conference of women\nmet to discuss business opportunities for their sex. The advice was\nvouchsafed by a young lawyer after the problem of opening wider fields\nto women in the legal profession had been looked at from every angle,\nonly to end in the question, \"What can we do to increase their\npractice?\" She spoke with animation, as if she had found the key to the\nsituation, \"Employ them.\" Perhaps more self-accusation than\ndetermination to mend their ways was roused by the short and\npointed remark.\n\nThe advice has wider application. Taking thirty names of women at\nrandom, I learned in response to an inquiry that only four had women\nphysicians, two had women lawyers, and only one, a woman dentist.\nTwenty-five women of large real estate holdings had never even for the\nmost unimportant work secured the services of an architect of their own\nsex. Further inquiry brought out the fact that of a long list of\nwomen's clubs and associations which have built or altered property for\ntheir purposes, only one had engaged a woman architect.\n\nPerhaps it is indicative of a lack of nothing more serious than a sense\nof humor, that we women unite and, apparently without embarrassment,\ndemand that masculine presidents, governors, mayors and legislatures\nshall appoint women to office. This unabashed faith in the good will of\nmen seems not misplaced, for not only do public men show some confidence\nin the official capacity of women, but to my inquiry as to whom was due\ntheir opportunities to \"get on,\" business women invariably replied,\n\"To men.\"\n\nHowever, the loyalty of women to women is increasing, and their\nsolidarity on sound lines of service is a thing of steady growth.\nThoughtful women, for instance, do not wish a woman put in a position of\nresponsibility simply because she is a woman, but they are even more\nopposed to having a candidate of peculiar fitness overlooked merely\nbecause she is not a man. While the conscientious and poised women are\nnot willing to urge any and every woman for a given office, they do\ntenaciously hold that there are positions which cry aloud for women and\nfor which the right women should he found. In conquering a fair field,\nwomen will have to pool their brains even more effectively than they\nhave in the past.\n\nOur efforts at combination are a mere mushroom growth compared with the\ngenerations of training our big brothers have had in pooling brains. War\nand the chase gave them their first lessons in cooperation, nor has war\nbeen a bad teacher for women.\n\nJust as the Crimean War and our Civil War put Florence Nightingale and\nClara Barton and the trained nurse on the map, this war is bringing the\nmedical woman to the fore. Women surgeons and doctors, unlike many other\ngroups, offer themselves fully trained for service. They know they have\nsomething to give, and they know the soldiers' need.\n\nAccording to an official statement, the emergency call of the army for\nmen physicians and surgeons fell two thousand short of being answered.\nThe necessity of the soldier and the skill of the women will no doubt in\nthe end be brought effectively together; for although the government of\nthe United States, like Great Britain in the early days of the war, has\nleft to ever farseeing France the honor of extending hospitality to\nAmerican women doctors, their strong national organization, with a\nmembership of four thousand, will in time, no doubt, persuade Uncle Sam\nto take his plucky women doctors over the top under the Stars and\nStripes! Organization crystallized about an unselfish desire and skilled\nability to serve is irresistible.\n\nThe pooling of the brains of women that has been going on on a\ncountry-wide scale for more than a half-century bears analyzing. These\nassociations have almost invariably centered about a service to be\nrendered. Even the first petition for political enfranchisement urged it\nas the \"duty of the women of this country to secure to themselves the\nelective franchise.\" Unselfishness draws numbers as a magnet draws steel\nfilings. The spirit of service lying at the heart of the great national\norganizations made possible quick response to new duties immediately\nupon our entrance into the war. The suffragists said, We wish to serve\nand we are ready for service. The government used their wide-spread net\nof local centers for purposes of registrations and war appeals.\n\nNaturally there were many efforts more foolish than effective in the\nuniversal rush to help. America was not peculiar in this, nor for the\nmatter of that, were women. War!--it does make the blood course through\nthe veins. Every generous citizen cries aloud, \"What can I do?\" Perhaps\nmen are a little more voluble than women, their emotions not finding\nsuch immediate and approved vent along clicking needles and tangled\nskeins of wool. On the whole, the initiative and organizing ability of\nwomen has stood out supremely.\n\nOf the two departments of the Red Cross which are still left in the\ncommand of women, the Bureau of Nursing, with Miss Delano at its head,\nmobilized immediately three thousand of the fourteen thousand nurses\nenrolled. The first Red Cross Medical Unit with its full quota of\nsixty-five nurses completely equipped stood on European soil before an\nAmerican soldier was there. Of the forty-nine units ready for service,\ntwelve, with from sixty-five to one hundred nurses each, are now in\nFrance. Two of the five units organized for the navy, each with its\nforty active nurses and twenty reserves, are established abroad, and two\nhundred and thirty nurses are already in active naval service here. Miss\nDelano holds constantly in reserve fifteen hundred nurses as emergency\ndetachments, a reservoir from which some eight hundred have been drawn\nfor cantonment hospitals. An inflow of nearly one thousand nurses each\nmonth keeps the reservoir ready to meet the drain.\n\nThe Chapter work-rooms sprang up at a call in the night. No one can help\nadmiring their well-ordered functioning. There may be criticism,\ngrumbling, but the work-room is moving irresistibly, like a well-oiled\nmachine. And women are the motive power from start to finish. The\nChapters, with their five million members joined in three thousand units\nover the United States, are so many monuments to the ability of women\nfor detail. Once mobilized, the women have thus far been able to serve\ntwo thousand war hospitals with surgical dressings, and to send abroad\nthirteen million separate articles packed carefully, boxed, labelled and\naccounted for on their books.\n\nNot only does this directing of manual work stand to the credit of the\nChapters, but they have given courses of lectures in home nursing and\ndietetics to thirty-four thousand women, and in first aid; ten thousand\nclasses have been held and seventy-five thousand certificates issued to\nthe proficient. Certainly one object of the Red Cross, \"to stimulate the\nvolunteer work of women,\" has been accomplished.\n\nIt is difficult to understand why, with such examples of women's\nefficiency before it, the Red Cross, founded by Clara Barton, places\nmerely two bureaus in the hands of a woman, has chosen no woman as an\nofficer, has put but one woman on its central and executive committee,\nand not a single woman on its present controlling body, the War Council.\nIt may be that the protest against the centralization of all volunteer\neffort in the Red Cross, in spite of President Wilson's appeal, was due\nto the fact that women feared that their energies, running to other\nlines than nursing and surgical dressings, would be entirely\nsidetracked.\n\nThe honor of the splendid war work of the Young Women's Christian\nAssociation belongs to women. The War Work Council of the National Board\nof Young Women's Christian Associations shows an example of how\nimmediately efficient an established organization can be in an\nemergency. As one sees its great War Fund roll up, one exclaims, \"What\nmoney raisers women are!\" The immediate demands upon the fund are for\nHostess Houses at cantonments where soldiers can meet their women\nvisitors, dormitories providing emergency housing for women employees at\ncertain army centers, the strengthening of club work among the younger\ngirls of the nation, profoundly affected by war conditions, and the\nsending of experienced organizers to cooeperate with the women leaders\nof France and Russia and to install nurses' huts at the base hospitals\nof France. It makes one's heart beat high to think of women spending\nmillions splendidly, they who have always been told to save pennies\nfrugally! Well, those hard days were times of training; women learned\nnot to waste.\n\nA very worthy pooling of brains, because springing up with no tradition\nbehind it, was the National League for Woman's Service. In six months it\ndrew to itself two hundred thousand members and built organizations in\nthirty-nine States, established classes to train women for the new work\nopening to them, opened recreation centers and canteens at which were\nentertained on a single Sunday, at one center, eighteen hundred soldiers\nand sailors. So excellent was its Bureau of Registration and Information\nfor women workers that the United States Department of Labor took over\nnot only the files and methods of the Woman's League for Service, but\nthe entire staff with Miss Obenauer at its head. If imitation is the\nsincerest flattery, what shall we say of complete adoption of work and\nworkers, with an honorable \"by your leave\" and outspoken praise! And\nnothing could show a finer spirit of service than this yielding up of\nwork initiated by a civil society and the willing passing of it into\ngovernment hands.\n\nNot only the Labor Department has established a special women's division\nwith a woman at its head, but the Ordnance Office of the War Department\nhas opened in its Industrial Service Section a woman's division, putting\nMiss Mary Van Kleeck in charge.\n\nBut still our government lags behind our Allies in mobilizing woman's\npower of initiative and her organizing faculty. The Woman's Committee\nof the Council of National Defense, appointed soon after the outbreak of\nwar, still has no administrative power. As one member of the Committee\nsays, \"We are not allowed to do anything without the consent of the\nCouncil of National Defense. There is no appropriation for the Woman's\nCommittee. We are furnished with headquarters, stationery, some printing\nand two stenographers, but nothing more. It is essential that we raise\nmoney to carry on the other expenses. The great trouble is that now, as\nalways, men want women to do the work while they do the overseeing.\"\n\n[Illustration: The women of the Motor Corps of the National League for\nWoman's Service refuting the traditions that women have neither strength\nnor endurance.]\n\nPerhaps holding the helm has become second nature to men simply because\nthey have held the helm so long, but I am inclined to think they have a\nvery definite desire to have women help steer the ship. Surely the\nreadiness with which they are sharing their political power with women,\nwould seem to indicate their wish for cooperation on a plan of\nperfect equality.\n\nIn any case, it is not necessary to hang on the skirts of government.\nAmerica has always shown evidence of greater gift in private enterprise\nthan state action. Perhaps women will demonstrate the national\ncharacteristic. It was farsighted\n\n### Summary:\n\n"}
