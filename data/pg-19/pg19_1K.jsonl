He is more than five times as big\nas an ox. But he is a harmless creature, for all that. When he is\nwild, and lives in the woods, he will run away, if you attempt to go\nnear him. When he is tame, he will take a piece of cake out of your\npocket, and let you ride upon his back.\n\n\n[Illustration: Ourang Outang.]\n\nThe Ourang Outang is a species of the ape; it has long arms and hands,\nwith very long fingers. It is much larger than the ape, and some have\nbeen found about six feet high, when standing erect. It is capable of\nwalking nearly erect; but the usual gait on the ground is like a\n<DW36> who supports himself on his hands, and draws his body forward.\nIts home, like the monkey family, seems to be on the trees. The hair\nis of a brownish red color, and covers his back, arms, legs, and the\noutside of his hands and feet. The face has no hair except whiskers on\nits side. He inhabits Malacca, Cochin China, and particularly the\nisland of Borneo.\n\n\n[Illustration: Opossums.]\n\nThe Opossum is an American animal, having a head like the fox, and\nlarge eyes. The head is mostly white, and the body is covered with\nlong black-and-white hairs. He climbs up trees with great facility,\nhides himself in the leaves to catch birds, or hangs himself by the\ntail from a branch. It seeks its food in the night, and lives on\nfruit, insects, and birds' eggs. Its teeth are fifty in number. The\nmost remarkable circumstance in the natural history of this animal is\nthe pouch which is formed under the belly of the female, in which it\ncarries its young ones when they are small. If the little creatures\nare frightened when absent from their mother, they scamper to this\nasylum as soon as possible.\n\n\n[Illustration: The Antelope.]\n\nTHE COMMON ANTELOPE\n\nOf this numerous tribe of animals, there is perhaps no species so\ntruly elegant in its appearance as this, and although it is one of the\nmost common, yet its habits are but little known. It is very numerous\nin all the northern parts of Africa. In size, it is rather smaller\nthan the fallow deer. Its color is a dusky brown, mixed with red; the\ntail is short; the horns, which are about sixteen inches long, are\nblack, distinctly annulated almost to the top, and have three curves.\nThe brachia, or sides of the lyre, were frequently made of these\nhorns, as appears from ancient gems. The female is destitute of horns,\nand has a white stripe on the flanks.\n\n\n[Illustration: Hare.]\n\nTHE RABBIT.\n\nThe Rabbit is a very pretty animal, and loves to live about the house\nand barn, in a state of friendship with all around it. It has no\ndefence, but to run away; and so harmless and innocent is it, that\nnobody can have the heart to do it injury. It feeds upon clover,\napples, and other fruits, and will often sit for hours in some snug\ncovered place, quietly chewing its cud, with the greatest\nsatisfaction. There is another kind of rabbit, which runs wild in the\nwoods and fields. He is remarkably swift of foot, and no dog can\novertake him in a race, but a grey-hound. His fur is very soft, and is\nused in making coarse hats.\n\n\n[Illustration: Musk Deer.]\n\nTHE MUSK DE\n\n### Summary:\n\n"}

The crew, you see, have\nmade a raft of some of the spars and planks of the ship, and having all\ngot upon it, are about cutting loose from the wreck, with the hope that\nthey may reach one of the distant islands.\n\nPoor men! they did indeed reach the island; but only to meet a more\ndreadful death than that threatened them by the waves. Overcome with\nfatigue and anxiety, they no sooner gained the shore, than they all,\ncaptain, crew, and passengers, threw themselves on the earth, and soon\nwere fast asleep. In this helpless state, they were attacked by the\ncruel and blood-thirsty savages who inhabited the island, and all\nbarbarously murdered, except two little boys, John and William Doyley.\n\nThese children, sons of a gentleman and lady who had been passengers\nin the ill-fated ship, were kept in captivity by the savages for many\nyears.\n\nAt the time of the shipwreck, John was a stout lad, thirteen or fourteen\nyears old; but little William was a mere infant, being scarcely two\nyears of age! Think what a dreadful life these poor little orphans had\nbefore them! Their kind parents cruelly murdered, and themselves\nprisoners to the barbarous murderers!\n\nAt first the savages treated them harshly, and made them endure all\nkinds of privation and hardship. Finally, after changing from one cruel\nmaster to another several times, they were purchased by one more humane\nthan the rest, named Dupper, who took them to his home on a distant\nisland, and treated them with a great deal of kindness.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nDupper taught John how to shoot with the bow and arrow, with which he\nwas himself very expert. He also showed him their method of spearing\nfish, and taught him many other savage accomplishments. In Dupper's\nfamily, too, the boys both learned to speak the native language, and\nthey soon almost forgot their own.\n\nBut they did not forget their own country; at least John did not; and as\nhe often talked with William about their dear parents, and the pleasant\nhome they had left many miles away, there was but little danger of\nWilliam forgetting it either.\n\nThough kindly treated by Dupper and his family, and made as comfortable\nas their savage mode of life would allow, yet they suffered many cruel\nhardships, and severely felt the change from their former to their\npresent way of living. They constantly sighed for home, and were made\nquite wretched by the prospect of a captivity to which they could see\nno end, except in death.\n\nBut the same kind Providence who had preserved them when their parents\nand the crew of the unfortunate ship were murdered, still watched over\nand protected these despairing orphans. The day of their deliverance\ncame quite unexpectedly. An English vessel arrived at the island, and\ncast her anchor near the shore. The natives immediately manned their\ncanoes, and flocked on board, to trade with the strangers. John was\npermitted to go with the others, and when on the deck of the vessel,\nhe told the captain and officers all about the shipwreck, the murder\nof the crew and passengers, and his own and his brother's captivity.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe kind captain listened to his story, and then set at once about\neffecting the release of the two boys, which he easily accomplished,\nand William soon joined John on board of the vessel, where Dupper also\nappeared, to take leave of his young friends. The kind native was quite\nsad at the parting\n\n### Summary:\n\n"}

This is one way in\nwhich parents should be honored continually.\n\nBut there is another way by which you may not only show that you feel\nrespect for your father and mother yourself, but you may force others to\nfeel the same respect for them.\n\nThat you may understand what I mean, I will tell you a story of a little\nboy who, for _once_, at least in his life, honored his mother. This\nwas not by any command, however, for she was not with him at the time,\nand I do not suppose that she ever heard of the circumstance which I am\nabout to tell you.\n\nOne morning, a teacher entered her school of about sixty children,\naccompanied by another young lady,--her friend. The children did not\ncluster around as thickly as usual. Some quietly took their seats; and\nothers, disliking the restraint of a stranger's presence, ran into the\nplay-ground. But nine o'clock soon came; and the teacher, having\nconducted her friend to a seat where she might observe what passed\naround her, rang a small bell, and the seats were soon filled with rosy\ncheeks and smiling countenances. The morning hymn was sung, and then all\nknelt to implore the blessing of him who loved little children when he\nwas in the world, and who loves them no less now he is in heaven. They\nrose from their knees; and soon the teacher was busied with classes, and\nthe children who could study, with their books.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nMiss H. (the stranger) soon became interested in watching the movement\nof six or eight little boys, of four years old, who occupied a low bench\nnear her. The smallest of these was a little black-eyed boy, who moved\nabout on the seat as much as any one, and made rather more than his\nshare of noise. He had a little book of pictures, which he was eagerly\ndisplaying to the little ones around him; and several times had his\nearnest explanations been interrupted by the voice of the teacher,\nsaying, \"Willy, my dear, you must look at the pictures without talking;\"\nwhen a rude boy stepped up and snatched it from his hand.\n\nNow, what would you have done, if you had been in Willy's place just\nthen? Would you have struck your naughty little playmate, or called him\nbad names? or should you have tried to snatch the book back again? Willy\nknew a better way. He looked troubled, indeed, at first. He asked for\nthe book in a very coaxing tone; but when he found that the selfish\nHenry would not give it up, he quietly turned away to find amusement\nin something else.\n\nA little girl, who sat near, now handed Willy a large yellow-covered\nbook, full of beautiful painted pictures. His eyes now sparkled more\nbrightly than ever, as he began to turn over the leaves. Soon Henry\nspied the pretty book; and not at all ashamed of his unkindness, he\nmoved towards Willy, and began to look over his shoulder. Would you not\nhave pushed him away, or at least have turned round so as to conceal the\nbook? But Willy held it towards him and pointed to the bright pictures\nas pleasantly as if Henry had never been unkind to him.\n\nWhen school had closed, and the children had left\n\n### Summary:\n\n"}

I am going out.\"\n\nThen old Mrs. Rabbit took a basket and her umbrella and went through\nthe wood to the baker's.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nShe bought a loaf of brown bread and five currant buns.\n\nFlopsy, Mopsy and Cotton-tail who were good little bunnies went down\nthe lane together\n\n[Illustration]\n\nTo gather blackberries.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nBut Peter who was very naughty, ran straight away to Mr. McGregor's\ngarden and\n\n[Illustration]\n\nSqueezed under the gate!\n\n[Illustration]\n\nFirst he ate some lettuces and some French beans\n\n[Illustration]\n\nAnd then\n\nHe\nAte\nSome\nRadishes\n\n[Illustration]\n\nAnd then, feeling rather sick, he went to look for some parsley.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\nBut round the end of a cucumber frame, whom should he meet but Mr.\nMcGregor!\n\nMr. McGregor was on his hands and knees planting out young cabbages,\nbut he jumped up and ran after Peter, waving a rake and calling out\n\"Stop thief!\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nPeter was most dreadfully frightened; he rushed all over the garden,\nfor he had forgotten the way back to the gate.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nHe lost one shoe among the cabbages, and the other amongst the\npotatoes.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nAfter losing them, he ran on four legs and went faster\n\n[Illustration]\n\nSo that I think he might have got away altogether if he had not\nunfortunately run into a gooseberry net\n\n[Illustration]\n\nAnd got caught by the large buttons on his jacket.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nIt was a blue jacket with brass buttons, quite new.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nPeter gave himself up for lost and shed big tears;\n\n[Illustration]\n\nBut his sobs were overheard by some friendly sparrows\n\n[Illustration]\n\nWho flew to him in great excitement and implored him to exert himself.\n\nMr. McGregor came up with a sieve which he intended to pop on the top\nof Peter, but Peter wriggled out just in time.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\nLeaving his jacket behind him.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nHe rushed into the tool-shed and--\n\n[Illustration]\n\nJumped into a can.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\nIt would have been a beautiful thing to hide in, if it had not had so\nmuch\n\n### Summary:\n\n"}
