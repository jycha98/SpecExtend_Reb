I had a rotten time! Anything else I got to explain?\"\n\n\"George, how can you speak like--Oh, I don't know what's come over you!\"\n\n\"Good Lord, there's nothing come over me! Why do you look for trouble\nall the time?\" He was warning himself, \"Careful! Stop being so\ndisagreeable. Course she feels it, being left alone here all evening.\"\nBut he forgot his warning as she went on:\n\n\"Why do you go out and see all sorts of strange people? I suppose you'll\nsay you've been to another committee-meeting this evening!\"\n\n\"Nope. I've been calling on a woman. We sat by the fire and kidded each\nother and had a whale of a good time, if you want to know!\"\n\n\"Well--From the way you say it, I suppose it's my fault you went there!\nI probably sent you!\"\n\n\"You did!\"\n\n\"Well, upon my word--\"\n\n\"You hate'strange people' as you call 'em. If you had your way, I'd be\nas much of an old stick-in-the-mud as Howard Littlefield. You never want\nto have anybody with any git to 'em at the house; you want a bunch of\nold stiffs that sit around and gas about the weather. You're doing\nyour level best to make me old. Well, let me tell you, I'm not going to\nhave--\"\n\nOverwhelmed she bent to his unprecedented tirade, and in answer she\nmourned:\n\n\"Oh, dearest, I don't think that's true. I don't mean to make you old,\nI know. Perhaps you're partly right. Perhaps I am slow about getting\nacquainted with new people. But when you think of all the dear good\ntimes we have, and the supper-parties and the movies and all--\"\n\nWith true masculine wiles he not only convinced himself that she had\ninjured him but, by the loudness of his voice and the brutality of his\nattack, he convinced her also, and presently he had her apologizing for\nhis having spent the evening with Tanis. He went up to bed well pleased,\nnot only the master but the martyr of the household. For a distasteful\nmoment after he had lain down he wondered if he had been altogether\njust. \"Ought to be ashamed, bullying her. Maybe there is her side to\nthings. Maybe she hasn't had such a bloomin' hectic time herself. But I\ndon't care! Good for her to get waked up a little. And I'm going to keep\nfree. Of her and Tanis and the fellows at the club and everybody. I'm\ngoing to run my own life!\"\n\n\nII\n\nIn this mood he was particularly objectionable at the Boosters' Club\nlunch next day. They were addressed by a congressman who had just\nreturned from an exhaustive three-months study of the finances,\nethnology, political systems, linguistic divisions, mineral resources,\nand agriculture of Germany, France, Great Britain, Italy, Austria,\nCzechoslovakia, Jugoslavia, and Bulgaria. He told them all about\nthose subjects, together with three funny stories about European\nmisconceptions of America and some spirited words on the necessity of\nkeeping ignorant foreigners out of America.\n\n\"Say, that was a mighty informative talk. Real he-stuff,\" said Sidney\nFinkelstein.\n\nBut the disaffected Babbitt grumbled, \"Four-flusher! Bunch of hot\nair! And what's the matter with the immigrants? Gosh, they aren't\nall ignorant, and I got a hunch we're all descended from immigrants\nourselves.\"\n\n\"Oh, you make me tired!\" said Mr. Finkelstein.\n\nBabbitt was aware that Dr. A. I. Dilling was sternly listening from\nacross the table. Dr. Dilling was one of the most important men in the\nBoosters'. He was not a physician but a surgeon, a more romantic and\nsounding occupation. He was an intense large man with a boiling of black\nhair and a thick black mustache. The newspapers often chronicled his\noperations; he was professor of surgery in the State University; he went\nto dinner at the very best houses on Royal Ridge; and he was said to be\nworth several hundred thousand dollars. It was dismaying to Babbitt to\nhave such a person glower at him. He hastily praised the congressman's\nwit, to Sidney Finkelstein, but for Dr. Dilling's benefit.\n\n\nIII\n\nThat afternoon three men shouldered into Babbitt's office with the air\nof a Vigilante committee in frontier days. They were large, resolute,\nbig-jawed men, and they were all high lords in the land of Zenith--Dr.\nDilling the surgeon, Charles McKelvey the contractor, and, most\ndismaying of all, the white-bearded Colonel Rutherford Snow, owner of\nthe Advocate-Times. In their whelming presence Babbitt felt small and\ninsignificant.\n\n\"Well, well, great pleasure, have chairs, what c'n I do for you?\" he\nbabbled.\n\nThey neither sat nor offered observations on the weather.\n\n\"Babbitt,\" said Colonel Snow, \"we've come from the Good Citizens'\nLeague. We've decided we want you to join. Vergil Gunch says you don't\ncare to, but I think we can show you a new light. The League is going to\ncombine with the Chamber of Commerce in a campaign for the Open Shop, so\nit's time for you to put your name down.\"\n\nIn his embarrassment Babbitt could not recall his reasons for not\nwishing to join the League, if indeed he had ever definitely known them,\nbut he was passionately certain that he did not wish to join, and at the\nthought of their forcing him he felt a stirring of anger against even\nthese princes of commerce.\n\n\"Sorry, Colonel, have to think it over a little,\" he mumbled.\n\nMcKelvey snarled, \"That means you're not going to join, George?\"\n\nSomething black and unfamiliar and ferocious spoke from Babbitt: \"Now,\nyou look here, Charley! I'm damned if I'm going to be bullied into\njoining anything, not even by you plutes!\"\n\n\"We're not bullying anybody,\" Dr. Dilling began, but Colonel Snow thrust\nhim aside with, \"Certainly we are! We don't mind a little bullying, if\nit's necessary. Babbitt, the G.C.L. has been talking about you a good\ndeal. You're supposed to be a sensible, clean, responsible man; you\nalways have been; but here lately, for God knows what reason, I hear\nfrom all sorts of sources that you're running around with a loose\ncrowd, and what's a whole lot worse, you've actually been advocating and\nsupporting some of the most dangerous elements in town, like this fellow\nDoane.\"\n\n\"Colonel, that strikes me as my private business.\"\n\n\"Possibly, but we want to have an understanding. You've stood in,\nyou and your father-in-law, with some of the most substantial and\nforward-looking interests in town, like my friends of the Street\nTraction Company, and my papers have given you a lot of boosts. Well,\nyou can't expect the decent citizens to go on aiding you if you intend\nto side with precisely the people who are trying to undermine us.\"\n\nBabbitt was frightened, but he had an agonized instinct that if he\nyielded in this he would yield in everything. He protested:\n\n\"You're exaggerating, Colonel. I believe in being broad-minded\nand liberal, but, of course, I'm just as much agin the cranks and\nblatherskites and labor unions and so on as you are. But fact is, I\nbelong to so many organizations now that I can't do 'em justice, and I\nwant to think it over before I decide about coming into the G.C.L.\"\n\nColonel Snow condescended, \"Oh, no, I'm not exaggerating! Why the doctor\nhere heard you cussing out and defaming one of the finest types of\nRepublican congressmen, just this noon! And you have entirely the wrong\nidea about 'thinking over joining.' We're not begging you to join the\nG.C.L.--we're permitting you to join. I'm not sure, my boy, but what\nif you put it off it'll be too late. I'm not sure we'll want you then.\nBetter think quick--better think quick!\"\n\nThe three Vigilantes, formidable in their righteousness, stared at him\nin a taut silence. Babbitt waited through. He thought nothing at all,\nhe merely waited, while in his echoing head buzzed, \"I don't want to\njoin--I don't want to join--I don't want to.\"\n\n\"All right. Sorry for you!\" said Colonel Snow, and the three men\nabruptly turned their beefy backs.\n\n\nIV\n\nAs Babbitt went out to his car that evening he saw Vergil Gunch coming\ndown the block. He raised his hand in salutation, but Gunch ignored it\nand crossed the street. He was certain that Gunch had seen him. He drove\nhome in sharp discomfort.\n\nHis wife attacked at once: \"Georgie dear, Muriel Frink was in this\nafternoon, and she says that Chum says the committee of this Good\nCitizens' League especially asked you to join and you wouldn't. Don't\nyou think it would be better? You know all the nicest people belong, and\nthe League stands for--\"\n\n\"I know what the League stands for! It stands for the suppression of\nfree speech and free thought and everything else! I don't propose to\nbe bullied and rushed into joining anything, and it isn't a question of\nwhether it's a good league or a bad league or what the hell kind of a\nleague it is; it's just a question of my refusing to be told I got to--\"\n\n\"But dear, if you don't join, people might criticize you.\"\n\n\"Let 'em criticize!\"\n\n\"But I mean NICE people!\"\n\n\"Rats, I--Matter of fact, this whole League is just a fad. It's like\nall these other organizations that start off with such a rush and let on\nthey're going to change the whole works, and pretty soon they peter out\nand everybody forgets all about 'em!\"\n\n\"But if it's THE fad now, don't you think you--\"\n\n\"No, I don't! Oh, Myra, please quit nagging me about it. I'm sick of\nhearing about the confounded G.C.L. I almost wish I'd joined it when\nVerg first came around, and got it over. And maybe I'd've come in\nto-day if the committee hadn't tried to bullyrag me, but, by God, as\nlong as I'm a free-born independent American cit--\"\n\n\"Now, George, you're talking exactly like the German furnace-man.\"\n\n\"Oh, I am, am I! Then, I won't talk at all!\"\n\nHe longed, that evening, to see Tanis Judique, to be strengthened by\nher sympathy. When all the family were up-stairs he got as far as\ntelephoning to her apartment-house, but he was agitated about it and\nwhen the janitor answered he blurted, \"Nev' mind--I'll call later,\" and\nhung up the receiver.\n\n\nV\n\nIf Babbitt had not been certain about Vergil Gunch's avoiding him, there\ncould be little doubt about William Washington Eathorne, next morning.\nWhen Babbitt was driving down to the office he overtook Eathorne's car,\nwith the great banker sitting in anemic solemnity behind his chauffeur.\nBabbitt waved and cried, \"Mornin'!\" Eathorne looked at him deliberately,\nhesitated, and gave him a nod more contemptuous than a direct cut.\n\nBabbitt's partner and father-in-law came in at ten:\n\n\"George, what's this I hear about some song and dance you gave Colonel\nSnow about not wanting to join the G.C.L.? What the dickens you trying\nto do? Wreck the firm? You don't suppose these Big Guns will stand your\nbucking them and springing all this 'liberal' poppycock you been getting\noff lately, do you?\"\n\n\"Oh, rats, Henry T., you been reading bum fiction. There ain't any such\na thing as these plots to keep folks from being liberal. This is a free\ncountry. A man can do anything he wants to.\"\n\n\"Course th' ain't any plots. Who said they was? Only if folks get an\nidea you're scatter-brained and unstable, you don't suppose they'll want\nto do business with you, do you? One little rumor about your being a\ncrank would do more to ruin this business than all the plots and stuff\nthat these fool story-writers could think up in a month of Sundays.\"\n\nThat afternoon, when the old reliable Conrad Lyte, the merry miser,\nConrad Lyte, appeared, and Babbitt suggested his buying a parcel of land\nin the new residential section of Dorchester, Lyte said hastily, too\nhastily, \"No, no, don't want to go into anything new just now.\"\n\nA week later Babbitt learned, through Henry Thompson, that the officials\nof the Street Traction Company were planning another real-estate coup,\nand that Sanders, Torrey and Wing, not the Babbitt-Thompson Company,\nwere to handle it for them. \"I figure that Jake Offutt is kind of\nleery about the way folks are talking about you. Of course Jake is a\nrock-ribbed old die-hard, and he probably advised the Traction fellows\nto get some other broker. George, you got to do something!\" trembled\nThompson.\n\nAnd, in a rush, Babbitt agreed. All nonsense the way people misjudged\nhim, but still--He determined to join the Good Citizens' League the\nnext time he was asked, and in furious resignation he waited. He wasn't\nasked. They ignored him. He did not have the courage to go to the League\nand beg in, and he took refuge in a shaky boast that he had \"gotten\naway with bucking the whole city. Nobody could dictate to him how he was\ngoing to think and act!\"\n\nHe was jarred as by nothing else when the paragon of stenographers, Miss\nMcGoun, suddenly left him, though her reasons were excellent--she needed\na rest, her sister was sick, she might not do any more work for six\nmonths. He was uncomfortable with her successor, Miss Havstad. What\nMiss Havstad's given name was, no one in the office ever knew. It seemed\nimprobable that she had a given name, a lover, a powder-puff, or a\ndigestion. She was so impersonal, this slight, pale, industrious Swede,\nthat it was vulgar to think of her as going to an ordinary home to eat\nhash. She was a perfectly oiled and enameled machine, and she ought,\neach evening, to have been dusted off and shut in her desk beside her\ntoo-slim, too-frail pencil points. She took dictation swiftly, her\ntyping was perfect, but Babbitt became jumpy when he tried to work with\nher. She made him feel puffy, and at his best-beloved daily jokes she\nlooked gently inquiring. He longed for Miss McGoun's return, and thought\nof writing to her.\n\nThen he heard that Miss McGoun had, a week after leaving him, gone over\nto his dangerous competitors, Sanders, Torrey and Wing.\n\nHe was not merely annoyed; he was frightened. \"Why did she quit, then?\"\nhe worried. \"Did she have a hunch my business is going on the rocks? And\nit was Sanders got the Street Traction deal. Rats--sinking ship!\"\n\nGray fear loomed always by him now. He watched Fritz Weilinger, the\nyoung salesman, and wondered if he too would leave. Daily he fancied\nslights. He noted that he was not asked to speak at the annual Chamber\nof Commerce dinner. When Orville Jones gave a large poker party and he\nwas not invited, he was certain that he had been snubbed. He was afraid\nto go to lunch at the Athletic Club, and afraid not to go. He believed\nthat he was spied on; that when he left the table they whispered about\nhim. Everywhere he heard the rustling whispers: in the offices of\nclients, in the bank when he made a deposit, in his own office, in his\nown home. Interminably he wondered what They were saying of him. All day\nlong in imaginary conversations he caught them marveling, \"Babbitt?\nWhy, say, he's a regular anarchist! You got to admire the fellow for his\nnerve, the way he turned liberal and, by golly, just absolutely runs his\nlife to suit himself, but say, he's dangerous, that's what he is, and\nhe's got to be shown up.\"\n\nHe was so twitchy that when he rounded a corner and chanced on two\nacquaintances talking--whispering--his heart leaped, and he stalked\nby like an embarrassed schoolboy. When he saw his neighbors Howard\nLittlefield and Orville Jones together, he peered at them, went indoors\nto escape their spying, and was miserably certain that they had been\nwhispering--plotting--whispering.\n\nThrough all his fear ran defiance. He felt stubborn. Sometimes he\ndecided that he had been a very devil of a fellow, as bold as Seneca\nDoane; sometimes he planned to call on Doane and tell him what a\nrevolutionist he was, and never got beyond the planning. But just as\noften, when he heard the soft whispers enveloping him he wailed, \"Good\nLord, what have I done? Just played with the Bunch, and called down\nClarence Drum about being such a high-and-mighty sodger. Never catch ME\ncriticizing people and trying to make them accept MY ideas!\"\n\nHe could not stand the strain. Before long he admitted that he would\nlike to flee back to the security of conformity, provided there was a\ndecent and creditable way to return. But, stubbornly, he would not be\nforced back; he would not, he swore, \"eat dirt.\"\n\nOnly in spirited engagements with his wife did these turbulent fears\nrise to the surface. She complained that he seemed nervous, that\nshe couldn't understand why he did not want to \"drop in at the\nLittlefields'\" for the evening. He tried, but he could not express to\nher the nebulous facts of his rebellion and punishment. And, with Paul\nand Tanis lost, he had no one to whom he could talk. \"Good Lord, Tinka\nis the only real friend I have, these days,\" he sighed, and he clung to\nthe child, played floor-games with her all evening.\n\nHe considered going to see Paul in prison, but, though he had a pale\ncurt note from him every week, he thought of Paul as dead. It was Tanis\nfor whom he was longing.\n\n\"I thought I was so smart and independent, cutting Tanis out, and I need\nher, Lord how I need her!\" he raged. \"Myra simply can't understand. All\nshe sees in life is getting along by being just like other folks. But\nTanis, she'd tell me I was all right.\"\n\nThen he broke, and one evening, late, he did run to Tanis. He had not\ndared to hope for it, but she was in, and alone. Only she wasn't Tanis.\nShe was a courteous, brow-lifting, ice-armored woman who looked like\nTanis. She said, \"Yes, George, what is it?\" in even and uninterested\ntones, and he crept away, whipped.\n\nHis first comfort was from Ted and Eunice Littlefield.\n\nThey danced in one evening when Ted was home from the university, and\nTed chuckled, \"What's this I hear from Euny, dad? She says her dad says\nyou raised Cain by boosting old Seneca Doane. Hot dog! Give 'em fits!\nStir 'em up! This old burg is asleep!\" Eunice plumped down on Babbitt's\nlap, kissed him, nestled her bobbed hair against his chin, and crowed;\n\"I think you're lots nicer than Howard. Why is it,\" confidentially,\n\"that Howard is such an old grouch? The man has a good heart, and\nhonestly, he's awfully bright, but he never will learn to step on the\ngas, after all the training I've given him. Don't you think we could do\nsomething with him, dearest?\"\n\n\"Why, Eunice, that isn't a nice way to speak of your papa,\" Babbitt\nobserved, in the best Floral Heights manner, but he was happy for\nthe first time in weeks. He pictured himself as the veteran liberal\nstrengthened by the loyalty of the young generation. They went out to\nrifle the ice-box. Babbitt gloated, \"If your mother caught us at this,\nwe'd certainly get our come-uppance!\" and Eunice became maternal,\nscrambled a terrifying number of eggs for them, kissed Babbitt on the\near, and in the voice of a brooding abbess marveled, \"It beats the devil\nwhy feminists like me still go on nursing these men!\"\n\nThus stimulated, Babbitt was reckless when he encountered Sheldon\nSmeeth, educational director of the Y.M.C.A. and choir-leader of the\nChatham Road Church. With one of his damp hands Smeeth imprisoned\nBabbitt's thick paw while he chanted, \"Brother Babbitt, we haven't seen\nyou at church very often lately. I know you're busy with a multitude\nof details, but you mustn't forget your dear friends at the old church\nhome.\"\n\nBabbitt shook off the affectionate clasp--Sheldy liked to hold hands for\na long time--and snarled, \"Well, I guess you fellows can run the show\nwithout me. Sorry, Smeeth; got to beat it. G'day.\"\n\nBut afterward he winced, \"If that white worm had the nerve to try to\ndrag me back to the Old Church Home, then the holy outfit must have been\ndoing a lot of talking about me, too.\"\n\nHe heard them whispering--whispering--Dr. John Jennison Drew,\nCholmondeley Frink, even William Washington Eathorne. The independence\nseeped out of him and he walked the streets alone, afraid of men's\ncynical eyes and the incessant hiss of whispering.\n\n\n\n\n\nI\n\nHE tried to explain to his wife, as they prepared for bed, how\nobjectionable was Sheldon Smeeth, but all her answer was, \"He has such\na beautiful voice--so spiritual. I don't think you ought to speak of him\nlike that just because you can't appreciate music!\" He saw her then as a\nstranger; he stared bleakly at this plump and fussy woman with the broad\nbare arms, and wondered how she had ever come here.\n\nIn his chilly cot, turning from aching side to side, he pondered of\nTanis. \"He'd been a fool to lose her. He had to have somebody he could\nreally talk to. He'd--oh, he'd BUST if he went on stewing about things\nby himself. And Myra, useless to expect her to understand. Well, rats,\nno use dodging the issue. Darn shame for two married people to drift\napart after all these years; darn rotten shame; but nothing could bring\nthem together now, as long as he refused to let Zenith bully him into\ntaking orders--and he was by golly not going to let anybody bully him\ninto anything, or wheedle him or coax him either!\"\n\nHe woke at three, roused by a passing motor, and struggled out of bed\nfor a drink of water. As he passed through the bedroom he heard his wife\ngroan. His resentment was night-blurred; he was solicitous in inquiring,\n\"What's the trouble, hon?\"\n\n\"I've got--such a pain down here in my side--oh, it's just--it tears at\nme.\"\n\n\"Bad indigestion? Shall I get you some bicarb?\"\n\n\"Don't think--that would help. I felt funny last evening and yesterday,\nand then--oh!--it passed away and I got to sleep and--That auto woke me\nup.\"\n\nHer voice was laboring like a ship in a storm. He was alarmed.\n\n\"I better call the doctor.\"\n\n\"No, no! It'll go away. But maybe you might get me an ice-bag.\"\n\nHe stalked to the bathroom for the ice-bag, down to the kitchen for ice.\nHe felt dramatic in this late-night expedition, but as he gouged the\nchunk of ice with the dagger-like pick he was cool, steady, mature;\nand the old friendliness was in his voice as he patted the ice-bag into\nplace on her groin, rumbling, \"There, there, that'll be better now.\"\nHe retired to bed, but he did not sleep. He heard her groan again.\nInstantly he was up, soothing her, \"Still pretty bad, honey?\"\n\n\"Yes, it just gripes me, and I can't get to sleep.\"\n\nHer voice was faint. He knew her dread of doctors' verdicts and he\ndid not inform her, but he creaked down-stairs, telephoned to Dr.\nEarl Patten, and waited, shivering, trying with fuzzy eyes to read a\nmagazine, till he heard the doctor's car.\n\nThe doctor was youngish and professionally breezy. He came in as though\nit were sunny noontime. \"Well, George, little trouble, eh? How is\nshe now?\" he said busily as, with tremendous and rather irritating\ncheerfulness, he tossed his coat on a chair and warmed his hands at\na radiator. He took charge of the house. Babbitt felt ousted and\nunimportant as he followed the doctor up to the bedroom, and it was the\ndoctor who chuckled, \"Oh, just little stomach-ache\" when Verona peeped\nthrough her door, begging, \"What is it, Dad, what is it?\"\n\nTo Mrs. Babbitt the doctor said with amiable belligerence, after his\nexamination, \"Kind of a bad old pain, eh? I'll give you something to\nmake you sleep, and I think you'll feel better in the morning. I'll come\nin right after breakfast.\" But to Babbitt, lying in wait in the lower\nhall, the doctor sighed, \"I don't like the feeling there in her belly.\nThere's some rigidity and some inflammation. She's never had her\nappendix out has she? Um. Well, no use worrying. I'll be here first\nthing in the morning, and meantime she'll get some rest. I've given her\na hypo. Good night.\"\n\nThen was Babbitt caught up in the black tempest.\n\nInstantly all the indignations which had been dominating him and the\nspiritual dramas through which he had struggled became pallid and\nabsurd before the ancient and overwhelming realities, the standard and\ntraditional realities, of sickness and menacing death, the long night,\nand the thousand steadfast implications of married life. He crept back\nto her. As she drowsed away in the tropic languor of morphia, he sat on\nthe edge of her bed, holding her hand, and for the first time in many\nweeks her hand abode trustfully in his.\n\nHe draped himself grotesquely in his toweling bathrobe and a pink and\nwhite couch-cover, and sat lumpishly in a wing-chair. The bedroom was\nuncanny in its half-light, which turned the curtains to lurking robbers,\nthe dressing-table to a turreted castle. It smelled of cosmetics, of\nlinen, of sleep. He napped and woke, napped and woke, a hundred times.\nHe heard her move and sigh in slumber; he wondered if there wasn't some\nofficious brisk thing he could do for her, and before he could quite\nform the thought he was asleep, racked and aching. The night was\ninfinite. When dawn came and the waiting seemed at an end, he fell\nasleep, and was vexed to have been caught off his guard, to have been\naroused by Verona's entrance and her agitated \"Oh, what is it, Dad?\"\n\nHis wife was awake, her face sallow and lifeless in the morning light,\nbut now he did not compare her with Tanis; she was not merely A Woman,\nto be contrasted with other women, but his own self, and though he might\ncriticize her and nag her, it was only as he might criticize and nag\nhimself, interestedly, unpatronizingly, without the expectation of\nchanging--or any real desire to change--the eternal essence.\n\nWith Verona he sounded fatherly again, and firm. He consoled Tinka, who\nsatisfactorily pointed the excitement of the hour by wailing. He ordered\nearly breakfast, and wanted to look at the newspaper, and felt somehow\nheroic and useful in not looking at it. But there were still crawling\nand totally unheroic hours of waiting before Dr. Patten returned.\n\n\"Don't see much change,\" said Patten. \"I'll be back about eleven, and\nif you don't mind, I think I'll bring in some other world-famous\npill-pedler for consultation, just to be on the safe side. Now\nGeorge, there's nothing you can do. I'll have Verona keep the ice-bag\nfilled--might as well leave that on, I guess--and you, you better beat\nit to the office instead of standing around her looking as if you were\nthe patient. The nerve of husbands! Lot more neurotic than the women!\nThey always have to horn in and get all the credit for feeling bad when\ntheir wives are ailing. Now have another nice cup of coffee and git!\"\n\nUnder this derision Babbitt became more matter-of-fact. He drove to the\noffice, tried to dictate letters, tried to telephone and, before the\ncall was answered, forgot to whom he was telephoning. At a quarter after\nten he returned home. As he left the down-town traffic and sped up the\ncar, his face was as grimly creased as the mask of tragedy.\n\nHis wife greeted him with surprise. \"Why did you come back, dear? I\nthink I feel a little better. I told Verona to skip off to her office.\nWas it wicked of me to go and get sick?\"\n\nHe knew that she wanted petting, and she got it, joyously. They were\ncuriously happy when he heard Dr. Patten's car in front. He looked out\nof the window. He was frightened. With Patten was an impatient man\nwith turbulent black hair and a hussar mustache--Dr. A. I. Dilling,\nthe surgeon. Babbitt sputtered with anxiety, tried to conceal it, and\nhurried down to the door.\n\nDr. Patten was profusely casual: \"Don't want to worry you, old man, but\nI thought it might be a good stunt to have Dr. Dilling examine her.\" He\ngestured toward Dilling as toward a master.\n\nDilling nodded in his curtest manner and strode up-stairs Babbitt\ntramped the living-room in agony. Except for his wife's confinements\nthere had never been a major operation in the family, and to him surgery\nwas at once a miracle and an abomination of fear. But when Dilling and\nPatten came down again he knew that everything was all right, and he\nwanted to laugh, for the two doctors were exactly like the bearded\nphysicians in a musical comedy, both of them rubbing their hands and\nlooking foolishly sagacious.\n\nDr. Dilling spoke:\n\n\"I'm sorry, old man, but it's acute appendicitis. We ought to operate.\nOf course you must decide, but there's no question as to what has to be\ndone.\"\n\nBabbitt did not get all the force of it. He mumbled, \"Well I suppose we\ncould get her ready in a couple o' days. Probably Ted ought to come down\nfrom the university, just in case anything happened.\"\n\nDr. Dilling growled, \"Nope. If you don't want peritonitis to set in,\nwe'll have to operate right away. I must advise it strongly. If you say\ngo ahead, I'll 'phone for the St. Mary's ambulance at once, and we'll\nhave her on the table in three-quarters of an hour.\"\n\n\"I--I Of course, I suppose you know what--But great God, man, I can't\nget her clothes ready and everything in two seconds, you know! And in\nher state, so wrought-up and weak--\"\n\n\"Just throw her hair-brush and comb and tooth-brush in a bag; that's\nall she'll need for a day or two,\" said Dr. Dilling, and went to the\ntelephone.\n\nBabbitt galloped desperately up-stairs. He sent the frightened Tinka out\nof the room. He said gaily to his wife, \"Well, old thing, the doc thinks\nmaybe we better have a little operation and get it over. Just take a few\nminutes--not half as serious as a confinement--and you'll be all right\nin a jiffy.\"\n\nShe gripped his hand till the fingers ached. She said patiently, like a\ncowed child, \"I'm afraid--to go into the dark, all alone!\" Maturity was\nwiped from her eyes; they were pleading and terrified. \"Will you stay\nwith me? Darling, you don't have to go to the office now, do you? Could\nyou just go down to the hospital with me? Could you come see me this\nevening--if everything's all right? You won't have to go out this\nevening, will you?\"\n\nHe was on his knees by the bed. While she feebly ruffled his hair, he\nsobbed, he kissed the lawn of her sleeve, and swore, \"Old honey, I\nlove you more than anything in the world! I've kind of been worried by\nbusiness and everything, but that's all over now, and I'm back again.\"\n\n\"Are you really? George, I was thinking, lying here, maybe it would be a\ngood thing if I just WENT. I was wondering if anybody really needed me.\nOr wanted me. I was wondering what was the use of my living. I've been\ngetting so stupid and ugly--\"\n\n\"Why, you old humbug! Fishing for compliments when I ought to be packing\nyour bag! Me, sure, I'm young and handsome and a regular village\ncut-up and--\" He could not go on. He sobbed again; and in muttered\nincoherencies they found each other.\n\nAs he packed, his brain was curiously clear and swift. He'd have no more\nwild evenings, he realized. He admitted that he would regret them. A\nlittle grimly he perceived that this had been his last despairing fling\nbefore the paralyzed contentment of middle-age. Well, and he grinned\nimpishly, \"it was one doggone good party while it lasted!\" And--how much\nwas the operation going to cost? \"I ought to have fought that out with\nDilling. But no, damn it, I don't care how much it costs!\"\n\nThe motor ambulance was at the door. Even in his grief the Babbitt who\nadmired all technical excellences was interested in the kindly skill\nwith which the attendants slid Mrs. Babbitt upon a stretcher and carried\nher down-stairs. The ambulance was a huge, suave, varnished, white\nthing. Mrs. Babbitt moaned, \"It frightens me. It's just like a hearse,\njust like being put in a hearse. I want you to stay with me.\"\n\n\"I'll be right up front with the driver,\" Babbitt promised.\n\n\"No, I want you to stay inside with me.\" To the attendants: \"Can't he be\ninside?\"\n\n\"Sure, ma'am, you bet. There's a fine little camp-stool in there,\" the\nolder attendant said, with professional pride.\n\nHe sat beside her in that traveling cabin with its cot, its stool, its\nactive little electric radiator, and its quite unexplained calendar,\ndisplaying a girl eating cherries, and the name of an enterprising\ngrocer. But as he flung out his hand in hopeless cheerfulness it touched\nthe radiator, and he squealed:\n\n\"Ouch! Jesus!\"\n\n\"Why, George Babbitt, I won't have you cursing and swearing and\nblaspheming!\"\n\n\"I know, awful sorry but--Gosh all fish-hooks, look how I burned my\nhand! Gee whiz, it hurts! It hurts like the mischief! Why, that damn\nradiator is hot as--it's hot as--it's hotter 'n the hinges of Hades!\nLook! You can see the mark!\"\n\nSo, as they drove up to St. Mary's Hospital, with the nurses already\nlaying out the instruments for an operation to save her life, it was\nshe who consoled him and kissed the place to make it well, and though\nhe tried to be gruff and mature, he yielded to her and was glad to be\nbabied.\n\nThe ambulance whirled under the hooded carriage-entrance of the\nhospital, and instantly he was reduced to a zero in the nightmare\nsuccession of cork-floored halls, endless doors open on old women\nsitting up in bed, an elevator, the anesthetizing room, a young interne\ncontemptuous of husbands. He was permitted to kiss his wife; he saw a\nthin dark nurse fit the cone over her mouth and nose; he stiffened at a\nsweet and treacherous odor; then he was driven out, and on a high stool\nin a laboratory he sat dazed, longing to see her once again, to insist\nthat he had always loved her, had never for a second loved anybody else\nor looked at anybody else. In the laboratory he was conscious only of a\ndecayed object preserved in a bottle of yellowing alcohol. It made him\nvery sick, but he could not take his eyes from it. He was more aware of\nit than of waiting. His mind floated in abeyance, coming back always\nto that horrible bottle. To escape it he opened the door to the right,\nhoping to find a sane and business-like office. He realized that he was\nlooking into the operating-room; in one glance he took in Dr. Dilling,\nstrange in white gown and bandaged head, bending over the steel table\nwith its screws and wheels, then nurses holding basins and cotton\nsponges, and a swathed thing, just a lifeless chin and a mound of white\nin the midst of which was a square of sallow flesh with a gash a little\nbloody at the edges, protruding from the gash a cluster of forceps like\nclinging parasites.\n\nHe shut the door with haste. It may be that his frightened repentance of\nthe night and morning had not eaten in, but this dehumanizing interment\nof her who had been so pathetically human shook him utterly, and as he\ncrouched again on the high stool in the laboratory he swore faith to his\nwife... to Zenith... to business efficiency... to the Boosters'\nClub... to every faith of the Clan of Good Fellows.\n\nThen a nurse was soothing, \"All over! Perfect success! She'll come out\nfine! She'll be out from under the anesthetic soon, and you can see\nher.\"\n\nHe found her on a curious tilted bed, her face an unwholesome yellow but\nher purple lips moving slightly. Then only did he really believe that\nshe was alive. She was muttering. He bent, and heard her sighing, \"Hard\nget real maple syrup for pancakes.\" He laughed inexhaustibly; he beamed\non the nurse and proudly confided, \"Think of her talking about maple\nsyrup! By golly, I'm going to go and order a hundred gallons of it,\nright from Vermont!\"\n\n\nII\n\nShe was out of the hospital in seventeen days. He went to see her each\nafternoon, and in their long talks they drifted back to intimacy. Once\nhe hinted something of his relations to Tanis and the Bunch, and she was\ninflated by the view that a Wicked Woman had captivated her poor George.\n\nIf once he had doubted his neighbors and the supreme charm of the Good\nFellows, he was convinced now. You didn't, he noted, \"see Seneca Doane\ncoming around with any flowers or dropping in to chat with the Missus,\"\nbut Mrs. Howard Littlefield brought to the hospital her priceless wine\njelly (flavored with real wine); Orville Jones spent hours in picking\nout the kind of novels Mrs. Babbitt liked--nice love stories about New\nYork millionaries and Wyoming cowpunchers; Louetta Swanson knitted a\npink bed-jacket; Sidney Finkelstein and his merry brown-eyed flapper of\na wife selected the prettiest nightgown in all the stock of Parcher and\nStein.\n\nAll his friends ceased whispering about him, suspecting him. At the\nAthletic Club they asked after her daily. Club members whose names he\ndid not know stopped him to inquire, \"How's your good lady getting on?\"\nBabbitt felt that he was swinging from bleak uplands down into the rich\nwarm air of a valley pleasant with cottages.\n\nOne noon Vergil Gunch suggested, \"You planning to be at the hospital\nabout six? The wife and I thought we'd drop in.\" They did drop in. Gunch\nwas so humorous that Mrs. Babbitt said he must \"stop making her laugh\nbecause honestly it was hurting her incision.\" As they passed down the\nhall Gunch demanded amiably, \"George, old scout, you were soreheaded\nabout something, here a while back. I don't know why, and it's none of\nmy business. But you seem to be feeling all hunky-dory again, and why\ndon't you come join us in the Good Citizens' League, old man? We have\nsome corking times together, and we need your advice.\"\n\nThen did Babbitt, almost tearful with joy at being coaxed instead of\nbullied, at being permitted to stop fighting, at being able to desert\nwithout injuring his opinion of himself, cease utterly to be a domestic\nrevolutionist. He patted Gunch's shoulder, and next day he became a\nmember of the Good Citizens' League.\n\nWithin two weeks no one in the League was more violent regarding the\nwickedness of Seneca Doane, the crimes of labor unions, the perils of\nimmigration, and the delights of golf, morality, and bank-accounts than\nwas George F. Babbitt.\n\n\n\n\n\nI\n\nTHE Good Citizens' League had spread through the country, but nowhere\nwas it so effective and well esteemed as in cities of the type of\nZenith, commercial cities of a few hundred thousand inhabitants, most\nof which--though not all--lay inland, against a background of\ncornfields and mines and of small towns which depended upon them for\nmortgage-loans, table-manners, art, social philosophy and millinery.\n\nTo the League belonged most of the prosperous citizens of Zenith. They\nwere not all of the kind who called themselves \"Regular Guys.\" Besides\nthese hearty fellows, these salesmen of prosperity, there were the\naristocrats, that is, the men who were richer or had been rich for more\ngenerations: the presidents of banks and of factories, the land-owners,\nthe corporation lawyers, the fashionable doctors, and the few young-old\nmen who worked not at all but, reluctantly remaining in Zenith,\ncollected luster-ware and first editions as though they were back in\nParis. All of them agreed that the working-classes must be kept in their\nplace; and all of them perceived that American Democracy did not imply\nany equality of wealth, but did demand a wholesome sameness of thought,\ndress, painting, morals, and vocabulary.\n\nIn this they were like the ruling-class of any other country,\nparticularly of Great Britain, but they differed in being more vigorous\nand in actually trying to produce the accepted standards which all\nclasses, everywhere, desire, but usually despair of realizing.\n\nThe longest struggle of the Good Citizens' League was against the\nOpen Shop--which was secretly a struggle against all union labor.\nAccompanying it was an Americanization Movement, with evening classes in\nEnglish and history and economics, and daily articles in the newspapers,\nso that newly arrived foreigners might learn that the true-blue and\none hundred per cent. American way of settling labor-troubles was for\nworkmen to trust and love their employers.\n\nThe League was more than generous in approving other organizations\nwhich agreed with its aims. It helped the Y.M. C.A. to raise a\ntwo-hundred-thousand-dollar fund for a new building. Babbitt, Vergil\nGunch, Sidney Finkelstein, and even Charles McKelvey told the spectators\nat movie theaters how great an influence for manly Christianity the\n\"good old Y.\" had been in their own lives; and the hoar and mighty\nColonel Rutherford Snow, owner of the Advocate-Times, was photographed\nclasping the hand of Sheldon Smeeth of the Y.M.C.A. It is true\nthat afterward, when Smeeth lisped, \"You must come to one of our\nprayer-meetings,\" the ferocious Colonel bellowed, \"What the hell would\nI do that for? I've got a bar of my own,\" but this did not appear in the\npublic prints.\n\nThe League was of value to the American Legion at a time when certain of\nthe lesser and looser newspapers were criticizing that organization of\nveterans of the Great War. One evening a number of young men raided\nthe Zenith Socialist Headquarters, burned its records, beat the\noffice staff, and agreeably dumped desks out of the window. All of the\nnewspapers save the Advocate-Times and the Evening Advocate attributed\nthis valuable but perhaps hasty direct-action to the American Legion.\nThen a flying squadron from the Good Citizens' League called on the\nunfair papers and explained that no ex-soldier could possibly do such\na thing, and the editors saw the light, and retained their advertising.\nWhen Zenith's lone Conscientious Objector came home from prison and was\nrighteously run out of town, the newspapers referred to the perpetrators\nas an \"unidentified mob.\"\n\n\nII\n\nIn all the activities and triumphs of the Good Citizens' League Babbitt\ntook part, and completely won back to self-respect, placidity, and the\naffection of his friends. But he began to protest, \"Gosh, I've done my\nshare in cleaning up the city. I want to tend to business. Think I'll\njust kind of slacken up on this G.C.L. stuff now.\"\n\nHe had returned to the church as he had returned to the Boosters' Club.\nHe had even endured the lavish greeting which Sheldon Smeeth gave him.\nHe was worried lest during his late discontent he had imperiled his\nsalvation. He was not quite sure there was a Heaven to be attained, but\nDr. John Jennison Drew said there was, and Babbitt was not going to take\na chance.\n\nOne evening when he was walking past Dr. Drew's parsonage he impulsively\nwent in and found the pastor in his study.\n\n\"Jus' minute--getting 'phone call,\" said Dr. Drew in businesslike tones,\nthen, aggressively, to the telephone: \"'Lo--'lo! This Berkey and Hannis?\nReverend Drew speaking. Where the dickens is the proof for next Sunday's\ncalendar? Huh? Y' ought to have it here. Well, I can't help it if\nthey're ALL sick! I got to have it to-night. Get an A.D.T. boy and shoot\nit up here quick.\"\n\nHe turned, without slackening his briskness. \"Well, Brother Babbitt,\nwhat c'n I do for you?\"\n\n\"I just wanted to ask--Tell you how it is, dominie: Here a while ago I\nguess I got kind of slack. Took a few drinks and so on. What I wanted\nto ask is: How is it if a fellow cuts that all out and comes back to his\nsenses? Does it sort of, well, you might say, does it score against him\nin the long run?\"\n\nThe Reverend Dr. Drew was suddenly interested. \"And, uh, brother--the\nother things, too? Women?\"\n\n\"No, practically, you might say, practically not at all.\"\n\n\"Don't hesitate to tell me, brother! That's what I'm here for. Been\ngoing on joy-rides? Squeezing girls in cars?\" The reverend eyes\nglistened.\n\n\"No--no--\"\n\n\"Well, I'll tell you. I've got a deputation from the Don't Make\nProhibition a Joke Association coming to see me in a quarter of an\nhour, and one from the Anti-Birth-Control Union at a quarter of ten.\" He\nbusily glanced at his watch. \"But I can take five minutes off and pray\nwith you. Kneel right down by your chair, brother. Don't be ashamed to\nseek the guidance of God.\"\n\nBabbitt's scalp itched and he longed to flee, but Dr. Drew had already\nflopped down beside his desk-chair and his voice had changed from\nrasping efficiency to an unctuous familiarity with sin and with the\nAlmighty. Babbitt also knelt, while Drew gloated:\n\n\"O Lord, thou seest our brother here, who has been led astray by\nmanifold temptations. O Heavenly Father, make his heart to be pure,\nas pure as a little child's. Oh, let him know again the joy of a manly\ncourage to abstain from evil--\"\n\nSheldon Smeeth came frolicking into the study. At the sight of the two\nmen he smirked, forgivingly patted Babbitt on the shoulder, and\nknelt beside him, his arm about him, while he authorized Dr. Drew's\nimprecations with moans of \"Yes, Lord! Help our brother, Lord!\"\n\nThough he was trying to keep his eyes closed, Babbitt squinted between\nhis fingers and saw the pastor glance at his watch as he concluded with\na triumphant, \"And let him never be afraid to come to Us for counsel and\ntender care, and let him know that the church can lead him as a little\nlamb.\"\n\nDr. Drew sprang up, rolled his eyes in the general direction of Heaven,\nchucked his watch into his pocket, and demanded, \"Has the deputation\ncome yet, Sheldy?\"\n\n\"Yep, right outside,\" Sheldy answered, with equal liveliness; then,\ncaressingly, to Babbitt, \"Brother, if it would help, I'd love to go into\nthe next room and pray with you while Dr. Drew is receiving the brothers\nfrom the Don't Make Prohibition a Joke Association.\"\n\n\"No--no thanks--can't take the time!\" yelped Babbitt, rushing toward the\ndoor.\n\nThereafter he was often seen at the Chatham Road Presbyterian Church,\nbut it is recorded that he avoided shaking hands with the pastor at the\ndoor.\n\n\nIII\n\nIf his moral fiber had been so weakened by rebellion that he was not\nquite dependable in the more rigorous campaigns of the Good Citizens'\nLeague nor quite appreciative of the church, yet there was no doubt of\nthe joy with which Babbitt returned to the pleasures of his home and of\nthe Athletic Club, the Boosters, the Elks.\n\nVerona and Kenneth Escott were eventually and hesitatingly married.\nFor the wedding Babbitt was dressed as carefully as was Verona; he was\ncrammed into the morning-coat he wore to teas thrice a year; and with a\ncertain relief, after Verona and Kenneth had driven away in a limousine,\nhe returned to the house, removed the morning coat, sat with his aching\nfeet up on the davenport, and reflected that his wife and he could have\nthe living-room to themselves now, and not have to listen to Verona and\nKenneth worrying, in a cultured collegiate manner, about minimum wages\nand the Drama League.\n\nBut even this sinking into peace was less consoling than his return to\nbeing one of the best-loved men in the Boosters' Club.\n\n\nIV\n\nPresident Willis Ijams began that Boosters' Club luncheon by standing\nquiet and staring at them so unhappily that they feared he was about\nto announce the death of a Brother Booster. He spoke slowly then, and\ngravely:\n\n\"Boys, I have something shocking to reveal to you; something terrible\nabout one of our own members.\"\n\nSeveral Boosters, including Babbitt, looked disconcerted.\n\n\"A knight of the grip, a trusted friend of mine, recently made a trip\nup-state, and in a certain town, where a certain Booster spent his\nboyhood, he found out something which can no longer be concealed. In\nfact, he discovered the inward nature of a man whom we have accepted as\na Real Guy and as one of us. Gentlemen, I cannot trust my voice to say\nit, so I have written it down.\"\n\nHe uncovered a large blackboard and on it, in huge capitals, was the\nlegend:\n\nGeorge Follansbee Babbitt--oh you Folly!\n\nThe Boosters cheered, they laughed, they wept, they threw rolls at\nBabbitt, they cried, \"Speech, speech! Oh you Folly!\"\n\nPresident Ijams continued:\n\n\"That, gentlemen, is the awful thing Georgie Babbitt has been concealing\nall these years, when we thought he was just plain George F. Now I want\nyou to tell us, taking it in turn, what you've always supposed the F.\nstood for.\"\n\nFlivver, they suggested, and Frog-face and Flathead and Farinaceous and\nFreezone and Flapdoodle and Foghorn. By the joviality of their insults\nBabbitt knew that he had been taken back to their hearts, and happily he\nrose.\n\n\"Boys, I've got to admit it. I've never worn a wrist-watch, or parted\nmy name in the middle, but I will confess to 'Follansbee.' My only\njustification is that my old dad--though otherwise he was perfectly\nsane, and packed an awful wallop when it came to trimming the City\nFellers at checkers--named me after the family doc, old Dr. Ambrose\nFollansbee. I apologize, boys. In my next what-d'you-call-it I'll see\nto it that I get named something really practical--something that sounds\nswell and yet is good and virile--something, in fact, like that\ngrand old name so familiar to every household--that bold and almost\noverpowering name, Willis Jimjams Ijams!\"\n\nHe knew by the cheer that he was secure again and popular; he knew that\nhe would no more endanger his security and popularity by straying from\nthe Clan of Good Fellows.\n\n\nV\n\nHenry Thompson dashed into the office, clamoring, \"George! Big news!\nJake Offutt says the Traction Bunch are dissatisfied with the way\nSanders, Torrey and Wing handled their last deal, and they're willing to\ndicker with us!\"\n\nBabbitt was pleased in the realization that the last scar of his\nrebellion was healed, yet as he drove home he was annoyed by such\nbackground thoughts as had never weakened him in his days of belligerent\nconformity. He discovered that he actually did not consider the Traction\ngroup quite honest. \"Well, he'd carry out one more deal for them, but\nas soon as it was practicable, maybe as soon as old Henry Thompson died,\nhe'd break away from all association from them. He was forty-eight; in\ntwelve years he'd be sixty; he wanted to leave a clean business to his\ngrandchildren. Course there was a lot of money in negotiating for the\nTraction people, and a fellow had to look at things in a practical way,\nonly--\" He wriggled uncomfortably. He wanted to tell the Traction group\nwhat he thought of them. \"Oh, he couldn't do it, not now. If he offended\nthem this second time, they would crush him. But--\"\n\nHe was conscious that his line of progress seemed confused. He wondered\nwhat he would do with his future. He was still young; was he through\nwith all adventuring? He felt that he had been trapped into the very\nnet from which he had with such fury escaped and, supremest jest of all,\nbeen made to rejoice in the trapping.\n\n\"They've licked me; licked me to a finish!\" he whimpered.\n\nThe house was peaceful, that evening, and he enjoyed a game of pinochle\nwith his wife. He indignantly told the Tempter that he was content to do\nthings in the good old fashioned way. The day after, he went to see the\npurchasing-agent of the Street Traction Company and they made plans for\nthe secret purchase of lots along the Evanston Road. But as he drove to\nhis office he struggled, \"I'm going to run things and figure out things\nto suit myself--when I retire.\"\n\n\nVI\n\nTed had come down from the University for the week-end. Though he no\nlonger spoke of mechanical engineering and though he was reticent about\nhis opinion of his instructors, he seemed no more reconciled to college,\nand his chief interest was his wireless telephone set.\n\nOn Saturday evening he took Eunice Littlefield to a dance at Devon\nWoods. Babbitt had a glimpse of her, bouncing in the seat of the car,\nbrilliant in a scarlet cloak over a frock of thinnest creamy silk. They\ntwo had not returned when the Babbitts went to bed, at half-past eleven.\nAt a blurred indefinite time of late night Babbitt was awakened by\nthe ring of the telephone and gloomily crawled down-stairs. Howard\nLittlefield was speaking:\n\n\"George, Euny isn't back yet. Is Ted?\"\n\n\"No--at least his door is open--\"\n\n\"They ought to be home. Eunice said the dance would be over at midnight.\nWhat's the name of those people where they're going?\"\n\n\"Why, gosh, tell the truth, I don't know, Howard. It's some classmate of\nTed's, out in Devon Woods. Don't see what we can do. Wait, I'll skip up\nand ask Myra if she knows their name.\"\n\nBabbitt turned on the light in Ted's room. It was a brown boyish room;\ndisordered dresser, worn books, a high-school pennant, photographs of\nbasket-ball teams and baseball teams. Ted was decidedly not there.\n\nMrs. Babbitt, awakened, irritably observed that she certainly did not\nknow the name of Ted's host, that it was late, that Howard Littlefield\nwas but little better than a born fool, and that she was sleepy. But\nshe remained awake and worrying while Babbitt, on the sleeping-porch,\nstruggled back into sleep through the incessant soft rain of her\nremarks. It was after dawn when he was aroused by her shaking him and\ncalling \"George! George!\" in something like horror.\n\n\"Wha--wha--what is it?\"\n\n\"Come here quick and see. Be quiet!\"\n\nShe led him down the hall to the door of Ted's room and pushed it gently\nopen. On the worn brown rug he saw a froth of rose-colored chiffon\nlingerie; on the sedate Morris chair a girl's silver slipper. And on the\npillows were two sleepy heads--Ted's and Eunice's.\n\nTed woke to grin, and to mutter with unconvincing defiance, \"Good\nmorning! Let me introduce my wife--Mrs. Theodore Roosevelt Eunice\nLittlefield Babbitt, Esquiress.\"\n\n\"Good God!\" from Babbitt, and from his wife a long wailing, \"You've gone\nand--\"\n\n\"We got married last evening. Wife! Sit up and say a pretty good morning\nto mother-in-law.\"\n\nBut Eunice hid her shoulders and her charming wild hair under the\npillow.\n\nBy nine o'clock the assembly which was gathered about Ted and Eunice\nin the living-room included Mr. and Mrs. George Babbitt, Dr. and Mrs.\nHoward Littlefield, Mr. and Mrs. Kenneth Escott, Mr. and Mrs. Henry\nT. Thompson, and Tinka Babbitt, who was the only pleased member of the\ninquisition.\n\n### Summary:"}
{"original_length": 17473, "trunc_length": 16384, "text": "\n\nSummarize the following text into a summary of less than 800 words.\n### Text:\n\nI\n\nTHE Zenith Street Traction Company planned to build car-repair shops in\nthe suburb of Dorchester, but when they came to buy the land they\nfound it held, on options, by the Babbitt-Thompson Realty Company. The\npurchasing-agent, the first vice-president, and even the president of\nthe Traction Company protested against the Babbitt price. They mentioned\ntheir duty toward stockholders, they threatened an appeal to the courts,\nthough somehow the appeal to the courts was never carried out and the\nofficials found it wiser to compromise with Babbitt. Carbon copies of\nthe correspondence are in the company's files, where they may be viewed\nby any public commission.\n\nJust after this Babbitt deposited three thousand dollars in the bank,\nthe purchasing-agent of the Street Traction Company bought a five\nthousand dollar car, the first vice-president built a home in Devon\nWoods, and the president was appointed minister to a foreign country.\n\nTo obtain the options, to tie up one man's land without letting his\nneighbor know, had been an unusual strain on Babbitt. It was necessary\nto introduce rumors about planning garages and stores, to pretend\nthat he wasn't taking any more options, to wait and look as bored as a\npoker-player at a time when the failure to secure a key-lot threatened\nhis whole plan. To all this was added a nerve-jabbing quarrel with his\nsecret associates in the deal. They did not wish Babbitt and Thompson\nto have any share in the deal except as brokers. Babbitt rather\nagreed. \"Ethics of the business-broker ought to strictly represent his\nprinciples and not get in on the buying,\" he said to Thompson.\n\n\"Ethics, rats! Think I'm going to see that bunch of holy grafters get\naway with the swag and us not climb in?\" snorted old Henry.\n\n\"Well, I don't like to do it. Kind of double-crossing.\"\n\n\"It ain't. It's triple-crossing. It's the public that gets\ndouble-crossed. Well, now we've been ethical and got it out of our\nsystems, the question is where we can raise a loan to handle some of\nthe property for ourselves, on the Q. T. We can't go to our bank for it.\nMight come out.\"\n\n\"I could see old Eathorne. He's close as the tomb.\"\n\n\"That's the stuff.\"\n\nEathorne was glad, he said, to \"invest in character,\" to make Babbitt\nthe loan and see to it that the loan did not appear on the books of the\nbank. Thus certain of the options which Babbitt and Thompson obtained\nwere on parcels of real estate which they themselves owned, though the\nproperty did not appear in their names.\n\nIn the midst of closing this splendid deal, which stimulated business\nand public confidence by giving an example of increased real-estate\nactivity, Babbitt was overwhelmed to find that he had a dishonest person\nworking for him.\n\nThe dishonest one was Stanley Graff, the outside salesman.\n\nFor some time Babbitt had been worried about Graff. He did not keep his\nword to tenants. In order to rent a house he would promise repairs\nwhich the owner had not authorized. It was suspected that he juggled\ninventories of furnished houses so that when the tenant left he had\nto pay for articles which had never been in the house and the price\nof which Graff put into his pocket. Babbitt had not been able to prove\nthese suspicions, and though he had rather planned to discharge Graff he\nhad never quite found time for it.\n\nNow into Babbitt's private room charged a red-faced man, panting, \"Look\nhere! I've come to raise particular merry hell, and unless you have that\nfellow pinched, I will!\" \"What's--Calm down, o' man. What's trouble?\"\n\n\"Trouble! Huh! Here's the trouble--\"\n\n\"Sit down and take it easy! They can hear you all over the building!\"\n\n\"This fellow Graff you got working for you, he leases me a house. I\nwas in yesterday and signs the lease, all O.K., and he was to get the\nowner's signature and mail me the lease last night. Well, and he did.\nThis morning I comes down to breakfast and the girl says a fellow had\ncome to the house right after the early delivery and told her he wanted\nan envelope that had been mailed by mistake, big long envelope with\n'Babbitt-Thompson' in the corner of it. Sure enough, there it was, so\nshe lets him have it. And she describes the fellow to me, and it was\nthis Graff. So I 'phones to him and he, the poor fool, he admits it! He\nsays after my lease was all signed he got a better offer from another\nfellow and he wanted my lease back. Now what you going to do about it?\"\n\n\"Your name is--?\"\n\n\"William Varney--W. K. Varney.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes. That was the Garrison house.\" Babbitt sounded the buzzer. When\nMiss McGoun came in, he demanded, \"Graff gone out?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Will you look through his desk and see if there is a lease made out to\nMr. Varney on the Garrison house?\" To Varney: \"Can't tell you how sorry\nI am this happened. Needless to say, I'll fire Graff the minute he comes\nin. And of course your lease stands. But there's one other thing I'd\nlike to do. I'll tell the owner not to pay us the commission but apply\nit to your rent. No! Straight! I want to. To be frank, this thing shakes\nme up bad. I suppose I've always been a Practical Business Man. Probably\nI've told one or two fairy stories in my time, when the occasion called\nfor it--you know: sometimes you have to lay things on thick, to impress\nboneheads. But this is the first time I've ever had to accuse one of\nmy own employees of anything more dishonest than pinching a few stamps.\nHonest, it would hurt me if we profited by it. So you'll let me hand you\nthe commission? Good!\"\n\n\nII\n\nHe walked through the February city, where trucks flung up a spattering\nof slush and the sky was dark above dark brick cornices. He came back\nmiserable. He, who respected the law, had broken it by concealing the\nFederal crime of interception of the mails. But he could not see Graff\ngo to jail and his wife suffer. Worse, he had to discharge Graff and\nthis was a part of office routine which he feared. He liked people\nso much, he so much wanted them to like him that he could not bear\ninsulting them.\n\nMiss McGoun dashed in to whisper, with the excitement of an approaching\nscene, \"He's here!\"\n\n\"Mr. Graff? Ask him to come in.\"\n\nHe tried to make himself heavy and calm in his chair, and to keep his\neyes expressionless. Graff stalked in--a man of thirty-five, dapper,\neye-glassed, with a foppish mustache.\n\n\"Want me?\" said Graff.\n\n\"Yes. Sit down.\"\n\nGraff continued to stand, grunting, \"I suppose that old nut Varney has\nbeen in to see you. Let me explain about him. He's a regular tightwad,\nand he sticks out for every cent, and he practically lied to me about\nhis ability to pay the rent--I found that out just after we signed up.\nAnd then another fellow comes along with a better offer for the house,\nand I felt it was my duty to the firm to get rid of Varney, and I was\nso worried about it I skun up there and got back the lease. Honest, Mr.\nBabbitt, I didn't intend to pull anything crooked. I just wanted the\nfirm to have all the commis--\"\n\n\"Wait now, Stan. This may all be true, but I've been having a lot of\ncomplaints about you. Now I don't s'pose you ever mean to do wrong,\nand I think if you just get a good lesson that'll jog you up a little,\nyou'll turn out a first-class realtor yet. But I don't see how I can\nkeep you on.\"\n\nGraff leaned against the filing-cabinet, his hands in his pockets, and\nlaughed. \"So I'm fired! Well, old Vision and Ethics, I'm tickled\nto death! But I don't want you to think you can get away with any\nholier-than-thou stuff. Sure I've pulled some raw stuff--a little of\nit--but how could I help it, in this office?\"\n\n\"Now, by God, young man--\"\n\n\"Tut, tut! Keep the naughty temper down, and don't holler, because\neverybody in the outside office will hear you. They're probably\nlistening right now. Babbitt, old dear, you're crooked in the first\nplace and a damn skinflint in the second. If you paid me a decent salary\nI wouldn't have to steal pennies off a blind man to keep my wife from\nstarving. Us married just five months, and her the nicest girl living,\nand you keeping us flat broke all the time, you damned old thief, so you\ncan put money away for your saphead of a son and your wishywashy fool\nof a daughter! Wait, now! You'll by God take it, or I'll bellow so the\nwhole office will hear it! And crooked--Say, if I told the prosecuting\nattorney what I know about this last Street Traction option steal, both\nyou and me would go to jail, along with some nice, clean, pious, high-up\ntraction guns!\"\n\n\"Well, Stan, looks like we were coming down to cases. That deal--There\nwas nothing crooked about it. The only way you can get progress is for\nthe broad-gauged men to get things done; and they got to be rewarded--\"\n\n\"Oh, for Pete's sake, don't get virtuous on me! As I gather it, I'm\nfired. All right. It's a good thing for me. And if I catch you knocking\nme to any other firm, I'll squeal all I know about you and Henry T. and\nthe dirty little lickspittle deals that you corporals of industry pull\noff for the bigger and brainier crooks, and you'll get chased out of\ntown. And me--you're right, Babbitt, I've been going crooked, but now\nI'm going straight, and the first step will be to get a job in some\noffice where the boss doesn't talk about Ideals. Bad luck, old dear, and\nyou can stick your job up the sewer!\"\n\nBabbitt sat for a long time, alternately raging, \"I'll have him\narrested,\" and yearning \"I wonder--No, I've never done anything that\nwasn't necessary to keep the Wheels of Progress moving.\"\n\nNext day he hired in Graff's place Fritz Weilinger, the salesman of his\nmost injurious rival, the East Side Homes and Development Company, and\nthus at once annoyed his competitor and acquired an excellent man.\nYoung Fritz was a curly-headed, merry, tennis-playing youngster. He made\ncustomers welcome to the office. Babbitt thought of him as a son, and in\nhim had much comfort.\n\n\nIII\n\nAn abandoned race-track on the outskirts of Chicago, a plot excellent\nfor factory sites, was to be sold, and Jake Offut asked Babbitt to\nbid on it for him. The strain of the Street Traction deal and his\ndisappointment in Stanley Graff had so shaken Babbitt that he found\nit hard to sit at his desk and concentrate. He proposed to his family,\n\"Look here, folks! Do you know who's going to trot up to Chicago for a\ncouple of days--just week-end; won't lose but one day of school--know\nwho's going with that celebrated business-ambassador, George F. Babbitt?\nWhy, Mr. Theodore Roosevelt Babbitt!\"\n\n\"Hurray!\" Ted shouted, and \"Oh, maybe the Babbitt men won't paint that\nlil ole town red!\"\n\nAnd, once away from the familiar implications of home, they were two men\ntogether. Ted was young only in his assumption of oldness, and the only\nrealms, apparently, in which Babbitt had a larger and more grown-up\nknowledge than Ted's were the details of real estate and the phrases of\npolitics. When the other sages of the Pullman smoking-compartment had\nleft them to themselves, Babbitt's voice did not drop into the playful\nand otherwise offensive tone in which one addresses children but\ncontinued its overwhelming and monotonous rumble, and Ted tried to\nimitate it in his strident tenor:\n\n\"Gee, dad, you certainly did show up that poor boot when he got flip\nabout the League of Nations!\"\n\n\"Well, the trouble with a lot of these fellows is, they simply don't\nknow what they're talking about. They don't get down to facts.... What\ndo you think of Ken Escott?\"\n\n\"I'll tell you, dad: it strikes me Ken is a nice lad; no special faults\nexcept he smokes too much; but slow, Lord! Why, if we don't give him\na shove the poor dumb-bell never will propose! And Rone just as bad.\nSlow.\"\n\n\"Yes, I guess you're right. They're slow. They haven't either one of 'em\ngot our pep.\"\n\n\"That's right. They're slow. I swear, dad, I don't know how Rone got\ninto our family! I'll bet, if the truth were known, you were a bad old\negg when you were a kid!\"\n\n\"Well, I wasn't so slow!\"\n\n\"I'll bet you weren't! I'll bet you didn't miss many tricks!\"\n\n\"Well, when I was out with the girls I didn't spend all the time telling\n'em about the strike in the knitting industry!\"\n\nThey roared together, and together lighted cigars.\n\n\"What are we going to do with 'em?\" Babbitt consulted.\n\n\"Gosh, I don't know. I swear, sometimes I feel like taking Ken aside and\nputting him over the jumps and saying to him, 'Young fella me lad, are\nyou going to marry young Rone, or are you going to talk her to death?\nHere you are getting on toward thirty, and you're only making twenty or\ntwenty-five a week. When you going to develop a sense of responsibility\nand get a raise? If there's anything that George F. or I can do to help\nyou, call on us, but show a little speed, anyway!'\"\n\n\"Well, at that, it might not be so bad if you or I talked to him, except\nhe might not understand. He's one of these high brows. He can't come\ndown to cases and lay his cards on the table and talk straight out from\nthe shoulder, like you or I can.\"\n\n\"That's right, he's like all these highbrows.\"\n\n\"That's so, like all of 'em.\"\n\n\"That's a fact.\"\n\nThey sighed, and were silent and thoughtful and happy.\n\nThe conductor came in. He had once called at Babbitt's office, to ask\nabout houses. \"H' are you, Mr. Babbitt! We going to have you with us to\nChicago? This your boy?\"\n\n\"Yes, this is my son Ted.\"\n\n\"Well now, what do you know about that! Here I been thinking you were\na youngster yourself, not a day over forty, hardly, and you with this\ngreat big fellow!\"\n\n\"Forty? Why, brother, I'll never see forty-five again!\"\n\n\"Is that a fact! Wouldn't hardly 'a' thought it!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, it's a bad give-away for the old man when he has to travel\nwith a young whale like Ted here!\"\n\n\"You're right, it is.\" To Ted: \"I suppose you're in college now?\"\n\nProudly, \"No, not till next fall. I'm just kind of giving the diff'rent\ncolleges the once-over now.\"\n\nAs the conductor went on his affable way, huge watch-chain jingling\nagainst his blue chest, Babbitt and Ted gravely considered colleges.\nThey arrived at Chicago late at night; they lay abed in the morning,\nrejoicing, \"Pretty nice not to have to get up and get down to breakfast,\nheh?\" They were staying at the modest Eden Hotel, because Zenith\nbusiness men always stayed at the Eden, but they had dinner in the\nbrocade and crystal Versailles Room of the Regency Hotel. Babbitt\nordered Blue Point oysters with cocktail sauce, a tremendous steak with\na tremendous platter of French fried potatoes, two pots of coffee, apple\npie with ice cream for both of them and, for Ted, an extra piece of\nmince pie.\n\n\"Hot stuff! Some feed, young fella!\" Ted admired.\n\n\"Huh! You stick around with me, old man, and I'll show you a good time!\"\n\nThey went to a musical comedy and nudged each other at the matrimonial\njokes and the prohibition jokes; they paraded the lobby, arm in arm,\nbetween acts, and in the glee of his first release from the shame which\ndissevers fathers and sons Ted chuckled, \"Dad, did you ever hear the one\nabout the three milliners and the judge?\"\n\nWhen Ted had returned to Zenith, Babbitt was lonely. As he was trying\nto make alliance between Offutt and certain Milwaukee interests which\nwanted the race-track plot, most of his time was taken up in waiting for\ntelephone calls.... Sitting on the edge of his bed, holding the portable\ntelephone, asking wearily, \"Mr. Sagen not in yet? Didn' he leave any\nmessage for me? All right, I'll hold the wire.\" Staring at a stain on\nthe wall, reflecting that it resembled a shoe, and being bored by this\ntwentieth discovery that it resembled a shoe. Lighting a cigarette;\nthen, bound to the telephone with no ashtray in reach, wondering what\nto do with this burning menace and anxiously trying to toss it into the\ntiled bathroom. At last, on the telephone, \"No message, eh? All right,\nI'll call up again.\"\n\nOne afternoon he wandered through snow-rutted streets of which he\nhad never heard, streets of small tenements and two-family houses and\nmarooned cottages. It came to him that he had nothing to do, that there\nwas nothing he wanted to do. He was bleakly lonely in the evening, when\nhe dined by himself at the Regency Hotel. He sat in the lobby afterward,\nin a plush chair bedecked with the Saxe-Coburg arms, lighting a cigar\nand looking for some one who would come and play with him and save him\nfrom thinking. In the chair next to him (showing the arms of Lithuania)\nwas a half-familiar man, a large red-faced man with pop eyes and a\ndeficient yellow mustache. He seemed kind and insignificant, and as\nlonely as Babbitt himself. He wore a tweed suit and a reluctant orange\ntie.\n\nIt came to Babbitt with a pyrotechnic crash. The melancholy stranger was\nSir Gerald Doak.\n\nInstinctively Babbitt rose, bumbling, \"How're you, Sir Gerald? 'Member\nwe met in Zenith, at Charley McKelvey's? Babbitt's my name--real\nestate.\"\n\n\"Oh! How d' you do.\" Sir Gerald shook hands flabbily.\n\nEmbarrassed, standing, wondering how he could retreat, Babbitt\nmaundered, \"Well, I suppose you been having a great trip since we saw\nyou in Zenith.\"\n\n\"Quite. British Columbia and California and all over the place,\" he said\ndoubtfully, looking at Babbitt lifelessly.\n\n\"How did you find business conditions in British Columbia? Or I suppose\nmaybe you didn't look into 'em. Scenery and sport and so on?\"\n\n\"Scenery? Oh, capital. But business conditions--You know, Mr. Babbitt,\nthey're having almost as much unemployment as we are.\" Sir Gerald was\nspeaking warmly now.\n\n\"So? Business conditions not so doggone good, eh?\"\n\n\"No, business conditions weren't at all what I'd hoped to find them.\"\n\n\"Not good, eh?\"\n\n\"No, not--not really good.\"\n\n\"That's a darn shame. Well--I suppose you're waiting for somebody to\ntake you out to some big shindig, Sir Gerald.\"\n\n\"Shindig? Oh. Shindig. No, to tell you the truth, I was wondering what\nthe deuce I could do this evening. Don't know a soul in Tchicahgo. I\nwonder if you happen to know whether there's a good theater in this\ncity?\"\n\n\"Good? Why say, they're running grand opera right now! I guess maybe\nyou'd like that.\"\n\n\"Eh? Eh? Went to the opera once in London. Covent Garden sort of thing.\nShocking! No, I was wondering if there was a good cinema-movie.\"\n\nBabbitt was sitting down, hitching his chair over, shouting, \"Movie?\nSay, Sir Gerald, I supposed of course you had a raft of dames waiting to\nlead you out to some soiree--\"\n\n\"God forbid!\"\n\n\"--but if you haven't, what do you say you and me go to a movie? There's\na peach of a film at the Grantham: Bill Hart in a bandit picture.\"\n\n\"Right-o! Just a moment while I get my coat.\"\n\nSwollen with greatness, slightly afraid lest the noble blood of\nNottingham change its mind and leave him at any street corner, Babbitt\nparaded with Sir Gerald Doak to the movie palace and in silent bliss sat\nbeside him, trying not to be too enthusiastic, lest the knight despise\nhis adoration of six-shooters and broncos. At the end Sir Gerald\nmurmured, \"Jolly good picture, this. So awfully decent of you to take\nme. Haven't enjoyed myself so much for weeks. All these Hostesses--they\nnever let you go to the cinema!\"\n\n\"The devil you say!\" Babbitt's speech had lost the delicate refinement\nand all the broad A's with which he had adorned it, and become hearty\nand natural. \"Well, I'm tickled to death you liked it, Sir Gerald.\"\n\nThey crawled past the knees of fat women into the aisle; they stood in\nthe lobby waving their arms in the rite of putting on overcoats. Babbitt\nhinted, \"Say, how about a little something to eat? I know a place where\nwe could get a swell rarebit, and we might dig up a little drink--that\nis, if you ever touch the stuff.\"\n\n\"Rather! But why don't you come to my room? I've some Scotch--not half\nbad.\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't want to use up all your hootch. It's darn nice of you,\nbut--You probably want to hit the hay.\"\n\nSir Gerald was transformed. He was beefily yearning. \"Oh really, now;\nI haven't had a decent evening for so long! Having to go to all these\ndances. No chance to discuss business and that sort of thing. Do be a\ngood chap and come along. Won't you?\"\n\n\"Will I? You bet! I just thought maybe--Say, by golly, it does do a\nfellow good, don't it, to sit and visit about business conditions,\nafter he's been to these balls and masquerades and banquets and all\nthat society stuff. I often feel that way in Zenith. Sure, you bet I'll\ncome.\"\n\n\"That's awfully nice of you.\" They beamed along the street. \"Look\nhere, old chap, can you tell me, do American cities always keep up this\ndreadful social pace? All these magnificent parties?\"\n\n\"Go on now, quit your kidding! Gosh, you with court balls and functions\nand everything--\"\n\n\"No, really, old chap! Mother and I--Lady Doak, I should say, we usually\nplay a hand of bezique and go to bed at ten. Bless my soul, I couldn't\nkeep up your beastly pace! And talking! All your American women, they\nknow so much--culture and that sort of thing. This Mrs. McKelvey--your\nfriend--\"\n\n\"Yuh, old Lucile. Good kid.\"\n\n\"--she asked me which of the galleries I liked best in Florence. Or was\nit in Firenze? Never been in Italy in my life! And primitives. Did I\nlike primitives. Do you know what the deuce a primitive is?\"\n\n\"Me? I should say not! But I know what a discount for cash is.\"\n\n\"Rather! So do I, by George! But primitives!\"\n\n\"Yuh! Primitives!\"\n\nThey laughed with the sound of a Boosters' luncheon.\n\nSir Gerald's room was, except for his ponderous and durable English\nbags, very much like the room of George F. Babbitt; and quite in the\nmanner of Babbitt he disclosed a huge whisky flask, looked proud and\nhospitable, and chuckled, \"Say, when, old chap.\"\n\nIt was after the third drink that Sir Gerald proclaimed, \"How do you\nYankees get the notion that writing chaps like Bertrand Shaw and this\nWells represent us? The real business England, we think those chaps are\ntraitors. Both our countries have their comic Old Aristocracy--you know,\nold county families, hunting people and all that sort of thing--and we\nboth have our wretched labor leaders, but we both have a backbone of\nsound business men who run the whole show.\"\n\n\"You bet. Here's to the real guys!\"\n\n\"I'm with you! Here's to ourselves!\"\n\nIt was after the fourth drink that Sir Gerald asked humbly, \"What do you\nthink of North Dakota mortgages?\" but it was not till after the fifth\nthat Babbitt began to call him \"Jerry,\" and Sir Gerald confided, \"I\nsay, do you mind if I pull off my boots?\" and ecstatically stretched his\nknightly feet, his poor, tired, hot, swollen feet out on the bed.\n\nAfter the sixth, Babbitt irregularly arose. \"Well, I better be hiking\nalong. Jerry, you're a regular human being! I wish to thunder we'd been\nbetter acquainted in Zenith. Lookit. Can't you come back and stay with\nme a while?\"\n\n\"So sorry--must go to New York to-morrow. Most awfully sorry, old boy.\nI haven't enjoyed an evening so much since I've been in the States.\nReal talk. Not all this social rot. I'd never have let them give me the\nbeastly title--and I didn't get it for nothing, eh?--if I'd thought I'd\nhave to talk to women about primitives and polo! Goodish thing to have\nin Nottingham, though; annoyed the mayor most frightfully when I got it;\nand of course the missus likes it. But nobody calls me 'Jerry' now--\"\nHe was almost weeping. \"--and nobody in the States has treated me like a\nfriend till to-night! Good-by, old chap, good-by! Thanks awfully!\"\n\n\"Don't mention it, Jerry. And remember whenever you get to Zenith, the\nlatch-string is always out.\"\n\n\"And don't forget, old boy, if you ever come to Nottingham, Mother and\nI will be frightfully glad to see you. I shall tell the fellows in\nNottingham your ideas about Visions and Real Guys--at our next Rotary\nClub luncheon.\"\n\n\nIV\n\nBabbitt lay abed at his hotel, imagining the Zenith Athletic Club asking\nhim, \"What kind of a time d'you have in Chicago?\" and his answering,\n\"Oh, fair; ran around with Sir Gerald Doak a lot;\" picturing himself\nmeeting Lucile McKelvey and admonishing her, \"You're all right, Mrs.\nMac, when you aren't trying to pull this highbrow pose. It's just as\nGerald Doak says to me in Chicago--oh, yes, Jerry's an old friend of\nmine--the wife and I are thinking of running over to England to stay\nwith Jerry in his castle, next year--and he said to me, 'Georgie, old\nbean, I like Lucile first-rate, but you and me, George, we got to make\nher get over this highty-tighty hooptediddle way she's got.\"\n\nBut that evening a thing happened which wrecked his pride.\n\n\nV\n\nAt the Regency Hotel cigar-counter he fell to talking with a salesman\nof pianos, and they dined together. Babbitt was filled with friendliness\nand well-being. He enjoyed the gorgeousness of the dining-room: the\nchandeliers, the looped brocade curtains, the portraits of French kings\nagainst panels of gilded oak. He enjoyed the crowd: pretty women, good\nsolid fellows who were \"liberal spenders.\"\n\nHe gasped. He stared, and turned away, and stared again. Three tables\noff, with a doubtful sort of woman, a woman at once coy and withered,\nwas Paul Riesling, and Paul was supposed to be in Akron, selling\ntar-roofing. The woman was tapping his hand, mooning at him and\ngiggling. Babbitt felt that he had encountered something involved\nand harmful. Paul was talking with the rapt eagerness of a man who is\ntelling his troubles. He was concentrated on the woman's faded eyes.\nOnce he held her hand and once, blind to the other guests, he puckered\nhis lips as though he was pretending to kiss her. Babbitt had so strong\nan impulse to go to Paul that he could feel his body uncoiling, his\nshoulders moving, but he felt, desperately, that he must be diplomatic,\nand not till he saw Paul paying the check did he bluster to the\npiano-salesman, \"By golly--friend of mine over there--'scuse me\nsecond--just say hello to him.\"\n\nHe touched Paul's shoulder, and cried, \"Well, when did you hit town?\"\n\nPaul glared up at him, face hardening. \"Oh, hello, George. Thought you'd\ngone back to Zenith.\" He did not introduce his companion. Babbitt peeped\nat her. She was a flabbily pretty, weakly flirtatious woman of forty-two\nor three, in an atrocious flowery hat. Her rouging was thorough but\nunskilful.\n\n\"Where you staying, Paulibus?\"\n\nThe woman turned, yawned, examined her nails. She seemed accustomed to\nnot being introduced.\n\nPaul grumbled, \"Campbell Inn, on the South Side.\"\n\n\"Alone?\" It sounded insinuating.\n\n\"Yes! Unfortunately!\" Furiously Paul turned toward the woman, smiling\nwith a fondness sickening to Babbitt. \"May! Want to introduce you. Mrs.\nArnold, this is my old-acquaintance, George Babbitt.\"\n\n\"Pleasmeech,\" growled Babbitt, while she gurgled, \"Oh, I'm very pleased\nto meet any friend of Mr. Riesling's, I'm sure.\"\n\nBabbitt demanded, \"Be back there later this evening, Paul? I'll drop\ndown and see you.\"\n\n\"No, better--We better lunch together to-morrow.\"\n\n\"All right, but I'll see you to-night, too, Paul. I'll go down to your\nhotel, and I'll wait for you!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nI\n\nHE sat smoking with the piano-salesman, clinging to the warm refuge of\ngossip, afraid to venture into thoughts of Paul. He was the more affable\non the surface as secretly he became more apprehensive, felt more\nhollow. He was certain that Paul was in Chicago without Zilla's\nknowledge, and that he was doing things not at all moral and secure.\nWhen the salesman yawned that he had to write up his orders, Babbitt\nleft him, left the hotel, in leisurely calm. But savagely he said\n\"Campbell Inn!\" to the taxi-driver. He sat agitated on the slippery\nleather seat, in that chill dimness which smelled of dust and perfume\nand Turkish cigarettes. He did not heed the snowy lake-front, the dark\nspaces and sudden bright corners in the unknown land south of the Loop.\n\nThe office of the Campbell Inn was hard, bright, new; the night clerk\nharder and brighter. \"Yep?\" he said to Babbitt.\n\n\"Mr. Paul Riesling registered here?\"\n\n\"Yep.\"\n\n\"Is he in now?\"\n\n\"Nope.\"\n\n\"Then if you'll give me his key, I'll wait for him.\"\n\n\"Can't do that, brother. Wait down here if you wanna.\"\n\nBabbitt had spoken with the deference which all the Clan of Good Fellows\ngive to hotel clerks. Now he said with snarling abruptness:\n\n\"I may have to wait some time. I'm Riesling's brother-in-law. I'll go up\nto his room. D' I look like a sneak-thief?\"\n\nHis voice was low and not pleasant. With considerable haste the\nclerk took down the key, protesting, \"I never said you looked like a\nsneak-thief. Just rules of the hotel. But if you want to--\"\n\nOn his way up in the elevator Babbitt wondered why he was here. Why\nshouldn't Paul be dining with a respectable married woman? Why had he\nlied to the clerk about being Paul's brother-in-law? He had acted like a\nchild. He must be careful not to say foolish dramatic things to Paul.\nAs he settled down he tried to look pompous and placid. Then the\nthought--Suicide. He'd been dreading that, without knowing it. Paul\nwould be just the person to do something like that. He must be out of\nhis head or he wouldn't be confiding in that--that dried-up hag.\n\nZilla (oh, damn Zilla! how gladly he'd throttle that nagging fiend of a\nwoman!)--she'd probably succeeded at last, and driven Paul crazy.\n\nSuicide. Out there in the lake, way out, beyond the piled ice along the\nshore. It would be ghastly cold to drop into the water to-night.\n\nOr--throat cut--in the bathroom--\n\nBabbitt flung into Paul's bathroom. It was empty. He smiled, feebly.\n\nHe pulled at his choking collar, looked at his watch, opened the window\nto stare down at the street, looked at his watch, tried to read the\nevening paper lying on the glass-topped bureau, looked again at his\nwatch. Three minutes had gone by since he had first looked at it.\n\nAnd he waited for three hours.\n\nHe was sitting fixed, chilled, when the doorknob turned. Paul came in\nglowering.\n\n\"Hello,\" Paul said. \"Been waiting?\"\n\n\"Yuh, little while.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Well what? Just thought I'd drop in to see how you made out in Akron.\"\n\n\"I did all right. What difference does it make?\"\n\n\"Why, gosh, Paul, what are you sore about?\"\n\n\"What are you butting into my affairs for?\"\n\n\"Why, Paul, that's no way to talk! I'm not butting into nothing. I was\nso glad to see your ugly old phiz that I just dropped in to say howdy.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm not going to have anybody following me around and trying to\nboss me. I've had all of that I'm going to stand!\"\n\n\"Well, gosh, I'm not--\"\n\n\"I didn't like the way you looked at May Arnold, or the snooty way you\ntalked.\"\n\n\"Well, all right then! If you think I'm a buttinsky, then I'll just butt\nin! I don't know who your May Arnold is, but I know doggone good and\nwell that you and her weren't talking about tar-roofing, no, nor about\nplaying the violin, neither! If you haven't got any moral consideration\nfor yourself, you ought to have some for your position in the community.\nThe idea of your going around places gawping into a female's eyes like\na love-sick pup! I can understand a fellow slipping once, but I don't\npropose to see a fellow that's been as chummy with me as you have\ngetting started on the downward path and sneaking off from his wife,\neven as cranky a one as Zilla, to go woman-chasing--\"\n\n\"Oh, you're a perfectly moral little husband!\"\n\n\"I am, by God! I've never looked at any woman except Myra since I've\nbeen married--practically--and I never will! I tell you there's nothing\nto immorality. It don't pay. Can't you see, old man, it just makes Zilla\nstill crankier?\"\n\nSlight of resolution as he was of body, Paul threw his snow-beaded\novercoat on the floor and crouched on a flimsy cane chair. \"Oh, you're\nan old blowhard, and you know less about morality than Tinka, but you're\nall right, Georgie. But you can't understand that--I'm through. I can't\ngo Zilla's hammering any longer. She's made up her mind that I'm a\ndevil, and--Reg'lar Inquisition. Torture. She enjoys it. It's a game to\nsee how sore she can make me. And me, either it's find a little comfort,\nany comfort, anywhere, or else do something a lot worse. Now this Mrs.\nArnold, she's not so young, but she's a fine woman and she understands a\nfellow, and she's had her own troubles.\"\n\n\"Yea! I suppose she's one of these hens whose husband 'doesn't\nunderstand her'!\"\n\n\"I don't know. Maybe. He was killed in the war.\"\n\nBabbitt lumbered up, stood beside Paul patting his shoulder, making soft\napologetic noises.\n\n\"Honest, George, she's a fine woman, and she's had one hell of a time.\nWe manage to jolly each other up a lot. We tell each other we're the\ndandiest pair on earth. Maybe we don't believe it, but it helps a lot\nto have somebody with whom you can be perfectly simple, and not all this\ndiscussing--explaining--\"\n\n\"And that's as far as you go?\"\n\n\"It is not! Go on! Say it!\"\n\n\"Well, I don't--I can't say I like it, but--\" With a burst which left\nhim feeling large and shining with generosity, \"it's none of my darn\nbusiness! I'll do anything I can for you, if there's anything I can do.\"\n\n\"There might be. I judge from Zilla's letters that've been forwarded\nfrom Akron that she's getting suspicious about my staying away so long.\nShe'd be perfectly capable of having me shadowed, and of coming to\nChicago and busting into a hotel dining-room and bawling me out before\neverybody.\"\n\n\"I'll take care of Zilla. I'll hand her a good fairy-story when I get\nback to Zenith.\"\n\n\"I don't know--I don't think you better try it. You're a good fellow,\nbut I don't know that diplomacy is your strong point.\" Babbitt looked\nhurt, then irritated. \"I mean with women! With women, I mean. Course\nthey got to go some to beat you in business diplomacy, but I just\nmean with women. Zilla may do a lot of rough talking, but she's pretty\nshrewd. She'd have the story out of you in no time.\"\n\n\"Well, all right, but--\" Babbitt was still pathetic at not being allowed\nto play Secret Agent. Paul soothed:\n\n\"Course maybe you might tell her you'd been in Akron and seen me there.\"\n\n\"Why, sure, you bet! Don't I have to go look at that candy-store\nproperty in Akron? Don't I? Ain't it a shame I have to stop off there\nwhen I'm so anxious to get home? Ain't it a regular shame? I'll say it\nis! I'll say it's a doggone shame!\"\n\n\"Fine. But for glory hallelujah's sake don't go putting any fancy\nfixings on the story. When men lie they always try to make it too\nartistic, and that's why women get suspicious. And--Let's have a drink,\nGeorgie. I've got some gin and a little vermouth.\"\n\nThe Paul who normally refused a second cocktail took a second now, and\na third. He became red-eyed and thick-tongued. He was embarrassingly\njocular and salacious.\n\nIn the taxicab Babbitt incredulously found tears crowding into his eyes.\n\n\nII\n\nHe had not told Paul of his plan but he did stop at Akron, between\ntrains, for the one purpose of sending to Zilla a postcard with \"Had to\ncome here for the day, ran into Paul.\" In Zenith he called on her.\nIf for public appearances Zilla was over-coiffed, over-painted,\nand resolutely corseted, for private misery she wore a filthy blue\ndressing-gown and torn stockings thrust into streaky pink satin mules.\nHer face was sunken. She seemed to have but half as much hair as Babbitt\nremembered, and that half was stringy. She sat in a rocker amid a debris\nof candy-boxes and cheap magazines, and she sounded dolorous when she\ndid not sound derisive. But Babbitt was exceedingly breezy:\n\n\"Well, well, Zil, old dear, having a good loaf while hubby's away?\nThat's the ideal I'll bet a hat Myra never got up till ten, while I was\nin Chicago. Say, could I borrow your thermos--just dropped in to see\nif I could borrow your thermos bottle. We're going to have a toboggan\nparty--want to take some coffee mit. Oh, did you get my card from Akron,\nsaying I'd run into Paul?\"\n\n\"Yes. What was he doing?\"\n\n\"How do you mean?\" He unbuttoned his overcoat, sat tentatively on the\narm of a chair.\n\n\"You know how I mean!\" She slapped the pages of a magazine with an\nirritable clatter. \"I suppose he was trying to make love to some hotel\nwaitress or manicure girl or somebody.\"\n\n\"Hang it, you're always letting on that Paul goes round chasing skirts.\nHe doesn't, in the first place, and if he did, it would prob'ly be\nbecause you keep hinting at him and dinging at him so much. I hadn't\nmeant to, Zilla, but since Paul is away, in Akron--\"\n\n\"He really is in Akron? I know he has some horrible woman that he writes\nto in Chicago.\"\n\n\"Didn't I tell you I saw him in Akron? What're you trying to do? Make\nme out a liar?\"\n\n\"No, but I just--I get so worried.\"\n\n\"Now, there you are! That's what gets me! Here you love Paul, and yet\nyou plague him and cuss him out as if you hated him. I simply can't\nunderstand why it is that the more some folks love people, the harder\nthey try to make 'em miserable.\"\n\n\"You love Ted and Rone--I suppose--and yet you nag them.\"\n\n\"Oh. Well. That. That's different. Besides, I don't nag 'em. Not what\nyou'd call nagging. But zize saying: Now, here's Paul, the nicest,\nmost sensitive critter on God's green earth. You ought to be ashamed of\nyourself the way you pan him. Why, you talk to him like a washerwoman.\nI'm surprised you can act so doggone common, Zilla!\"\n\nShe brooded over her linked fingers. \"Oh, I know. I do go and get\nmean sometimes, and I'm sorry afterwards. But, oh, Georgie, Paul is so\naggravating! Honestly, I've tried awfully hard, these last few years, to\nbe nice to him, but just because I used to be spiteful--or I seemed so;\nI wasn't, really, but I used to speak up and say anything that came\ninto my head--and so he made up his mind that everything was my fault.\nEverything can't always be my fault, can it? And now if I get to\nfussing, he just turns silent, oh, so dreadfully silent, and he\nwon't look at me--he just ignores me. He simply isn't human! And he\ndeliberately keeps it up till I bust out and say a lot of things I don't\nmean. So silent--Oh, you righteous men! How wicked you are! How rotten\nwicked!\"\n\nThey thrashed things over and over for half an hour. At the end, weeping\ndrably, Zilla promised to restrain herself.\n\nPaul returned four days later, and the Babbitts and Rieslings went\nfestively to the movies and had chop suey at a Chinese restaurant.\nAs they walked to the restaurant through a street of tailor shops and\nbarber shops, the two wives in front, chattering about cooks, Babbitt\nmurmured to Paul, \"Zil seems a lot nicer now.\"\n\n\"Yes, she has been, except once or twice. But it's too late now. I\njust--I'm not going to discuss it, but I'm afraid of her. There's\nnothing left. I don't ever want to see her. Some day I'm going to break\naway from her. Somehow.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE International Organization of Boosters' Clubs has become a\nworld-force for optimism, manly pleasantry, and good business. Chapters\nare to be found now in thirty countries. Nine hundred and twenty of the\nthousand chapters, however, are in the United States.\n\nNone of these is more ardent than the Zenith Boosters' Club.\n\nThe second March lunch of the Zenith Boosters was the most important of\nthe year, as it was to be followed by the annual election of officers.\nThere was agitation abroad. The lunch was held in the ballroom of the\nO'Hearn House. As each of the four hundred Boosters entered he took from\na wall-board a huge celluloid button announcing his name, his nick name,\nand his business. There was a fine of ten cents for calling a Fellow\nBooster by anything but his nickname at a lunch, and as Babbitt jovially\nchecked his hat the air was radiant with shouts of \"Hello, Chet!\" and\n\"How're you, Shorty!\" and \"Top o' the mornin', Mac!\"\n\nThey sat at friendly tables for eight, choosing places by lot. Babbitt\nwas with Albert Boos the merchant tailor, Hector Seybolt of the Little\nSweetheart Condensed Milk Company, Emil Wengert the jeweler, Professor\nPumphrey of the Riteway Business College, Dr. Walter Gorbutt, Roy\nTeegarten the photographer, and Ben Berkey the photo-engraver. One of\nthe merits of the Boosters' Club was that only two persons from each\ndepartment of business were permitted to join, so that you at\nonce encountered the Ideals of other occupations, and realized the\nmetaphysical oneness of all occupations--plumbing and portrait-painting,\nmedicine and the manufacture of chewing-gum.\n\nBabbitt's table was particularly happy to-day, because Professor\nPumphrey had just had a birthday, and was therefore open to teasing.\n\n\"Let's pump Pump about how old he is!\" said Emil Wengert.\n\n\"No, let's paddle him with a dancing-pump!\" said Ben Berkey.\n\nBut it was Babbitt who had the applause, with \"Don't talk about pumps to\nthat guy! The only pump he knows is a bottle! Honest, they tell me he's\nstarting a class in home-brewing at the ole college!\"\n\nAt each place was the Boosters' Club booklet, listing the members.\nThough the object of the club was good-fellowship, yet they never lost\nsight of the importance of doing a little more business. After each name\nwas the member's occupation. There were scores of advertisements in the\nbooklet, and on one page the admonition: \"There's no rule that you have\nto trade with your Fellow Boosters, but get wise, boy--what's the use\nof letting all this good money get outside of our happy fambly?\" And at\neach place, to-day, there was a present; a card printed in artistic red\nand black:\n\n\nSERVICE AND BOOSTERISM\n\nService finds its finest opportunity and development only in its\nbroadest and deepest application and the consideration of its perpetual\naction upon reaction. I believe the highest type of Service, like the\nmost progressive tenets of ethics, senses unceasingly and is motived by\nactive adherence and loyalty to that which is the essential principle of\nBoosterism--Good Citizenship in all its factors and aspects.\n\nDAD PETERSEN.\n\nCompliments of Dadbury Petersen Advertising Corp.\n\n\"Ads, not Fads, at Dad's\"\n\n\nThe Boosters all read Mr. Peterson's aphorism and said they understood\nit perfectly.\n\nThe meeting opened with the regular weekly \"stunts.\" Retiring President\nVergil Gunch was in the chair, his stiff hair like a hedge, his\nvoice like a brazen gong of festival. Members who had brought guests\nintroduced them publicly. \"This tall red-headed piece of misinformation\nis the sporting editor of the Press,\" said Willis Ijams; and H. H.\nHazen, the druggist, chanted, \"Boys, when you're on a long motor tour\nand finally get to a romantic spot or scene and draw up and remark to\nthe wife, 'This is certainly a romantic place,' it sends a glow right\nup and down your vertebrae. Well, my guest to-day is from such a place,\nHarper's Ferry, Virginia, in the beautiful Southland, with memories of\ngood old General Robert E. Lee and of that brave soul, John Brown who,\nlike every good Booster, goes marching on--\"\n\nThere were two especially distinguished guests: the leading man of the\n\"Bird of Paradise\" company, playing this week at the Dodsworth Theater,\nand the mayor of Zenith, the Hon. Lucas Prout.\n\nVergil Gunch thundered, \"When we manage to grab this celebrated Thespian\noff his lovely aggregation of beautiful actresses--and I got to admit\nI butted right into his dressing-room and told him how the Boosters\nappreciated the high-class artistic performance he's giving us--and\ndon't forget that the treasurer of the Dodsworth is a Booster and will\nappreciate our patronage--and when on top of that we yank Hizzonor\nout of his multifarious duties at City Hall, then I feel we've done\nourselves proud, and Mr. Prout will now say a few words about the\nproblems and duties--\"\n\nBy rising vote the Boosters decided which was the handsomest and which\nthe ugliest guest, and to each of them was given a bunch of carnations,\ndonated, President Gunch noted, by Brother Booster H. G. Yeager, the\nJennifer Avenue florist.\n\nEach week, in rotation, four Boosters were privileged to obtain the\npleasures of generosity and of publicity by donating goods or services\nto four fellow-members, chosen by lot. There was laughter, this week,\nwhen it was announced that one of the contributors was Barnabas Joy, the\nundertaker. Everybody whispered, \"I can think of a coupla good guys to\nbe buried if his donation is a free funeral!\"\n\nThrough all these diversions the Boosters were lunching on chicken\ncroquettes, peas, fried potatoes, coffee, apple pie, and American\ncheese. Gunch did not lump the speeches. Presently he called on the\nvisiting secretary of the Zenith Rotary Club, a rival organization.\nThe secretary had the distinction of possessing State Motor Car License\nNumber 5.\n\nThe Rotary secretary laughingly admitted that wherever he drove in the\nstate so low a number created a sensation, and \"though it was pretty\nnice to have the honor, yet traffic cops remembered it only too darn\nwell, and sometimes he didn't know but what he'd almost as soon have\njust plain B56,876 or something like that. Only let any doggone Booster\ntry to get Number 5 away from a live Rotarian next year, and watch the\nfur fly! And if they'd permit him, he'd wind up by calling for a cheer\nfor the Boosters and Rotarians and the Kiwanis all together!\"\n\nBabbitt sighed to Professor Pumphrey, \"Be pretty nice to have as low a\nnumber as that! Everybody 'd say, 'He must be an important guy!' Wonder\nhow he got it? I'll bet he wined and dined the superintendent of the\nMotor License Bureau to a fare-you-well!\"\n\nThen Chum Frink addressed them:\n\n\"Some of you may feel that it's out of place here to talk on a strictly\nhighbrow and artistic subject, but I want to come out flatfooted and\nask you boys to O.K. the proposition of a Symphony Orchestra for Zenith.\nNow, where a lot of you make your mistake is in assuming that if you\ndon't like classical music and all that junk, you ought to oppose it.\nNow, I want to confess that, though I'm a literary guy by profession, I\ndon't care a rap for all this long-haired music. I'd rather listen to a\ngood jazz band any time than to some piece by Beethoven that hasn't any\nmore tune to it than a bunch of fighting cats, and you couldn't whistle\nit to save your life! But that isn't the point. Culture has become as\nnecessary an adornment and advertisement for a city to-day as pavements\nor bank-clearances. It's Culture, in theaters and art-galleries and so\non, that brings thousands of visitors to New York every year and, to be\nfrank, for all our splendid attainments we haven't yet got the Culture\nof a New York or Chicago or Boston--or at least we don't get the credit\nfor it. The thing to do then, as a live bunch of go-getters, is to\nCAPITALIZE CULTURE; to go right out and grab it.\n\n\"Pictures and books are fine for those that have the time to study 'em,\nbut they don't shoot out on the road and holler 'This is what little\nold Zenith can put up in the way of Culture.' That's precisely what\na Symphony Orchestra does do. Look at the credit Minneapolis and\nCincinnati get. An orchestra with first-class musickers and a swell\nconductor--and I believe we ought to do the thing up brown and get\none of the highest-paid conductors on the market, providing he ain't a\nHun--it goes right into Beantown and New York and Washington; it plays\nat the best theaters to the most cultured and moneyed people; it gives\nsuch class-advertising as a town can get in no other way; and the guy\nwho is so short-sighted as to crab this orchestra proposition is passing\nup the chance to impress the glorious name of Zenith on some big New\nYork millionaire that might-that might establish a branch factory here!\n\n\"I could also go into the fact that for our daughters who show an\ninterest in highbrow music and may want to teach it, having an A1 local\norganization is of great benefit, but let's keep this on a practical\nbasis, and I call on you good brothers to whoop it up for Culture and a\nWorld-beating Symphony Orchestra!\"\n\nThey applauded.\n\nTo a rustle of excitement President Gunch proclaimed, \"Gentlemen, we\nwill now proceed to the annual election of officers.\" For each of the\nsix offices, three candidates had been chosen by a committee. The second\nname among the candidates for vice-president was Babbitt's.\n\nHe was surprised. He looked self-conscious. His heart pounded. He was\nstill more agitated when the ballots were counted and Gunch said, \"It's\na pleasure to announce that Georgie Babbitt will be the next assistant\ngavel-wielder. I know of no man who stands more stanchly for common\nsense and enterprise than good old George. Come on, let's give him our\nbest long yell!\"\n\nAs they adjourned, a hundred men crushed in to slap his back. He had\nnever known a higher moment. He drove away in a blur of wonder. He\nlunged into his office, chuckling to Miss McGoun, \"Well, I guess you\nbetter congratulate your boss! Been elected vice-president of the\nBoosters!\"\n\nHe was disappointed. She answered only, \"Yes--Oh, Mrs. Babbitt's been\ntrying to get you on the 'phone.\" But the new salesman, Fritz Weilinger,\nsaid, \"By golly, chief, say, that's great, that's perfectly great! I'm\ntickled to death! Congratulations!\"\n\nBabbitt called the house, and crowed to his wife, \"Heard you were trying\nto get me, Myra. Say, you got to hand it to little Georgie, this time!\nBetter talk careful! You are now addressing the vice-president of the\nBoosters' Club!\"\n\n\"Oh, Georgie--\"\n\n\"Pretty nice, huh? Willis Ijams is the new president, but when\nhe's away, little ole Georgie takes the gavel and whoops 'em up\nand introduces the speakers--no matter if they're the governor\nhimself--and--\"\n\n\"George! Listen!\"\n\n\"--It puts him in solid with big men like Doc Dilling and--\"\n\n\"George! Paul Riesling--\"\n\n\"Yes, sure, I'll 'phone Paul and let him know about it right away.\"\n\n\"Georgie! LISTEN! Paul's in jail. He shot his wife, he shot Zilla, this\nnoon. She may not live.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nI\n\nHE drove to the City Prison, not blindly, but with unusual fussy care at\ncorners, the fussiness of an old woman potting plants. It kept him from\nfacing the obscenity of fate.\n\nThe attendant said, \"Naw, you can't see any of the prisoners till\nthree-thirty--visiting-hour.\"\n\nIt was three. For half an hour Babbitt sat looking at a calendar and\na clock on a whitewashed wall. The chair was hard and mean and creaky.\nPeople went through the office and, he thought, stared at him. He felt\na belligerent defiance which broke into a wincing fear of this machine\nwhich was grinding Paul--Paul----\n\nExactly at half-past three he sent in his name.\n\nThe attendant returned with \"Riesling says he don't want to see you.\"\n\n\"You're crazy! You didn't give him my name! Tell him it's George wants\nto see him, George Babbitt.\"\n\n\"Yuh, I told him, all right, all right! He said he didn't want to see\nyou.\"\n\n\"Then take me in anyway.\"\n\n\"Nothing doing. If you ain't his lawyer, if he don't want to see you,\nthat's all there is to it.\"\n\n\"But, my GOD--Say, let me see the warden.\"\n\n\"He's busy. Come on, now, you--\" Babbitt reared over him. The attendant\nhastily changed to a coaxing \"You can come back and try to-morrow.\nProbably the poor guy is off his nut.\"\n\nBabbitt drove, not at all carefully or fussily, sliding viciously past\ntrucks, ignoring the truckmen's curses, to the City Hall; he stopped\nwith a grind of wheels against the curb, and ran up the marble steps to\nthe office of the Hon. Mr. Lucas Prout, the mayor. He bribed the mayor's\ndoorman with a dollar; he was instantly inside, demanding, \"You remember\nme, Mr. Prout? Babbitt--vice-president of the Boosters--campaigned for\nyou? Say, have you heard about poor Riesling? Well, I want an order on\nthe warden or whatever you call um of the City Prison to take me back\nand see him. Good.\n\n### Summary:"}

Hell Row was a block of thatched,\nbulging cottages that stood by the brookside on Greenhill Lane. There\nlived the colliers who worked in the little gin-pits two fields away.\nThe brook ran under the alder trees, scarcely soiled by these small\nmines, whose coal was drawn to the surface by donkeys that plodded\nwearily in a circle round a gin. And all over the countryside were these\nsame pits, some of which had been worked in the time of Charles II, the\nfew colliers and the donkeys burrowing down like ants into the earth,\nmaking queer mounds and little black places among the corn-fields and\nthe meadows. And the cottages of these coal-miners, in blocks and pairs\nhere and there, together with odd farms and homes of the stockingers,\nstraying over the parish, formed the village of Bestwood.\n\nThen, some sixty years ago, a sudden change took place, gin-pits were\nelbowed aside by the large mines of the financiers. The coal and iron\nfield of Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire was discovered. Carston, Waite\nand Co. appeared. Amid tremendous excitement, Lord Palmerston formally\nopened the company's first mine at Spinney Park, on the edge of Sherwood\nForest.\n\nAbout this time the notorious Hell Row, which through growing old had\nacquired an evil reputation, was burned down, and much dirt was cleansed\naway.\n\nCarston, Waite & Co. found they had struck on a good thing, so, down the\nvalleys of the brooks from Selby and Nuttall, new mines were sunk, until\nsoon there were six pits working. From Nuttall, high up on the sandstone\namong the woods, the railway ran, past the ruined priory of the\nCarthusians and past Robin Hood's Well, down to Spinney Park, then on to\nMinton, a large mine among corn-fields; from Minton across the farmlands\nof the valleyside to Bunker's Hill, branching off there, and running\nnorth to Beggarlee and Selby, that looks over at Crich and the hills of\nDerbyshire: six mines like black studs on the countryside, linked by a\nloop of fine chain, the railway.\n\nTo accommodate the regiments of miners, Carston, Waite and Co. built the\nSquares, great quadrangles of dwellings on the hillside of Bestwood,\nand then, in the brook valley, on the site of Hell Row, they erected the\nBottoms.\n\nThe Bottoms consisted of six blocks of miners' dwellings, two rows\nof three, like the dots on a blank-six domino, and twelve houses in a\nblock. This double row of dwellings sat at the foot of the rather sharp\nslope from Bestwood, and looked out, from the attic windows at least, on\nthe slow climb of the valley towards Selby.\n\nThe houses themselves were substantial and very decent. One could walk\nall round, seeing little front gardens with auriculas and saxifrage in\nthe shadow of the bottom block, sweet-williams and pinks in the sunny\ntop block; seeing neat front windows, little porches, little privet\nhedges, and dormer windows for the attics. But that was outside; that\nwas the view on to the uninhabited parlours of all the colliers' wives.\nThe dwelling-room, the kitchen, was at the back of the house, facing\ninward between the blocks, looking at a scrubby back garden, and then at\nthe ash-pits. And between the rows, between the long lines of ash-pits,\nwent the alley, where the children played and the women gossiped and the\nmen smoked. So, the actual conditions of living in the Bottoms, that\nwas so well built and that looked so nice, were quite unsavoury because\npeople must live in the kitchen, and the kitchens opened on to that\nnasty alley of ash-pits.\n\nMrs. Morel was not anxious to move into the Bottoms, which was already\ntwelve years old and on the downward path, when she descended to it from\nBestwood. But it was the best she could do. Moreover, she had an end\nhouse in one of the top blocks, and thus had only one neighbour; on\nthe other side an extra strip of garden. And, having an end house, she\nenjoyed a kind of aristocracy among the other women of the \"between\"\nhouses, because her rent was five shillings and sixpence instead of\nfive shillings a week. But this superiority in station was not much\nconsolation to Mrs. Morel.\n\nShe was thirty-one years old, and had been married eight years. A rather\nsmall woman, of delicate mould but resolute bearing, she shrank a little\nfrom the first contact with the Bottoms women. She came down in the\nJuly, and in the September expected her third baby.\n\nHer husband was a miner. They had only been in their new home three\nweeks when the wakes, or fair, began. Morel, she knew, was sure to make\na holiday of it. He went off early on the Monday morning, the day of\nthe fair. The two children were highly excited. William, a boy of seven,\nfled off immediately after breakfast, to prowl round the wakes ground,\nleaving Annie, who was only five, to whine all morning to go also. Mrs.\nMorel did her work. She scarcely knew her neighbours yet, and knew no\none with whom to trust the little girl. So she promised to take her to\nthe wakes after dinner.\n\nWilliam appeared at half-past twelve. He was a very active lad,\nfair-haired, freckled, with a touch of the Dane or Norwegian about him.\n\n\"Can I have my dinner, mother?\" he cried, rushing in with his cap on.\n\"'Cause it begins at half-past one, the man says so.\"\n\n\"You can have your dinner as soon as it's done,\" replied the mother.\n\n\"Isn't it done?\" he cried, his blue eyes staring at her in indignation.\n\"Then I'm goin' be-out it.\"\n\n\"You'll do nothing of the sort. It will be done in five minutes. It is\nonly half-past twelve.\"\n\n\"They'll be beginnin',\" the boy half cried, half shouted.\n\n\"You won't die if they do,\" said the mother. \"Besides, it's only\nhalf-past twelve, so you've a full hour.\"\n\nThe lad began hastily to lay the table, and directly the three sat down.\nThey were eating batter-pudding and jam, when the boy jumped off his\nchair and stood perfectly stiff. Some distance away could be heard the\nfirst small braying of a merry-go-round, and the tooting of a horn. His\nface quivered as he looked at his mother.\n\n\"I told you!\" he said, running to the dresser for his cap.\n\n\"Take your pudding in your hand--and it's only five past one, so you\nwere wrong--you haven't got your twopence,\" cried the mother in a\nbreath.\n\nThe boy came back, bitterly disappointed, for his twopence, then went\noff without a word.\n\n\"I want to go, I want to go,\" said Annie, beginning to cry.\n\n\"Well, and you shall go, whining, wizzening little stick!\" said the\nmother. And later in the afternoon she trudged up the hill under the\ntall hedge with her child. The hay was gathered from the fields, and\ncattle were turned on to the eddish. It was warm, peaceful.\n\nMrs. Morel did not like the wakes. There were two sets of horses, one\ngoing by steam, one pulled round by a pony; three organs were grinding,\nand there came odd cracks of pistol-shots, fearful screeching of the\ncocoanut man's rattle, shouts of the Aunt Sally man, screeches from the\npeep-show lady. The mother perceived her son gazing enraptured outside\nthe Lion Wallace booth, at the pictures of this famous lion that had\nkilled a negro and maimed for life two white men. She left him alone,\nand went to get Annie a spin of toffee. Presently the lad stood in front\nof her, wildly excited.\n\n\"You never said you was coming--isn't the' a lot of things?--that lion's\nkilled three men--I've spent my tuppence--an' look here.\"\n\nHe pulled from his pocket two egg-cups, with pink moss-roses on them.\n\n\"I got these from that stall where y'ave ter get them marbles in\nthem holes. An' I got these two in two goes-'aepenny a go-they've got\nmoss-roses on, look here. I wanted these.\"\n\nShe knew he wanted them for her.\n\n\"H'm!\" she said, pleased. \"They ARE pretty!\"\n\n\"Shall you carry 'em, 'cause I'm frightened o' breakin' 'em?\"\n\nHe was tipful of excitement now she had come, led her about the ground,\nshowed her everything. Then, at the peep-show, she explained the\npictures, in a sort of story, to which he listened as if spellbound. He\nwould not leave her. All the time he stuck close to her, bristling with\na small boy's pride of her. For no other woman looked such a lady as she\ndid, in her little black bonnet and her cloak. She smiled when she saw\nwomen she knew. When she was tired she said to her son:\n\n\"Well, are you coming now, or later?\"\n\n\"Are you goin' a'ready?\" he cried, his face full of reproach.\n\n\"Already? It is past four, I know.\"\n\n\"What are you goin' a'ready for?\" he lamented.\n\n\"You needn't come if you don't want,\" she said.\n\nAnd she went slowly away with her little girl, whilst her son stood\nwatching her, cut to the heart to let her go, and yet unable to leave\nthe wakes. As she crossed the open ground in front of the Moon and Stars\nshe heard men shouting, and smelled the beer, and hurried a little,\nthinking her husband was probably in the bar.\n\nAt about half-past six her son came home, tired now, rather pale, and\nsomewhat wretched. He was miserable, though he did not know it, because\nhe had let her go alone. Since she had gone, he had not enjoyed his\nwakes.\n\n\"Has my dad been?\" he asked.\n\n\"No,\" said the mother.\n\n\"He's helping to wait at the Moon and Stars. I seed him through that\nblack tin stuff wi' holes in, on the window, wi' his sleeves rolled up.\"\n\n\"Ha!\" exclaimed the mother shortly. \"He's got no money. An' he'll be\nsatisfied if he gets his 'lowance, whether they give him more or not.\"\n\nWhen the light was fading, and Mrs. Morel could see no more to sew, she\nrose and went to the door. Everywhere was the sound of excitement, the\nrestlessness of the holiday, that at last infected her. She went\nout into the side garden. Women were coming home from the wakes, the\nchildren hugging a white lamb with green legs, or a wooden horse.\nOccasionally a man lurched past, almost as full as he could carry.\nSometimes a good husband came along with his family, peacefully. But\nusually the women and children were alone. The stay-at-home mothers\nstood gossiping at the corners of the alley, as the twilight sank,\nfolding their arms under their white aprons.\n\nMrs. Morel was alone, but she was used to it. Her son and her little\ngirl slept upstairs; so, it seemed, her home was there behind her,\nfixed and stable. But she felt wretched with the coming child. The world\nseemed a dreary place, where nothing else would happen for her--at\nleast until William grew up. But for herself, nothing but this dreary\nendurance--till the children grew up. And the children! She could not\nafford to have this third. She did not want it. The father was serving\nbeer in a public house, swilling himself drunk. She despised him, and\nwas tied to him. This coming child was too much for her. If it were not\nfor William and Annie, she was sick of it, the struggle with poverty and\nugliness and meanness.\n\nShe went into the front garden, feeling too heavy to take herself out,\nyet unable to stay indoors. The heat suffocated her. And looking ahead,\nthe prospect of her life made her feel as if she were buried alive.\n\nThe front garden was a small square with a privet hedge. There she\nstood, trying to soothe herself with the scent of flowers and the\nfading, beautiful evening. Opposite her small gate was the stile that\nled uphill, under the tall hedge between the burning glow of the cut\npastures. The sky overhead throbbed and pulsed with light. The glow sank\nquickly off the field; the earth and the hedges smoked dusk. As it grew\ndark, a ruddy glare came out on the hilltop, and out of the glare the\ndiminished commotion of the fair.\n\nSometimes, down the trough of darkness formed by the path under the\nhedges, men came lurching home. One young man lapsed into a run down\nthe steep bit that ended the hill, and went with a crash into the stile.\nMrs. Morel shuddered. He picked himself up, swearing viciously, rather\npathetically, as if he thought the stile had wanted to hurt him.\n\nShe went indoors, wondering if things were never going to alter. She was\nbeginning by now to realise that they would not. She seemed so far\naway from her girlhood, she wondered if it were the same person walking\nheavily up the back garden at the Bottoms as had run so lightly up the\nbreakwater at Sheerness ten years before.\n\n\"What have I to do with it?\" she said to herself. \"What have I to do\nwith all this? Even the child I am going to have! It doesn't seem as if\nI were taken into account.\"\n\nSometimes life takes hold of one, carries the body along, accomplishes\none's history, and yet is not real, but leaves oneself as it were\nslurred over.\n\n\"I wait,\" Mrs. Morel said to herself--\"I wait, and what I wait for can\nnever come.\"\n\nThen she straightened the kitchen, lit the lamp, mended the fire, looked\nout the washing for the next day, and put it to soak. After which\nshe sat down to her sewing. Through the long hours her needle flashed\nregularly through the stuff. Occasionally she sighed, moving to relieve\nherself. And all the time she was thinking how to make the most of what\nshe had, for the children's sakes.\n\nAt half-past eleven her husband came. His cheeks were very red and\nvery shiny above his black moustache. His head nodded slightly. He was\npleased with himself.\n\n\"Oh! Oh! waitin' for me, lass? I've bin 'elpin' Anthony, an' what's\nthink he's gen me? Nowt b'r a lousy hae'f-crown, an' that's ivry\npenny--\"\n\n\"He thinks you've made the rest up in beer,\" she said shortly.\n\n\"An' I 'aven't--that I 'aven't. You b'lieve me, I've 'ad very little\nthis day, I have an' all.\" His voice went tender. \"Here, an' I browt\nthee a bit o' brandysnap, an' a cocoanut for th' children.\" He laid the\ngingerbread and the cocoanut, a hairy object, on the table. \"Nay, tha\nniver said thankyer for nowt i' thy life, did ter?\"\n\nAs a compromise, she picked up the cocoanut and shook it, to see if it\nhad any milk.\n\n\"It's a good 'un, you may back yer life o' that. I got it fra' Bill\nHodgkisson. 'Bill,' I says, 'tha non wants them three nuts, does ter?\nArena ter for gi'ein' me one for my bit of a lad an' wench?' 'I ham,\nWalter, my lad,' 'e says; 'ta'e which on 'em ter's a mind.' An' so I\ntook one, an' thanked 'im. I didn't like ter shake it afore 'is eyes,\nbut 'e says, 'Tha'd better ma'e sure it's a good un, Walt.' An' so, yer\nsee, I knowed it was. He's a nice chap, is Bill Hodgkisson, e's a nice\nchap!\"\n\n\"A man will part with anything so long as he's drunk, and you're drunk\nalong with him,\" said Mrs. Morel.\n\n\"Eh, tha mucky little 'ussy, who's drunk, I sh'd like ter know?\" said\nMorel. He was extraordinarily pleased with himself, because of his day's\nhelping to wait in the Moon and Stars. He chattered on.\n\nMrs. Morel, very tired, and sick of his babble, went to bed as quickly\nas possible, while he raked the fire.\n\nMrs. Morel came of a good old burgher family, famous independents\nwho had fought with Colonel Hutchinson, and who remained stout\nCongregationalists. Her grandfather had gone bankrupt in the lace-market\nat a time when so many lace-manufacturers were ruined in Nottingham. Her\nfather, George Coppard, was an engineer--a large, handsome, haughty\nman, proud of his fair skin and blue eyes, but more proud still of his\nintegrity. Gertrude resembled her mother in her small build. But her\ntemper, proud and unyielding, she had from the Coppards.\n\nGeorge Coppard was bitterly galled by his own poverty. He became foreman\nof the engineers in the dockyard at Sheerness. Mrs. Morel--Gertrude--was\nthe second daughter. She favoured her mother, loved her mother best of\nall; but she had the Coppards' clear, defiant blue eyes and their broad\nbrow. She remembered to have hated her father's overbearing manner\ntowards her gentle, humorous, kindly-souled mother. She remembered\nrunning over the breakwater at Sheerness and finding the boat. She\nremembered to have been petted and flattered by all the men when she had\ngone to the dockyard, for she was a delicate, rather proud child. She\nremembered the funny old mistress, whose assistant she had become, whom\nshe had loved to help in the private school. And she still had the Bible\nthat John Field had given her. She used to walk home from chapel\nwith John Field when she was nineteen. He was the son of a well-to-do\ntradesman, had been to college in London, and was to devote himself to\nbusiness.\n\nShe could always recall in detail a September Sunday afternoon, when\nthey had sat under the vine at the back of her father's house. The sun\ncame through the chinks of the vine-leaves and made beautiful patterns,\nlike a lace scarf, falling on her and on him. Some of the leaves were\nclean yellow, like yellow flat flowers.\n\n\"Now sit still,\" he had cried. \"Now your hair, I don't know what it IS\nlike! It's as bright as copper and gold, as red as burnt copper, and\nit has gold threads where the sun shines on it. Fancy their saying it's\nbrown. Your mother calls it mouse-colour.\"\n\nShe had met his brilliant eyes, but her clear face scarcely showed the\nelation which rose within her.\n\n\"But you say you don't like business,\" she pursued.\n\n\"I don't. I hate it!\" he cried hotly.\n\n\"And you would like to go into the ministry,\" she half implored.\n\n\"I should. I should love it, if I thought I could make a first-rate\npreacher.\"\n\n\"Then why don't you--why DON'T you?\" Her voice rang with defiance. \"If I\nwere a man, nothing would stop me.\"\n\nShe held her head erect. He was rather timid before her.\n\n\"But my father's so stiff-necked. He means to put me into the business,\nand I know he'll do it.\"\n\n\"But if you're a MAN?\" she had cried.\n\n\"Being a man isn't everything,\" he replied, frowning with puzzled\nhelplessness.\n\nNow, as she moved about her work at the Bottoms, with some experience of\nwhat being a man meant, she knew that it was NOT everything.\n\nAt twenty, owing to her health, she had left Sheerness. Her father had\nretired home to Nottingham. John Field's father had been ruined; the\nson had gone as a teacher in Norwood. She did not hear of him until, two\nyears later, she made determined inquiry. He had married his landlady, a\nwoman of forty, a widow with property.\n\nAnd still Mrs. Morel preserved John Field's Bible. She did not now\nbelieve him to be--Well, she understood pretty well what he might or\nmight not have been. So she preserved his Bible, and kept his memory\nintact in her heart, for her own sake. To her dying day, for thirty-five\nyears, she did not speak of him.\n\nWhen she was twenty-three years old, she met, at a Christmas party, a\nyoung man from the Erewash Valley. Morel was then twenty-seven years\nold. He was well set-up, erect, and very smart. He had wavy black hair\nthat shone again, and a vigorous black beard that had never been shaved.\nHis cheeks were ruddy, and his red, moist mouth was noticeable because\nhe laughed so often and so heartily. He had that rare thing, a rich,\nringing laugh. Gertrude Coppard had watched him, fascinated. He was\nso full of colour and animation, his voice ran so easily into comic\ngrotesque, he was so ready and so pleasant with everybody. Her own\nfather had a rich fund of humour, but it was satiric. This man's was\ndifferent: soft, non-intellectual, warm, a kind of gambolling.\n\nShe herself was opposite. She had a curious, receptive mind which found\nmuch pleasure and amusement in listening to other folk. She was clever\nin leading folk to talk. She loved ideas, and was considered very\nintellectual. What she liked most of all was an argument on religion or\nphilosophy or politics with some educated man. This she did not often\nenjoy. So she always had people tell her about themselves, finding her\npleasure so.\n\nIn her person she was rather small and delicate, with a large brow, and\ndropping bunches of brown silk curls. Her blue eyes were very straight,\nhonest, and searching. She had the beautiful hands of the Coppards.\nHer dress was always subdued. She wore dark blue silk, with a peculiar\nsilver chain of silver scallops. This, and a heavy brooch of twisted\ngold, was her only ornament. She was still perfectly intact, deeply\nreligious, and full of beautiful candour.\n\nWalter Morel seemed melted away before her. She was to the miner that\nthing of mystery and fascination, a lady. When she spoke to him, it was\nwith a southern pronunciation and a purity of English which thrilled\nhim to hear. She watched him. He danced well, as if it were natural and\njoyous in him to dance. His grandfather was a French refugee who had\nmarried an English barmaid--if it had been a marriage. Gertrude Coppard\nwatched the young miner as he danced, a certain subtle exultation like\nglamour in his movement, and his face the flower of his body, ruddy,\nwith tumbled black hair, and laughing alike whatever partner he bowed\nabove. She thought him rather wonderful, never having met anyone like\nhim. Her father was to her the type of all men. And George Coppard,\nproud in his bearing, handsome, and rather bitter; who preferred\ntheology in reading, and who drew near in sympathy only to one man, the\nApostle Paul; who was harsh in government, and in familiarity ironic;\nwho ignored all sensuous pleasure:--he was very different from the\nminer. Gertrude herself was rather contemptuous of dancing; she had not\nthe slightest inclination towards that accomplishment, and had never\nlearned even a Roger de Coverley. She was puritan, like her father,\nhigh-minded, and really stern. Therefore the dusky, golden softness of\nthis man's sensuous flame of life, that flowed off his flesh like the\nflame from a candle, not baffled and gripped into incandescence by\nthought and spirit as her life was, seemed to her something wonderful,\nbeyond her.\n\nHe came and bowed above her. A warmth radiated through her as if she had\ndrunk wine.\n\n\"Now do come and have this one wi' me,\" he said caressively. \"It's easy,\nyou know. I'm pining to see you dance.\"\n\nShe had told him before she could not dance. She glanced at his humility\nand smiled. Her smile was very beautiful. It moved the man so that he\nforgot everything.\n\n\"No, I won't dance,\" she said softly. Her words came clean and ringing.\n\nNot knowing what he was doing--he often did the right thing by\ninstinct--he sat beside her, inclining reverentially.\n\n\"But you mustn't miss your dance,\" she reproved.\n\n\n\"Nay, I don't want to dance that--it's not one as I care about.\"\n\n\"Yet you invited me to it.\"\n\nHe laughed very heartily at this.\n\n\"I never thought o' that. Tha'rt not long in taking the curl out of me.\"\n\nIt was her turn to laugh quickly.\n\n\"You don't look as if you'd come much uncurled,\" she said.\n\n\"I'm like a pig's tail, I curl because I canna help it,\" he laughed,\nrather boisterously.\n\n\"And you are a miner!\" she exclaimed in surprise.\n\n\"Yes. I went down when I was ten.\"\n\nShe looked at him in wondering dismay.\n\n\"When you were ten! And wasn't it very hard?\" she asked.\n\n\"You soon get used to it. You live like th' mice, an' you pop out at\nnight to see what's going on.\"\n\n\"It makes me feel blind,\" she frowned.\n\n\"Like a moudiwarp!\" he laughed. \"Yi, an' there's some chaps as does\ngo round like moudiwarps.\" He thrust his face forward in the blind,\nsnout-like way of a mole, seeming to sniff and peer for direction. \"They\ndun though!\" he protested naively. \"Tha niver seed such a way they get\nin. But tha mun let me ta'e thee down some time, an' tha can see for\nthysen.\"\n\nShe looked at him, startled. This was a new tract of life suddenly\nopened before her. She realised the life of the miners, hundreds of them\ntoiling below earth and coming up at evening. He seemed to her noble. He\nrisked his life daily, and with gaiety. She looked at him, with a touch\nof appeal in her pure humility.\n\n\"Shouldn't ter like it?\" he asked tenderly. \"'Appen not, it 'ud dirty\nthee.\"\n\nShe had never been \"thee'd\" and \"thou'd\" before.\n\nThe next Christmas they were married, and for three months she was\nperfectly happy: for six months she was very happy.\n\nHe had signed the pledge, and wore the blue ribbon of a tee-totaller: he\nwas nothing if not showy. They lived, she thought, in his own house.\nIt was small, but convenient enough, and quite nicely furnished,\nwith solid, worthy stuff that suited her honest soul. The women, her\nneighbours, were rather foreign to her, and Morel's mother and sisters\nwere apt to sneer at her ladylike ways. But she could perfectly well\nlive by herself, so long as she had her husband close.\n\nSometimes, when she herself wearied of love-talk, she tried to open her\nheart seriously to him. She saw him listen deferentially, but without\nunderstanding. This killed her efforts at a finer intimacy, and she had\nflashes of fear. Sometimes he was restless of an evening: it was not\nenough for him just to be near her, she realised. She was glad when he\nset himself to little jobs.\n\nHe was a remarkably handy man--could make or mend anything. So she would\nsay:\n\n\"I do like that coal-rake of your mother's--it is small and natty.\"\n\n\"Does ter, my wench? Well, I made that, so I can make thee one!\"\n\n\"What! why, it's a steel one!\"\n\n\"An' what if it is! Tha s'lt ha'e one very similar, if not exactly\nsame.\"\n\nShe did not mind the mess, nor the hammering and noise. He was busy and\nhappy.\n\nBut in the seventh month, when she was brushing his Sunday coat, she\nfelt papers in the breast pocket, and, seized with a sudden curiosity,\ntook them out to read. He very rarely wore the frock-coat he was married\nin: and it had not occurred to her before to feel curious concerning the\npapers. They were the bills of the household furniture, still unpaid.\n\n\"Look here,\" she said at night, after he was washed and had had his\ndinner. \"I found these in the pocket of your wedding-coat. Haven't you\nsettled the bills yet?\"\n\n\"No. I haven't had a chance.\"\n\n\"But you told me all was paid. I had better go into Nottingham on\nSaturday and settle them. I don't like sitting on another man's chairs\nand eating from an unpaid table.\"\n\nHe did not answer.\n\n\"I can have your bank-book, can't I?\"\n\n\"Tha can ha'e it, for what good it'll be to thee.\"\n\n\"I thought--\" she began. He had told her he had a good bit of money left\nover. But she realised it was no use asking questions. She sat rigid\nwith bitterness and indignation.\n\nThe next day she went down to see his mother.\n\n\"Didn't you buy the furniture for Walter?\" she asked.\n\n\"Yes, I did,\" tartly retorted the elder woman.\n\n\"And how much did he give you to pay for it?\"\n\nThe elder woman was stung with fine indignation.\n\n\"Eighty pound, if you're so keen on knowin',\" she replied.\n\n\"Eighty pounds! But there are forty-two pounds still owing!\"\n\n\"I can't help that.\"\n\n\"But where has it all gone?\"\n\n\"You'll find all the papers, I think, if you look--beside ten pound as\nhe owed me, an' six pound as the wedding cost down here.\"\n\n\"Six pounds!\" echoed Gertrude Morel. It seemed to her monstrous that,\nafter her own father had paid so heavily for her wedding, six pounds\nmore should have been squandered in eating and drinking at Walter's\nparents' house, at his expense.\n\n\"And how much has he sunk in his houses?\" she asked.\n\n\"His houses--which houses?\"\n\nGertrude Morel went white to the lips. He had told her the house he\nlived in, and the next one, was his own.\n\n\"I thought the house we live in--\" she began.\n\n\"They're my houses, those two,\" said the mother-in-law. \"And not clear\neither. It's as much as I can do to keep the mortgage interest paid.\"\n\nGertrude sat white and silent. She was her father now.\n\n\"Then we ought to be paying you rent,\" she said coldly.\n\n\"Walter is paying me rent,\" replied the mother.\n\n\"And what rent?\" asked Gertrude.\n\n\"Six and six a week,\" retorted the mother.\n\nIt was more than the house was worth. Gertrude held her head erect,\nlooked straight before her.\n\n\"It is lucky to be you,\" said the elder woman, bitingly, \"to have a\nhusband as takes all the worry of the money, and leaves you a free\nhand.\"\n\nThe young wife was silent.\n\nShe said very little to her husband, but her manner had changed towards\nhim. Something in her proud, honourable soul had crystallised out hard\nas rock.\n\nWhen October came in, she thought only of Christmas. Two years ago, at\nChristmas, she had met him. Last Christmas she had married him. This\nChristmas she would bear him a child.\n\n\"You don't dance yourself, do you, missis?\" asked her nearest neighbour,\nin October, when there was great talk of opening a dancing-class over\nthe Brick and Tile Inn at Bestwood.\n\n\"No--I never had the least inclination to,\" Mrs. Morel replied.\n\n\"Fancy! An' how funny as you should ha' married your Mester. You know\nhe's quite a famous one for dancing.\"\n\n\"I didn't know he was famous,\" laughed Mrs. Morel.\n\n\"Yea, he is though! Why, he ran that dancing-class in the Miners' Arms\nclub-room for over five year.\"\n\n\"Did he?\"\n\n\"Yes, he did.\" The other woman was defiant. \"An' it was thronged\nevery Tuesday, and Thursday, an' Sat'day--an' there WAS carryin's-on,\naccordin' to all accounts.\"\n\nThis kind of thing was gall and bitterness to Mrs. Morel, and she had\na fair share of it. The women did not spare her, at first; for she was\nsuperior, though she could not help it.\n\nHe began to be rather late in coming home.\n\n\"They're working very late now, aren't they?\" she said to her\nwasher-woman.\n\n\"No later than they allers do, I don't think. But they stop to have\ntheir pint at Ellen's, an' they get talkin', an' there you are! Dinner\nstone cold--an' it serves 'em right.\"\n\n\"But Mr. Morel does not take any drink.\"\n\nThe woman dropped the clothes, looked at Mrs. Morel, then went on with\nher work, saying nothing.\n\nGertrude Morel was very ill when the boy was born. Morel was good to\nher, as good as gold. But she felt very lonely, miles away from her own\npeople. She felt lonely with him now, and his presence only made it more\nintense.\n\nThe boy was small and frail at first, but he came on quickly. He was\na beautiful child, with dark gold ringlets, and dark-blue eyes which\nchanged gradually to a clear grey. His mother loved him passionately.\nHe came just when her own bitterness of disillusion was hardest to bear;\nwhen her faith in life was shaken, and her soul felt dreary and lonely.\nShe made much of the child, and the father was jealous.\n\nAt last Mrs. Morel despised her husband. She turned to the child; she\nturned from the father. He had begun to neglect her; the novelty of his\nown home was gone. He had no grit, she said bitterly to herself. What\nhe felt just at the minute, that was all to him. He could not abide by\nanything. There was nothing at the back of all his show.\n\nThere began a battle between the husband and wife--a fearful, bloody\nbattle that ended only with the death of one. She fought to make him\nundertake his own responsibilities, to make him fulfill his obligations.\nBut he was too different from her. His nature was purely sensuous, and\nshe strove to make him moral, religious. She tried to force him to face\nthings. He could not endure it--it drove him out of his mind.\n\nWhile the baby was still tiny, the father's temper had become so\nirritable that it was not to be trusted. The child had only to give a\nlittle trouble when the man began to bully. A little more, and the hard\nhands of the collier hit the baby. Then Mrs. Morel loathed her husband,\nloathed him for days; and he went out and drank; and she cared very\nlittle what he did. Only, on his return, she scathed him with her\nsatire.\n\nThe estrangement between them caused him, knowingly or unknowingly,\ngrossly to offend her where he would not have done.\n\nWilliam was only one year old, and his mother was proud of him, he was\nso pretty. She was not well off now, but her sisters kept the boy in\nclothes. Then, with his little white hat curled with an ostrich feather,\nand his white coat, he was a joy to her, the twining wisps of hair\nclustering round his head. Mrs. Morel lay listening, one Sunday morning,\nto the chatter of the father and child downstairs. Then she dozed off.\nWhen she came downstairs, a great fire glowed in the grate, the room was\nhot, the breakfast was roughly laid, and seated in his armchair, against\nthe chimney-piece, sat Morel, rather timid; and standing between\nhis legs, the child--cropped like a sheep, with such an odd round\npoll--looking wondering at her; and on a newspaper spread out upon\nthe hearthrug, a myriad of crescent-shaped curls, like the petals of a\nmarigold scattered in the reddening firelight.\n\nMrs. Morel stood still. It was her first baby. She went very white, and\nwas unable to speak.\n\n\"What dost think o' 'im?\" Morel laughed uneasily.\n\nShe gripped her two fists, lifted them, and came forward. Morel shrank\nback.\n\n\"I could kill you, I could!\" she said. She choked with rage, her two\nfists uplifted.\n\n\"Yer non want ter make a wench on 'im,\" Morel said, in a frightened\ntone, bending his head to shield his eyes from hers. His attempt at\nlaughter had vanished.\n\nThe mother looked down at the jagged, close-clipped head of her child.\nShe put her hands on his hair, and stroked and fondled his head.\n\n\"Oh--my boy!\" she faltered. Her lip trembled, her face broke, and,\nsnatching up the child, she buried her face in his shoulder and cried\npainfully. She was one of those women who cannot cry; whom it hurts as\nit hurts a man. It was like ripping something out of her, her sobbing.\n\nMorel sat with his elbows on his knees, his hands gripped together till\nthe knuckles were white. He gazed in the fire, feeling almost stunned,\nas if he could not breathe.\n\nPresently she came to an end, soothed the child and cleared away the\nbreakfast-table. She left the newspaper, littered with curls, spread\nupon the hearthrug. At last her husband gathered it up and put it at\nthe back of the fire. She went about her work with closed mouth and very\nquiet. Morel was subdued. He crept about wretchedly, and his meals were\na misery that day. She spoke to him civilly, and never alluded to what\nhe had done. But he felt something final had happened.\n\nAfterwards she said she had been silly, that the boy's hair would have\nhad to be cut, sooner or later. In the end, she even brought herself to\nsay to her husband it was just as well he had played barber when he\ndid. But she knew, and Morel knew, that that act had caused something\nmomentous to take place in her soul. She remembered the scene all her\nlife, as one in which she had suffered the most intensely.\n\nThis act of masculine clumsiness was the spear through the side of her\nlove for Morel. Before, while she had striven against him bitterly, she\nhad fretted after him, as if he had gone astray from her. Now she ceased\nto fret for his love: he was an outsider to her. This made life much\nmore bearable.\n\nNevertheless, she still continued to strive with him. She still had her\nhigh moral sense, inherited from generations of Puritans. It was now a\nreligious instinct, and she was almost a fanatic with him, because\nshe loved him, or had loved him. If he sinned, she tortured him. If he\ndrank, and lied, was often a poltroon, sometimes a knave, she wielded\nthe lash unmercifully.\n\nThe pity was, she was too much his opposite. She could not be content\nwith the little he might be; she would have him the much that he ought\nto be. So, in seeking to make him nobler than he could be, she destroyed\nhim. She injured and hurt and scarred herself, but she lost none of her\nworth. She also had the children.\n\nHe drank rather heavily, though not more than many miners, and always\nbeer, so that whilst his health was affected, it was never injured.\nThe week-end was his chief carouse. He sat in the Miners' Arms until\nturning-out time every Friday, every Saturday, and every Sunday evening.\nOn Monday and Tuesday he had to get up and reluctantly leave towards ten\no'clock. Sometimes he stayed at home on Wednesday and Thursday evenings,\nor was only out for an hour. He practically never had to miss work owing\nto his drinking.\n\nBut although he was very steady at work, his wages fell off. He was\nblab-mouthed, a tongue-wagger. Authority was hateful to him, therefore\nhe could only abuse the pit-managers. He would say, in the Palmerston:\n\n\"Th' gaffer come down to our stall this morning, an' 'e says, 'You know,\nWalter, this 'ere'll not do. What about these props?' An' I says to him,\n'Why, what art talkin' about? What d'st mean about th' props?' 'It'll\nnever do, this 'ere,' 'e says. 'You'll be havin' th' roof in, one o'\nthese days.' An' I says, 'Tha'd better stan' on a bit o' clunch, then,\nan' hold it up wi' thy 'ead.' So 'e wor that mad, 'e cossed an' 'e\nswore, an' t'other chaps they did laugh.\" Morel was a good mimic. He\nimitated the manager's fat, squeaky voice, with its attempt at good\nEnglish.\n\n\"'I shan't have it, Walter. Who knows more about it, me or you?' So\nI says, 'I've niver fun out how much tha' knows, Alfred. It'll 'appen\ncarry thee ter bed an' back.\"'\n\nSo Morel would go on to the amusement of his boon companions. And some\nof this would be true. The pit-manager was not an educated man. He had\nbeen a boy along with Morel, so that, while the two disliked each other,\nthey more or less took each other for granted. But Alfred Charlesworth\ndid not forgive the butty these public-house sayings. Consequently,\nalthough Morel was a good miner, sometimes earning as much as five\npounds a week when he married, he came gradually to have worse and worse\nstalls, where the coal was thin, and hard to get, and unprofitable.\n\nAlso, in summer, the pits are slack. Often, on bright sunny mornings,\nthe men are seen trooping home again at ten, eleven, or twelve o'clock.\nNo empty trucks stand at the pit-mouth. The women on the hillside look\nacross as they shake the hearthrug against the fence, and count the\nwagons the engine is taking along the line up the valley. And the\nchildren, as they come from school at dinner-time, looking down the\nfields and seeing the wheels on the headstocks standing, say:\n\n\"Minton's knocked off. My dad'll be at home.\"\n\nAnd there is a sort of shadow over all, women and children and men,\nbecause money will be short at the end of the week.\n\nMorel was supposed to give his wife thirty shillings a week, to\nprovide everything--rent, food, clothes, clubs, insurance, doctors.\nOccasionally, if he were flush, he gave her thirty-five. But these\noccasions by no means balanced those when he gave her twenty-five. In\nwinter, with a decent stall, the miner might earn fifty or fifty-five\nshillings a week. Then he was happy. On Friday night, Saturday, and\nSunday, he spent royally, getting rid of his sovereign or thereabouts.\nAnd out of so much, he scarcely spared the children an extra penny or\nbought them a pound of apples. It all went in drink. In the bad times,\nmatters were more worrying, but he was not so often drunk, so that Mrs.\nMorel used to say:\n\n\"I'm not sure I wouldn't rather be short, for when he's flush, there\nisn't a minute of peace.\"\n\nIf he earned forty shillings he kept ten; from thirty-five he kept five;\nfrom thirty-two he kept four; from twenty-eight he kept three; from\ntwenty-four he kept two; from twenty he kept one-and-six; from eighteen\nhe kept a shilling; from sixteen he kept sixpence. He never saved a\npenny, and he gave his wife no opportunity of saving; instead, she had\noccasionally to pay his debts; not public-house debts, for those never\nwere passed on to the women, but debts when he had bought a canary, or a\nfancy walking-stick.\n\nAt the wakes time Morel was working badly, and Mrs. Morel was trying\nto save against her confinement. So it galled her bitterly to think\nhe should be out taking his pleasure and spending money, whilst she\nremained at home, harassed. There were two days' holiday. On the Tuesday\nmorning Morel rose early. He was in good spirits. Quite early, before\nsix o'clock, she heard him whistling away to himself downstairs. He\nhad a pleasant way of whistling, lively and musical. He nearly always\nwhistled hymns. He had been a choir-boy with a beautiful voice, and had\ntaken solos in Southwell cathedral. His morning whistling alone betrayed\nit.\n\nHis wife lay listening to him tinkering away in the garden, his\nwhistling ringing out as he sawed and hammered away. It always gave\nher a sense of warmth and peace to hear him thus as she lay in bed, the\nchildren not yet awake, in the bright early morning, happy in his man's\nfashion.\n\nAt nine o'clock, while the children with bare legs and feet were sitting\nplaying on the sofa, and the mother was washing up, he came in from his\ncarpentry, his sleeves rolled up, his waistcoat hanging open. He was\nstill a good-looking man, with black, wavy hair, and a large black\nmoustache. His face was perhaps too much inflamed, and there was about\nhim a look almost of peevishness. But now he was jolly. He went straight\nto the sink where his wife was washing up.\n\n\"What, are thee there!\" he said boisterously. \"Sluthe off an' let me\nwesh mysen.\"\n\n\"You may wait till I've finished,\" said his wife.\n\n\"Oh, mun I? An' what if I shonna?\"\n\nThis good-humoured threat amused Mrs. Morel.\n\n\"Then you can go and wash yourself in the soft-water tub.\"\n\n\"Ha! I can' an' a', tha mucky little 'ussy.\"\n\nWith which he stood watching her a moment, then went away to wait for\nher.\n\nWhen he chose he could still make himself again a real gallant. Usually\nhe preferred to go out with a scarf round his neck. Now, however, he\nmade a toilet. There seemed so much gusto in the way he puffed and\nswilled as he washed himself, so much alacrity with which he hurried to\nthe mirror in the kitchen, and, bending because it was too low for him,\nscrupulously parted his wet black hair, that it irritated Mrs. Morel. He\nput on a turn-down collar, a black bow, and wore his Sunday tail-coat.\nAs such, he looked spruce, and what his clothes would not do, his\ninstinct for making the most of his good looks would.\n\nAt half-past nine Jerry Purdy came to call for his pal. Jerry was\nMorel's bosom friend, and Mrs. Morel disliked him. He was a tall,\nthin man, with a rather foxy face, the kind of face that seems to lack\neyelashes. He walked with a stiff, brittle dignity, as if his head were\non a wooden spring. His nature was cold and shrewd. Generous where he\nintended to be generous, he seemed to be very fond of Morel, and more or\nless to take charge of him.\n\nMrs. Morel hated him. She had known his wife, who had died of\nconsumption, and who had, at the end, conceived such a violent dislike\nof her husband, that if he came into her room it caused her haemorrhage.\nNone of which Jerry had seemed to mind. And now his eldest daughter,\na girl of fifteen, kept a poor house for him, and looked after the two\nyounger children.\n\n\"A mean, wizzen-hearted stick!\" Mrs. Morel said of him.\n\n\"I've never known Jerry mean in MY life,\" protested Morel. \"A\nopener-handed and more freer chap you couldn't find anywhere, accordin'\nto my knowledge.\"\n\n\"Open-handed to you,\" retorted Mrs. Morel. \"But his fist is shut tight\nenough to his children, poor things.\"\n\n\"Poor things! And what for are they poor things, I should like to know.\"\n\nBut Mrs. Morel would not be appeased on Jerry's score.\n\nThe subject of argument was seen, craning his thin neck over the\nscullery curtain. He caught Mrs. Morel's eye.\n\n\"Mornin', missis! Mester in?\"\n\n\"Yes--he is.\"\n\nJerry entered unasked, and stood by the kitchen doorway. He was not\ninvited to sit down, but stood there, coolly asserting the rights of men\nand husbands.\n\n\"A nice day,\" he said to Mrs. Morel.\n\n\"Yes.\n\n\"Grand out this morning--grand for a walk.\"\n\n\"Do you mean YOU'RE going for a walk?\" she asked.\n\n\"Yes. We mean walkin' to Nottingham,\" he replied.\n\n\"H'm!\"\n\nThe two men greeted each other, both glad: Jerry, however, full of\nassurance, Morel rather subdued, afraid to seem too jubilant in presence\nof his wife. But he laced his boots quickly, with spirit. They were\ngoing for a ten-mile walk across the fields to Nottingham. Climbing the\nhillside from the Bottoms, they mounted gaily into the morning. At the\nMoon and Stars they had their first drink, then on to the Old Spot. Then\na long five miles of drought to carry them into Bulwell to a glorious\npint of bitter. But they stayed in a field with some haymakers whose\ngallon bottle was full, so that, when they came in sight of the city,\nMorel was sleepy. The town spread upwards before them, smoking vaguely\nin the midday glare, fridging the crest away to the south with spires\nand factory bulks and chimneys. In the last field Morel lay down under\nan oak tree and slept soundly for over an hour. When he rose to go\nforward he felt queer.\n\nThe two had dinner in the Meadows, with Jerry's sister, then repaired\nto the Punch Bowl, where they mixed in the excitement of pigeon-racing.\nMorel never in his life played cards, considering them as having some\noccult, malevolent power--\"the devil's pictures,\" he called them! But\nhe was a master of skittles and of dominoes. He took a challenge from\na Newark man, on skittles. All the men in the old, long bar took sides,\nbetting either one way or the other. Morel took off his coat. Jerry held\nthe hat containing the money. The men at the tables watched. Some\nstood with their mugs in their hands. Morel felt his big wooden ball\ncarefully, then launched it. He played havoc among the nine-pins, and\nwon half a crown, which restored him to solvency.\n\nBy seven o'clock the two were in good condition. They caught the 7.30\ntrain home.\n\nIn the afternoon the Bottoms was intolerable. Every inhabitant remaining\nwas out of doors. The women, in twos and threes, bareheaded and in white\naprons, gossiped in the alley between the blocks. Men, having a rest\nbetween drinks, sat on their heels and talked. The place smelled stale;\nthe slate roofs glistered in the arid heat.\n\nMrs. Morel took the little girl down to the brook in the meadows, which\nwere not more than two hundred yards away. The water ran quickly over\nstones and broken pots. Mother and child leaned on the rail of the old\nsheep-bridge, watching. Up at the dipping-hole, at the other end of the\nmeadow, Mrs. Morel could see the naked forms of boys flashing round the\ndeep yellow water, or an occasional bright figure dart glittering over\nthe blackish stagnant meadow. She knew William was at the dipping-hole,\nand it was the dread of her life lest he should get drowned. Annie\nplayed under the tall old hedge, picking up alder cones, that she called\ncurrants. The child required much attention, and the flies were teasing.\n\nThe children were put to bed at seven o'clock. Then she worked awhile.\n\nWhen Walter Morel and Jerry arrived at Bestwood they felt a load off\ntheir minds; a railway journey no longer impended, so they could put the\nfinishing touches to a glorious day. They entered the Nelson with the\nsatisfaction of returned travellers.\n\nThe next day was a work-day, and the thought of it put a damper on the\nmen's spirits. Most of them, moreover, had spent their money. Some were\nalready rolling dismally home, to sleep in preparation for the morrow.\nMrs. Morel, listening to their mournful singing, went indoors. Nine\no'clock passed, and ten, and still \"the pair\" had not returned. On a\ndoorstep somewhere a man was singing loudly, in a drawl: \"Lead, kindly\nLight.\" Mrs. Morel was always indignant with the drunken men that they\nmust sing that hymn when they got maudlin.\n\n\"As if 'Genevieve' weren't good enough,\" she said.\n\nThe kitchen was full of the scent of boiled herbs and hops. On the hob a\nlarge black saucepan steamed slowly. Mrs. Morel took a panchion, a great\nbowl of thick red earth, streamed a heap of white sugar into the bottom,\nand then, straining herself to the weight, was pouring in the liquor.\n\nJust then Morel came in. He had been very jolly in the Nelson, but\ncoming home had grown irritable. He had not quite got over the feeling\nof irritability and pain, after having slept on the ground when he was\nso hot; and a bad conscience afflicted him as he neared the house.\nHe did not know he was angry. But when the garden gate resisted his\nattempts to open it, he kicked it and broke the latch. He entered just\nas Mrs. Morel was pouring the infusion of herbs out of the saucepan.\nSwaying slightly, he lurched against the table. The boiling liquor\npitched. Mrs. Morel started back.\n\n\"Good gracious,\" she cried, \"coming home in his drunkenness!\"\n\n\"Comin' home in his what?\" he snarled, his hat over his eye.\n\nSuddenly her blood rose in a jet.\n\n\"Say you're NOT drunk!\" she flashed.\n\nShe had put down her saucepan, and was stirring the sugar into the\nbeer. He dropped his two hands heavily on the table, and thrust his face\nforwards at her.\n\n\"'Say you're not drunk,'\" he repeated. \"Why, nobody but a nasty little\nbitch like you 'ud 'ave such a thought.\"\n\nHe thrust his face forward at her.\n\n\"There's money to bezzle with, if there's money for nothing else.\"\n\n\"I've not spent a two-shillin' bit this day,\" he said.\n\n\"You don't get as drunk as a lord on nothing,\" she replied. \"And,\"\nshe cried, flashing into sudden fury, \"if you've been sponging on your\nbeloved Jerry, why, let him look after his children, for they need it.\"\n\n\"It's a lie, it's a lie. Shut your face, woman.\"\n\nThey were now at battle-pitch. Each forgot everything save the hatred of\nthe other and the battle between them. She was fiery and furious as he.\nThey went on till he called her a liar.\n\n\"No,\" she cried, starting up, scarce able to breathe. \"Don't call me\nthat--you, the most despicable liar that ever walked in shoe-leather.\"\nShe forced the last words out of suffocated lungs.\n\n\"You're a liar!\" he yelled, banging the table with his fist. \"You're a\nliar, you're a liar.\"\n\nShe stiffened herself, with clenched fists.\n\n\"The house is filthy with you,\" she cried.\n\n\"Then get out on it--it's mine. Get out on it!\" he shouted. \"It's me as\nbrings th' money whoam, not thee. It's my house, not thine. Then ger out\non't--ger out on't!\"\n\n\"And I would,\" she cried, suddenly shaken into tears of impotence. \"Ah,\nwouldn't I, wouldn't I have gone long ago, but for those children. Ay,\nhaven't I repented not going years ago, when I'd only the one\"--suddenly\ndrying into rage. \"Do you think it's for YOU I stop--do you think I'd\nstop one minute for YOU?\"\n\n\"Go, then,\" he shouted, beside himself. \"Go!\"\n\n\"No!\" She faced round. \"No,\" she cried loudly, \"you shan't have it ALL\nyour own way; you shan't do ALL you like. I've got those children to see\nto. My word,\" she laughed, \"I should look well to leave them to you.\"\n\n\"Go,\" he cried thickly, lifting his fist. He was afraid of her. \"Go!\"\n\n\"I should be only too glad. I should laugh, laugh, my lord, if I could\nget away from you,\" she replied.\n\nHe came up to her, his red face, with its bloodshot eyes, thrust\nforward, and gripped her arms. She cried in fear of him, struggled to be\nfree. Coming slightly to himself, panting, he pushed her roughly to the\nouter door, and thrust her forth, slotting the bolt behind her with a\nbang. Then he went back into the kitchen, dropped into his armchair, his\nhead, bursting full of blood, sinking between his knees. Thus he dipped\ngradually into a stupor, from exhaustion and intoxication.\n\nThe moon was high and magnificent in the August night. Mrs. Morel,\nseared with passion, shivered to find herself out there in a great white\nlight, that fell cold on her, and gave a shock to her inflamed soul.\nShe stood for a few moments helplessly staring at the glistening great\nrhubarb leaves near the door. Then she got the air into her breast. She\nwalked down the garden path, trembling in every limb, while the child\nboiled within her. For a while she could not control her consciousness;\nmechanically she went over the last scene, then over it again, certain\nphrases, certain moments coming each time like a brand red-hot down on\nher soul; and each time she enacted again the past hour, each time the\nbrand came down at the same points, till the mark was burnt in, and the\npain burnt out, and at last she came to herself. She must have been half\nan hour in this delirious condition. Then the presence of the night came\nagain to her. She glanced round in fear. She had wandered to the side\ngarden, where she was walking up and down the path beside the currant\nbushes under the long wall. The garden was a narrow strip, bounded from\nthe road, that cut transversely between the blocks, by a thick thorn\nhedge.\n\nShe hurried out of the side garden to the front, where she could stand\nas if in an immense gulf of white light, the moon streaming high in face\nof her, the moonlight standing up from the hills in front, and filling\nthe valley where the Bottoms crouched, almost blindingly. There, panting\nand half weeping in reaction from the stress, she murmured to herself\nover and over again: \"The nuisance! the nuisance!\"\n\nShe became aware of something about her.\n\n### Summary:"}

He was a quick, careless, impulsive boy, a\ngood deal like his father. He hated study, made a great moan if he had\nto work, and escaped as soon as possible to his sport again.\n\nIn appearance he remained the flower of the family, being well made,\ngraceful, and full of life. His dark brown hair and fresh colouring, and\nhis exquisite dark blue eyes shaded with long lashes, together with his\ngenerous manner and fiery temper, made him a favourite. But as he grew\nolder his temper became uncertain. He flew into rages over nothing,\nseemed unbearably raw and irritable.\n\nHis mother, whom he loved, wearied of him sometimes. He thought only of\nhimself. When he wanted amusement, all that stood in his way he\nhated, even if it were she. When he was in trouble he moaned to her\nceaselessly.\n\n\"Goodness, boy!\" she said, when he groaned about a master who, he said,\nhated him, \"if you don't like it, alter it, and if you can't alter it,\nput up with it.\"\n\nAnd his father, whom he had loved and who had worshipped him, he came\nto detest. As he grew older Morel fell into a slow ruin. His body, which\nhad been beautiful in movement and in being, shrank, did not seem to\nripen with the years, but to get mean and rather despicable. There came\nover him a look of meanness and of paltriness. And when the mean-looking\nelderly man bullied or ordered the boy about, Arthur was furious.\nMoreover, Morel's manners got worse and worse, his habits somewhat\ndisgusting. When the children were growing up and in the crucial stage\nof adolescence, the father was like some ugly irritant to their souls.\nHis manners in the house were the same as he used among the colliers\ndown pit.\n\n\"Dirty nuisance!\" Arthur would cry, jumping up and going straight out\nof the house when his father disgusted him. And Morel persisted the more\nbecause his children hated it. He seemed to take a kind of satisfaction\nin disgusting them, and driving them nearly mad, while they were so\nirritably sensitive at the age of fourteen or fifteen. So that Arthur,\nwho was growing up when his father was degenerate and elderly, hated him\nworst of all.\n\nThen, sometimes, the father would seem to feel the contemptuous hatred\nof his children.\n\n\"There's not a man tries harder for his family!\" he would shout. \"He\ndoes his best for them, and then gets treated like a dog. But I'm not\ngoing to stand it, I tell you!\"\n\nBut for the threat and the fact that he did not try so hard as he\nimagined, they would have felt sorry. As it was, the battle now went on\nnearly all between father and children, he persisting in his dirty and\ndisgusting ways, just to assert his independence. They loathed him.\n\nArthur was so inflamed and irritable at last, that when he won a\nscholarship for the Grammar School in Nottingham, his mother decided\nto let him live in town, with one of her sisters, and only come home at\nweek-ends.\n\nAnnie was still a junior teacher in the Board-school, earning about four\nshillings a week. But soon she would have fifteen shillings, since she\nhad passed her examination, and there would be financial peace in the\nhouse.\n\nMrs. Morel clung now to Paul. He was quiet and not brilliant. But still\nhe stuck to his painting, and still he stuck to his mother. Everything\nhe did was for her. She waited for his coming home in the evening, and\nthen she unburdened herself of all she had pondered, or of all that\nhad occurred to her during the day. He sat and listened with his\nearnestness. The two shared lives.\n\nWilliam was engaged now to his brunette, and had bought her an\nengagement ring that cost eight guineas. The children gasped at such a\nfabulous price.\n\n\"Eight guineas!\" said Morel. \"More fool him! If he'd gen me some on't,\nit 'ud ha' looked better on 'im.\"\n\n\"Given YOU some of it!\" cried Mrs. Morel. \"Why give YOU some of it!\"\n\nShe remembered HE had bought no engagement ring at all, and she\npreferred William, who was not mean, if he were foolish. But now the\nyoung man talked only of the dances to which he went with his betrothed,\nand the different resplendent clothes she wore; or he told his mother\nwith glee how they went to the theatre like great swells.\n\nHe wanted to bring the girl home. Mrs. Morel said she should come at the\nChristmas. This time William arrived with a lady, but with no presents.\nMrs. Morel had prepared supper. Hearing footsteps, she rose and went to\nthe door. William entered.\n\n\"Hello, mother!\" He kissed her hastily, then stood aside to present a\ntall, handsome girl, who was wearing a costume of fine black-and-white\ncheck, and furs.\n\n\"Here's Gyp!\"\n\nMiss Western held out her hand and showed her teeth in a small smile.\n\n\"Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Morel!\" she exclaimed.\n\n\"I am afraid you will be hungry,\" said Mrs. Morel.\n\n\"Oh no, we had dinner in the train. Have you got my gloves, Chubby?\"\n\nWilliam Morel, big and raw-boned, looked at her quickly.\n\n\"How should I?\" he said.\n\n\"Then I've lost them. Don't be cross with me.\"\n\nA frown went over his face, but he said nothing. She glanced round\nthe kitchen. It was small and curious to her, with its glittering\nkissing-bunch, its evergreens behind the pictures, its wooden chairs and\nlittle deal table. At that moment Morel came in.\n\n\"Hello, dad!\"\n\n\"Hello, my son! Tha's let on me!\"\n\nThe two shook hands, and William presented the lady. She gave the same\nsmile that showed her teeth.\n\n\"How do you do, Mr. Morel?\"\n\nMorel bowed obsequiously.\n\n\"I'm very well, and I hope so are you. You must make yourself very\nwelcome.\"\n\n\"Oh, thank you,\" she replied, rather amused.\n\n\"You will like to go upstairs,\" said Mrs. Morel.\n\n\"If you don't mind; but not if it is any trouble to you.\"\n\n\"It is no trouble. Annie will take you. Walter, carry up this box.\"\n\n\"And don't be an hour dressing yourself up,\" said William to his\nbetrothed.\n\nAnnie took a brass candlestick, and, too shy almost to speak, preceded\nthe young lady to the front bedroom, which Mr. and Mrs. Morel had\nvacated for her. It, too, was small and cold by candlelight. The\ncolliers' wives only lit fires in bedrooms in case of extreme illness.\n\n\"Shall I unstrap the box?\" asked Annie.\n\n\"Oh, thank you very much!\"\n\nAnnie played the part of maid, then went downstairs for hot water.\n\n\"I think she's rather tired, mother,\" said William. \"It's a beastly\njourney, and we had such a rush.\"\n\n\"Is there anything I can give her?\" asked Mrs. Morel.\n\n\"Oh no, she'll be all right.\"\n\nBut there was a chill in the atmosphere. After half an hour Miss Western\ncame down, having put on a purplish-coloured dress, very fine for the\ncollier's kitchen.\n\n\"I told you you'd no need to change,\" said William to her.\n\n\"Oh, Chubby!\" Then she turned with that sweetish smile to Mrs. Morel.\n\"Don't you think he's always grumbling, Mrs. Morel?\"\n\n\"Is he?\" said Mrs. Morel. \"That's not very nice of him.\"\n\n\"It isn't, really!\"\n\n\"You are cold,\" said the mother. \"Won't you come near the fire?\"\n\nMorel jumped out of his armchair.\n\n\"Come and sit you here!\" he cried. \"Come and sit you here!\"\n\n\"No, dad, keep your own chair. Sit on the sofa, Gyp,\" said William.\n\n\"No, no!\" cried Morel. \"This cheer's warmest. Come and sit here, Miss\nWesson.\"\n\n\"Thank you so much,\" said the girl, seating herself in the collier's\narmchair, the place of honour. She shivered, feeling the warmth of the\nkitchen penetrate her.\n\n\"Fetch me a hanky, Chubby dear!\" she said, putting up her mouth to him,\nand using the same intimate tone as if they were alone; which made the\nrest of the family feel as if they ought not to be present. The young\nlady evidently did not realise them as people: they were creatures to\nher for the present. William winced.\n\nIn such a household, in Streatham, Miss Western would have been a lady\ncondescending to her inferiors. These people were to her, certainly\nclownish--in short, the working classes. How was she to adjust herself?\n\n\"I'll go,\" said Annie.\n\nMiss Western took no notice, as if a servant had spoken. But when the\ngirl came downstairs again with the handkerchief, she said: \"Oh, thank\nyou!\" in a gracious way.\n\nShe sat and talked about the dinner on the train, which had been so\npoor; about London, about dances. She was really very nervous, and\nchattered from fear. Morel sat all the time smoking his thick twist\ntobacco, watching her, and listening to her glib London speech, as he\npuffed. Mrs. Morel, dressed up in her best black silk blouse, answered\nquietly and rather briefly. The three children sat round in silence and\nadmiration. Miss Western was the princess. Everything of the best was\ngot out for her: the best cups, the best spoons, the best table cloth,\nthe best coffee-jug. The children thought she must find it quite grand.\nShe felt strange, not able to realise the people, not knowing how to\ntreat them. William joked, and was slightly uncomfortable.\n\nAt about ten o'clock he said to her:\n\n\"Aren't you tired, Gyp?\"\n\n\"Rather, Chubby,\" she answered, at once in the intimate tones and\nputting her head slightly on one side.\n\n\"I'll light her the candle, mother,\" he said.\n\n\"Very well,\" replied the mother.\n\nMiss Western stood up, held out her hand to Mrs. Morel.\n\n\"Good-night, Mrs. Morel,\" she said.\n\nPaul sat at the boiler, letting the water run from the tap into a stone\nbeer-bottle. Annie swathed the bottle in an old flannel pit-singlet, and\nkissed her mother good-night. She was to share the room with the lady,\nbecause the house was full.\n\n\"You wait a minute,\" said Mrs. Morel to Annie. And Annie sat nursing\nthe hot-water bottle. Miss Western shook hands all round, to everybody's\ndiscomfort, and took her departure, preceded by William. In five minutes\nhe was downstairs again. His heart was rather sore; he did not know why.\nHe talked very little till everybody had gone to bed, but himself and\nhis mother. Then he stood with his legs apart, in his old attitude on\nthe hearthrug, and said hesitatingly:\n\n\"Well, mother?\"\n\n\"Well, my son?\"\n\nShe sat in the rocking-chair, feeling somehow hurt and humiliated, for\nhis sake.\n\n\"Do you like her?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" came the slow answer.\n\n\"She's shy yet, mother. She's not used to it. It's different from her\naunt's house, you know.\"\n\n\"Of course it is, my boy; and she must find it difficult.\"\n\n\"She does.\" Then he frowned swiftly. \"If only she wouldn't put on her\nBLESSED airs!\"\n\n\"It's only her first awkwardness, my boy. She'll be all right.\"\n\n\"That's it, mother,\" he replied gratefully. But his brow was gloomy.\n\"You know, she's not like you, mother. She's not serious, and she can't\nthink.\"\n\n\"She's young, my boy.\"\n\n\"Yes; and she's had no sort of show. Her mother died when she was a\nchild. Since then she's lived with her aunt, whom she can't bear. And\nher father was a rake. She's had no love.\"\n\n\"No! Well, you must make up to her.\"\n\n\"And so--you have to forgive her a lot of things.\"\n\n\"WHAT do you have to forgive her, my boy?\"\n\n\"I dunno. When she seems shallow, you have to remember she's never had\nanybody to bring her deeper side out. And she's FEARFULLY fond of me.\"\n\n\"Anybody can see that.\"\n\n\"But you know, mother--she's--she's different from us. Those sort of\npeople, like those she lives amongst, they don't seem to have the same\nprinciples.\"\n\n\"You mustn't judge too hastily,\" said Mrs. Morel.\n\nBut he seemed uneasy within himself.\n\nIn the morning, however, he was up singing and larking round the house.\n\n\"Hello!\" he called, sitting on the stairs. \"Are you getting up?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" her voice called faintly.\n\n\"Merry Christmas!\" he shouted to her.\n\nHer laugh, pretty and tinkling, was heard in the bedroom. She did not\ncome down in half an hour.\n\n\"Was she REALLY getting up when she said she was?\" he asked of Annie.\n\n\"Yes, she was,\" replied Annie.\n\nHe waited a while, then went to the stairs again.\n\n\"Happy New Year,\" he called.\n\n\"Thank you, Chubby dear!\" came the laughing voice, far away.\n\n\"Buck up!\" he implored.\n\nIt was nearly an hour, and still he was waiting for her. Morel, who\nalways rose before six, looked at the clock.\n\n\"Well, it's a winder!\" he exclaimed.\n\nThe family had breakfasted, all but William. He went to the foot of the\nstairs.\n\n\"Shall I have to send you an Easter egg up there?\" he called, rather\ncrossly. She only laughed. The family expected, after that time of\npreparation, something like magic. At last she came, looking very nice\nin a blouse and skirt.\n\n\"Have you REALLY been all this time getting ready?\" he asked.\n\n\"Chubby dear! That question is not permitted, is it, Mrs. Morel?\"\n\nShe played the grand lady at first. When she went with William\nto chapel, he in his frock-coat and silk hat, she in her furs and\nLondon-made costume, Paul and Arthur and Annie expected everybody to bow\nto the ground in admiration. And Morel, standing in his Sunday suit\nat the end of the road, watching the gallant pair go, felt he was the\nfather of princes and princesses.\n\nAnd yet she was not so grand. For a year now she had been a sort of\nsecretary or clerk in a London office. But while she was with the Morels\nshe queened it. She sat and let Annie or Paul wait on her as if they\nwere her servants. She treated Mrs. Morel with a certain glibness and\nMorel with patronage. But after a day or so she began to change her\ntune.\n\nWilliam always wanted Paul or Annie to go along with them on their\nwalks. It was so much more interesting. And Paul really DID admire\n\"Gipsy\" wholeheartedly; in fact, his mother scarcely forgave the boy for\nthe adulation with which he treated the girl.\n\nOn the second day, when Lily said: \"Oh, Annie, do you know where I left\nmy muff?\" William replied:\n\n\"You know it is in your bedroom. Why do you ask Annie?\"\n\nAnd Lily went upstairs with a cross, shut mouth. But it angered the\nyoung man that she made a servant of his sister.\n\nOn the third evening William and Lily were sitting together in the\nparlour by the fire in the dark. At a quarter to eleven Mrs. Morel was\nheard raking the fire. William came out to the kitchen, followed by his\nbeloved.\n\n\"Is it as late as that, mother?\" he said. She had been sitting alone.\n\n\"It is not LATE, my boy, but it is as late as I usually sit up.\"\n\n\"Won't you go to bed, then?\" he asked.\n\n\"And leave you two? No, my boy, I don't believe in it.\"\n\n\"Can't you trust us, mother?\"\n\n\"Whether I can or not, I won't do it. You can stay till eleven if you\nlike, and I can read.\"\n\n\"Go to bed, Gyp,\" he said to his girl. \"We won't keep mater waiting.\"\n\n\"Annie has left the candle burning, Lily,\" said Mrs. Morel; \"I think you\nwill see.\"\n\n\"Yes, thank you. Good-night, Mrs. Morel.\"\n\nWilliam kissed his sweetheart at the foot of the stairs, and she went.\nHe returned to the kitchen.\n\n\"Can't you trust us, mother?\" he repeated, rather offended.\n\n\"My boy, I tell you I don't BELIEVE in leaving two young things like you\nalone downstairs when everyone else is in bed.\"\n\nAnd he was forced to take this answer. He kissed his mother good-night.\n\nAt Easter he came over alone. And then he discussed his sweetheart\nendlessly with his mother.\n\n\"You know, mother, when I'm away from her I don't care for her a bit. I\nshouldn't care if I never saw her again. But, then, when I'm with her in\nthe evenings I am awfully fond of her.\"\n\n\"It's a queer sort of love to marry on,\" said Mrs. Morel, \"if she holds\nyou no more than that!\"\n\n\"It IS funny!\" he exclaimed. It worried and perplexed him. \"But\nyet--there's so much between us now I couldn't give her up.\"\n\n\"You know best,\" said Mrs. Morel. \"But if it is as you say, I wouldn't\ncall it LOVE--at any rate, it doesn't look much like it.\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't know, mother. She's an orphan, and--\"\n\nThey never came to any sort of conclusion. He seemed puzzled and rather\nfretted. She was rather reserved. All his strength and money went\nin keeping this girl. He could scarcely afford to take his mother to\nNottingham when he came over.\n\nPaul's wages had been raised at Christmas to ten shillings, to his great\njoy. He was quite happy at Jordan's, but his health suffered from the\nlong hours and the confinement. His mother, to whom he became more and\nmore significant, thought how to help.\n\nHis half-day holiday was on Monday afternoon. On a Monday morning in\nMay, as the two sat alone at breakfast, she said:\n\n\"I think it will be a fine day.\"\n\nHe looked up in surprise. This meant something.\n\n\"You know Mr. Leivers has gone to live on a new farm. Well, he asked me\nlast week if I wouldn't go and see Mrs. Leivers, and I promised to bring\nyou on Monday if it's fine. Shall we go?\"\n\n\"I say, little woman, how lovely!\" he cried. \"And we'll go this\nafternoon?\"\n\nPaul hurried off to the station jubilant. Down Derby Road was a\ncherry-tree that glistened. The old brick wall by the Statutes ground\nburned scarlet, spring was a very flame of green. And the steep swoop\nof highroad lay, in its cool morning dust, splendid with patterns of\nsunshine and shadow, perfectly still. The trees sloped their great green\nshoulders proudly; and inside the warehouse all the morning, the boy had\na vision of spring outside.\n\nWhen he came home at dinner-time his mother was rather excited.\n\n\"Are we going?\" he asked.\n\n\"When I'm ready,\" she replied.\n\nPresently he got up.\n\n\"Go and get dressed while I wash up,\" he said.\n\nShe did so. He washed the pots, straightened, and then took her boots.\nThey were quite clean. Mrs. Morel was one of those naturally exquisite\npeople who can walk in mud without dirtying their shoes. But Paul had to\nclean them for her. They were kid boots at eight shillings a pair. He,\nhowever, thought them the most dainty boots in the world, and he cleaned\nthem with as much reverence as if they had been flowers.\n\nSuddenly she appeared in the inner doorway rather shyly. She had got a\nnew cotton blouse on. Paul jumped up and went forward.\n\n\"Oh, my stars!\" he exclaimed. \"What a bobby-dazzler!\"\n\nShe sniffed in a little haughty way, and put her head up.\n\n\"It's not a bobby-dazzler at all!\" she replied. \"It's very quiet.\"\n\nShe walked forward, whilst he hovered round her.\n\n\"Well,\" she asked, quite shy, but pretending to be high and mighty, \"do\nyou like it?\"\n\n\"Awfully! You ARE a fine little woman to go jaunting out with!\"\n\nHe went and surveyed her from the back.\n\n\"Well,\" he said, \"if I was walking down the street behind you, I should\nsay: 'Doesn't THAT little person fancy herself!\"'\n\n\"Well, she doesn't,\" replied Mrs. Morel. \"She's not sure it suits her.\"\n\n\"Oh no! she wants to be in dirty black, looking as if she was wrapped in\nburnt paper. It DOES suit you, and I say you look nice.\"\n\nShe sniffed in her little way, pleased, but pretending to know better.\n\n\"Well,\" she said, \"it's cost me just three shillings. You couldn't have\ngot it ready-made for that price, could you?\"\n\n\"I should think you couldn't,\" he replied.\n\n\"And, you know, it's good stuff.\"\n\n\"Awfully pretty,\" he said.\n\nThe blouse was white, with a little sprig of heliotrope and black.\n\n\"Too young for me, though, I'm afraid,\" she said.\n\n\"Too young for you!\" he exclaimed in disgust. \"Why don't you buy some\nfalse white hair and stick it on your head.\"\n\n\"I s'll soon have no need,\" she replied. \"I'm going white fast enough.\"\n\n\"Well, you've no business to,\" he said. \"What do I want with a\nwhite-haired mother?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid you'll have to put up with one, my lad,\" she said rather\nstrangely.\n\nThey set off in great style, she carrying the umbrella William had given\nher, because of the sun. Paul was considerably taller than she, though\nhe was not big. He fancied himself.\n\nOn the fallow land the young wheat shone silkily. Minton pit waved its\nplumes of white steam, coughed, and rattled hoarsely.\n\n\"Now look at that!\" said Mrs. Morel. Mother and son stood on the road to\nwatch. Along the ridge of the great pit-hill crawled a little group\nin silhouette against the sky, a horse, a small truck, and a man. They\nclimbed the incline against the heavens. At the end the man tipped the\nwagon. There was an undue rattle as the waste fell down the sheer slope\nof the enormous bank.\n\n\"You sit a minute, mother,\" he said, and she took a seat on a bank,\nwhilst he sketched rapidly. She was silent whilst he worked, looking\nround at the afternoon, the red cottages shining among their greenness.\n\n\"The world is a wonderful place,\" she said, \"and wonderfully beautiful.\"\n\n\"And so's the pit,\" he said. \"Look how it heaps together, like something\nalive almost--a big creature that you don't know.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said. \"Perhaps!\"\n\n\"And all the trucks standing waiting, like a string of beasts to be\nfed,\" he said.\n\n\"And very thankful I am they ARE standing,\" she said, \"for that means\nthey'll turn middling time this week.\"\n\n\"But I like the feel of MEN on things, while they're alive. There's a\nfeel of men about trucks, because they've been handled with men's hands,\nall of them.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mrs. Morel.\n\nThey went along under the trees of the highroad. He was constantly\ninforming her, but she was interested. They passed the end of\nNethermere, that was tossing its sunshine like petals lightly in\nits lap. Then they turned on a private road, and in some trepidation\napproached a big farm. A dog barked furiously. A woman came out to see.\n\n\"Is this the way to Willey Farm?\" Mrs. Morel asked.\n\nPaul hung behind in terror of being sent back. But the woman was\namiable, and directed them. The mother and son went through the wheat\nand oats, over a little bridge into a wild meadow. Peewits, with their\nwhite breasts glistening, wheeled and screamed about them. The lake was\nstill and blue. High overhead a heron floated. Opposite, the wood heaped\non the hill, green and still.\n\n\"It's a wild road, mother,\" said Paul. \"Just like Canada.\"\n\n\"Isn't it beautiful!\" said Mrs. Morel, looking round.\n\n\"See that heron--see--see her legs?\"\n\nHe directed his mother, what she must see and what not. And she was\nquite content.\n\n\"But now,\" she said, \"which way? He told me through the wood.\"\n\nThe wood, fenced and dark, lay on their left.\n\n\"I can feel a bit of a path this road,\" said Paul. \"You've got town\nfeet, somehow or other, you have.\"\n\nThey found a little gate, and soon were in a broad green alley of the\nwood, with a new thicket of fir and pine on one hand, an old oak glade\ndipping down on the other. And among the oaks the bluebells stood in\npools of azure, under the new green hazels, upon a pale fawn floor of\noak-leaves. He found flowers for her.\n\n\"Here's a bit of new-mown hay,\" he said; then, again, he brought her\nforget-me-nots. And, again, his heart hurt with love, seeing her hand,\nused with work, holding the little bunch of flowers he gave her. She was\nperfectly happy.\n\nBut at the end of the riding was a fence to climb. Paul was over in a\nsecond.\n\n\"Come,\" he said, \"let me help you.\"\n\n\"No, go away. I will do it in my own way.\"\n\nHe stood below with his hands up ready to help her. She climbed\ncautiously.\n\n\"What a way to climb!\" he exclaimed scornfully, when she was safely to\nearth again.\n\n\"Hateful stiles!\" she cried.\n\n\"Duffer of a little woman,\" he replied, \"who can't get over 'em.\"\n\nIn front, along the edge of the wood, was a cluster of low red farm\nbuildings. The two hastened forward. Flush with the wood was the apple\norchard, where blossom was falling on the grindstone. The pond was deep\nunder a hedge and overhanging oak trees. Some cows stood in the shade.\nThe farm and buildings, three sides of a quadrangle, embraced the\nsunshine towards the wood. It was very still.\n\nMother and son went into the small railed garden, where was a scent\nof red gillivers. By the open door were some floury loaves, put out to\ncool. A hen was just coming to peck them. Then, in the doorway suddenly\nappeared a girl in a dirty apron. She was about fourteen years old, had\na rosy dark face, a bunch of short black curls, very fine and free, and\ndark eyes; shy, questioning, a little resentful of the strangers, she\ndisappeared. In a minute another figure appeared, a small, frail woman,\nrosy, with great dark brown eyes.\n\n\"Oh!\" she exclaimed, smiling with a little glow, \"you've come, then. I\nAM glad to see you.\" Her voice was intimate and rather sad.\n\nThe two women shook hands.\n\n\"Now are you sure we're not a bother to you?\" said Mrs. Morel. \"I know\nwhat a farming life is.\"\n\n\"Oh no! We're only too thankful to see a new face, it's so lost up\nhere.\"\n\n\"I suppose so,\" said Mrs. Morel.\n\nThey were taken through into the parlour--a long, low room, with a great\nbunch of guelder-roses in the fireplace. There the women talked, whilst\nPaul went out to survey the land. He was in the garden smelling the\ngillivers and looking at the plants, when the girl came out quickly to\nthe heap of coal which stood by the fence.\n\n\"I suppose these are cabbage-roses?\" he said to her, pointing to the\nbushes along the fence.\n\nShe looked at him with startled, big brown eyes.\n\n\"I suppose they are cabbage-roses when they come out?\" he said.\n\n\"I don't know,\" she faltered. \"They're white with pink middles.\"\n\n\"Then they're maiden-blush.\"\n\nMiriam flushed. She had a beautiful warm colouring.\n\n\"I don't know,\" she said.\n\n\"You don't have MUCH in your garden,\" he said.\n\n\"This is our first year here,\" she answered, in a distant, rather\nsuperior way, drawing back and going indoors. He did not notice, but\nwent his round of exploration. Presently his mother came out, and they\nwent through the buildings. Paul was hugely delighted.\n\n\"And I suppose you have the fowls and calves and pigs to look after?\"\nsaid Mrs. Morel to Mrs. Leivers.\n\n\"No,\" replied the little woman. \"I can't find time to look after cattle,\nand I'm not used to it. It's as much as I can do to keep going in the\nhouse.\"\n\n\"Well, I suppose it is,\" said Mrs. Morel.\n\nPresently the girl came out.\n\n\"Tea is ready, mother,\" she said in a musical, quiet voice.\n\n\"Oh, thank you, Miriam, then we'll come,\" replied her mother, almost\ningratiatingly. \"Would you CARE to have tea now, Mrs. Morel?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" said Mrs. Morel. \"Whenever it's ready.\"\n\nPaul and his mother and Mrs. Leivers had tea together. Then they\nwent out into the wood that was flooded with bluebells, while fumy\nforget-me-nots were in the paths. The mother and son were in ecstasy\ntogether.\n\nWhen they got back to the house, Mr. Leivers and Edgar, the eldest\nson, were in the kitchen. Edgar was about eighteen. Then Geoffrey and\nMaurice, big lads of twelve and thirteen, were in from school. Mr.\nLeivers was a good-looking man in the prime of life, with a golden-brown\nmoustache, and blue eyes screwed up against the weather.\n\nThe boys were condescending, but Paul scarcely observed it. They went\nround for eggs, scrambling into all sorts of places. As they were\nfeeding the fowls Miriam came out. The boys took no notice of her. One\nhen, with her yellow chickens, was in a coop. Maurice took his hand full\nof corn and let the hen peck from it.\n\n\"Durst you do it?\" he asked of Paul.\n\n\"Let's see,\" said Paul.\n\nHe had a small hand, warm, and rather capable-looking. Miriam watched.\nHe held the corn to the hen. The bird eyed it with her hard, bright eye,\nand suddenly made a peck into his hand. He started, and laughed. \"Rap,\nrap, rap!\" went the bird's beak in his palm. He laughed again, and the\nother boys joined.\n\n\"She knocks you, and nips you, but she never hurts,\" said Paul, when the\nlast corn had gone. \"Now, Miriam,\" said Maurice, \"you come an 'ave a\ngo.\"\n\n\"No,\" she cried, shrinking back.\n\n\"Ha! baby. The mardy-kid!\" said her brothers.\n\n\"It doesn't hurt a bit,\" said Paul. \"It only just nips rather nicely.\"\n\n\"No,\" she still cried, shaking her black curls and shrinking.\n\n\"She dursn't,\" said Geoffrey. \"She niver durst do anything except recite\npoitry.\"\n\n\"Dursn't jump off a gate, dursn't tweedle, dursn't go on a slide,\ndursn't stop a girl hittin' her. She can do nowt but go about thinkin'\nherself somebody. 'The Lady of the Lake.' Yah!\" cried Maurice.\n\nMiriam was crimson with shame and misery.\n\n\"I dare do more than you,\" she cried. \"You're never anything but cowards\nand bullies.\"\n\n\"Oh, cowards and bullies!\" they repeated mincingly, mocking her speech.\n\n     \"Not such a clown shall anger me,\n     A boor is answered silently,\"\n\nhe quoted against her, shouting with laughter.\n\nShe went indoors. Paul went with the boys into the orchard, where they\nhad rigged up a parallel bar. They did feats of strength. He was more\nagile than strong, but it served. He fingered a piece of apple-blossom\nthat hung low on a swinging bough.\n\n\"I wouldn't get the apple-blossom,\" said Edgar, the eldest brother.\n\"There'll be no apples next year.\"\n\n\"I wasn't going to get it,\" replied Paul, going away.\n\nThe boys felt hostile to him; they were more interested in their own\npursuits. He wandered back to the house to look for his mother. As he\nwent round the back, he saw Miriam kneeling in front of the hen-coop,\nsome maize in her hand, biting her lip, and crouching in an intense\nattitude. The hen was eyeing her wickedly. Very gingerly she put forward\nher hand. The hen bobbed for her. She drew back quickly with a cry, half\nof fear, half of chagrin.\n\n\"It won't hurt you,\" said Paul.\n\nShe flushed crimson and started up.\n\n\"I only wanted to try,\" she said in a low voice.\n\n\"See, it doesn't hurt,\" he said, and, putting only two corns in his\npalm, he let the hen peck, peck, peck at his bare hand. \"It only makes\nyou laugh,\" he said.\n\nShe put her hand forward and dragged it away, tried again, and started\nback with a cry. He frowned.\n\n\"Why, I'd let her take corn from my face,\" said Paul, \"only she bumps a\nbit. She's ever so neat. If she wasn't, look how much ground she'd peck\nup every day.\"\n\nHe waited grimly, and watched. At last Miriam let the bird peck from\nher hand. She gave a little cry--fear, and pain because of fear--rather\npathetic. But she had done it, and she did it again.\n\n\"There, you see,\" said the boy. \"It doesn't hurt, does it?\"\n\nShe looked at him with dilated dark eyes.\n\n\"No,\" she laughed, trembling.\n\nThen she rose and went indoors. She seemed to be in some way resentful\nof the boy.\n\n\"He thinks I'm only a common girl,\" she thought, and she wanted to prove\nshe was a grand person like the \"Lady of the Lake\".\n\nPaul found his mother ready to go home. She smiled on her son. He took\nthe great bunch of flowers. Mr. and Mrs. Leivers walked down the fields\nwith them. The hills were golden with evening; deep in the woods showed\nthe darkening purple of bluebells. It was everywhere perfectly stiff,\nsave for the rustling of leaves and birds.\n\n\"But it is a beautiful place,\" said Mrs. Morel.\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Mr. Leivers; \"it's a nice little place, if only it\nweren't for the rabbits. The pasture's bitten down to nothing. I dunno\nif ever I s'll get the rent off it.\"\n\nHe clapped his hands, and the field broke into motion near the woods,\nbrown rabbits hopping everywhere.\n\n\"Would you believe it!\" exclaimed Mrs. Morel.\n\nShe and Paul went on alone together.\n\n\"Wasn't it lovely, mother?\" he said quietly.\n\nA thin moon was coming out. His heart was full of happiness till it\nhurt. His mother had to chatter, because she, too, wanted to cry with\nhappiness.\n\n\"Now WOULDN'T I help that man!\" she said. \"WOULDN'T I see to the fowls\nand the young stock! And I'D learn to milk, and I'D talk with him, and\nI'D plan with him. My word, if I were his wife, the farm would be run,\nI know! But there, she hasn't the strength--she simply hasn't the\nstrength. She ought never to have been burdened like it, you know. I'm\nsorry for her, and I'm sorry for him too. My word, if I'D had him, I\nshouldn't have thought him a bad husband! Not that she does either; and\nshe's very lovable.\"\n\nWilliam came home again with his sweetheart at the Whitsuntide. He had\none week of his holidays then. It was beautiful weather. As a rule,\nWilliam and Lily and Paul went out in the morning together for a walk.\nWilliam did not talk to his beloved much, except to tell her things from\nhis boyhood. Paul talked endlessly to both of them. They lay down, all\nthree, in a meadow by Minton Church. On one side, by the Castle Farm,\nwas a beautiful quivering screen of poplars. Hawthorn was dropping\nfrom the hedges; penny daisies and ragged robin were in the field, like\nlaughter. William, a big fellow of twenty-three, thinner now and even a\nbit gaunt, lay back in the sunshine and dreamed, while she fingered with\nhis hair. Paul went gathering the big daisies. She had taken off her\nhat; her hair was black as a horse's mane. Paul came back and threaded\ndaisies in her jet-black hair--big spangles of white and yellow, and\njust a pink touch of ragged robin.\n\n\"Now you look like a young witch-woman,\" the boy said to her. \"Doesn't\nshe, William?\"\n\nLily laughed. William opened his eyes and looked at her. In his gaze was\na certain baffled look of misery and fierce appreciation.\n\n\"Has he made a sight of me?\" she asked, laughing down on her lover.\n\n\"That he has!\" said William, smiling.\n\nHe looked at her. Her beauty seemed to hurt him. He glanced at her\nflower-decked head and frowned.\n\n\"You look nice enough, if that's what you want to know,\" he said.\n\nAnd she walked without her hat. In a little while William recovered, and\nwas rather tender to her. Coming to a bridge, he carved her initials and\nhis in a heart.\n\nL. L. W.\n\nW. M.\n\nShe watched his strong, nervous hand, with its glistening hairs and\nfreckles, as he carved, and she seemed fascinated by it.\n\nAll the time there was a feeling of sadness and warmth, and a certain\ntenderness in the house, whilst William and Lily were at home. But often\nhe got irritable. She had brought, for an eight-days' stay, five dresses\nand six blouses.\n\n\"Oh, would you mind,\" she said to Annie, \"washing me these two blouses,\nand these things?\"\n\nAnd Annie stood washing when William and Lily went out the next morning.\nMrs. Morel was furious. And sometimes the young man, catching a glimpse\nof his sweetheart's attitude towards his sister, hated her.\n\nOn Sunday morning she looked very beautiful in a dress of foulard, silky\nand sweeping, and blue as a jay-bird's feather, and in a large cream hat\ncovered with many roses, mostly crimson. Nobody could admire her enough.\nBut in the evening, when she was going out, she asked again:\n\n\"Chubby, have you got my gloves?\"\n\n\"Which?\" asked William.\n\n\"My new black SUEDE.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nThere was a hunt. She had lost them.\n\n\"Look here, mother,\" said William, \"that's the fourth pair she's lost\nsince Christmas--at five shillings a pair!\"\n\n\"You only gave me TWO of them,\" she remonstrated.\n\nAnd in the evening, after supper, he stood on the hearthrug whilst she\nsat on the sofa, and he seemed to hate her. In the afternoon he had\nleft her whilst he went to see some old friend. She had sat looking at a\nbook. After supper William wanted to write a letter.\n\n\"Here is your book, Lily,\" said Mrs. Morel. \"Would you care to go on\nwith it for a few minutes?\"\n\n\"No, thank you,\" said the girl. \"I will sit still.\"\n\n\"But it is so dull.\"\n\nWilliam scribbled irritably at a great rate. As he sealed the envelope\nhe said:\n\n\"Read a book! Why, she's never read a book in her life.\"\n\n\"Oh, go along!\" said Mrs. Morel, cross with the exaggeration,\n\n\"It's true, mother--she hasn't,\" he cried, jumping up and taking his old\nposition on the hearthrug. \"She's never read a book in her life.\"\n\n\"'Er's like me,\" chimed in Morel. \"'Er canna see what there is i' books,\nter sit borin' your nose in 'em for, nor more can I.\"\n\n\"But you shouldn't say these things,\" said Mrs. Morel to her son.\n\n\"But it's true, mother--she CAN'T read. What did you give her?\"\n\n\"Well, I gave her a little thing of Annie Swan's. Nobody wants to read\ndry stuff on Sunday afternoon.\"\n\n\"Well, I'll bet she didn't read ten lines of it.\"\n\n\"You are mistaken,\" said his mother.\n\nAll the time Lily sat miserably on the sofa. He turned to her swiftly.\n\n\"DID you read any?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes, I did,\" she replied.\n\n\"How much?\"\n\n\"I don't know how many pages.\"\n\n\"Tell me ONE THING you read.\"\n\nShe could not.\n\nShe never got beyond the second page. He read a great deal, and had a\nquick, active intelligence. She could understand nothing but love-making\nand chatter. He was accustomed to having all his thoughts sifted through\nhis mother's mind; so, when he wanted companionship, and was asked in\nreply to be the billing and twittering lover, he hated his betrothed.\n\n\"You know, mother,\" he said, when he was alone with her at night, \"she's\nno idea of money, she's so wessel-brained. When she's paid, she'll\nsuddenly buy such rot as marrons glaces, and then I have to buy her\nseason ticket, and her extras, even her underclothing. And she wants to\nget married, and I think myself we might as well get married next year.\nBut at this rate--\"\n\n\"A fine mess of a marriage it would be,\" replied his mother. \"I should\nconsider it again, my boy.\"\n\n\"Oh, well, I've gone too far to break off now,\" he said, \"and so I shall\nget married as soon as I can.\"\n\n\"Very well, my boy. If you will, you will, and there's no stopping you;\nbut I tell you, I can't sleep when I think about it.\"\n\n\"Oh, she'll be all right, mother. We shall manage.\"\n\n\"And she lets you buy her underclothing?\" asked the mother.\n\n\"Well,\" he began apologetically, \"she didn't ask me; but one\nmorning--and it WAS cold--I found her on the station shivering, not able\nto keep still; so I asked her if she was well wrapped up. She said: 'I\nthink so.' So I said: 'Have you got warm underthings on?' And she\nsaid: 'No, they were cotton.' I asked her why on earth she hadn't got\nsomething thicker on in weather like that, and she said because she HAD\nnothing. And there she is--a bronchial subject! I HAD to take her and\nget some warm things. Well, mother, I shouldn't mind the money if we\nhad any. And, you know, she OUGHT to keep enough to pay for her\nseason-ticket; but no, she comes to me about that, and I have to find\nthe money.\"\n\n\"It's a poor lookout,\" said Mrs. Morel bitterly.\n\nHe was pale, and his rugged face, that used to be so perfectly careless\nand laughing, was stamped with conflict and despair.\n\n\"But I can't give her up now; it's gone too far,\" he said. \"And,\nbesides, for SOME things I couldn't do without her.\"\n\n\"My boy, remember you're taking your life in your hands,\" said Mrs.\nMorel. \"NOTHING is as bad as a marriage that's a hopeless failure. Mine\nwas bad enough, God knows, and ought to teach you something; but it\nmight have been worse by a long chalk.\"\n\nHe leaned with his back against the side of the chimney-piece, his hands\nin his pockets. He was a big, raw-boned man, who looked as if he would\ngo to the world's end if he wanted to. But she saw the despair on his\nface.\n\n\"I couldn't give her up now,\" he said.\n\n\"Well,\" she said, \"remember there are worse wrongs than breaking off an\nengagement.\"\n\n\"I can't give her up NOW,\" he said.\n\nThe clock ticked on; mother and son remained in silence, a conflict\nbetween them; but he would say no more. At last she said:\n\n\"Well, go to bed, my son. You'll feel better in the morning, and perhaps\nyou'll know better.\"\n\nHe kissed her, and went. She raked the fire. Her heart was heavy now\nas it had never been. Before, with her husband, things had seemed to be\nbreaking down in her, but they did not destroy her power to live. Now\nher soul felt lamed in itself. It was her hope that was struck.\n\nAnd so often William manifested the same hatred towards his betrothed.\nOn the last evening at home he was railing against her.\n\n\"Well,\" he said, \"if you don't believe me, what she's like, would you\nbelieve she has been confirmed three times?\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" laughed Mrs. Morel.\n\n\"Nonsense or not, she HAS! That's what confirmation means for her--a bit\nof a theatrical show where she can cut a figure.\"\n\n\"I haven't, Mrs. Morel!\" cried the girl--\"I haven't! it is not true!\"\n\n\"What!\" he cried, flashing round on her. \"Once in Bromley, once in\nBeckenham, and once somewhere else.\"\n\n\"Nowhere else!\" she said, in tears--\"nowhere else!\"\n\n\"It WAS! And if it wasn't why were you confirmed TWICE?\"\n\n\"Once I was only fourteen, Mrs. Morel,\" she pleaded, tears in her eyes.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mrs. Morel; \"I can quite understand it, child. Take no\nnotice of him. You ought to be ashamed, William, saying such things.\"\n\n\"But it's true. She's religious--she had blue velvet Prayer-Books--and\nshe's not as much religion, or anything else, in her than that\ntable-leg. Gets confirmed three times for show, to show herself off, and\nthat's how she is in EVERYTHING--EVERYTHING!\"\n\nThe girl sat on the sofa, crying. She was not strong.\n\n\"As for LOVE!\" he cried, \"you might as well ask a fly to love you! It'll\nlove settling on you--\"\n\n\"Now, say no more,\" commanded Mrs. Morel. \"If you want to say these\nthings, you must find another place than this. I am ashamed of you,\nWilliam! Why don't you be more manly. To do nothing but find fault with\na girl, and then pretend you're engaged to her!\"\n\nMrs. Morel subsided in wrath and indignation.\n\nWilliam was silent, and later he repented, kissed and comforted the\ngirl. Yet it was true, what he had said. He hated her.\n\nWhen they were going away, Mrs. Morel accompanied them as far as\nNottingham. It was a long way to Keston station.\n\n\"You know, mother,\" he said to her, \"Gyp's shallow. Nothing goes deep\nwith her.\"\n\n\"William, I WISH you wouldn't say these things,\" said Mrs. Morel, very\nuncomfortable for the girl who walked beside her.\n\n\"But it doesn't, mother. She's very much in love with me now, but if I\ndied she'd have forgotten me in three months.\"\n\nMrs. Morel was afraid. Her heart beat furiously, hearing the quiet\nbitterness of her son's last speech.\n\n\"How do you know?\" she replied. \"You DON'T know, and therefore you've no\nright to say such a thing.\"\n\n\"He's always saying these things!\" cried the girl.\n\n\"In three months after I was buried you'd have somebody else, and I\nshould be forgotten,\" he said. \"And that's your love!\"\n\nMrs. Morel saw them into the train in Nottingham, then she returned\nhome.\n\n\"There's one comfort,\" she said to Paul--\"he'll never have any money to\nmarry on, that I AM sure of. And so she'll save him that way.\"\n\nSo she took cheer. Matters were not yet very desperate. She firmly\nbelieved William would never marry his Gipsy. She waited, and she kept\nPaul near to her.\n\nAll summer long William's letters had a feverish tone; he seemed\nunnatural and intense. Sometimes he was exaggeratedly jolly, usually he\nwas flat and bitter in his letter.\n\n\"Ah,\" his mother said, \"I'm afraid he's ruining himself against that\ncreature, who isn't worthy of his love--no, no more than a rag doll.\"\n\nHe wanted to come home. The midsummer holiday was gone; it was a long\nwhile to Christmas. He wrote in wild excitement, saying he could come\nfor Saturday and Sunday at Goose Fair, the first week in October.\n\n\"You are not well, my boy,\" said his mother, when she saw him. She was\nalmost in tears at having him to herself again.\n\n\"No, I've not been well,\" he said. \"I've seemed to have a dragging cold\nall the last month, but it's going, I think.\"\n\nIt was sunny October weather. He seemed wild with joy, like a schoolboy\nescaped; then again he was silent and reserved. He was more gaunt than\never, and there was a haggard look in his eyes.\n\n\"You are doing too much,\" said his mother to him.\n\nHe was doing extra work, trying to make some money to marry on, he said.\nHe only talked to his mother once on the Saturday night; then he was sad\nand tender about his beloved.\n\n\"And yet, you know, mother, for all that, if I died she'd be\nbroken-hearted for two months, and then she'd start to forget me. You'd\nsee, she'd never come home here to look at my grave, not even once.\"\n\n\"Why, William,\" said his mother, \"you're not going to die, so why talk\nabout it?\"\n\n\"But whether or not--\" he replied.\n\n\"And she can't help it. She is like that, and if you choose her--well,\nyou can't grumble,\" said his mother.\n\nOn the Sunday morning, as he was putting his collar on:\n\n\"Look,\" he said to his mother, holding up his chin, \"what a rash my\ncollar's made under my chin!\"\n\nJust at the junction of chin and throat was a big red inflammation.\n\n\"It ought not to do that,\" said his mother. \"Here, put a bit of this\nsoothing ointment on. You should wear different collars.\"\n\nHe went away on Sunday midnight, seeming better and more solid for his\ntwo days at home.\n\nOn Tuesday morning came a telegram from London that he was ill. Mrs.\nMorel got off her knees from washing the floor, read the telegram,\ncalled a neighbour, went to her landlady and borrowed a sovereign, put\non her things, and set off. She hurried to Keston, caught an express for\nLondon in Nottingham. She had to wait in Nottingham nearly an hour. A\nsmall figure in her black bonnet, she was anxiously asking the porters\nif they knew how to get to Elmers End. The journey was three hours. She\nsat in her corner in a kind of stupor, never moving. At King's Cross\nstill no one could tell her how to get to Elmers End. Carrying her\nstring bag, that contained her nightdress, a comb and brush, she went\nfrom person to person. At last they sent her underground to Cannon\nStreet.\n\nIt was six o'clock when she arrived at William's lodging. The blinds\nwere not down.\n\n\"How is he?\" she asked.\n\n\"No better,\" said the landlady.\n\nShe followed the woman upstairs. William lay on the bed, with bloodshot\neyes, his face rather discoloured. The clothes were tossed about, there\nwas no fire in the room, a glass of milk stood on the stand at his\nbedside. No one had been with him.\n\n\"Why, my son!\" said the mother bravely.\n\nHe did not answer. He looked at her, but did not see her. Then he began\nto say, in a dull voice, as if repeating a letter from dictation: \"Owing\nto a leakage in the hold of this vessel, the sugar had set, and become\nconverted into rock. It needed hacking--\"\n\nHe was quite unconscious. It had been his business to examine some such\ncargo of sugar in the Port of London.\n\n\"How long has he been like this?\" the mother asked the landlady.\n\n\"He got home at six o'clock on Monday morning, and he seemed to sleep\nall day; then in the night we heard him talking, and this morning he\nasked for you. So I wired, and we fetched the doctor.\"\n\n\"Will you have a fire made?\"\n\nMrs. Morel tried to soothe her son, to keep him still.\n\nThe doctor came. It was pneumonia, and, he said, a peculiar erysipelas,\nwhich had started under the chin where the collar chafed, and was\nspreading over the face. He hoped it would not get to the brain.\n\nMrs. Morel settled down to nurse. She prayed for William, prayed that he\nwould recognise her. But the young man's face grew more discoloured.\nIn the night she struggled with him. He raved, and raved, and would not\ncome to consciousness. At two o'clock, in a dreadful paroxysm, he died.\n\nMrs. Morel sat perfectly still for an hour in the lodging bedroom; then\nshe roused the household.\n\nAt six o'clock, with the aid of the charwoman, she laid him out; then\nshe went round the dreary London village to the registrar and the\ndoctor.\n\nAt nine o'clock to the cottage on Scargill Street came another wire:\n\n\"William died last night. Let father come, bring money.\"\n\nAnnie, Paul, and Arthur were at home; Mr. Morel was gone to work. The\nthree children said not a word. Annie began to whimper with fear; Paul\nset off for his father.\n\nIt was a beautiful day. At Brinsley pit the white steam melted slowly in\nthe sunshine of a soft blue sky; the wheels of the headstocks twinkled\nhigh up; the screen, shuffling its coal into the trucks, made a busy\nnoise.\n\n\"I want my father; he's got to go to London,\" said the boy to the first\nman he met on the bank.\n\n\"Tha wants Walter Morel? Go in theer an' tell Joe Ward.\"\n\nPaul went into the little top office.\n\n\"I want my father; he's got to go to London.\"\n\n\"Thy feyther? Is he down? What's his name?\"\n\n\"Mr. Morel.\"\n\n\"What, Walter? Is owt amiss?\"\n\n\"He's got to go to London.\"\n\nThe man went to the telephone and rang up the bottom office.\n\n\"Walter Morel's wanted, number 42, Hard. Summat's amiss; there's his lad\nhere.\"\n\nThen he turned round to Paul.\n\n\"He'll be up in a few minutes,\" he said.\n\nPaul wandered out to the pit-top. He watched the chair come up, with its\nwagon of coal. The great iron cage sank back on its rest, a full carfle\nwas hauled off, an empty tram run on to the chair, a bell ting'ed\nsomewhere, the chair heaved, then dropped like a stone.\n\nPaul did not realise William was dead; it was impossible, with such\na bustle going on. The puller-off swung the small truck on to the\nturn-table, another man ran with it along the bank down the curving\nlines.\n\n\"And William is dead, and my mother's in London, and what will she be\ndoing?\" the boy asked himself, as if it were a conundrum.\n\nHe watched chair after chair come up, and still no father. At last,\nstanding beside a wagon, a man's form! the chair sank on its rests,\nMorel stepped off. He was slightly lame from an accident.\n\n\"Is it thee, Paul? Is 'e worse?\"\n\n\"You've got to go to London.\"\n\nThe two walked off the pit-bank, where men were watching curiously. As\nthey came out and went along the railway, with the sunny autumn field on\none side and a wall of trucks on the other, Morel said in a frightened\nvoice:\n\n\"'E's niver gone, child?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"When wor't?\"\n\n\"Last night. We had a telegram from my mother.\"\n\nMorel walked on a few strides, then leaned up against a truck-side,\nhis hand over his eyes. He was not crying. Paul stood looking round,\nwaiting. On the weighing machine a truck trundled slowly. Paul saw\neverything, except his father leaning against the truck as if he were\ntired.\n\nMorel had only once before been to London. He set off, scared and\npeaked, to help his wife. That was on Tuesday. The children were left\nalone in the house. Paul went to work, Arthur went to school, and Annie\nhad in a friend to be with her.\n\nOn Saturday night, as Paul was turning the corner, coming home from\nKeston, he saw his mother and father, who had come to Sethley Bridge\nStation. They were walking in silence in the dark, tired, straggling\napart. The boy waited.\n\n\"Mother!\" he said, in the darkness.\n\nMrs. Morel's small figure seemed not to observe. He spoke again.\n\n\"Paul!\" she said, uninterestedly.\n\nShe let him kiss her, but she seemed unaware of him.\n\nIn the house she was the same--small, white, and mute. She noticed\nnothing, she said nothing, only:\n\n\"The coffin will be here to-night, Walter. You'd better see about some\nhelp.\" Then, turning to the children: \"We're bringing him home.\"\n\nThen she relapsed into the same mute looking into space, her hands\nfolded on her lap. Paul, looking at her, felt he could not breathe. The\nhouse was dead silent.\n\n\"I went to work, mother,\" he said plaintively.\n\n\"Did you?\" she answered, dully.\n\nAfter half an hour Morel, troubled and bewildered, came in again.\n\n\"Wheer s'll we ha'e him when he DOES come?\" he asked his wife.\n\n\"In the front-room.\"\n\n\"Then I'd better shift th' table?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"An' ha'e him across th' chairs?\"\n\n\"You know there--Yes, I suppose so.\"\n\nMorel and Paul went, with a candle, into the parlour. There was no gas\nthere.\n\n### Summary:"}

He doesn't seem to have many belongings in this\nworld.\"\n\n\"Baxter Dawes!\" Paul exclaimed.\n\n\"That's the man--has been a fine fellow, physically, I should think.\nBeen in a bit of a mess lately. You know him?\"\n\n\"He used to work at the place where I am.\"\n\n\"Did he? Do you know anything about him? He's just sulking, or he'd be a\nlot better than he is by now.\"\n\n\"I don't know anything of his home circumstances, except that he's\nseparated from his wife and has been a bit down, I believe. But tell him\nabout me, will you? Tell him I'll come and see him.\"\n\nThe next time Morel saw the doctor he said:\n\n\"And what about Dawes?\"\n\n\"I said to him,\" answered the other, \"'Do you know a man from Nottingham\nnamed Morel?' and he looked at me as if he'd jump at my throat. So I\nsaid: 'I see you know the name; it's Paul Morel.' Then I told him about\nyour saying you would go and see him. 'What does he want?' he said, as\nif you were a policeman.\"\n\n\"And did he say he would see me?\" asked Paul.\n\n\"He wouldn't say anything--good, bad or indifferent,\" replied the\ndoctor.\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"That's what I want to know. There he lies and sulks, day in, day out.\nCan't get a word of information out of him.\"\n\n\"Do you think I might go?\" asked Paul.\n\n\"You might.\"\n\nThere was a feeling of connection between the rival men, more than ever\nsince they had fought. In a way Morel felt guilty towards the other, and\nmore or less responsible. And being in such a state of soul himself,\nhe felt an almost painful nearness to Dawes, who was suffering and\ndespairing, too. Besides, they had met in a naked extremity of hate, and\nit was a bond. At any rate, the elemental man in each had met.\n\nHe went down to the isolation hospital, with Dr. Ansell's card. This\nsister, a healthy young Irishwoman, led him down the ward.\n\n\"A visitor to see you, Jim Crow,\" she said.\n\nDawes turned over suddenly with a startled grunt.\n\n\"Eh?\"\n\n\"Caw!\" she mocked. \"He can only say 'Caw!' I have brought you a\ngentleman to see you. Now say 'Thank you,' and show some manners.\"\n\nDawes looked swiftly with his dark, startled eyes beyond the sister at\nPaul. His look was full of fear, mistrust, hate, and misery. Morel met\nthe swift, dark eyes, and hesitated. The two men were afraid of the\nnaked selves they had been.\n\n\"Dr. Ansell told me you were here,\" said Morel, holding out his hand.\n\nDawes mechanically shook hands.\n\n\"So I thought I'd come in,\" continued Paul.\n\nThere was no answer. Dawes lay staring at the opposite wall.\n\n\"Say 'Caw!\"' mocked the nurse. \"Say 'Caw!' Jim Crow.\"\n\n\"He is getting on all right?\" said Paul to her.\n\n\"Oh yes! He lies and imagines he's going to die,\" said the nurse, \"and\nit frightens every word out of his mouth.\"\n\n\"And you MUST have somebody to talk to,\" laughed Morel.\n\n\"That's it!\" laughed the nurse. \"Only two old men and a boy who always\ncries. It is hard lines! Here am I dying to hear Jim Crow's voice, and\nnothing but an odd 'Caw!' will he give!\"\n\n\"So rough on you!\" said Morel.\n\n\"Isn't it?\" said the nurse.\n\n\"I suppose I am a godsend,\" he laughed.\n\n\"Oh, dropped straight from heaven!\" laughed the nurse.\n\nPresently she left the two men alone. Dawes was thinner, and handsome\nagain, but life seemed low in him. As the doctor said, he was lying\nsulking, and would not move forward towards convalescence. He seemed to\ngrudge every beat of his heart.\n\n\"Have you had a bad time?\" asked Paul.\n\nSuddenly again Dawes looked at him.\n\n\"What are you doing in Sheffield?\" he asked.\n\n\"My mother was taken ill at my sister's in Thurston Street. What are you\ndoing here?\"\n\nThere was no answer.\n\n\"How long have you been in?\" Morel asked.\n\n\"I couldn't say for sure,\" Dawes answered grudgingly.\n\nHe lay staring across at the wall opposite, as if trying to believe\nMorel was not there. Paul felt his heart go hard and angry.\n\n\"Dr. Ansell told me you were here,\" he said coldly.\n\nThe other man did not answer.\n\n\"Typhoid's pretty bad, I know,\" Morel persisted.\n\nSuddenly Dawes said:\n\n\"What did you come for?\"\n\n\"Because Dr. Ansell said you didn't know anybody here. Do you?\"\n\n\"I know nobody nowhere,\" said Dawes.\n\n\"Well,\" said Paul, \"it's because you don't choose to, then.\"\n\nThere was another silence.\n\n\"We s'll be taking my mother home as soon as we can,\" said Paul.\n\n\"What's a-matter with her?\" asked Dawes, with a sick man's interest in\nillness.\n\n\"She's got a cancer.\"\n\nThere was another silence.\n\n\"But we want to get her home,\" said Paul. \"We s'll have to get a\nmotor-car.\"\n\nDawes lay thinking.\n\n\"Why don't you ask Thomas Jordan to lend you his?\" said Dawes.\n\n\"It's not big enough,\" Morel answered.\n\nDawes blinked his dark eyes as he lay thinking.\n\n\"Then ask Jack Pilkington; he'd lend it you. You know him.\"\n\n\"I think I s'll hire one,\" said Paul.\n\n\"You're a fool if you do,\" said Dawes.\n\nThe sick man was gaunt and handsome again. Paul was sorry for him\nbecause his eyes looked so tired.\n\n\"Did you get a job here?\" he asked.\n\n\"I was only here a day or two before I was taken bad,\" Dawes replied.\n\n\"You want to get in a convalescent home,\" said Paul.\n\nThe other's face clouded again.\n\n\"I'm goin' in no convalescent home,\" he said.\n\n\"My father's been in the one at Seathorpe, an' he liked it. Dr. Ansell\nwould get you a recommend.\"\n\nDawes lay thinking. It was evident he dared not face the world again.\n\n\"The seaside would be all right just now,\" Morel said. \"Sun on those\nsandhills, and the waves not far out.\"\n\nThe other did not answer.\n\n\"By Gad!\" Paul concluded, too miserable to bother much; \"it's all right\nwhen you know you're going to walk again, and swim!\"\n\nDawes glanced at him quickly. The man's dark eyes were afraid to meet\nany other eyes in the world. But the real misery and helplessness in\nPaul's tone gave him a feeling of relief.\n\n\"Is she far gone?\" he asked.\n\n\"She's going like wax,\" Paul answered; \"but cheerful--lively!\"\n\nHe bit his lip. After a minute he rose.\n\n\"Well, I'll be going,\" he said. \"I'll leave you this half-crown.\"\n\n\"I don't want it,\" Dawes muttered.\n\nMorel did not answer, but left the coin on the table.\n\n\"Well,\" he said, \"I'll try and run in when I'm back in Sheffield. Happen\nyou might like to see my brother-in-law? He works in Pyecrofts.\"\n\n\"I don't know him,\" said Dawes.\n\n\"He's all right. Should I tell him to come? He might bring you some\npapers to look at.\"\n\nThe other man did not answer. Paul went. The strong emotion that Dawes\naroused in him, repressed, made him shiver.\n\nHe did not tell his mother, but next day he spoke to Clara about this\ninterview. It was in the dinner-hour. The two did not often go out\ntogether now, but this day he asked her to go with him to the Castle\ngrounds. There they sat while the scarlet geraniums and the yellow\ncalceolarias blazed in the sunlight. She was now always rather\nprotective, and rather resentful towards him.\n\n\"Did you know Baxter was in Sheffield Hospital with typhoid?\" he asked.\n\nShe looked at him with startled grey eyes, and her face went pale.\n\n\"No,\" she said, frightened.\n\n\"He's getting better. I went to see him yesterday--the doctor told me.\"\n\nClara seemed stricken by the news.\n\n\"Is he very bad?\" she asked guiltily.\n\n\"He has been. He's mending now.\"\n\n\"What did he say to you?\"\n\n\"Oh, nothing! He seems to be sulking.\"\n\nThere was a distance between the two of them. He gave her more\ninformation.\n\nShe went about shut up and silent. The next time they took a walk\ntogether, she disengaged herself from his arm, and walked at a distance\nfrom him. He was wanting her comfort badly.\n\n\"Won't you be nice with me?\" he asked.\n\nShe did not answer.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" he said, putting his arm across her shoulder.\n\n\"Don't!\" she said, disengaging herself.\n\nHe left her alone, and returned to his own brooding.\n\n\"Is it Baxter that upsets you?\" he asked at length.\n\n\"I HAVE been VILE to him!\" she said.\n\n\"I've said many a time you haven't treated him well,\" he replied.\n\nAnd there was a hostility between them. Each pursued his own train of\nthought.\n\n\"I've treated him--no, I've treated him badly,\" she said. \"And now you\ntreat ME badly. It serves me right.\"\n\n\"How do I treat you badly?\" he said.\n\n\"It serves me right,\" she repeated. \"I never considered him worth\nhaving, and now you don't consider ME. But it serves me right. He loved\nme a thousand times better than you ever did.\"\n\n\"He didn't!\" protested Paul.\n\n\"He did! At any rate, he did respect me, and that's what you don't do.\"\n\n\"It looked as if he respected you!\" he said.\n\n\"He did! And I MADE him horrid--I know I did! You've taught me that. And\nhe loved me a thousand times better than ever you do.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Paul.\n\nHe only wanted to be left alone now. He had his own trouble, which was\nalmost too much to bear. Clara only tormented him and made him tired. He\nwas not sorry when he left her.\n\nShe went on the first opportunity to Sheffield to see her husband. The\nmeeting was not a success. But she left him roses and fruit and money.\nShe wanted to make restitution. It was not that she loved him. As she\nlooked at him lying there her heart did not warm with love. Only she\nwanted to humble herself to him, to kneel before him. She wanted now to\nbe self-sacrificial. After all, she had failed to make Morel really\nlove her. She was morally frightened. She wanted to do penance. So she\nkneeled to Dawes, and it gave him a subtle pleasure. But the distance\nbetween them was still very great--too great. It frightened the man. It\nalmost pleased the woman. She liked to feel she was serving him across\nan insuperable distance. She was proud now.\n\nMorel went to see Dawes once or twice. There was a sort of friendship\nbetween the two men, who were all the while deadly rivals. But they\nnever mentioned the woman who was between them.\n\nMrs. Morel got gradually worse. At first they used to carry her\ndownstairs, sometimes even into the garden. She sat propped in her\nchair, smiling, and so pretty. The gold wedding-ring shone on her\nwhite hand; her hair was carefully brushed. And she watched the tangled\nsunflowers dying, the chrysanthemums coming out, and the dahlias.\n\nPaul and she were afraid of each other. He knew, and she knew, that she\nwas dying. But they kept up a pretence of cheerfulness. Every morning,\nwhen he got up, he went into her room in his pyjamas.\n\n\"Did you sleep, my dear?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" she answered.\n\n\"Not very well?\"\n\n\"Well, yes!\"\n\nThen he knew she had lain awake. He saw her hand under the bedclothes,\npressing the place on her side where the pain was.\n\n\"Has it been bad?\" he asked.\n\n\"No. It hurt a bit, but nothing to mention.\"\n\nAnd she sniffed in her old scornful way. As she lay she looked like a\ngirl. And all the while her blue eyes watched him. But there were the\ndark pain-circles beneath that made him ache again.\n\n\"It's a sunny day,\" he said.\n\n\"It's a beautiful day.\"\n\n\"Do you think you'll be carried down?\"\n\n\"I shall see.\"\n\nThen he went away to get her breakfast. All day long he was conscious of\nnothing but her. It was a long ache that made him feverish. Then, when\nhe got home in the early evening, he glanced through the kitchen window.\nShe was not there; she had not got up.\n\nHe ran straight upstairs and kissed her. He was almost afraid to ask:\n\n\"Didn't you get up, pigeon?\"\n\n\"No,\" she said, \"it was that morphia; it made me tired.\"\n\n\"I think he gives you too much,\" he said.\n\n\"I think he does,\" she answered.\n\nHe sat down by the bed, miserably. She had a way of curling and lying on\nher side, like a child. The grey and brown hair was loose over her ear.\n\n\"Doesn't it tickle you?\" he said, gently putting it back.\n\n\"It does,\" she replied.\n\nHis face was near hers. Her blue eyes smiled straight into his, like a\ngirl's--warm, laughing with tender love. It made him pant with terror,\nagony, and love.\n\n\"You want your hair doing in a plait,\" he said. \"Lie still.\"\n\nAnd going behind her, he carefully loosened her hair, brushed it out. It\nwas like fine long silk of brown and grey. Her head was snuggled between\nher shoulders. As he lightly brushed and plaited her hair, he bit his\nlip and felt dazed. It all seemed unreal, he could not understand it.\n\nAt night he often worked in her room, looking up from time to time. And\nso often he found her blue eyes fixed on him. And when their eyes met,\nshe smiled. He worked away again mechanically, producing good stuff\nwithout knowing what he was doing.\n\nSometimes he came in, very pale and still, with watchful, sudden eyes,\nlike a man who is drunk almost to death. They were both afraid of the\nveils that were ripping between them.\n\nThen she pretended to be better, chattered to him gaily, made a great\nfuss over some scraps of news. For they had both come to the condition\nwhen they had to make much of the trifles, lest they should give in to\nthe big thing, and their human independence would go smash. They were\nafraid, so they made light of things and were gay.\n\nSometimes as she lay he knew she was thinking of the past. Her mouth\ngradually shut hard in a line. She was holding herself rigid, so that\nshe might die without ever uttering the great cry that was tearing from\nher. He never forgot that hard, utterly lonely and stubborn clenching\nof her mouth, which persisted for weeks. Sometimes, when it was lighter,\nshe talked about her husband. Now she hated him. She did not forgive\nhim. She could not bear him to be in the room. And a few things, the\nthings that had been most bitter to her, came up again so strongly that\nthey broke from her, and she told her son.\n\nHe felt as if his life were being destroyed, piece by piece, within him.\nOften the tears came suddenly. He ran to the station, the tear-drops\nfalling on the pavement. Often he could not go on with his work. The\npen stopped writing. He sat staring, quite unconscious. And when he came\nround again he felt sick, and trembled in his limbs. He never questioned\nwhat it was. His mind did not try to analyse or understand. He merely\nsubmitted, and kept his eyes shut; let the thing go over him.\n\nHis mother did the same. She thought of the pain, of the morphia, of the\nnext day; hardly ever of the death. That was coming, she knew. She had\nto submit to it. But she would never entreat it or make friends with\nit. Blind, with her face shut hard and blind, she was pushed towards the\ndoor. The days passed, the weeks, the months.\n\nSometimes, in the sunny afternoons, she seemed almost happy.\n\n\"I try to think of the nice times--when we went to Mablethorpe, and\nRobin Hood's Bay, and Shanklin,\" she said. \"After all, not everybody has\nseen those beautiful places. And wasn't it beautiful! I try to think of\nthat, not of the other things.\"\n\nThen, again, for a whole evening she spoke not a word; neither did he.\nThey were together, rigid, stubborn, silent. He went into his room\nat last to go to bed, and leaned against the doorway as if paralysed,\nunable to go any farther. His consciousness went. A furious storm, he\nknew not what, seemed to ravage inside him. He stood leaning there,\nsubmitting, never questioning.\n\nIn the morning they were both normal again, though her face was grey\nwith the morphia, and her body felt like ash. But they were bright\nagain, nevertheless. Often, especially if Annie or Arthur were at home,\nhe neglected her. He did not see much of Clara. Usually he was with\nmen. He was quick and active and lively; but when his friends saw him\ngo white to the gills, his eyes dark and glittering, they had a certain\nmistrust of him. Sometimes he went to Clara, but she was almost cold to\nhim.\n\n\"Take me!\" he said simply.\n\nOccasionally she would. But she was afraid. When he had her then,\nthere was something in it that made her shrink away from him--something\nunnatural. She grew to dread him. He was so quiet, yet so strange. She\nwas afraid of the man who was not there with her, whom she could feel\nbehind this make-belief lover; somebody sinister, that filled her with\nhorror. She began to have a kind of horror of him. It was almost as if\nhe were a criminal. He wanted her--he had her--and it made her feel as\nif death itself had her in its grip. She lay in horror. There was no\nman there loving her. She almost hated him. Then came little bouts of\ntenderness. But she dared not pity him.\n\nDawes had come to Colonel Seely's Home near Nottingham. There Paul\nvisited him sometimes, Clara very occasionally. Between the two men\nthe friendship developed peculiarly. Dawes, who mended very slowly and\nseemed very feeble, seemed to leave himself in the hands of Morel.\n\nIn the beginning of November Clara reminded Paul that it was her\nbirthday.\n\n\"I'd nearly forgotten,\" he said.\n\n\"I'd thought quite,\" she replied.\n\n\"No. Shall we go to the seaside for the week-end?\"\n\nThey went. It was cold and rather dismal. She waited for him to be warm\nand tender with her, instead of which he seemed hardly aware of her.\nHe sat in the railway-carriage, looking out, and was startled when she\nspoke to him. He was not definitely thinking. Things seemed as if they\ndid not exist. She went across to him.\n\n\"What is it dear?\" she asked.\n\n\"Nothing!\" he said. \"Don't those windmill sails look monotonous?\"\n\nHe sat holding her hand. He could not talk nor think. It was a comfort,\nhowever, to sit holding her hand. She was dissatisfied and miserable. He\nwas not with her; she was nothing.\n\nAnd in the evening they sat among the sandhills, looking at the black,\nheavy sea.\n\n\"She will never give in,\" he said quietly.\n\nClara's heart sank.\n\n\"No,\" she replied.\n\n\"There are different ways of dying. My father's people are frightened,\nand have to be hauled out of life into death like cattle into a\nslaughter-house, pulled by the neck; but my mother's people are pushed\nfrom behind, inch by inch. They are stubborn people, and won't die.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Clara.\n\n\"And she won't die. She can't. Mr. Renshaw, the parson, was in the other\nday. 'Think!' he said to her; 'you will have your mother and father, and\nyour sisters, and your son, in the Other Land.' And she said: 'I have\ndone without them for a long time, and CAN do without them now. It is\nthe living I want, not the dead.' She wants to live even now.\"\n\n\"Oh, how horrible!\" said Clara, too frightened to speak.\n\n\"And she looks at me, and she wants to stay with me,\" he went on\nmonotonously. \"She's got such a will, it seems as if she would never\ngo--never!\"\n\n\"Don't think of it!\" cried Clara.\n\n\"And she was religious--she is religious now--but it is no good. She\nsimply won't give in. And do you know, I said to her on Thursday:\n'Mother, if I had to die, I'd die. I'd WILL to die.' And she said to\nme, sharp: 'Do you think I haven't? Do you think you can die when you\nlike?'\"\n\nHis voice ceased. He did not cry, only went on speaking monotonously.\nClara wanted to run. She looked round. There was the black, re-echoing\nshore, the dark sky down on her. She got up terrified. She wanted to be\nwhere there was light, where there were other people. She wanted to be\naway from him. He sat with his head dropped, not moving a muscle.\n\n\"And I don't want her to eat,\" he said, \"and she knows it. When I ask\nher: 'Shall you have anything' she's almost afraid to say 'Yes.' 'I'll\nhave a cup of Benger's,' she says. 'It'll only keep your strength up,'\nI said to her. 'Yes'--and she almost cried--'but there's such a gnawing\nwhen I eat nothing, I can't bear it.' So I went and made her the food.\nIt's the cancer that gnaws like that at her. I wish she'd die!\"\n\n\"Come!\" said Clara roughly. \"I'm going.\"\n\nHe followed her down the darkness of the sands. He did not come to her.\nHe seemed scarcely aware of her existence. And she was afraid of him,\nand disliked him.\n\nIn the same acute daze they went back to Nottingham. He was always\nbusy, always doing something, always going from one to the other of his\nfriends.\n\nOn the Monday he went to see Baxter Dawes. Listless and pale, the man\nrose to greet the other, clinging to his chair as he held out his hand.\n\n\"You shouldn't get up,\" said Paul.\n\nDawes sat down heavily, eyeing Morel with a sort of suspicion.\n\n\"Don't you waste your time on me,\" he said, \"if you've owt better to\ndo.\"\n\n\"I wanted to come,\" said Paul. \"Here! I brought you some sweets.\"\n\nThe invalid put them aside.\n\n\"It's not been much of a week-end,\" said Morel.\n\n\"How's your mother?\" asked the other.\n\n\"Hardly any different.\"\n\n\"I thought she was perhaps worse, being as you didn't come on Sunday.\"\n\n\"I was at Skegness,\" said Paul. \"I wanted a change.\"\n\nThe other looked at him with dark eyes. He seemed to be waiting, not\nquite daring to ask, trusting to be told.\n\n\"I went with Clara,\" said Paul.\n\n\"I knew as much,\" said Dawes quietly.\n\n\"It was an old promise,\" said Paul.\n\n\"You have it your own way,\" said Dawes.\n\nThis was the first time Clara had been definitely mentioned between\nthem.\n\n\"Nay,\" said Morel slowly; \"she's tired of me.\"\n\nAgain Dawes looked at him.\n\n\"Since August she's been getting tired of me,\" Morel repeated.\n\nThe two men were very quiet together. Paul suggested a game of draughts.\nThey played in silence.\n\n\"I s'll go abroad when my mother's dead,\" said Paul.\n\n\"Abroad!\" repeated Dawes.\n\n\"Yes; I don't care what I do.\"\n\nThey continued the game. Dawes was winning.\n\n\"I s'll have to begin a new start of some sort,\" said Paul; \"and you as\nwell, I suppose.\"\n\nHe took one of Dawes's pieces.\n\n\"I dunno where,\" said the other.\n\n\"Things have to happen,\" Morel said. \"It's no good doing anything--at\nleast--no, I don't know. Give me some toffee.\"\n\nThe two men ate sweets, and began another game of draughts.\n\n\"What made that scar on your mouth?\" asked Dawes.\n\nPaul put his hand hastily to his lips, and looked over the garden.\n\n\"I had a bicycle accident,\" he said.\n\nDawes's hand trembled as he moved the piece.\n\n\"You shouldn't ha' laughed at me,\" he said, very low.\n\n\"When?\"\n\n\"That night on Woodborough Road, when you and her passed me--you with\nyour hand on her shoulder.\"\n\n\"I never laughed at you,\" said Paul.\n\nDawes kept his fingers on the draught-piece.\n\n\"I never knew you were there till the very second when you passed,\" said\nMorel.\n\n\"It was that as did me,\" Dawes said, very low.\n\nPaul took another sweet.\n\n\"I never laughed,\" he said, \"except as I'm always laughing.\"\n\nThey finished the game.\n\nThat night Morel walked home from Nottingham, in order to have something\nto do. The furnaces flared in a red blotch over Bulwell; the black\nclouds were like a low ceiling. As he went along the ten miles of\nhighroad, he felt as if he were walking out of life, between the black\nlevels of the sky and the earth. But at the end was only the sick-room.\nIf he walked and walked for ever, there was only that place to come to.\n\nHe was not tired when he got near home, or He did not know it. Across\nthe field he could see the red firelight leaping in her bedroom window.\n\n\"When she's dead,\" he said to himself, \"that fire will go out.\"\n\nHe took off his boots quietly and crept upstairs. His mothers door was\nwide open, because she slept alone still. The red firelight dashed its\nglow on the landing. Soft as a shadow, he peeped in her doorway.\n\n\"Paul!\" she murmured.\n\nHis heart seemed to break again. He went in and sat by the bed.\n\n\"How late you are!\" she murmured.\n\n\"Not very,\" he said.\n\n\"Why, what time is it?\" The murmur came plaintive and helpless.\n\n\"It's only just gone eleven.\"\n\nThat was not true; it was nearly one o'clock.\n\n\"Oh!\" she said; \"I thought it was later.\"\n\nAnd he knew the unutterable misery of her nights that would not go.\n\n\"Can't you sleep, my pigeon?\" he said.\n\n\"No, I can't,\" she wailed.\n\n\"Never mind, Little!\" He said crooning. \"Never mind, my love. I'll stop\nwith you half an hour, my pigeon; then perhaps it will be better.\"\n\nAnd he sat by the bedside, slowly, rhythmically stroking her brows\nwith his finger-tips, stroking her eyes shut, soothing her, holding her\nfingers in his free hand. They could hear the sleepers' breathing in the\nother rooms.\n\n\"Now go to bed,\" she murmured, lying quite still under his fingers and\nhis love.\n\n\"Will you sleep?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes, I think so.\"\n\n\"You feel better, my Little, don't you?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said, like a fretful, half-soothed child.\n\nStill the days and the weeks went by. He hardly ever went to see Clara\nnow. But he wandered restlessly from one person to another for some\nhelp, and there was none anywhere. Miriam had written to him tenderly.\nHe went to see her. Her heart was very sore when she saw him, white,\ngaunt, with his eyes dark and bewildered. Her pity came up, hurting her\ntill she could not bear it.\n\n\"How is she?\" she asked.\n\n\"The same--the same!\" he said. \"The doctor says she can't last, but I\nknow she will. She'll be here at Christmas.\"\n\nMiriam shuddered. She drew him to her; she pressed him to her bosom; she\nkissed him and kissed him. He submitted, but it was torture. She could\nnot kiss his agony. That remained alone and apart. She kissed his face,\nand roused his blood, while his soul was apart writhing with the agony\nof death. And she kissed him and fingered his body, till at last,\nfeeling he would go mad, he got away from her. It was not what he wanted\njust then--not that. And she thought she had soothed him and done him\ngood.\n\nDecember came, and some snow. He stayed at home all the while now.\nThey could not afford a nurse. Annie came to look after her mother; the\nparish nurse, whom they loved, came in morning and evening. Paul shared\nthe nursing with Annie. Often, in the evenings, when friends were in the\nkitchen with them, they all laughed together and shook with laughter. It\nwas reaction. Paul was so comical, Annie was so quaint. The whole party\nlaughed till they cried, trying to subdue the sound. And Mrs. Morel,\nlying alone in the darkness heard them, and among her bitterness was a\nfeeling of relief.\n\nThen Paul would go upstairs gingerly, guiltily, to see if she had heard.\n\n\"Shall I give you some milk?\" he asked.\n\n\"A little,\" she replied plaintively.\n\nAnd he would put some water with it, so that it should not nourish her.\nYet he loved her more than his own life.\n\nShe had morphia every night, and her heart got fitful. Annie slept\nbeside her. Paul would go in in the early morning, when his sister\ngot up. His mother was wasted and almost ashen in the morning with the\nmorphia. Darker and darker grew her eyes, all pupil, with the torture.\nIn the mornings the weariness and ache were too much to bear. Yet she\ncould not--would not--weep, or even complain much.\n\n\"You slept a bit later this morning, little one,\" he would say to her.\n\n\"Did I?\" she answered, with fretful weariness.\n\n\"Yes; it's nearly eight o'clock.\"\n\nHe stood looking out of the window. The whole country was bleak and\npallid under the snow. Then he felt her pulse. There was a strong stroke\nand a weak one, like a sound and its echo. That was supposed to betoken\nthe end. She let him feel her wrist, knowing what he wanted.\n\nSometimes they looked in each other's eyes. Then they almost seemed to\nmake an agreement. It was almost as if he were agreeing to die also.\nBut she did not consent to die; she would not. Her body was wasted to a\nfragment of ash. Her eyes were dark and full of torture.\n\n\"Can't you give her something to put an end to it?\" he asked the doctor\nat last.\n\nBut the doctor shook his head.\n\n\"She can't last many days now, Mr. Morel,\" he said.\n\nPaul went indoors.\n\n\"I can't bear it much longer; we shall all go mad,\" said Annie.\n\nThe two sat down to breakfast.\n\n\"Go and sit with her while we have breakfast, Minnie,\" said Annie. But\nthe girl was frightened.\n\nPaul went through the country, through the woods, over the snow. He saw\nthe marks of rabbits and birds in the white snow. He wandered miles\nand miles. A smoky red sunset came on slowly, painfully, lingering. He\nthought she would die that day. There was a donkey that came up to him\nover the snow by the wood's edge, and put its head against him, and\nwalked with him alongside. He put his arms round the donkey's neck, and\nstroked his cheeks against his ears.\n\nHis mother, silent, was still alive, with her hard mouth gripped grimly,\nher eyes of dark torture only living.\n\nIt was nearing Christmas; there was more snow. Annie and he felt as if\nthey could go on no more. Still her dark eyes were alive. Morel, silent\nand frightened, obliterated himself. Sometimes he would go into the\nsick-room and look at her. Then he backed out, bewildered.\n\nShe kept her hold on life still. The miners had been out on strike, and\nreturned a fortnight or so before Christmas. Minnie went upstairs with\nthe feeding-cup. It was two days after the men had been in.\n\n\"Have the men been saying their hands are sore, Minnie?\" she asked,\nin the faint, querulous voice that would not give in. Minnie stood\nsurprised.\n\n\"Not as I know of, Mrs. Morel,\" she answered.\n\n\"But I'll bet they are sore,\" said the dying woman, as she moved her\nhead with a sigh of weariness. \"But, at any rate, there'll be something\nto buy in with this week.\"\n\nNot a thing did she let slip.\n\n\"Your father's pit things will want well airing, Annie,\" she said, when\nthe men were going back to work.\n\n\"Don't you bother about that, my dear,\" said Annie.\n\nOne night Annie and Paul were alone. Nurse was upstairs.\n\n\"She'll live over Christmas,\" said Annie. They were both full of horror.\n\"She won't,\" he replied grimly. \"I s'll give her morphia.\"\n\n\"Which?\" said Annie.\n\n\"All that came from Sheffield,\" said Paul.\n\n\"Ay--do!\" said Annie.\n\nThe next day he was painting in the bedroom. She seemed to be asleep.\nHe stepped softly backwards and forwards at his painting. Suddenly her\nsmall voice wailed:\n\n\"Don't walk about, Paul.\"\n\nHe looked round. Her eyes, like dark bubbles in her face, were looking\nat him.\n\n\"No, my dear,\" he said gently. Another fibre seemed to snap in his\nheart.\n\nThat evening he got all the morphia pills there were, and took them\ndownstairs. Carefully he crushed them to powder.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" said Annie.\n\n\"I s'll put 'em in her night milk.\"\n\nThen they both laughed together like two conspiring children. On top of\nall their horror flicked this little sanity.\n\nNurse did not come that night to settle Mrs. Morel down. Paul went up\nwith the hot milk in a feeding-cup. It was nine o'clock.\n\nShe was reared up in bed, and he put the feeding-cup between her lips\nthat he would have died to save from any hurt. She took a sip, then put\nthe spout of the cup away and looked at him with her dark, wondering\neyes. He looked at her.\n\n\"Oh, it IS bitter, Paul!\" she said, making a little grimace.\n\n\"It's a new sleeping draught the doctor gave me for you,\" he said. \"He\nthought it would leave you in such a state in the morning.\"\n\n\"And I hope it won't,\" she said, like a child.\n\nShe drank some more of the milk.\n\n\"But it IS horrid!\" she said.\n\nHe saw her frail fingers over the cup, her lips making a little move.\n\n\"I know--I tasted it,\" he said. \"But I'll give you some clean milk\nafterwards.\"\n\n\"I think so,\" she said, and she went on with the draught. She was\nobedient to him like a child. He wondered if she knew. He saw her\npoor wasted throat moving as she drank with difficulty. Then he ran\ndownstairs for more milk. There were no grains in the bottom of the cup.\n\n\"Has she had it?\" whispered Annie.\n\n\"Yes--and she said it was bitter.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" laughed Annie, putting her under lip between her teeth.\n\n\"And I told her it was a new draught. Where's that milk?\"\n\nThey both went upstairs.\n\n\"I wonder why nurse didn't come to settle me down?\" complained the\nmother, like a child, wistfully.\n\n\"She said she was going to a concert, my love,\" replied Annie.\n\n\"Did she?\"\n\nThey were silent a minute. Mrs. Morel gulped the little clean milk.\n\n\"Annie, that draught WAS horrid!\" she said plaintively.\n\n\"Was it, my love? Well, never mind.\"\n\nThe mother sighed again with weariness. Her pulse was very irregular.\n\n\"Let US settle you down,\" said Annie. \"Perhaps nurse will be so late.\"\n\n\"Ay,\" said the mother--\"try.\"\n\nThey turned the clothes back. Paul saw his mother like a girl curled up\nin her flannel nightdress. Quickly they made one half of the bed, moved\nher, made the other, straightened her nightgown over her small feet, and\ncovered her up.\n\n\"There,\" said Paul, stroking her softly. \"There!--now you'll sleep.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said. \"I didn't think you could do the bed so nicely,\" she\nadded, almost gaily. Then she curled up, with her cheek on her hand, her\nhead snugged between her shoulders. Paul put the long thin plait of grey\nhair over her shoulder and kissed her.\n\n\"You'll sleep, my love,\" he said.\n\n\"Yes,\" she answered trustfully. \"Good-night.\"\n\nThey put out the light, and it was still.\n\nMorel was in bed. Nurse did not come. Annie and Paul came to look at her\nat about eleven. She seemed to be sleeping as usual after her draught.\nHer mouth had come a bit open.\n\n\"Shall we sit up?\" said Paul.\n\n\"I s'll lie with her as I always do,\" said Annie. \"She might wake up.\"\n\n\"All right. And call me if you see any difference.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nThey lingered before the bedroom fire, feeling the night big and black\nand snowy outside, their two selves alone in the world. At last he went\ninto the next room and went to bed.\n\nHe slept almost immediately, but kept waking every now and again. Then\nhe went sound asleep. He started awake at Annie's whispered, \"Paul,\nPaul!\" He saw his sister in her white nightdress, with her long plait of\nhair down her back, standing in the darkness.\n\n\"Yes?\" he whispered, sitting up.\n\n\"Come and look at her.\"\n\nHe slipped out of bed. A bud of gas was burning in the sick chamber.\nHis mother lay with her cheek on her hand, curled up as she had gone\nto sleep. But her mouth had fallen open, and she breathed with great,\nhoarse breaths, like snoring, and there were long intervals between.\n\n\"She's going!\" he whispered.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Annie.\n\n\"How long has she been like it?\"\n\n\"I only just woke up.\"\n\nAnnie huddled into the dressing-gown, Paul wrapped himself in a brown\nblanket. It was three o'clock. He mended the fire. Then the two sat\nwaiting. The great, snoring breath was taken--held awhile--then given\nback. There was a space--a long space. Then they started. The great,\nsnoring breath was taken again. He bent close down and looked at her.\n\n\"Isn't it awful!\" whispered Annie.\n\nHe nodded. They sat down again helplessly. Again came the great, snoring\nbreath. Again they hung suspended. Again it was given back, long and\nharsh. The sound, so irregular, at such wide intervals, sounded through\nthe house. Morel, in his room, slept on. Paul and Annie sat crouched,\nhuddled, motionless. The great snoring sound began again--there was a\npainful pause while the breath was held--back came the rasping breath.\nMinute after minute passed. Paul looked at her again, bending low over\nher.\n\n\"She may last like this,\" he said.\n\nThey were both silent. He looked out of the window, and could faintly\ndiscern the snow on the garden.\n\n\"You go to my bed,\" he said to Annie. \"I'll sit up.\"\n\n\"No,\" she said, \"I'll stop with you.\"\n\n\"I'd rather you didn't,\" he said.\n\nAt last Annie crept out of the room, and he was alone. He hugged himself\nin his brown blanket, crouched in front of his mother, watching. She\nlooked dreadful, with the bottom jaw fallen back. He watched. Sometimes\nhe thought the great breath would never begin again. He could not bear\nit--the waiting. Then suddenly, startling him, came the great harsh\nsound. He mended the fire again, noiselessly. She must not be disturbed.\nThe minutes went by. The night was going, breath by breath. Each time\nthe sound came he felt it wring him, till at last he could not feel so\nmuch.\n\nHis father got up. Paul heard the miner drawing his stockings on,\nyawning. Then Morel, in shirt and stockings, entered.\n\n\"Hush!\" said Paul.\n\nMorel stood watching. Then he looked at his son, helplessly, and in\nhorror.\n\n\"Had I better stop a-whoam?\" he whispered.\n\n\"No. Go to work. She'll last through to-morrow.\"\n\n\"I don't think so.\"\n\n\"Yes. Go to work.\"\n\nThe miner looked at her again, in fear, and went obediently out of the\nroom. Paul saw the tape of his garters swinging against his legs.\n\nAfter another half-hour Paul went downstairs and drank a cup of tea,\nthen returned. Morel, dressed for the pit, came upstairs again.\n\n\"Am I to go?\" he said.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nAnd in a few minutes Paul heard his father's heavy steps go thudding\nover the deadening snow. Miners called in the streets as they\ntramped in gangs to work. The terrible, long-drawn breaths\ncontinued--heave--heave--heave; then a long pause--then--ah-h-h-h-h!\nas it came back. Far away over the snow sounded the hooters of the\nironworks. One after another they crowed and boomed, some small and far\naway, some near, the blowers of the collieries and the other works.\nThen there was silence. He mended the fire. The great breaths broke the\nsilence--she looked just the same. He put back the blind and peered out.\nStill it was dark. Perhaps there was a lighter tinge. Perhaps the snow\nwas bluer. He drew up the blind and got dressed. Then, shuddering, he\ndrank brandy from the bottle on the wash-stand. The snow WAS growing\nblue. He heard a cart clanking down the street. Yes, it was seven\no'clock, and it was coming a little bit light. He heard some people\ncalling. The world was waking. A grey, deathly dawn crept over the snow.\nYes, he could see the houses. He put out the gas. It seemed very dark.\nThe breathing came still, but he was almost used to it. He could see\nher. She was just the same. He wondered if he piled heavy clothes on top\nof her it would stop. He looked at her. That was not her--not her a bit.\nIf he piled the blanket and heavy coats on her--\n\nSuddenly the door opened, and Annie entered. She looked at him\nquestioningly.\n\n\"Just the same,\" he said calmly.\n\nThey whispered together a minute, then he went downstairs to get\nbreakfast. It was twenty to eight. Soon Annie came down.\n\n\"Isn't it awful! Doesn't she look awful!\" she whispered, dazed with\nhorror.\n\nHe nodded.\n\n\"If she looks like that!\" said Annie.\n\n\"Drink some tea,\" he said.\n\nThey went upstairs again. Soon the neighbours came with their frightened\nquestion:\n\n\"How is she?\"\n\nIt went on just the same. She lay with her cheek in her hand, her mouth\nfallen open, and the great, ghastly snores came and went.\n\nAt ten o'clock nurse came. She looked strange and woebegone.\n\n\"Nurse,\" cried Paul, \"she'll last like this for days?\"\n\n\"She can't, Mr. Morel,\" said nurse. \"She can't.\"\n\nThere was a silence.\n\n\"Isn't it dreadful!\" wailed the nurse. \"Who would have thought she could\nstand it? Go down now, Mr. Morel, go down.\"\n\nAt last, at about eleven o'clock, he went downstairs and sat in the\nneighbour's house. Annie was downstairs also. Nurse and Arthur were\nupstairs. Paul sat with his head in his hand. Suddenly Annie came flying\nacross the yard crying, half mad:\n\n\"Paul--Paul--she's gone!\"\n\nIn a second he was back in his own house and upstairs. She lay curled\nup and still, with her face on her hand, and nurse was wiping her mouth.\nThey all stood back. He kneeled down, and put his face to hers and his\narms round her:\n\n\"My love--my love--oh, my love!\" he whispered again and again. \"My\nlove--oh, my love!\"\n\nThen he heard the nurse behind him, crying, saying:\n\n\"She's better, Mr. Morel, she's better.\"\n\nWhen he took his face up from his warm, dead mother he went straight\ndownstairs and began blacking his boots.\n\nThere was a good deal to do, letters to write, and so on. The doctor\ncame and glanced at her, and sighed.\n\n\"Ay--poor thing!\" he said, then turned away. \"Well, call at the surgery\nabout six for the certificate.\"\n\nThe father came home from work at about four o'clock. He dragged\nsilently into the house and sat down. Minnie bustled to give him his\ndinner. Tired, he laid his black arms on the table. There were swede\nturnips for his dinner, which he liked. Paul wondered if he knew. It was\nsome time, and nobody had spoken. At last the son said:\n\n\"You noticed the blinds were down?\"\n\nMorel looked up.\n\n\"No,\" he said. \"Why--has she gone?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"When wor that?\"\n\n\"About twelve this morning.\"\n\n\"H'm!\"\n\nThe miner sat still for a moment, then began his dinner. It was as\nif nothing had happened. He ate his turnips in silence. Afterwards he\nwashed and went upstairs to dress. The door of her room was shut.\n\n\"Have you seen her?\" Annie asked of him when he came down.\n\n\"No,\" he said.\n\nIn a little while he went out. Annie went away, and Paul called on the\nundertaker, the clergyman, the doctor, the registrar. It was a long\nbusiness. He got back at nearly eight o'clock. The undertaker was coming\nsoon to measure for the coffin. The house was empty except for her. He\ntook a candle and went upstairs.\n\nThe room was cold, that had been warm for so long. Flowers, bottles,\nplates, all sick-room litter was taken away; everything was harsh and\naustere. She lay raised on the bed, the sweep of the sheet from the\nraised feet was like a clean curve of snow, so silent. She lay like a\nmaiden asleep. With his candle in his hand, he bent over her. She lay\nlike a girl asleep and dreaming of her love. The mouth was a little open\nas if wondering from the suffering, but her face was young, her brow\nclear and white as if life had never touched it. He looked again at the\neyebrows, at the small, winsome nose a bit on one side. She was young\nagain. Only the hair as it arched so beautifully from her temples was\nmixed with silver, and the two simple plaits that lay on her shoulders\nwere filigree of silver and brown. She would wake up. She would lift her\neyelids. She was with him still. He bent and kissed her passionately.\nBut there was coldness against his mouth. He bit his lips with horror.\nLooking at her, he felt he could never, never let her go. No! He stroked\nthe hair from her temples. That, too, was cold. He saw the mouth so dumb\nand wondering at the hurt. Then he crouched on the floor, whispering to\nher:\n\n\"Mother, mother!\"\n\nHe was still with her when the undertakers came, young men who had\nbeen to school with him. They touched her reverently, and in a quiet,\nbusinesslike fashion. They did not look at her. He watched jealously. He\nand Annie guarded her fiercely. They would not let anybody come to see\nher, and the neighbours were offended.\n\nAfter a while Paul went out of the house, and played cards at a\nfriend's. It was midnight when he got back. His father rose from the\ncouch as he entered, saying in a plaintive way:\n\n\"I thought tha wor niver comin', lad.\"\n\n\"I didn't think you'd sit up,\" said Paul.\n\nHis father looked so forlorn. Morel had been a man without fear--simply\nnothing frightened him. Paul realised with a start that he had been\nafraid to go to bed, alone in the house with his dead. He was sorry.\n\n\"I forgot you'd be alone, father,\" he said.\n\n\"Dost want owt to eat?\" asked Morel.\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Sithee--I made thee a drop o' hot milk. Get it down thee; it's cold\nenough for owt.\"\n\nPaul drank it.\n\nAfter a while Morel went to bed. He hurried past the closed door, and\nleft his own door open. Soon the son came upstairs also. He went in to\nkiss her good-night, as usual. It was cold and dark. He wished they had\nkept her fire burning. Still she dreamed her young dream. But she would\nbe cold.\n\n\"My dear!\" he whispered. \"My dear!\"\n\nAnd he did not kiss her, for fear she should be cold and strange to him.\nIt eased him she slept so beautifully. He shut her door softly, not to\nwake her, and went to bed.\n\nIn the morning Morel summoned his courage, hearing Annie downstairs and\nPaul coughing in the room across the landing. He opened her door, and\nwent into the darkened room. He saw the white uplifted form in the\ntwilight, but her he dared not see. Bewildered, too frightened to\npossess any of his faculties, he got out of the room again and left her.\nHe never looked at her again. He had not seen her for months, because he\nhad not dared to look. And she looked like his young wife again.\n\n\"Have you seen her?\" Annie asked of him sharply after breakfast.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said.\n\n\"And don't you think she looks nice?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nHe went out of the house soon after. And all the time he seemed to be\ncreeping aside to avoid it.\n\nPaul went about from place to place, doing the business of the death. He\nmet Clara in Nottingham, and they had tea together in a cafe, when they\nwere quite jolly again. She was infinitely relieved to find he did not\ntake it tragically.\n\nLater, when the relatives began to come for the funeral, the affair\nbecame public, and the children became social beings. They put\nthemselves aside. They buried her in a furious storm of rain and wind.\nThe wet clay glistened, all the white flowers were soaked. Annie\ngripped his arm and leaned forward. Down below she saw a dark corner\nof William's coffin. The oak box sank steadily. She was gone. The\nrain poured in the grave. The procession of black, with its umbrellas\nglistening, turned away. The cemetery was deserted under the drenching\ncold rain.\n\nPaul went home and busied himself supplying the guests with drinks.\nHis father sat in the kitchen with Mrs. Morel's relatives, \"superior\"\npeople, and wept, and said what a good lass she'd been, and how he'd\ntried to do everything he could for her--everything. He had striven\nall his life to do what he could for her, and he'd nothing to reproach\nhimself with. She was gone, but he'd done his best for her. He wiped his\neyes with his white handkerchief. He'd nothing to reproach himself for,\nhe repeated. All his life he'd done his best for her.\n\nAnd that was how he tried to dismiss her. He never thought of her\npersonally. Everything deep in him he denied. Paul hated his father\nfor sitting sentimentalising over her. He knew he would do it in\nthe public-houses. For the real tragedy went on in Morel in spite of\nhimself. Sometimes, later, he came down from his afternoon sleep, white\nand cowering.\n\n\"I HAVE been dreaming of thy mother,\" he said in a small voice.\n\n\"Have you, father? When I dream of her it's always just as she was when\nshe was well. I dream of her often, but it seems quite nice and natural,\nas if nothing had altered.\"\n\nBut Morel crouched in front of the fire in terror.\n\nThe weeks passed half-real, not much pain, not much of anything, perhaps\na little relief, mostly a _nuit blanche_. Paul went restless from place\nto place. For some months, since his mother had been worse, he had not\nmade love to Clara. She was, as it were, dumb to him, rather distant.\nDawes saw her very occasionally, but the two could not get an inch\nacross the great distance between them. The three of them were drifting\nforward.\n\nDawes mended very slowly. He was in the convalescent home at Skegness at\nChristmas, nearly well again. Paul went to the seaside for a few days.\nHis father was with Annie in Sheffield. Dawes came to Paul's lodgings.\nHis time in the home was up. The two men, between whom was such a big\nreserve, seemed faithful to each other. Dawes depended on Morel now. He\nknew Paul and Clara had practically separated.\n\nTwo days after Christmas Paul was to go back to Nottingham. The evening\nbefore he sat with Dawes smoking before the fire.\n\n\"You know Clara's coming down for the day to-morrow?\" he said.\n\nThe other man glanced at him.\n\n\"Yes, you told me,\" he replied.\n\nPaul drank the remainder of his glass of whisky.\n\n\"I told the landlady your wife was coming,\" he said.\n\n\"Did you?\" said Dawes, shrinking, but almost leaving himself in the\nother's hands. He got up rather stiffly, and reached for Morel's glass.\n\n\"Let me fill you up,\" he said.\n\nPaul jumped up.\n\n\"You sit still,\" he said.\n\nBut Dawes, with rather shaky hand, continued to mix the drink.\n\n\"Say when,\" he said.\n\n\"Thanks!\" replied the other. \"But you've no business to get up.\"\n\n\"It does me good, lad,\" replied Dawes. \"I begin to think I'm right\nagain, then.\"\n\n\"You are about right, you know.\"\n\n\"I am, certainly I am,\" said Dawes, nodding to him.\n\n\"And Len says he can get you on in Sheffield.\"\n\nDawes glanced at him again, with dark eyes that agreed with everything\nthe other would say, perhaps a trifle dominated by him.\n\n\"It's funny,\" said Paul, \"starting again. I feel in a lot bigger mess\nthan you.\"\n\n\"In what way, lad?\"\n\n\"I don't know. I don't know. It's as if I was in a tangled sort of hole,\nrather dark and dreary, and no road anywhere.\"\n\n\"I know--I understand it,\" Dawes said, nodding. \"But you'll find it'll\ncome all right.\"\n\nHe spoke caressingly.\n\n\"I suppose so,\" said Paul.\n\nDawes knocked his pipe in a hopeless fashion.\n\n\"You've not done for yourself like I have,\" he said.\n\nMorel saw the wrist and the white hand of the other man gripping the\nstem of the pipe and knocking out the ash, as if he had given up.\n\n\"How old are you?\" Paul asked.\n\n\"Thirty-nine,\" replied Dawes, glancing at him.\n\nThose brown eyes, full of the consciousness of failure, almost pleading\nfor reassurance, for someone to re-establish the man in himself, to warm\nhim, to set him up firm again, troubled Paul.\n\n\"You'll just be in your prime,\" said Morel. \"You don't look as if much\nlife had gone out of you.\"\n\nThe brown eyes of the other flashed suddenly.\n\n\"It hasn't,\" he said. \"The go is there.\"\n\nPaul looked up and laughed.\n\n\"We've both got plenty of life in us yet to make things fly,\" he said.\n\nThe eyes of the two men met. They exchanged one look. Having recognised\nthe stress of passion each in the other, they both drank their whisky.\n\n\"Yes, begod!\" said Dawes, breathless.\n\nThere was a pause.\n\n\"And I don't see,\" said Paul, \"why you shouldn't go on where you left\noff.\"\n\n\"What--\" said Dawes, suggestively.\n\n\"Yes--fit your old home together again.\"\n\nDawes hid his face and shook his head.\n\n\"Couldn't be done,\" he said, and looked up with an ironic smile.\n\n\"Why? Because you don't want?\"\n\n\"Perhaps.\"\n\nThey smoked in silence. Dawes showed his teeth as he bit his pipe stem.\n\n\"You mean you don't want her?\" asked Paul.\n\nDawes stared up at the picture with a caustic expression on his face.\n\n\"I hardly know,\" he said.\n\nThe smoke floated softly up.\n\n\"I believe she wants you,\" said Paul.\n\n\"Do you?\" replied the other, soft, satirical, abstract.\n\n\"Yes. She never really hitched on to me--you were always there in the\nbackground. That's why she wouldn't get a divorce.\"\n\nDawes continued to stare in a satirical fashion at the picture over the\nmantelpiece.\n\n\"That's how women are with me,\" said Paul. \"They want me like mad, but\nthey don't want to belong to me. And she BELONGED to you all the time. I\nknew.\"\n\nThe triumphant male came up in Dawes. He showed his teeth more\ndistinctly.\n\n\"Perhaps I was a fool,\" he said.\n\n\"You were a big fool,\" said Morel.\n\n\"But perhaps even THEN you were a bigger fool,\" said Dawes.\n\nThere was a touch of triumph and malice in it.\n\n\"Do you think so?\" said Paul.\n\nThey were silent for some time.\n\n\"At any rate, I'm clearing out to-morrow,\" said Morel.\n\n\"I see,\" answered Dawes.\n\nThen they did not talk any more. The instinct to murder each other had\nreturned. They almost avoided each other.\n\nThey shared the same bedroom. When they retired Dawes seemed abstract,\nthinking of something. He sat on the side of the bed in his shirt,\nlooking at his legs.\n\n\"Aren't you getting cold?\" asked Morel.\n\n\"I was lookin' at these legs,\" replied the other.\n\n\"What's up with 'em? They look all right,\" replied Paul, from his bed.\n\n\"They look all right.\n\n### Summary:"}
{"original_length": 17496, "trunc_length": 16384, "text": "\n\nSummarize the following text into a summary of less than 800 words.\n### Text:\n\n\nThe autumn dragged on monotonously. Miss Bart had received one or two\nnotes from Judy Trenor, reproaching her for not returning to Bellomont;\nbut she replied evasively, alleging the obligation to remain with her\naunt. In truth, however, she was fast wearying of her solitary existence\nwith Mrs. Peniston, and only the excitement of spending her\nnewly-acquired money lightened the dulness of the days.\n\nAll her life Lily had seen money go out as quickly as it came in, and\nwhatever theories she cultivated as to the prudence of setting aside a\npart of her gains, she had unhappily no saving vision of the risks of the\nopposite course. It was a keen satisfaction to feel that, for a few\nmonths at least, she would be independent of her friends' bounty, that\nshe could show herself abroad without wondering whether some penetrating\neye would detect in her dress the traces of Judy Trenor's refurbished\nsplendour. The fact that the money freed her temporarily from all minor\nobligations obscured her sense of the greater one it represented, and\nhaving never before known what it was to command so large a sum, she\nlingered delectably over the amusement of spending it.\n\nIt was on one of these occasions that, leaving a shop where she had spent\nan hour of deliberation over a dressing-case of the most complicated\nelegance, she ran across Miss Farish, who had entered the same\nestablishment with the modest object of having her watch repaired.  Lily\nwas feeling unusually virtuous. She had decided to defer the purchase of\nthe dressing-case till she should receive the bill for her new\nopera-cloak, and the resolve made her feel much richer than when she had\nentered the shop. In this mood of self-approval she had a sympathetic eye\nfor others, and she was struck by her friend's air of dejection.\n\nMiss Farish, it appeared, had just left the committee-meeting of a\nstruggling charity in which she was interested. The object of the\nassociation was to provide comfortable lodgings, with a reading-room and\nother modest distractions, where young women of the class employed in\ndown town offices might find a home when out of work, or in need of rest,\nand the first year's financial report showed so deplorably small a\nbalance that Miss Farish, who was convinced of the urgency of the work,\nfelt proportionately discouraged by the small amount of interest it\naroused. The other-regarding sentiments had not been cultivated in Lily,\nand she was often bored by the relation of her friend's philanthropic\nefforts, but today her quick dramatizing fancy seized on the contrast\nbetween her own situation and that represented by some of Gerty's\n\"cases.\" These were young girls, like herself; some perhaps pretty, some\nnot without a trace of her finer sensibilities. She pictured herself\nleading such a life as theirs--a life in which achievement seemed as\nsqualid as failure--and the vision made her shudder sympathetically. The\nprice of the dressing-case was still in her pocket; and drawing out her\nlittle gold purse she slipped a liberal fraction of the amount into Miss\nFarish's hand.\n\nThe satisfaction derived from this act was all that the most ardent\nmoralist could have desired. Lily felt a new interest in herself as a\nperson of charitable instincts: she had never before thought of doing\ngood with the wealth she had so often dreamed of possessing, but now her\nhorizon was enlarged by the vision of a prodigal philanthropy.  Moreover,\nby some obscure process of logic, she felt that her momentary burst of\ngenerosity had justified all previous extravagances, and excused any in\nwhich she might subsequently indulge. Miss Farish's surprise and\ngratitude confirmed this feeling, and Lily parted from her with a sense\nof self-esteem which she naturally mistook for the fruits of altruism.\n\nAbout this time she was farther cheered by an invitation to spend the\nThanksgiving week at a camp in the Adirondacks. The invitation was one\nwhich, a year earlier, would have provoked a less ready response, for the\nparty, though organized by Mrs. Fisher, was ostensibly given by a lady of\nobscure origin and indomitable social ambitions, whose acquaintance Lily\nhad hitherto avoided. Now, however, she was disposed to coincide with\nMrs. Fisher's view, that it didn't matter who gave the party, as long as\nthings were well done; and doing things well (under competent direction)\nwas Mrs. Wellington Bry's strong point. The lady (whose consort was known\nas \"Welly\" Bry on the Stock Exchange and in sporting circles) had already\nsacrificed one husband, and sundry minor considerations, to her\ndetermination to get on; and, having obtained a hold on Carry Fisher, she\nwas astute enough to perceive the wisdom of committing herself entirely\nto that lady's guidance. Everything, accordingly, was well done, for\nthere was no limit to Mrs. Fisher's prodigality when she was not spending\nher own money, and as she remarked to her pupil, a good cook was the best\nintroduction to society. If the company was not as select as the CUISINE,\nthe Welly Brys at least had the satisfaction of figuring for the first\ntime in the society columns in company with one or two noticeable names;\nand foremost among these was of course Miss Bart's. The young lady was\ntreated by her hosts with corresponding deference; and she was in the\nmood when such attentions are acceptable, whatever their source. Mrs.\nBry's admiration was a mirror in which Lily's self-complacency recovered\nits lost outline. No insect hangs its nest on threads as frail as those\nwhich will sustain the weight of human vanity; and the sense of being of\nimportance among the insignificant was enough to restore to Miss Bart the\ngratifying consciousness of power. If these people paid court to her it\nproved that she was still conspicuous in the world to which they aspired;\nand she was not above a certain enjoyment in dazzling them by her\nfineness, in developing their puzzled perception of her superiorities.\n\nPerhaps, however, her enjoyment proceeded more than she was aware from\nthe physical stimulus of the excursion, the challenge of crisp cold and\nhard exercise, the responsive thrill of her body to the influences of the\nwinter woods. She returned to town in a glow of rejuvenation, conscious\nof a clearer colour in her cheeks, a fresh elasticity in her muscles. The\nfuture seemed full of a vague promise, and all her apprehensions were\nswept out of sight on the buoyant current of her mood.\n\nA few days after her return to town she had the unpleasant surprise of a\nvisit from Mr. Rosedale. He came late, at the confidential hour when the\ntea-table still lingers by the fire in friendly expectancy; and his\nmanner showed a readiness to adapt itself to the intimacy of the occasion.\n\nLily, who had a vague sense of his being somehow connected with her lucky\nspeculations, tried to give him the welcome he expected; but there was\nsomething in the quality of his geniality which chilled her own, and she\nwas conscious of marking each step in their acquaintance by a fresh\nblunder.\n\nMr. Rosedale--making himself promptly at home in an adjoining easy-chair,\nand sipping his tea critically, with the comment: \"You ought to go to my\nman for something really good\"--appeared totally unconscious of the\nrepugnance which kept her in frozen erectness behind the urn. It was\nperhaps her very manner of holding herself aloof that appealed to his\ncollector's passion for the rare and unattainable. He gave, at any rate,\nno sign of resenting it and seemed prepared to supply in his own manner\nall the ease that was lacking in hers.\n\nHis object in calling was to ask her to go to the opera in his box on the\nopening night, and seeing her hesitate he said persuasively: \"Mrs. Fisher\nis coming, and I've secured a tremendous admirer of yours, who'll never\nforgive me if you don't accept.\"\n\nAs Lily's silence left him with this allusion on his hands, he added with\na confidential smile: \"Gus Trenor has promised to come to town on\npurpose. I fancy he'd go a good deal farther for the pleasure of seeing\nyou.\"\n\nMiss Bart felt an inward motion of annoyance: it was distasteful enough\nto hear her name coupled with Trenor's, and on Rosedale's lips the\nallusion was peculiarly unpleasant.\n\n\"The Trenors are my best friends--I think we should all go a long way to\nsee each other,\" she said, absorbing herself in the preparation of fresh\ntea.\n\nHer visitor's smile grew increasingly intimate. \"Well, I wasn't thinking\nof Mrs. Trenor at the moment--they say Gus doesn't always, you know.\"\nThen, dimly conscious that he had not struck the right note, he added,\nwith a well-meant effort at diversion: \"How's your luck been going in\nWall Street, by the way? I hear Gus pulled off a nice little pile for you\nlast month.\"\n\nLily put down the tea-caddy with an abrupt gesture. She felt that her\nhands were trembling, and clasped them on her knee to steady them; but\nher lip trembled too, and for a moment she was afraid the tremor might\ncommunicate itself to her voice. When she spoke, however, it was in a\ntone of perfect lightness.\n\n\"Ah, yes--I had a little bit of money to invest, and Mr. Trenor, who\nhelps me about such matters, advised my putting it in stocks instead of a\nmortgage, as my aunt's agent wanted me to do; and as it happened, I made\na lucky 'turn'--is that what you call it? For you make a great many\nyourself, I believe.\"\n\nShe was smiling back at him now, relaxing the tension of her attitude,\nand admitting him, by imperceptible gradations of glance and manner, a\nstep farther toward intimacy. The protective instinct always nerved her\nto successful dissimulation, and it was not the first time she had used\nher beauty to divert attention from an inconvenient topic.\n\nWhen Mr. Rosedale took leave, he carried with him, not only her\nacceptance of his invitation, but a general sense of having comported\nhimself in a way calculated to advance his cause. He had always believed\nhe had a light touch and a knowing way with women, and the prompt manner\nin which Miss Bart (as he would have phrased it) had \"come into line,\"\nconfirmed his confidence in his powers of handling this skittish sex. Her\nway of glossing over the transaction with Trenor he regarded at once as a\ntribute to his own acuteness, and a confirmation of his suspicions. The\ngirl was evidently nervous, and Mr. Rosedale, if he saw no other means of\nadvancing his acquaintance with her, was not above taking advantage of\nher nervousness.\n\nHe left Lily to a passion of disgust and fear. It seemed incredible that\nGus Trenor should have spoken of her to Rosedale.  With all his faults,\nTrenor had the safeguard of his traditions, and was the less likely to\noverstep them because they were so purely instinctive. But Lily recalled\nwith a pang that there were convivial moments when, as Judy had confided\nto her, Gus \"talked foolishly\": in one of these, no doubt, the fatal word\nhad slipped from him. As for Rosedale, she did not, after the first\nshock, greatly care what conclusions he had drawn.  Though usually adroit\nenough where her own interests were concerned, she made the mistake, not\nuncommon to persons in whom the social habits are instinctive, of\nsupposing that the inability to acquire them quickly implies a general\ndulness. Because a blue-bottle bangs irrationally against a window-pane,\nthe drawing-room naturalist may forget that under less artificial\nconditions it is capable of measuring distances and drawing conclusions\nwith all the accuracy needful to its welfare; and the fact that Mr.\nRosedale's drawing-room manner lacked perspective made Lily class him\nwith Trenor and the other dull men she knew, and assume that a little\nflattery, and the occasional acceptance of his hospitality, would suffice\nto render him innocuous. However, there could be no doubt of the\nexpediency of showing herself in his box on the opening night of the\nopera; and after all, since Judy Trenor had promised to take him up that\nwinter, it was as well to reap the advantage of being first in the field.\n\nFor a day or two after Rosedale's visit, Lily's thoughts were dogged by\nthe consciousness of Trenor's shadowy claim, and she wished she had a\nclearer notion of the exact nature of the transaction which seemed to\nhave put her in his power; but her mind shrank from any unusual\napplication, and she was always helplessly puzzled by figures. Moreover\nshe had not seen Trenor since the day of the Van Osburgh wedding, and in\nhis continued absence the trace of Rosedale's words was soon effaced by\nother impressions.\n\nWhen the opening night of the opera came, her apprehensions had so\ncompletely vanished that the sight of Trenor's ruddy countenance in the\nback of Mr. Rosedale's box filled her with a sense of pleasant\nreassurance. Lily had not quite reconciled herself to the necessity of\nappearing as Rosedale's guest on so conspicuous an occasion, and it was a\nrelief to find herself supported by any one of her own set--for Mrs.\nFisher's social habits were too promiscuous for her presence to justify\nMiss Bart's.\n\nTo Lily, always inspirited by the prospect of showing her beauty in\npublic, and conscious tonight of all the added enhancements of dress, the\ninsistency of Trenor's gaze merged itself in the general stream of\nadmiring looks of which she felt herself the centre. Ah, it was good to\nbe young, to be radiant, to glow with the sense of slenderness, strength\nand elasticity, of well-poised lines and happy tints, to feel one's self\nlifted to a height apart by that incommunicable grace which is the bodily\ncounterpart of genius!\n\nAll means seemed justifiable to attain such an end, or rather, by a happy\nshifting of lights with which practice had familiarized Miss Bart, the\ncause shrank to a pin-point in the general brightness of the effect. But\nbrilliant young ladies, a little blinded by their own effulgence, are apt\nto forget that the modest satellite drowned in their light is still\nperforming its own revolutions and generating heat at its own rate. If\nLily's poetic enjoyment of the moment was undisturbed by the base thought\nthat her gown and opera cloak had been indirectly paid for by Gus Trenor,\nthe latter had not sufficient poetry in his composition to lose sight of\nthese prosaic facts. He knew only that he had never seen Lily look\nsmarter in her life, that there wasn't a woman in the house who showed\noff good clothes as she did, and that hitherto he, to whom she owed the\nopportunity of making this display, had reaped no return beyond that of\ngazing at her in company with several hundred other pairs of eyes.\n\nIt came to Lily therefore as a disagreeable surprise when, in the back of\nthe box, where they found themselves alone between two acts, Trenor said,\nwithout preamble, and in a tone of sulky authority: \"Look here, Lily, how\nis a fellow ever to see anything of you? I'm in town three or four days\nin the week, and you know a line to the club will always find me, but you\ndon't seem to remember my existence nowadays unless you want to get a tip\nout of me.\"\n\nThe fact that the remark was in distinctly bad taste did not make it any\neasier to answer, for Lily was vividly aware that it was not the moment\nfor that drawing up of her slim figure and surprised lifting of the brows\nby which she usually quelled incipient signs of familiarity.\n\n\"I'm very much flattered by your wanting to see me,\" she returned,\nessaying lightness instead, \"but, unless you have mislaid my address, it\nwould have been easy to find me any afternoon at my aunt's--in fact, I\nrather expected you to look me up there.\"\n\nIf she hoped to mollify him by this last concession the attempt was a\nfailure, for he only replied, with the familiar lowering of the brows\nthat made him look his dullest when he was angry: \"Hang going to your\naunt's, and wasting the afternoon listening to a lot of other chaps\ntalking to you! You know I'm not the kind to sit in a crowd and jaw--I'd\nalways rather clear out when that sort of circus is going on.  But why\ncan't we go off somewhere on a little lark together--a nice quiet little\nexpedition like that drive at Bellomont, the day you met me at the\nstation?\"\n\nHe leaned unpleasantly close in order to convey this suggestion, and she\nfancied she caught a significant aroma which explained the dark flush on\nhis face and the glistening dampness of his forehead.\n\nThe idea that any rash answer might provoke an unpleasant outburst\ntempered her disgust with caution, and she answered with a laugh: \"I\ndon't see how one can very well take country drives in town, but I am not\nalways surrounded by an admiring throng, and if you will let me know what\nafternoon you are coming I will arrange things so that we can have a nice\nquiet talk.\"\n\n\"Hang talking! That's what you always say,\" returned Trenor, whose\nexpletives lacked variety. \"You put me off with that at the Van Osburgh\nwedding--but the plain English of it is that, now you've got what you\nwanted out of me, you'd rather have any other fellow about.\"\n\nHis voice had risen sharply with the last words, and Lily flushed with\nannoyance, but she kept command of the situation and laid a persuasive\nhand on his arm.\n\n\"Don't be foolish, Gus; I can't let you talk to me in that ridiculous\nway. If you really want to see me, why shouldn't we take a walk in the\nPark some afternoon? I agree with you that it's amusing to be rustic in\ntown, and if you like I'll meet you there, and we'll go and feed the\nsquirrels, and you shall take me out on the lake in the steam-gondola.\"\n\nShe smiled as she spoke, letting her eyes rest on his in a way that took\nthe edge from her banter and made him suddenly malleable to her will.\n\n\"All right, then: that's a go. Will you come tomorrow? Tomorrow at three\no'clock, at the end of the Mall. I'll be there sharp, remember; you won't\ngo back on me, Lily?\"\n\nBut to Miss Bart's relief the repetition of her promise was cut short by\nthe opening of the box door to admit George Dorset.\n\nTrenor sulkily yielded his place, and Lily turned a brilliant smile on\nthe newcomer. She had not talked with Dorset since their visit at\nBellomont, but something in his look and manner told her that he recalled\nthe friendly footing on which they had last met. He was not a man to whom\nthe expression of admiration came easily: his long sallow face and\ndistrustful eyes seemed always barricaded against the expansive emotions.\nBut, where her own influence was concerned, Lily's intuitions sent out\nthread-like feelers, and as she made room for him on the narrow sofa she\nwas sure he found a dumb pleasure in being near her. Few women took the\ntrouble to make themselves agreeable to Dorset, and Lily had been kind to\nhim at Bellomont, and was now smiling on him with a divine renewal of\nkindness.\n\n\"Well, here we are, in for another six months of caterwauling,\" he began\ncomplainingly. \"Not a shade of difference between this year and last,\nexcept that the women have got new clothes and the singers haven't got\nnew voices. My wife's musical, you know--puts me through a course of this\nevery winter. It isn't so bad on Italian nights--then she comes late, and\nthere's time to digest.  But when they give Wagner we have to rush\ndinner, and I pay up for it. And the draughts are damnable--asphyxia in\nfront and pleurisy in the back. There's Trenor leaving the box without\ndrawing the curtain! With a hide like that draughts don't make any\ndifference. Did you ever watch Trenor eat? If you did, you'd wonder why\nhe's alive; I suppose he's leather inside too.--But I came to say that my\nwife wants you to come down to our place next Sunday. Do for heaven's\nsake say yes. She's got a lot of bores coming--intellectual ones, I mean;\nthat's her new line, you know, and I'm not sure it ain't worse than the\nmusic. Some of 'em have long hair, and they start an argument with the\nsoup, and don't notice when things are handed to them. The consequence is\nthe dinner gets cold, and I have dyspepsia. That silly ass Silverton\nbrings them to the house--he writes poetry, you know, and Bertha and he\nare getting tremendously thick. She could write better than any of 'em if\nshe chose, and I don't blame her for wanting clever fellows about; all I\nsay is: 'Don't let me see 'em eat!'\"\n\nThe gist of this strange communication gave Lily a distinct thrill of\npleasure. Under ordinary circumstances, there would have been nothing\nsurprising in an invitation from Bertha Dorset; but since the Bellomont\nepisode an unavowed hostility had kept the two women apart. Now, with a\nstart of inner wonder, Lily felt that her thirst for retaliation had died\nout. IF YOU WOULD FORGIVE YOUR ENEMY, says the Malay proverb, FIRST\nINFLICT A HURT ON HIM; and Lily was experiencing the truth of the\napothegm.  If she had destroyed Mrs. Dorset's letters, she might have\ncontinued to hate her; but the fact that they remained in her possession\nhad fed her resentment to satiety.\n\nShe uttered a smiling acceptance, hailing in the renewal of the tie an\nescape from Trenor's importunities.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile the holidays had gone by and the season was beginning.  Fifth\nAvenue had become a nightly torrent of carriages surging upward to the\nfashionable quarters about the Park, where illuminated windows and\noutspread awnings betokened the usual routine of hospitality. Other\ntributary currents crossed the mainstream, bearing their freight to the\ntheatres, restaurants or opera; and Mrs. Peniston, from the secluded\nwatch-tower of her upper window, could tell to a nicety just when the\nchronic volume of sound was increased by the sudden influx setting toward\na Van Osburgh ball, or when the multiplication of wheels meant merely\nthat the opera was over, or that there was a big supper at Sherry's.\n\nMrs. Peniston followed the rise and culmination of the season as keenly\nas the most active sharer in its gaieties; and, as a looker-on, she\nenjoyed opportunities of comparison and generalization such as those who\ntake part must proverbially forego. No one could have kept a more\naccurate record of social fluctuations, or have put a more unerring\nfinger on the distinguishing features of each season: its dulness, its\nextravagance, its lack of balls or excess of divorces. She had a special\nmemory for the vicissitudes of the \"new people\" who rose to the surface\nwith each recurring tide, and were either submerged beneath its rush or\nlanded triumphantly beyond the reach of envious breakers; and she was apt\nto display a remarkable retrospective insight into their ultimate fate,\nso that, when they had fulfilled their destiny, she was almost always\nable to say to Grace Stepney--the recipient of her prophecies--that she\nhad known exactly what would happen.\n\nThis particular season Mrs. Peniston would have characterized as that in\nwhich everybody \"felt poor\" except the Welly Brys and Mr. Simon Rosedale.\nIt had been a bad autumn in Wall Street, where prices fell in accordance\nwith that peculiar law which proves railway stocks and bales of cotton to\nbe more sensitive to the allotment of executive power than many estimable\ncitizens trained to all the advantages of self-government. Even fortunes\nsupposed to be independent of the market either betrayed a secret\ndependence on it, or suffered from a sympathetic affection: fashion\nsulked in its country houses, or came to town incognito, general\nentertainments were discountenanced, and informality and short dinners\nbecame the fashion.\n\nBut society, amused for a while at playing Cinderella, soon wearied of\nthe hearthside role, and welcomed the Fairy Godmother in the shape of any\nmagician powerful enough to turn the shrunken pumpkin back again into the\ngolden coach. The mere fact of growing richer at a time when most\npeople's investments are shrinking, is calculated to attract envious\nattention; and according to Wall Street rumours, Welly Bry and Rosedale\nhad found the secret of performing this miracle.\n\nRosedale, in particular, was said to have doubled his fortune, and there\nwas talk of his buying the newly-finished house of one of the victims of\nthe crash, who, in the space of twelve short months, had made the same\nnumber of millions, built a house in Fifth Avenue, filled a\npicture-gallery with old masters, entertained all New York in it, and\nbeen smuggled out of the country between a trained nurse and a doctor,\nwhile his creditors mounted guard over the old masters, and his guests\nexplained to each other that they had dined with him only because they\nwanted to see the pictures. Mr. Rosedale meant to have a less meteoric\ncareer. He knew he should have to go slowly, and the instincts of his\nrace fitted him to suffer rebuffs and put up with delays. But he was\nprompt to perceive that the general dulness of the season afforded him an\nunusual opportunity to shine, and he set about with patient industry to\nform a background for his growing glory.  Mrs. Fisher was of immense\nservice to him at this period. She had set off so many newcomers on the\nsocial stage that she was like one of those pieces of stock scenery which\ntell the experienced spectator exactly what is going to take place. But\nMr. Rosedale wanted, in the long run, a more individual environment. He\nwas sensitive to shades of difference which Miss Bart would never have\ncredited him with perceiving, because he had no corresponding variations\nof manner; and it was becoming more and more clear to him that Miss Bart\nherself possessed precisely the complementary qualities needed to round\noff his social personality.\n\nSuch details did not fall within the range of Mrs. Peniston's vision.\nLike many minds of panoramic sweep, hers was apt to overlook the MINUTIAE\nof the foreground, and she was much more likely to know where Carry\nFisher had found the Welly Brys' CHEF for them, than what was happening\nto her own niece. She was not, however, without purveyors of information\nready to supplement her deficiencies. Grace Stepney's mind was like a\nkind of moral fly-paper, to which the buzzing items of gossip were drawn\nby a fatal attraction, and where they hung fast in the toils of an\ninexorable memory. Lily would have been surprised to know how many\ntrivial facts concerning herself were lodged in Miss Stepney's head. She\nwas quite aware that she was of interest to dingy people, but she assumed\nthat there is only one form of dinginess, and that admiration for\nbrilliancy is the natural expression of its inferior state. She knew that\nGerty Farish admired her blindly, and therefore supposed that she\ninspired the same sentiments in Grace Stepney, whom she classified as a\nGerty Farish without the saving traits of youth and enthusiasm.\n\nIn reality, the two differed from each other as much as they differed\nfrom the object of their mutual contemplation. Miss Farish's heart was a\nfountain of tender illusions, Miss Stepney's a precise register of facts\nas manifested in their relation to herself. She had sensibilities which,\nto Lily, would have seemed comic in a person with a freckled nose and red\neyelids, who lived in a boarding-house and admired Mrs. Peniston's\ndrawing-room; but poor Grace's limitations gave them a more concentrated\ninner life, as poor soil starves certain plants into intenser\nefflorescence. She had in truth no abstract propensity to malice: she did\nnot dislike Lily because the latter was brilliant and predominant, but\nbecause she thought that Lily disliked her. It is less mortifying to\nbelieve one's self unpopular than insignificant, and vanity prefers to\nassume that indifference is a latent form of unfriendliness. Even such\nscant civilities as Lily accorded to Mr. Rosedale would have made Miss\nStepney her friend for life; but how could she foresee that such a friend\nwas worth cultivating? How, moreover, can a young woman who has never\nbeen ignored measure the pang which this injury inflicts? And, lastly,\nhow could Lily, accustomed to choose between a pressure of engagements,\nguess that she had mortally offended Miss Stepney by causing her to be\nexcluded from one of Mrs. Peniston's infrequent dinner-parties?\n\nMrs. Peniston disliked giving dinners, but she had a high sense of family\nobligation, and on the Jack Stepneys' return from their honeymoon she\nfelt it incumbent upon her to light the drawing-room lamps and extract\nher best silver from the Safe Deposit vaults. Mrs. Peniston's rare\nentertainments were preceded by days of heart-rending vacillation as to\nevery detail of the feast, from the seating of the guests to the pattern\nof the table-cloth, and in the course of one of these preliminary\ndiscussions she had imprudently suggested to her cousin Grace that, as\nthe dinner was a family affair, she might be included in it. For a week\nthe prospect had lighted up Miss Stepney's colourless existence; then she\nhad been given to understand that it would be more convenient to have her\nanother day. Miss Stepney knew exactly what had happened. Lily, to whom\nfamily reunions were occasions of unalloyed dulness, had persuaded her\naunt that a dinner of \"smart\" people would be much more to the taste of\nthe young couple, and Mrs. Peniston, who leaned helplessly on her niece\nin social matters, had been prevailed upon to pronounce Grace's exile.\nAfter all, Grace could come any other day; why should she mind being put\noff?\n\nIt was precisely because Miss Stepney could come any other day--and\nbecause she knew her relations were in the secret of her unoccupied\nevenings--that this incident loomed gigantically on her horizon. She was\naware that she had Lily to thank for it; and dull resentment was turned\nto active animosity.\n\nMrs. Peniston, on whom she had looked in a day or two after the dinner,\nlaid down her crochet-work and turned abruptly from her oblique survey of\nFifth Avenue.\n\n\"Gus Trenor?--Lily and Gus Trenor?\" she said, growing so suddenly pale\nthat her visitor was almost alarmed.\n\n\"Oh, cousin Julia... of course I don't mean...\"\n\n\"I don't know what you DO mean,\" said Mrs. Peniston, with a frightened\nquiver in her small fretful voice. \"Such things were never heard of in my\nday. And my own niece! I'm not sure I understand you. Do people say he's\nin love with her?\"\n\nMrs. Peniston's horror was genuine. Though she boasted an unequalled\nfamiliarity with the secret chronicles of society, she had the innocence\nof the school-girl who regards wickedness as a part of \"history,\" and to\nwhom it never occurs that the scandals she reads of in lesson-hours may\nbe repeating themselves in the next street. Mrs. Peniston had kept her\nimagination shrouded, like the drawing-room furniture. She knew, of\ncourse, that society was \"very much changed,\" and that many women her\nmother would have thought \"peculiar\" were now in a position to be\ncritical about their visiting-lists; she had discussed the perils of\ndivorce with her rector, and had felt thankful at times that Lily was\nstill unmarried; but the idea that any scandal could attach to a young\ngirl's name, above all that it could be lightly coupled with that of a\nmarried man, was so new to her that she was as much aghast as if she had\nbeen accused of leaving her carpets down all summer, or of violating any\nof the other cardinal laws of housekeeping.\n\nMiss Stepney, when her first fright had subsided, began to feel the\nsuperiority that greater breadth of mind confers. It was really pitiable\nto be as ignorant of the world as Mrs. Peniston!  She smiled at the\nlatter's question. \"People always say unpleasant things--and certainly\nthey're a great deal together. A friend of mine met them the other\nafternoon in the Park--quite late, after the lamps were lit. It's a pity\nLily makes herself so conspicuous.\"\n\n\"CONSPICUOUS!\" gasped Mrs. Peniston. She bent forward, lowering her voice\nto mitigate the horror. \"What sort of things do they say? That he means\nto get a divorce and marry her?\"\n\nGrace Stepney laughed outright. \"Dear me, no! He would hardly do that.\nIt--it's a flirtation--nothing more.\"\n\n\"A flirtation? Between my niece and a married man? Do you mean to tell me\nthat, with Lily's looks and advantages, she could find no better use for\nher time than to waste it on a fat stupid man almost old enough to be her\nfather?\" This argument had such a convincing ring that it gave Mrs.\nPeniston sufficient reassurance to pick up her work, while she waited for\nGrace Stepney to rally her scattered forces.\n\nBut Miss Stepney was on the spot in an instant. \"That's the worst of\nit--people say she isn't wasting her time! Every one knows, as you say,\nthat Lily is too handsome and--and charming--to devote herself to a man\nlike Gus Trenor unless--\"\n\n\"Unless?\" echoed Mrs. Peniston. Her visitor drew breath nervously. It was\nagreeable to shock Mrs. Peniston, but not to shock her to the verge of\nanger. Miss Stepney was not sufficiently familiar with the classic drama\nto have recalled in advance how bearers of bad tidings are proverbially\nreceived, but she now had a rapid vision of forfeited dinners and a\nreduced wardrobe as the possible consequence of her disinterestedness. To\nthe honour of her sex, however, hatred of Lily prevailed over more\npersonal considerations. Mrs. Peniston had chosen the wrong moment to\nboast of her niece's charms.\n\n\"Unless,\" said Grace, leaning forward to speak with low-toned emphasis,\n\"unless there are material advantages to be gained by making herself\nagreeable to him.\"\n\nShe felt that the moment was tremendous, and remembered suddenly that\nMrs. Peniston's black brocade, with the cut jet fringe, would have been\nhers at the end of the season.\n\nMrs. Peniston put down her work again. Another aspect of the same idea\nhad presented itself to her, and she felt that it was beneath her dignity\nto have her nerves racked by a dependent relative who wore her old\nclothes.\n\n\"If you take pleasure in annoying me by mysterious insinuations,\" she\nsaid coldly, \"you might at least have chosen a more suitable time than\njust as I am recovering from the strain of giving a large dinner.\"\n\nThe mention of the dinner dispelled Miss Stepney's last scruples.  \"I\ndon't know why I should be accused of taking pleasure in telling you\nabout Lily. I was sure I shouldn't get any thanks for it,\" she returned\nwith a flare of temper. \"But I have some family feeling left, and as you\nare the only person who has any authority over Lily, I thought you ought\nto know what is being said of her.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Mrs. Peniston, \"what I complain of is that you haven't told\nme yet what IS being said.\"\n\n\"I didn't suppose I should have to put it so plainly. People say that Gus\nTrenor pays her bills.\"\n\n\"Pays her bills--her bills?\" Mrs. Peniston broke into a laugh. \"I can't\nimagine where you can have picked up such rubbish. Lily has her own\nincome--and I provide for her very handsomely--\"\n\n\"Oh, we all know that,\" interposed Miss Stepney drily. \"But Lily wears a\ngreat many smart gowns--\"\n\n\"I like her to be well-dressed--it's only suitable!\"\n\n\"Certainly; but then there are her gambling debts besides.\"\n\nMiss Stepney, in the beginning, had not meant to bring up this point; but\nMrs. Peniston had only her own incredulity to blame.  She was like the\nstiff-necked unbelievers of Scripture, who must be annihilated to be\nconvinced.\n\n\"Gambling debts? Lily?\" Mrs. Peniston's voice shook with anger and\nbewilderment. She wondered whether Grace Stepney had gone out of her\nmind. \"What do you mean by her gambling debts?\"\n\n\"Simply that if one plays bridge for money in Lily's set one is liable to\nlose a great deal--and I don't suppose Lily always wins.\"\n\n\"Who told you that my niece played cards for money?\"\n\n\"Mercy, cousin Julia, don't look at me as if I were trying to turn you\nagainst Lily! Everybody knows she is crazy about bridge.  Mrs. Gryce told\nme herself that it was her gambling that frightened Percy Gryce--it seems\nhe was really taken with her at first. But, of course, among Lily's\nfriends it's quite the custom for girls to play for money.  In fact,\npeople are inclined to excuse her on that account----\"\n\n\"To excuse her for what?\"\n\n\"For being hard up--and accepting attentions from men like Gus\nTrenor--and George Dorset----\"\n\nMrs. Peniston gave another cry. \"George Dorset? Is there any one else?  I\nshould like to know the worst, if you please.\"\n\n\"Don't put it in that way, cousin Julia. Lately Lily has been a good deal\nwith the Dorsets, and he seems to admire her--but of course that's only\nnatural. And I'm sure there is no truth in the horrid things people say;\nbut she HAS been spending a great deal of money this winter. Evie Van\nOsburgh was at Celeste's ordering her trousseau the other day--yes, the\nmarriage takes place next month--and she told me that Celeste showed her\nthe most exquisite things she was just sending home to Lily. And people\nsay that Judy Trenor has quarrelled with her on account of Gus; but I'm\nsure I'm sorry I spoke, though I only meant it as a kindness.\"\n\nMrs. Peniston's genuine incredulity enabled her to dismiss Miss Stepney\nwith a disdain which boded ill for that lady's prospect of succeeding to\nthe black brocade; but minds impenetrable to reason have generally some\ncrack through which suspicion filters, and her visitor's insinuations did\nnot glide off as easily as she had expected. Mrs. Peniston disliked\nscenes, and her determination to avoid them had always led her to hold\nherself aloof from the details of Lily's life.  In her youth, girls had\nnot been supposed to require close supervision.  They were generally\nassumed to be taken up with the legitimate business of courtship and\nmarriage, and interference in such affairs on the part of their natural\nguardians was considered as unwarrantable as a spectator's suddenly\njoining in a game. There had of course been \"fast\" girls even in Mrs.\nPeniston's early experience; but their fastness, at worst, was understood\nto be a mere excess of animal spirits, against which there could be no\ngraver charge than that of being \"unladylike.\" The modern fastness\nappeared synonymous with immorality, and the mere idea of immorality was\nas offensive to Mrs. Peniston as a smell of cooking in the drawing-room:\nit was one of the conceptions her mind refused to admit.\n\nShe had no immediate intention of repeating to Lily what she had heard,\nor even of trying to ascertain its truth by means of discreet\ninterrogation. To do so might be to provoke a scene; and a scene, in the\nshaken state of Mrs. Peniston's nerves, with the effects of her dinner\nnot worn off, and her mind still tremulous with new impressions, was a\nrisk she deemed it her duty to avoid.  But there remained in her thoughts\na settled deposit of resentment against her niece, all the denser because\nit was not to be cleared by explanation or discussion.  It was horrible\nof a young girl to let herself be talked about; however unfounded the\ncharges against her, she must be to blame for their having been made.\nMrs. Peniston felt as if there had been a contagious illness in the\nhouse, and she was doomed to sit shivering among her contaminated\nfurniture.\n\n\n\nMiss Bart had in fact been treading a devious way, and none of her\ncritics could have been more alive to the fact than herself; but she had\na fatalistic sense of being drawn from one wrong turning to another,\nwithout ever perceiving the right road till it was too late to take it.\n\nLily, who considered herself above narrow prejudices, had not imagined\nthat the fact of letting Gus Trenor make a little money for her would\never disturb her self-complacency. And the fact in itself still seemed\nharmless enough; only it was a fertile source of harmful complications.\nAs she exhausted the amusement of spending the money these complications\nbecame more pressing, and Lily, whose mind could be severely logical in\ntracing the causes of her ill-luck to others, justified herself by the\nthought that she owed all her troubles to the enmity of Bertha Dorset.\nThis enmity, however, had apparently expired in a renewal of friendliness\nbetween the two women. Lily's visit to the Dorsets had resulted, for\nboth, in the discovery that they could be of use to each other; and the\ncivilized instinct finds a subtler pleasure in making use of its\nantagonist than in confounding him.  Mrs. Dorset was, in fact, engaged in\na new sentimental experiment, of which Mrs. Fisher's late property, Ned\nSilverton, was the rosy victim; and at such moments, as Judy Trenor had\nonce remarked, she felt a peculiar need of distracting her husband's\nattention. Dorset was as difficult to amuse as a savage; but even his\nself-engrossment was not proof against Lily's arts, or rather these were\nespecially adapted to soothe an uneasy egoism. Her experience with Percy\nGryce stood her in good stead in ministering to Dorset's humours, and if\nthe incentive to please was less urgent, the difficulties of her\nsituation were teaching her to make much of minor opportunities.\n\nIntimacy with the Dorsets was not likely to lessen such difficulties on\nthe material side. Mrs. Dorset had none of Judy Trenor's lavish impulses,\nand Dorset's admiration was not likely to express itself in financial\n\"tips,\" even had Lily cared to renew her experiences in that line. What\nshe required, for the moment, of the Dorsets' friendship, was simply its\nsocial sanction. She knew that people were beginning to talk of her; but\nthis fact did not alarm her as it had alarmed Mrs. Peniston. In her set\nsuch gossip was not unusual, and a handsome girl who flirted with a\nmarried man was merely assumed to be pressing to the limit of her\nopportunities. It was Trenor himself who frightened her.  Their walk in\nthe Park had not been a success.  Trenor had married young, and since his\nmarriage his intercourse with women had not taken the form of the\nsentimental small-talk which doubles upon itself like the paths in a\nmaze. He was first puzzled and then irritated to find himself always led\nback to the same starting-point, and Lily felt that she was gradually\nlosing control of the situation. Trenor was in truth in an unmanageable\nmood. In spite of his understanding with Rosedale he had been somewhat\nheavily \"touched\" by the fall in stocks; his household expenses weighed\non him, and he seemed to be meeting, on all sides, a sullen opposition to\nhis wishes, instead of the easy good luck he had hitherto encountered.\n\nMrs. Trenor was still at Bellomont, keeping the town-house open, and\ndescending on it now and then for a taste of the world, but preferring\nthe recurrent excitement of week-end parties to the restrictions of a\ndull season. Since the holidays she had not urged Lily to return to\nBellomont, and the first time they met in town Lily fancied there was a\nshade of coldness in her manner.  Was it merely the expression of her\ndispleasure at Miss Bart's neglect, or had disquieting rumours reached\nher? The latter contingency seemed improbable, yet Lily was not without a\nsense of uneasiness. If her roaming sympathies had struck root anywhere,\nit was in her friendship with Judy Trenor. She believed in the sincerity\nof her friend's affection, though it sometimes showed itself in\nself-interested ways, and she shrank with peculiar reluctance from any\nrisk of estranging it. But, aside from this, she was keenly conscious of\nthe way in which such an estrangement would react on herself. The fact\nthat Gus Trenor was Judy's husband was at times Lily's strongest reason\nfor disliking him, and for resenting the obligation under which he had\nplaced her. To set her doubts at rest, Miss Bart, soon after the New\nYear, \"proposed\" herself for a week-end at Bellomont. She had learned in\nadvance that the presence of a large party would protect her from too\ngreat assiduity on Trenor's part, and his wife's telegraphic \"come by all\nmeans\" seemed to assure her of her usual welcome.\n\nJudy received her amicably. The cares of a large party always prevailed\nover personal feelings, and Lily saw no change in her hostess's manner.\nNevertheless, she was soon aware that the experiment of coming to\nBellomont was destined not to be successful. The party was made up of\nwhat Mrs. Trenor called \"poky people\"--her generic name for persons who\ndid not play bridge--and, it being her habit to group all such\nobstructionists in one class, she usually invited them together,\nregardless of their other characteristics. The result was apt to be an\nirreducible combination of persons having no other quality in common than\ntheir abstinence from bridge, and the antagonisms developed in a group\nlacking the one taste which might have amalgamated them, were in this\ncase aggravated by bad weather, and by the ill-concealed boredom of their\nhost and hostess. In such emergencies, Judy would usually have turned to\nLily to fuse the discordant elements; and Miss Bart, assuming that such a\nservice was expected of her, threw herself into it with her accustomed\nzeal. But at the outset she perceived a subtle resistance to her efforts.\nIf Mrs. Trenor's manner toward her was unchanged, there was certainly a\nfaint coldness in that of the other ladies. An occasional caustic\nallusion to \"your friends the Wellington Brys,\" or to \"the little Jew who\nhas bought the Greiner house--some one told us you knew him, Miss\nBart,\"--showed Lily that she was in disfavour with that portion of\nsociety which, while contributing least to its amusement, has assumed the\nright to decide what forms that amusement shall take. The indication was\na slight one, and a year ago Lily would have smiled at it, trusting to\nthe charm of her personality to dispel any prejudice against her. But now\nshe had grown more sensitive to criticism and less confident in her power\nof disarming it. She knew, moreover, that if the ladies at Bellomont\npermitted themselves to criticize her friends openly, it was a proof that\nthey were not afraid of subjecting her to the same treatment behind her\nback. The nervous dread lest anything in Trenor's manner should seem to\njustify their disapproval made her seek every pretext for avoiding him,\nand she left Bellomont conscious of having failed in every purpose which\nhad taken her there.\n\nIn town she returned to preoccupations which, for the moment, had the\nhappy effect of banishing troublesome thoughts. The Welly Brys, after\nmuch debate, and anxious counsel with their newly acquired friends, had\ndecided on the bold move of giving a general entertainment. To attack\nsociety collectively, when one's means of approach are limited to a few\nacquaintances, is like advancing into a strange country with an\ninsufficient number of scouts; but such rash tactics have sometimes led\nto brilliant victories, and the Brys had determined to put their fate to\nthe touch. Mrs. Fisher, to whom they had entrusted the conduct of the\naffair, had decided that TABLEAUX VIVANTS and expensive music were the\ntwo baits most likely to attract the desired prey, and after prolonged\nnegotiations, and the kind of wire-pulling in which she was known to\nexcel, she had induced a dozen fashionable women to exhibit themselves in\na series of pictures which, by a farther miracle of persuasion, the\ndistinguished portrait painter, Paul Morpeth, had been prevailed upon to\norganize.\n\nLily was in her element on such occasions. Under Morpeth's guidance her\nvivid plastic sense, hitherto nurtured on no higher food than\ndress-making and upholstery, found eager expression in the disposal of\ndraperies, the study of attitudes, the shifting of lights and shadows.\nHer dramatic instinct was roused by the choice of subjects, and the\ngorgeous reproductions of historic dress stirred an imagination which\nonly visual impressions could reach. But keenest of all was the\nexhilaration of displaying her own beauty under a new aspect: of showing\nthat her loveliness was no mere fixed quality, but an element shaping all\nemotions to fresh forms of grace.\n\nMrs. Fisher's measures had been well-taken, and society, surprised in a\ndull moment, succumbed to the temptation of Mrs. Bry's hospitality. The\nprotesting minority were forgotten in the throng which abjured and came;\nand the audience was almost as brilliant as the show.\n\nLawrence Selden was among those who had yielded to the proffered\ninducements. If he did not often act on the accepted social axiom that a\nman may go where he pleases, it was because he had long since learned\nthat his pleasures were mainly to be found in a small group of the\nlike-minded. But he enjoyed spectacular effects, and was not insensible\nto the part money plays in their production: all he asked was that the\nvery rich should live up to their calling as stage-managers, and not\nspend their money in a dull way. This the Brys could certainly not be\ncharged with doing. Their recently built house, whatever it might lack as\na frame for domesticity, was almost as well-designed for the display of a\nfestal assemblage as one of those airy pleasure-halls which the Italian\narchitects improvised to set off the hospitality of princes.  The air of\nimprovisation was in fact strikingly present: so recent, so\nrapidly-evoked was the whole MISE-EN-SCENE that one had to touch the\nmarble columns to learn they were not of cardboard, to seat one's self in\none of the damask-and-gold arm-chairs to be sure it was not painted\nagainst the wall.\n\nSelden, who had put one of these seats to the test, found himself, from\nan angle of the ball-room, surveying the scene with frank enjoyment.  The\ncompany, in obedience to the decorative instinct which calls for fine\nclothes in fine surroundings, had dressed rather with an eye to Mrs.\nBry's background than to herself. The seated throng, filling the immense\nroom without undue crowding, presented a surface of rich tissues and\njewelled shoulders in harmony with the festooned and gilded walls, and\nthe flushed splendours of the Venetian ceiling. At the farther end of the\nroom a stage had been constructed behind a proscenium arch curtained with\nfolds of old damask; but in the pause before the parting of the folds\nthere was little thought of what they might reveal, for every woman who\nhad accepted Mrs. Bry's invitation was engaged in trying to find out how\nmany of her friends had done the same.\n\nGerty Farish, seated next to Selden, was lost in that indiscriminate and\nuncritical enjoyment so irritating to Miss Bart's finer perceptions. It\nmay be that Selden's nearness had something to do with the quality of his\ncousin's pleasure; but Miss Farish was so little accustomed to refer her\nenjoyment of such scenes to her own share in them, that she was merely\nconscious of a deeper sense of contentment.\n\n\"Wasn't it dear of Lily to get me an invitation? Of course it would never\nhave occurred to Carry Fisher to put me on the list, and I should have\nbeen so sorry to miss seeing it all--and especially Lily herself.  Some\none told me the ceiling was by Veronese--you would know, of course,\nLawrence. I suppose it's very beautiful, but his women are so dreadfully\nfat. Goddesses?  Well, I can only say that if they'd been mortals and had\nto wear corsets, it would have been better for them. I think our women\nare much handsomer. And this room is wonderfully becoming--every one\nlooks so well! Did you ever see such jewels? Do look at Mrs. George\nDorset's pearls--I suppose the smallest of them would pay the rent of our\nGirls' Club for a year. Not that I ought to complain about the club;\nevery one has been so wonderfully kind.  Did I tell you that Lily had\ngiven us three hundred dollars?  Wasn't it splendid of her? And then she\ncollected a lot of money from her friends--Mrs. Bry gave us five hundred,\nand Mr. Rosedale a thousand. I wish Lily were not so nice to Mr.\nRosedale, but she says it's no use being rude to him, because he doesn't\nsee the difference. She really can't bear to hurt people's feelings--it\nmakes me so angry when I hear her called cold and conceited! The girls at\nthe club don't call her that. Do you know she has been there with me\ntwice?--yes, Lily! And you should have seen their eyes! One of them said\nit was as good as a day in the country just to look at her. And she sat\nthere, and laughed and talked with them--not a bit as if she were being\nCHARITABLE, you know, but as if she liked it as much as they did. They've\nbeen asking ever since when she's coming back; and she's promised\nme----oh!\"\n\nMiss Farish's confidences were cut short by the parting of the curtain on\nthe first TABLEAU--a group of nymphs dancing across flower-strewn sward\nin the rhythmic postures of Botticelli's Spring. TABLEAUX VIVANTS depend\nfor their effect not only on the happy disposal of lights and the\ndelusive-interposition of layers of gauze, but on a corresponding\nadjustment of the mental vision.  To unfurnished minds they remain, in\nspite of every enhancement of art, only a superior kind of wax-works; but\nto the responsive fancy they may give magic glimpses of the boundary\nworld between fact and imagination. Selden's mind was of this order: he\ncould yield to vision-making influences as completely as a child to the\nspell of a fairy-tale. Mrs. Bry's TABLEAUX wanted none of the qualities\nwhich go to the producing of such illusions, and under Morpeth's\norganizing hand the pictures succeeded each other with the rhythmic march\nof some splendid frieze, in which the fugitive curves of living flesh and\nthe wandering light of young eyes have been subdued to plastic harmony\nwithout losing the charm of life.\n\nThe scenes were taken from old pictures, and the participators had been\ncleverly fitted with characters suited to their types.  No one, for\ninstance, could have made a more typical Goya than Carry Fisher, with her\nshort dark-skinned face, the exaggerated glow of her eyes, the\nprovocation of her frankly-painted smile. A brilliant Miss Smedden from\nBrooklyn showed to perfection the sumptuous curves of Titian's Daughter,\nlifting her gold salver laden with grapes above the harmonizing gold of\nrippled hair and rich brocade, and a young Mrs. Van Alstyne, who showed\nthe frailer Dutch type, with high blue-veined forehead and pale eyes and\nlashes, made a characteristic Vandyck, in black satin, against a\ncurtained archway. Then there were Kauffmann nymphs garlanding the altar\nof Love; a Veronese supper, all sheeny textures, pearl-woven heads and\nmarble architecture; and a Watteau group of lute-playing comedians,\nlounging by a fountain in a sunlit glade.\n\nEach evanescent picture touched the vision-building faculty in Selden,\nleading him so far down the vistas of fancy that even Gerty Farish's\nrunning commentary--\"Oh, how lovely Lulu Melson looks!\" or: \"That must be\nKate Corby, to the right there, in purple\"--did not break the spell of\nthe illusion. Indeed, so skilfully had the personality of the actors been\nsubdued to the scenes they figured in that even the least imaginative of\nthe audience must have felt a thrill of contrast when the curtain\nsuddenly parted on a picture which was simply and undisguisedly the\nportrait of Miss Bart.\n\nHere there could be no mistaking the predominance of personality--the\nunanimous \"Oh!\" of the spectators was a tribute, not to the brush-work of\nReynolds's \"Mrs. Lloyd\" but to the flesh and blood loveliness of Lily\nBart. She had shown her artistic intelligence in selecting a type so like\nher own that she could embody the person represented without ceasing to\nbe herself. It was as though she had stepped, not out of, but into,\nReynolds's canvas, banishing the phantom of his dead beauty by the beams\nof her living grace. The impulse to show herself in a splendid\nsetting--she had thought for a moment of representing Tiepolo's\nCleopatra--had yielded to the truer instinct of trusting to her\nunassisted beauty, and she had purposely chosen a picture without\ndistracting accessories of dress or surroundings.  Her pale draperies,\nand the background of foliage against which she stood, served only to\nrelieve the long dryad-like curves that swept upward from her poised foot\nto her lifted arm. The noble buoyancy of her attitude, its suggestion of\nsoaring grace, revealed the touch of poetry in her beauty that Selden\nalways felt in her presence, yet lost the sense of when he was not with\nher. Its expression was now so vivid that for the first time he seemed to\nsee before him the real Lily Bart, divested of the trivialities of her\nlittle world, and catching for a moment a note of that eternal harmony of\nwhich her beauty was a part.\n\n\"Deuced bold thing to show herself in that get-up; but, gad, there isn't\na break in the lines anywhere, and I suppose she wanted us to know it!\"\n\nThese words, uttered by that experienced connoisseur, Mr. Ned Van\nAlstyne, whose scented white moustache had brushed Selden's shoulder\nwhenever the parting of the curtains presented any exceptional\nopportunity for the study of the female outline, affected their hearer in\nan unexpected way. It was not the first time that Selden had heard Lily's\nbeauty lightly remarked on, and hitherto the tone of the comments had\nimperceptibly coloured his view of her. But now it woke only a motion of\nindignant contempt.  This was the world she lived in, these were the\nstandards by which she was fated to be measured!\n\n### Summary:"}
{"original_length": 17886, "trunc_length": 16384, "text": "\n\nSummarize the following text into a summary of less than 800 words.\n### Text:\n\n\nThe light projected on the situation by Mrs. Fisher had the cheerless\ndistinctness of a winter dawn. It outlined the facts with a cold\nprecision unmodified by shade or colour, and refracted, as it were, from\nthe blank walls of the surrounding limitations: she had opened windows\nfrom which no sky was ever visible. But the idealist subdued to vulgar\nnecessities must employ vulgar minds to draw the inferences to which he\ncannot stoop; and it was easier for Lily to let Mrs. Fisher formulate her\ncase than to put it plainly to herself. Once confronted with it, however,\nshe went the full length of its consequences; and these had never been\nmore clearly present to her than when, the next afternoon, she set out\nfor a walk with Rosedale.\n\nIt was one of those still November days when the air is haunted with the\nlight of summer, and something in the lines of the landscape, and in the\ngolden haze which bathed them, recalled to Miss Bart the September\nafternoon when she had climbed the slopes of Bellomont with Selden. The\nimportunate memory was kept before her by its ironic contrast to her\npresent situation, since her walk with Selden had represented an\nirresistible flight from just such a climax as the present excursion was\ndesigned to bring about. But other memories importuned her also; the\nrecollection of similar situations, as skillfully led up to, but through\nsome malice of fortune, or her own unsteadiness of purpose, always\nfailing of the intended result. Well, her purpose was steady enough now.\nShe saw that the whole weary work of rehabilitation must begin again, and\nagainst far greater odds, if Bertha Dorset should succeed in breaking up\nher friendship with the Gormers; and her longing for shelter and security\nwas intensified by the passionate desire to triumph over Bertha, as only\nwealth and predominance could triumph over her. As the wife of\nRosedale--the Rosedale she felt it in her power to create--she would at\nleast present an invulnerable front to her enemy.\n\nShe had to draw upon this thought, as upon some fiery stimulant, to keep\nup her part in the scene toward which Rosedale was too frankly tending.\nAs she walked beside him, shrinking in every nerve from the way in which\nhis look and tone made free of her, yet telling herself that this\nmomentary endurance of his mood was the price she must pay for her\nultimate power over him, she tried to calculate the exact point at which\nconcession must turn to resistance, and the price HE would have to pay be\nmade equally clear to him. But his dapper self-confidence seemed\nimpenetrable to such hints, and she had a sense of something hard and\nself-contained behind the superficial warmth of his manner.\n\nThey had been seated for some time in the seclusion of a rocky glen above\nthe lake, when she suddenly cut short the culmination of an impassioned\nperiod by turning upon him the grave loveliness of her gaze.\n\n\"I DO believe what you say, Mr. Rosedale,\" she said quietly; \"and I am\nready to marry you whenever you wish.\"\n\nRosedale, reddening to the roots of his glossy hair, received this\nannouncement with a recoil which carried him to his feet, where he halted\nbefore her in an attitude of almost comic discomfiture.\n\n\"For I suppose that is what you do wish,\" she continued, in the same\nquiet tone. \"And, though I was unable to consent when you spoke to me in\nthis way before, I am ready, now that I know you so much better, to trust\nmy happiness to your hands.\"\n\nShe spoke with the noble directness which she could command on such\noccasions, and which was like a large steady light thrown across the\ntortuous darkness of the situation. In its inconvenient brightness\nRosedale seemed to waver a moment, as though conscious that every avenue\nof escape was unpleasantly illuminated.\n\nThen he gave a short laugh, and drew out a gold cigarette-case, in which,\nwith plump jewelled fingers, he groped for a gold-tipped cigarette.\nSelecting one, he paused to contemplate it a moment before saying: \"My\ndear Miss Lily, I'm sorry if there's been any little misapprehension\nbetween us-but you made me feel my suit was so hopeless that I had really\nno intention of renewing it.\"\n\nLily's blood tingled with the grossness of the rebuff; but she checked\nthe first leap of her anger, and said in a tone of gentle dignity: \"I\nhave no one but myself to blame if I gave you the impression that my\ndecision was final.\"\n\nHer word-play was always too quick for him, and this reply held him in\npuzzled silence while she extended her hand and added, with the faintest\ninflection of sadness in her voice: \"Before we bid each other goodbye, I\nwant at least to thank you for having once thought of me as you did.\"\n\nThe touch of her hand, the moving softness of her look, thrilled a\nvulnerable fibre in Rosedale. It was her exquisite inaccessibleness, the\nsense of distance she could convey without a hint of disdain, that made\nit most difficult for him to give her up.\n\n\"Why do you talk of saying goodbye? Ain't we going to be good friends all\nthe same?\" he urged, without releasing her hand.\n\nShe drew it away quietly. \"What is your idea of being good friends?\" she\nreturned with a slight smile. \"Making love to me without asking me to\nmarry you?\" Rosedale laughed with a recovered sense of ease.\n\n\"Well, that's about the size of it, I suppose. I can't help making love\nto you--I don't see how any man could; but I don't mean to ask you to\nmarry me as long as I can keep out of it.\"\n\nShe continued to smile. \"I like your frankness; but I am afraid our\nfriendship can hardly continue on those terms.\" She turned away, as\nthough to mark that its final term had in fact been reached, and he\nfollowed her for a few steps with a baffled sense of her having after all\nkept the game in her own hands.\n\n\"Miss Lily----\" he began impulsively; but she walked on without seeming\nto hear him.\n\nHe overtook her in a few quick strides, and laid an entreating hand on\nher arm. \"Miss Lily--don't hurry away like that. You're beastly hard on a\nfellow; but if you don't mind speaking the truth I don't see why you\nshouldn't allow me to do the same.\"\n\nShe had paused a moment with raised brows, drawing away instinctively\nfrom his touch, though she made no effort to evade his words.\n\n\"I was under the impression,\" she rejoined, \"that you had done so without\nwaiting for my permission.\"\n\n\"Well--why shouldn't you hear my reasons for doing it, then?  We're\nneither of us such new hands that a little plain speaking is going to\nhurt us. I'm all broken up on you: there's nothing new in that. I'm more\nin love with you than I was this time last year; but I've got to face the\nfact that the situation is changed.\"\n\nShe continued to confront him with the same air of ironic composure.\n\"You mean to say that I'm not as desirable a match as you thought me?\"\n\n\"Yes; that's what I do mean,\" he answered resolutely. \"I won't go into\nwhat's happened. I don't believe the stories about you--I don't WANT to\nbelieve them. But they're there, and my not believing them ain't going to\nalter the situation.\"\n\nShe flushed to her temples, but the extremity of her need checked the\nretort on her lip and she continued to face him composedly.  \"If they are\nnot true,\" she said, \"doesn't THAT alter the situation?\"\n\nHe met this with a steady gaze of his small stock-taking eyes, which made\nher feel herself no more than some superfine human merchandise. \"I\nbelieve it does in novels; but I'm certain it don't in real life. You\nknow that as well as I do: if we're speaking the truth, let's speak the\nwhole truth. Last year I was wild to marry you, and you wouldn't look at\nme: this year--well, you appear to be willing. Now, what has changed in\nthe interval?  Your situation, that's all. Then you thought you could do\nbetter; now----\"\n\n\"You think you can?\" broke from her ironically.\n\n\"Why, yes, I do: in one way, that is.\" He stood before her, his hands in\nhis pockets, his chest sturdily expanded under its vivid waistcoat.\n\"It's this way, you see: I've had a pretty steady grind of it these last\nyears, working up my social position.  Think it's funny I should say\nthat? Why should I mind saying I want to get into society? A man ain't\nashamed to say he wants to own a racing stable or a picture gallery.\nWell, a taste for society's just another kind of hobby.  Perhaps I want\nto get even with some of the people who cold-shouldered me last year--put\nit that way if it sounds better. Anyhow, I want to have the run of the\nbest houses; and I'm getting it too, little by little. But I know the\nquickest way to queer yourself with the right people is to be seen with\nthe wrong ones; and that's the reason I want to avoid mistakes.\"\n\nMiss Bart continued to stand before him in a silence that might have\nexpressed either mockery or a half-reluctant respect for his candour, and\nafter a moment's pause he went on: \"There it is, you see. I'm more in\nlove with you than ever, but if I married you now I'd queer myself for\ngood and all, and everything I've worked for all these years would be\nwasted.\"\n\nShe received this with a look from which all tinge of resentment had\nfaded. After the tissue of social falsehoods in which she had so long\nmoved it was refreshing to step into the open daylight of an avowed\nexpediency.\n\n\"I understand you,\" she said. \"A year ago I should have been of use to\nyou, and now I should be an encumbrance; and I like you for telling me so\nquite honestly.\" She extended her hand with a smile.\n\nAgain the gesture had a disturbing effect upon Mr. Rosedale's\nself-command. \"By George, you're a dead game sport, you are!\" he\nexclaimed; and as she began once more to move away, he broke out\nsuddenly--\"Miss Lily--stop. You know I don't believe those stories--I\nbelieve they were all got up by a woman who didn't hesitate to sacrifice\nyou to her own convenience----\"\n\nLily drew away with a movement of quick disdain: it was easier to endure\nhis insolence than his commiseration.\n\n\"You are very kind; but I don't think we need discuss the matter farther.\"\n\nBut Rosedale's natural imperviousness to hints made it easy for him to\nbrush such resistance aside. \"I don't want to discuss anything; I just\nwant to put a plain case before you,\" he persisted.\n\nShe paused in spite of herself, held by the note of a new purpose in his\nlook and tone; and he went on, keeping his eyes firmly upon her: \"The\nwonder to me is that you've waited so long to get square with that woman,\nwhen you've had the power in your hands.\" She continued silent under the\nrush of astonishment that his words produced, and he moved a step closer\nto ask with low-toned directness: \"Why don't you use those letters of\nhers you bought last year?\"\n\nLily stood speechless under the shock of the interrogation. In the words\npreceding it she had conjectured, at most, an allusion to her supposed\ninfluence over George Dorset; nor did the astonishing indelicacy of the\nreference diminish the likelihood of Rosedale's resorting to it. But now\nshe saw how far short of the mark she had fallen; and the surprise of\nlearning that he had discovered the secret of the letters left her, for\nthe moment, unconscious of the special use to which he was in the act of\nputting his knowledge.\n\nHer temporary loss of self-possession gave him time to press his point;\nand he went on quickly, as though to secure completer control of the\nsituation: \"You see I know where you stand--I know how completely she's\nin your power. That sounds like stage-talk, don't it?--but there's a lot\nof truth in some of those old gags; and I don't suppose you bought those\nletters simply because you're collecting autographs.\"\n\nShe continued to look at him with a deepening bewilderment: her only\nclear impression resolved itself into a scared sense of his power.\n\n\"You're wondering how I found out about 'em?\" he went on, answering her\nlook with a note of conscious pride. \"Perhaps you've forgotten that I'm\nthe owner of the Benedick--but never mind about that now. Getting on to\nthings is a mighty useful accomplishment in business, and I've simply\nextended it to my private affairs. For this IS partly my affair, you\nsee--at least, it depends on you to make it so. Let's look the situation\nstraight in the eye. Mrs. Dorset, for reasons we needn't go into, did you\na beastly bad turn last spring. Everybody knows what Mrs. Dorset is, and\nher best friends wouldn't believe her on oath where their own interests\nwere concerned; but as long as they're out of the row it's much easier to\nfollow her lead than to set themselves against it, and you've simply been\nsacrificed to their laziness and selfishness. Isn't that a pretty fair\nstatement of the case?--Well, some people say you've got the neatest kind\nof an answer in your hands: that George Dorset would marry you tomorrow,\nif you'd tell him all you know, and give him the chance to show the lady\nthe door. I daresay he would; but you don't seem to care for that\nparticular form of getting even, and, taking a purely business view of\nthe question, I think you're right. In a deal like that, nobody comes out\nwith perfectly clean hands, and the only way for you to start fresh is to\nget Bertha Dorset to back you up, instead of trying to fight her.\"\n\nHe paused long enough to draw breath, but not to give her time for the\nexpression of her gathering resistance; and as he pressed on, expounding\nand elucidating his idea with the directness of the man who has no doubts\nof his cause, she found the indignation gradually freezing on her lip,\nfound herself held fast in the grasp of his argument by the mere cold\nstrength of its presentation. There was no time now to wonder how he had\nheard of her obtaining the letters: all her world was dark outside the\nmonstrous glare of his scheme for using them. And it was not, after the\nfirst moment, the horror of the idea that held her spell-bound, subdued\nto his will; it was rather its subtle affinity to her own inmost\ncravings. He would marry her tomorrow if she could regain Bertha Dorset's\nfriendship; and to induce the open resumption of that friendship, and the\ntacit retractation of all that had caused its withdrawal, she had only to\nput to the lady the latent menace contained in the packet so miraculously\ndelivered into her hands. Lily saw in a flash the advantage of this\ncourse over that which poor Dorset had pressed upon her. The other plan\ndepended for its success on the infliction of an open injury, while this\nreduced the transaction to a private understanding, of which no third\nperson need have the remotest hint. Put by Rosedale in terms of\nbusiness-like give-and-take, this understanding took on the harmless air\nof a mutual accommodation, like a transfer of property or a revision of\nboundary lines. It certainly simplified life to view it as a perpetual\nadjustment, a play of party politics, in which every concession had its\nrecognized equivalent: Lily's tired mind was fascinated by this escape\nfrom fluctuating ethical estimates into a region of concrete weights and\nmeasures.\n\nRosedale, as she listened, seemed to read in her silence not only a\ngradual acquiescence in his plan, but a dangerously far-reaching\nperception of the chances it offered; for as she continued to stand\nbefore him without speaking, he broke out, with a quick return upon\nhimself: \"You see how simple it is, don't you? Well, don't be carried\naway by the idea that it's TOO simple.  It isn't exactly as if you'd\nstarted in with a clean bill of health. Now we're talking let's call\nthings by their right names, and clear the whole business up. You know\nwell enough that Bertha Dorset couldn't have touched you if there hadn't\nbeen--well--questions asked before--little points of interrogation, eh?\nBound to happen to a good-looking girl with stingy relatives, I suppose;\nanyhow, they DID happen, and she found the ground prepared for her. Do\nyou see where I'm coming out? You don't want these little questions\ncropping up again.  It's one thing to get Bertha Dorset into line--but\nwhat you want is to keep her there. You can frighten her fast enough--but\nhow are you going to keep her frightened?  By showing her that you're as\npowerful as she is. All the letters in the world won't do that for you as\nyou are now; but with a big backing behind you, you'll keep her just\nwhere you want her to be. That's MY share in the business--that's what\nI'm offering you. You can't put the thing through without me--don't run\naway with any idea that you can. In six months you'd be back again among\nyour old worries, or worse ones; and here I am, ready to lift you out of\n'em tomorrow if you say so. DO you say so, Miss Lily?\" he added, moving\nsuddenly nearer.\n\nThe words, and the movement which accompanied them, combined to startle\nLily out of the state of tranced subservience into which she had\ninsensibly slipped. Light comes in devious ways to the groping\nconsciousness, and it came to her now through the disgusted perception\nthat her would-be accomplice assumed, as a matter of course, the\nlikelihood of her distrusting him and perhaps trying to cheat him of his\nshare of the spoils. This glimpse of his inner mind seemed to present the\nwhole transaction in a new aspect, and she saw that the essential\nbaseness of the act lay in its freedom from risk.\n\nShe drew back with a quick gesture of rejection, saying, in a voice that\nwas a surprise to her own ears: \"You are mistaken--quite mistaken--both\nin the facts and in what you infer from them.\"\n\nRosedale stared a moment, puzzled by her sudden dash in a direction so\ndifferent from that toward which she had appeared to be letting him guide\nher.\n\n\"Now what on earth does that mean? I thought we understood each other!\"\nhe exclaimed; and to her murmur of \"Ah, we do NOW,\" he retorted with a\nsudden burst of violence: \"I suppose it's because the letters are to HIM,\nthen? Well, I'll be damned if I see what thanks you've got from him!\"\n\n\n\nThe autumn days declined to winter. Once more the leisure world was in\ntransition between country and town, and Fifth Avenue, still deserted at\nthe week-end, showed from Monday to Friday a broadening stream of\ncarriages between house-fronts gradually restored to consciousness.\n\nThe Horse Show, some two weeks earlier, had produced a passing semblance\nof reanimation, filling the theatres and restaurants with a human display\nof the same costly and high-stepping kind as circled daily about its\nring. In Miss Bart's world the Horse Show, and the public it attracted,\nhad ostensibly come to be classed among the spectacles disdained of the\nelect; but, as the feudal lord might sally forth to join in the dance on\nhis village green, so society, unofficially and incidentally, still\ncondescended to look in upon the scene. Mrs. Gormer, among the rest, was\nnot above seizing such an occasion for the display of herself and her\nhorses; and Lily was given one or two opportunities of appearing at her\nfriend's side in the most conspicuous box the house afforded. But this\nlingering semblance of intimacy made her only the more conscious of a\nchange in the relation between Mattie and herself, of a dawning\ndiscrimination, a gradually formed social standard, emerging from Mrs.\nGormer's chaotic view of life. It was inevitable that Lily herself should\nconstitute the first sacrifice to this new ideal, and she knew that, once\nthe Gormers were established in town, the whole drift of fashionable life\nwould facilitate Mattie's detachment from her. She had, in short, failed\nto make herself indispensable; or rather, her attempt to do so had been\nthwarted by an influence stronger than any she could exert. That\ninfluence, in its last analysis, was simply the power of money: Bertha\nDorset's social credit was based on an impregnable bank-account.\n\nLily knew that Rosedale had overstated neither the difficulty of her own\nposition nor the completeness of the vindication he offered: once\nBertha's match in material resources, her superior gifts would make it\neasy for her to dominate her adversary. An understanding of what such\ndomination would mean, and of the disadvantages accruing from her\nrejection of it, was brought home to Lily with increasing clearness\nduring the early weeks of the winter. Hitherto, she had kept up a\nsemblance of movement outside the main flow of the social current; but\nwith the return to town, and the concentrating of scattered activities,\nthe mere fact of not slipping back naturally into her old habits of life\nmarked her as being unmistakably excluded from them. If one were not a\npart of the season's fixed routine, one swung unsphered in a void of\nsocial non-existence. Lily, for all her dissatisfied dreaming, had never\nreally conceived the possibility of revolving about a different centre:\nit was easy enough to despise the world, but decidedly difficult to find\nany other habitable region. Her sense of irony never quite deserted her,\nand she could still note, with self-directed derision, the abnormal value\nsuddenly acquired by the most tiresome and insignificant details of her\nformer life. Its very drudgeries had a charm now that she was\ninvoluntarily released from them: card-leaving, note-writing, enforced\ncivilities to the dull and elderly, and the smiling endurance of tedious\ndinners--how pleasantly such obligations would have filled the emptiness\nof her days! She did indeed leave cards in plenty; she kept herself, with\na smiling and valiant persistence, well in the eye of her world; nor did\nshe suffer any of those gross rebuffs which sometimes produce a wholesome\nreaction of contempt in their victim. Society did not turn away from her,\nit simply drifted by, preoccupied and inattentive, letting her feel, to\nthe full measure of her humbled pride, how completely she had been the\ncreature of its favour.\n\nShe had rejected Rosedale's suggestion with a promptness of scorn almost\nsurprising to herself: she had not lost her capacity for high flashes of\nindignation. But she could not breathe long on the heights; there had\nbeen nothing in her training to develop any continuity of moral strength:\nwhat she craved, and really felt herself entitled to, was a situation in\nwhich the noblest attitude should also be the easiest. Hitherto her\nintermittent impulses of resistance had sufficed to maintain her\nself-respect.  If she slipped she recovered her footing, and it was only\nafterward that she was aware of having recovered it each time on a\nslightly lower level. She had rejected Rosedale's offer without conscious\neffort; her whole being had risen against it; and she did not yet\nperceive that, by the mere act of listening to him, she had learned to\nlive with ideas which would once have been intolerable to her.\n\n\n\n\nTo Gerty Farish, keeping watch over her with a tenderer if less\ndiscerning eye than Mrs. Fisher's, the results of the struggle were\nalready distinctly visible. She did not, indeed, know what hostages Lily\nhad already given to expediency; but she saw her passionately and\nirretrievably pledged to the ruinous policy of \"keeping up.\" Gerty could\nsmile now at her own early dream of her friend's renovation through\nadversity: she understood clearly enough that Lily was not of those to\nwhom privation teaches the unimportance of what they have lost. But this\nvery fact, to Gerty, made her friend the more piteously in want of aid,\nthe more exposed to the claims of a tenderness she was so little\nconscious of needing.\n\nLily, since her return to town, had not often climbed Miss Farish's\nstairs. There was something irritating to her in the mute interrogation\nof Gerty's sympathy: she felt the real difficulties of her situation to\nbe incommunicable to any one whose theory of values was so different from\nher own, and the restrictions of Gerty's life, which had once had the\ncharm of contrast, now reminded her too painfully of the limits to which\nher own existence was shrinking. When at length, one afternoon, she put\ninto execution the belated resolve to visit her friend, this sense of\nshrunken opportunities possessed her with unusual intensity.  The walk up\nFifth Avenue, unfolding before her, in the brilliance of the hard winter\nsunlight, an interminable procession of fastidiously-equipped\ncarriages--giving her, through the little squares of brougham-windows,\npeeps of familiar profiles bent above visiting-lists, of hurried hands\ndispensing notes and cards to attendant footmen--this glimpse of the\never-revolving wheels of the great social machine made Lily more than\never conscious of the steepness and narrowness of Gerty's stairs, and of\nthe cramped blind alley of life to which they led.  Dull stairs destined\nto be mounted by dull people: how many thousands of insignificant figures\nwere going up and down such stairs all over the world at that very\nmoment--figures as shabby and uninteresting as that of the middle-aged\nlady in limp black who descended Gerty's flight as Lily climbed to it!\n\n\"That was poor Miss Jane Silverton--she came to talk things over with me:\nshe and her sister want to do something to support themselves,\" Gerty\nexplained, as Lily followed her into the sitting-room.\n\n\"To support themselves? Are they so hard up?\" Miss Bart asked with a\ntouch of irritation: she had not come to listen to the woes of other\npeople.\n\n\"I'm afraid they have nothing left: Ned's debts have swallowed up\neverything. They had such hopes, you know, when he broke away from Carry\nFisher; they thought Bertha Dorset would be such a good influence,\nbecause she doesn't care for cards, and--well, she talked quite\nbeautifully to poor Miss Jane about feeling as if Ned were her younger\nbrother, and wanting to carry him off on the yacht, so that he might have\na chance to drop cards and racing, and take up his literary work again.\"\n\nMiss Farish paused with a sigh which reflected the perplexity of her\ndeparting visitor. \"But that isn't all; it isn't even the worst. It seems\nthat Ned has quarrelled with the Dorsets; or at least Bertha won't allow\nhim to see her, and he is so unhappy about it that he has taken to\ngambling again, and going about with all sorts of queer people. And\ncousin Grace Van Osburgh accuses him of having had a very bad influence\non Freddy, who left Harvard last spring, and has been a great deal with\nNed ever since. She sent for Miss Jane, and made a dreadful scene; and\nJack Stepney and Herbert Melson, who were there too, told Miss Jane that\nFreddy was threatening to marry some dreadful woman to whom Ned had\nintroduced him, and that they could do nothing with him because now he's\nof age he has his own money. You can fancy how poor Miss Jane felt--she\ncame to me at once, and seemed to think that if I could get her something\nto do she could earn enough to pay Ned's debts and send him away--I'm\nafraid she has no idea how long it would take her to pay for one of his\nevenings at bridge. And he was horribly in debt when he came back from\nthe cruise--I can't see why he should have spent so much more money under\nBertha's influence than Carry's: can you?\"\n\nLily met this query with an impatient gesture. \"My dear Gerty, I always\nunderstand how people can spend much more money--never how they can spend\nany less!\"\n\nShe loosened her furs and settled herself in Gerty's easy-chair, while\nher friend busied herself with the tea-cups.\n\n\"But what can they do--the Miss Silvertons? How do they mean to support\nthemselves?\" she asked, conscious that the note of irritation still\npersisted in her voice. It was the very last topic she had meant to\ndiscuss--it really did not interest her in the least--but she was seized\nby a sudden perverse curiosity to know how the two colourless shrinking\nvictims of young Silverton's sentimental experiments meant to cope with\nthe grim necessity which lurked so close to her own threshold.\n\n\"I don't know--I am trying to find something for them. Miss Jane reads\naloud very nicely--but it's so hard to find any one who is willing to be\nread to. And Miss Annie paints a little----\"\n\n\"Oh, I know--apple-blossoms on blotting-paper; just the kind of thing I\nshall be doing myself before long!\" exclaimed Lily, starting up with a\nvehemence of movement that threatened destruction to Miss Farish's\nfragile tea-table.\n\nLily bent over to steady the cups; then she sank back into her seat.\n\"I'd forgotten there was no room to dash about in--how beautifully one\ndoes have to behave in a small flat! Oh, Gerty, I wasn't meant to be\ngood,\" she sighed out incoherently.\n\nGerty lifted an apprehensive look to her pale face, in which the eyes\nshone with a peculiar sleepless lustre.\n\n\"You look horribly tired, Lily; take your tea, and let me give you this\ncushion to lean against.\"\n\nMiss Bart accepted the cup of tea, but put back the cushion with an\nimpatient hand.\n\n\"Don't give me that! I don't want to lean back--I shall go to sleep if I\ndo.\"\n\n\"Well, why not, dear? I'll be as quiet as a mouse,\" Gerty urged\naffectionately.\n\n\"No--no; don't be quiet; talk to me--keep me awake! I don't sleep at\nnight, and in the afternoon a dreadful drowsiness creeps over me.\"\n\n\"You don't sleep at night? Since when?\"\n\n\"I don't know--I can't remember.\" She rose and put the empty cup on the\ntea-tray. \"Another, and stronger, please; if I don't keep awake now I\nshall see horrors tonight--perfect horrors!\"\n\n\"But they'll be worse if you drink too much tea.\"\n\n\"No, no--give it to me; and don't preach, please,\" Lily returned\nimperiously. Her voice had a dangerous edge, and Gerty noticed that her\nhand shook as she held it out to receive the second cup.\n\n\"But you look so tired: I'm sure you must be ill----\"\n\nMiss Bart set down her cup with a start. \"Do I look ill? Does my face\nshow it?\" She rose and walked quickly toward the little mirror above the\nwriting-table. \"What a horrid looking-glass--it's all blotched and\ndiscoloured. Any one would look ghastly in it!\" She turned back, fixing\nher plaintive eyes on Gerty. \"You stupid dear, why do you say such odious\nthings to me? It's enough to make one ill to be told one looks so! And\nlooking ill means looking ugly.\" She caught Gerty's wrists, and drew her\nclose to the window. \"After all, I'd rather know the truth.  Look me\nstraight in the face, Gerty, and tell me: am I perfectly frightful?\"\n\n\"You're perfectly beautiful now, Lily: your eyes are shining, and your\ncheeks have grown so pink all of a sudden----\"\n\n\"Ah, they WERE pale, then--ghastly pale, when I came in? Why don't you\ntell me frankly that I'm a wreck? My eyes are bright now because I'm so\nnervous--but in the mornings they look like lead. And I can see the lines\ncoming in my face--the lines of worry and disappointment and failure!\nEvery sleepless night leaves a new one--and how can I sleep, when I have\nsuch dreadful things to think about?\"\n\n\"Dreadful things--what things?\" asked Gerty, gently detaching her wrists\nfrom her friend's feverish fingers.\n\n\"What things? Well, poverty, for one--and I don't know any that's more\ndreadful.\" Lily turned away and sank with sudden weariness into the\neasy-chair near the tea-table. \"You asked me just now if I could\nunderstand why Ned Silverton spent so much money. Of course I\nunderstand--he spends it on living with the rich. You think we live ON\nthe rich, rather than with them: and so we do, in a sense--but it's a\nprivilege we have to pay for! We eat their dinners, and drink their wine,\nand smoke their cigarettes, and use their carriages and their opera-boxes\nand their private cars--yes, but there's a tax to pay on every one of\nthose luxuries. The man pays it by big tips to the servants, by playing\ncards beyond his means, by flowers and presents--and--and--lots of other\nthings that cost; the girl pays it by tips and cards too--oh, yes, I've\nhad to take up bridge again--and by going to the best dress-makers, and\nhaving just the right dress for every occasion, and always keeping\nherself fresh and exquisite and amusing!\"\n\nShe leaned back for a moment, closing her eyes, and as she sat there, her\npale lips slightly parted, and the lids dropped above her fagged\nbrilliant gaze, Gerty had a startled perception of the change in her\nface--of the way in which an ashen daylight seemed suddenly to extinguish\nits artificial brightness. She looked up, and the vision vanished.\n\n\"It doesn't sound very amusing, does it? And it isn't--I'm sick to death\nof it! And yet the thought of giving it all up nearly kills me--it's what\nkeeps me awake at night, and makes me so crazy for your strong tea. For I\ncan't go on in this way much longer, you know--I'm nearly at the end of\nmy tether. And then what can I do--how on earth am I to keep myself\nalive? I see myself reduced to the fate of that poor Silverton\nwoman--slinking about to employment agencies, and trying to sell painted\nblotting-pads to Women's Exchanges! And there are thousands and thousands\nof women trying to do the same thing already, and not one of the number\nwho has less idea how to earn a dollar than I have!\"\n\nShe rose again with a hurried glance at the clock. \"It's late, and I must\nbe off--I have an appointment with Carry Fisher. Don't look so worried,\nyou dear thing--don't think too much about the nonsense I've been\ntalking.\" She was before the mirror again, adjusting her hair with a\nlight hand, drawing down her veil, and giving a dexterous touch to her\nfurs. \"Of course, you know, it hasn't come to the employment agencies and\nthe painted blotting-pads yet; but I'm rather hard-up just for the\nmoment, and if I could find something to do--notes to write and\nvisiting-lists to make up, or that kind of thing--it would tide me over\ntill the legacy is paid. And Carry has promised to find somebody who\nwants a kind of social secretary--you know she makes a specialty of the\nhelpless rich.\"\n\n\n\n\nMiss Bart had not revealed to Gerty the full extent of her anxiety. She\nwas in fact in urgent and immediate need of money: money to meet the\nvulgar weekly claims which could neither be deferred nor evaded. To give\nup her apartment, and shrink to the obscurity of a boarding-house, or the\nprovisional hospitality of a bed in Gerty Farish's sitting-room, was an\nexpedient which could only postpone the problem confronting her; and it\nseemed wiser as well as more agreeable to remain where she was and find\nsome means of earning her living. The possibility of having to do this\nwas one which she had never before seriously considered, and the\ndiscovery that, as a bread-winner, she was likely to prove as helpless\nand ineffectual as poor Miss Silverton, was a severe shock to her\nself-confidence.\n\nHaving been accustomed to take herself at the popular valuation, as a\nperson of energy and resource, naturally fitted to dominate any situation\nin which she found herself, she vaguely imagined that such gifts would be\nof value to seekers after social guidance; but there was unfortunately no\nspecific head under which the art of saying and doing the right thing\ncould be offered in the market, and even Mrs. Fisher's resourcefulness\nfailed before the difficulty of discovering a workable vein in the vague\nwealth of Lily's graces. Mrs. Fisher was full of indirect expedients for\nenabling her friends to earn a living, and could conscientiously assert\nthat she had put several opportunities of this kind before Lily; but more\nlegitimate methods of bread-winning were as much out of her line as they\nwere beyond the capacity of the sufferers she was generally called upon\nto assist. Lily's failure to profit by the chances already afforded her\nmight, moreover, have justified the abandonment of farther effort on her\nbehalf; but Mrs. Fisher's inexhaustible good-nature made her an adept at\ncreating artificial demands in response to an actual supply. In the\npursuance of this end she at once started on a voyage of discovery in\nMiss Bart's behalf; and as the result of her explorations she now\nsummoned the latter with the announcement that she had \"found something.\"\n\n\n\n\nLeft to herself, Gerty mused distressfully upon her friend's plight, and\nher own inability to relieve it. It was clear to her that Lily, for the\npresent, had no wish for the kind of help she could give. Miss Farish\ncould see no hope for her friend but in a life completely reorganized and\ndetached from its old associations; whereas all Lily's energies were\ncentred in the determined effort to hold fast to those associations, to\nkeep herself visibly identified with them, as long as the illusion could\nbe maintained. Pitiable as such an attitude seemed to Gerty, she could\nnot judge it as harshly as Selden, for instance, might have done. She had\nnot forgotten the night of emotion when she and Lily had lain in each\nother's arms, and she had seemed to feel her very heart's blood passing\ninto her friend. The sacrifice she had made had seemed unavailing enough;\nno trace remained in Lily of the subduing influences of that hour; but\nGerty's tenderness, disciplined by long years of contact with obscure and\ninarticulate suffering, could wait on its object with a silent\nforbearance which took no account of time. She could not, however, deny\nherself the solace of taking anxious counsel with Lawrence Selden, with\nwhom, since his return from Europe, she had renewed her old relation of\ncousinly confidence.\n\nSelden himself had never been aware of any change in their relation. He\nfound Gerty as he had left her, simple, undemanding and devoted, but with\na quickened intelligence of the heart which he recognized without seeking\nto explain it. To Gerty herself it would once have seemed impossible that\nshe should ever again talk freely with him of Lily Bart; but what had\npassed in the secrecy of her own breast seemed to resolve itself, when\nthe mist of the struggle cleared, into a breaking down of the bounds of\nself, a deflecting of the wasted personal emotion into the general\ncurrent of human understanding.\n\nIt was not till some two weeks after her visit from Lily that Gerty had\nthe opportunity of communicating her fears to Selden.  The latter, having\npresented himself on a Sunday afternoon, had lingered on through the\ndowdy animation of his cousin's tea-hour, conscious of something in her\nvoice and eye which solicited a word apart; and as soon as the last\nvisitor was gone Gerty opened her case by asking how lately he had seen\nMiss Bart.\n\nSelden's perceptible pause gave her time for a slight stir of surprise.\n\n\"I haven't seen her at all--I've perpetually missed seeing her since she\ncame back.\"\n\nThis unexpected admission made Gerty pause too; and she was still\nhesitating on the brink of her subject when he relieved her by adding:\n\"I've wanted to see her--but she seems to have been absorbed by the\nGormer set since her return from Europe.\"\n\n\"That's all the more reason: she's been very unhappy.\"\n\n\"Unhappy at being with the Gormers?\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't defend her intimacy with the Gormers; but that too is at an\nend now, I think. You know people have been very unkind since Bertha\nDorset quarrelled with her.\"\n\n\"Ah----\" Selden exclaimed, rising abruptly to walk to the window, where\nhe remained with his eyes on the darkening street while his cousin\ncontinued to explain: \"Judy Trenor and her own family have deserted her\ntoo--and all because Bertha Dorset has said such horrible things. And she\nis very poor--you know Mrs. Peniston cut her off with a small legacy,\nafter giving her to understand that she was to have everything.\"\n\n\"Yes--I know,\" Selden assented curtly, turning back into the room, but\nonly to stir about with restless steps in the circumscribed space between\ndoor and window. \"Yes--she's been abominably treated; but it's\nunfortunately the precise thing that a man who wants to show his sympathy\ncan't say to her.\"\n\nHis words caused Gerty a slight chill of disappointment. \"There would be\nother ways of showing your sympathy,\" she suggested.\n\nSelden, with a slight laugh, sat down beside her on the little sofa which\nprojected from the hearth. \"What are you thinking of, you incorrigible\nmissionary?\" he asked.\n\nGerty's colour rose, and her blush was for a moment her only answer.\nThen she made it more explicit by saying: \"I am thinking of the fact that\nyou and she used to be great friends--that she used to care immensely for\nwhat you thought of her--and that, if she takes your staying away as a\nsign of what you think now, I can imagine its adding a great deal to her\nunhappiness.\"\n\n\"My dear child, don't add to it still more--at least to your conception\nof it--by attributing to her all sorts of susceptibilities of your own.\"\nSelden, for his life, could not keep a note of dryness out of his voice;\nbut he met Gerty's look of perplexity by saying more mildly: \"But, though\nyou immensely exaggerate the importance of anything I could do for Miss\nBart, you can't exaggerate my readiness to do it--if you ask me to.\" He\nlaid his hand for a moment on hers, and there passed between them, on the\ncurrent of the rare contact, one of those exchanges of meaning which fill\nthe hidden reservoirs of affection.  Gerty had the feeling that he\nmeasured the cost of her request as plainly as she read the significance\nof his reply; and the sense of all that was suddenly clear between them\nmade her next words easier to find.\n\n\"I do ask you, then; I ask you because she once told me that you had been\na help to her, and because she needs help now as she has never needed it\nbefore. You know how dependent she has always been on ease and\nluxury--how she has hated what was shabby and ugly and uncomfortable. She\ncan't help it--she was brought up with those ideas, and has never been\nable to find her way out of them. But now all the things she cared for\nhave been taken from her, and the people who taught her to care for them\nhave abandoned her too; and it seems to me that if some one could reach\nout a hand and show her the other side--show her how much is left in life\nand in herself----\" Gerty broke off, abashed at the sound of her own\neloquence, and impeded by the difficulty of giving precise expression to\nher vague yearning for her friend's retrieval. \"I can't help her myself:\nshe's passed out of my reach,\" she continued. \"I think she's afraid of\nbeing a burden to me.  When she was last here, two weeks ago, she seemed\ndreadfully worried about her future: she said Carry Fisher was trying to\nfind something for her to do. A few days later she wrote me that she had\ntaken a position as private secretary, and that I was not to be anxious,\nfor everything was all right, and she would come in and tell me about it\nwhen she had time; but she has never come, and I don't like to go to her,\nbecause I am afraid of forcing myself on her when I'm not wanted.  Once,\nwhen we were children, and I had rushed up after a long separation, and\nthrown my arms about her, she said: 'Please don't kiss me unless I ask\nyou to, Gerty'--and she DID ask me, a minute later; but since then I've\nalways waited to be asked.\"\n\nSelden had listened in silence, with the concentrated look which his thin\ndark face could assume when he wished to guard it against any involuntary\nchange of expression. When his cousin ended, he said with a slight smile:\n\"Since you've learned the wisdom of waiting, I don't see why you urge me\nto rush in--\" but the troubled appeal of her eyes made him add, as he\nrose to take leave: \"Still, I'll do what you wish, and not hold you\nresponsible for my failure.\"\n\nSelden's avoidance of Miss Bart had not been as unintentional as he had\nallowed his cousin to think. At first, indeed, while the memory of their\nlast hour at Monte Carlo still held the full heat of his indignation, he\nhad anxiously watched for her return; but she had disappointed him by\nlingering in England, and when she finally reappeared it happened that\nbusiness had called him to the West, whence he came back only to learn\nthat she was starting for Alaska with the Gormers. The revelation of this\nsuddenly-established intimacy effectually chilled his desire to see her.\nIf, at a moment when her whole life seemed to be breaking up, she could\ncheerfully commit its reconstruction to the Gormers, there was no reason\nwhy such accidents should ever strike her as irreparable.  Every step she\ntook seemed in fact to carry her farther from the region where, once or\ntwice, he and she had met for an illumined moment; and the recognition of\nthis fact, when its first pang had been surmounted, produced in him a\nsense of negative relief. It was much simpler for him to judge Miss Bart\nby her habitual conduct than by the rare deviations from it which had\nthrown her so disturbingly in his way; and every act of hers which made\nthe recurrence of such deviations more unlikely, confirmed the sense of\nrelief with which he returned to the conventional view of her.\n\nBut Gerty Farish's words had sufficed to make him see how little this\nview was really his, and how impossible it was for him to live quietly\nwith the thought of Lily Bart. To hear that she was in need of help--even\nsuch vague help as he could offer--was to be at once repossessed by that\nthought; and by the time he reached the street he had sufficiently\nconvinced himself of the urgency of his cousin's appeal to turn his steps\ndirectly toward Lily's hotel.\n\nThere his zeal met a check in the unforeseen news that Miss Bart had\nmoved away; but, on his pressing his enquiries, the clerk remembered that\nshe had left an address, for which he presently began to search through\nhis books.\n\nIt was certainly strange that she should have taken this step without\nletting Gerty Farish know of her decision; and Selden waited with a vague\nsense of uneasiness while the address was sought for. The process lasted\nlong enough for uneasiness to turn to apprehension; but when at length a\nslip of paper was handed him, and he read on it: \"Care of Mrs. Norma\nHatch, Emporium Hotel,\" his apprehension passed into an incredulous\nstare, and this into the gesture of disgust with which he tore the paper\nin two, and turned to walk quickly homeward.\n\n\n\nWhen Lily woke on the morning after her translation to the Emporium\nHotel, her first feeling was one of purely physical satisfaction. The\nforce of contrast gave an added keenness to the luxury of lying once more\nin a soft-pillowed bed, and looking across a spacious sunlit room at a\nbreakfast-table set invitingly near the fire. Analysis and introspection\nmight come later; but for the moment she was not even troubled by the\nexcesses of the upholstery or the restless convolutions of the furniture.\nThe sense of being once more lapped and folded in ease, as in some dense\nmild medium impenetrable to discomfort, effectually stilled the faintest\nnote of criticism.\n\nWhen, the afternoon before, she had presented herself to the lady to whom\nCarry Fisher had directed her, she had been conscious of entering a new\nworld. Carry's vague presentment of Mrs. Norma Hatch (whose reversion to\nher Christian name was explained as the result of her latest divorce),\nleft her under the implication of coming \"from the West,\" with the not\nunusual extenuation of having brought a great deal of money with her. She\nwas, in short, rich, helpless, unplaced: the very subject for Lily's\nhand. Mrs. Fisher had not specified the line her friend was to take; she\nowned herself unacquainted with Mrs. Hatch, whom she \"knew about\" through\nMelville Stancy, a lawyer in his leisure moments, and the Falstaff of a\ncertain section of festive club life.  Socially, Mr. Stancy might have\nbeen said to form a connecting link between the Gormer world and the more\ndimly-lit region on which Miss Bart now found herself entering. It was,\nhowever, only figuratively that the illumination of Mrs. Hatch's world\ncould be described as dim: in actual fact, Lily found her seated in a\nblaze of electric light, impartially projected from various ornamental\nexcrescences on a vast concavity of pink damask and gilding, from which\nshe rose like Venus from her shell. The analogy was justified by the\nappearance of the lady, whose large-eyed prettiness had the fixity of\nsomething impaled and shown under glass. This did not preclude the\nimmediate discovery that she was some years younger than her visitor, and\nthat under her showiness, her ease, the aggression of her dress and\nvoice, there persisted that ineradicable innocence which, in ladies of\nher nationality, so curiously coexists with startling extremes of\nexperience.\n\nThe environment in which Lily found herself was as strange to her as its\ninhabitants. She was unacquainted with the world of the fashionable New\nYork hotel--a world over-heated, over-upholstered, and over-fitted with\nmechanical appliances for the gratification of fantastic requirements,\nwhile the comforts of a civilized life were as unattainable as in a\ndesert. Through this atmosphere of torrid splendour moved wan beings as\nrichly upholstered as the furniture, beings without definite pursuits or\npermanent relations, who drifted on a languid tide of curiosity from\nrestaurant to concert-hall, from palm-garden to music-room, from \"art\nexhibit\" to dress-maker's opening.  High-stepping horses or elaborately\nequipped motors waited to carry these ladies into vague metropolitan\ndistances, whence they returned, still more wan from the weight of their\nsables, to be sucked back into the stifling inertia of the hotel routine.\nSomewhere behind them, in the background of their lives, there was\ndoubtless a real past, peopled by real human activities: they themselves\nwere probably the product of strong ambitions, persistent energies,\ndiversified contacts with the wholesome roughness of life; yet they had\nno more real existence than the poet's shades in limbo.\n\nLily had not been long in this pallid world without discovering that Mrs.\nHatch was its most substantial figure. That lady, though still floating\nin the void, showed faint symptoms of developing an outline; and in this\nendeavour she was actively seconded by Mr. Melville Stancy.  It was Mr.\nStancy, a man of large resounding presence, suggestive of convivial\noccasions and of a chivalry finding expression in \"first-night\" boxes and\nthousand dollar bonbonnieres, who had transplanted Mrs. Hatch from the\nscene of her first development to the higher stage of hotel life in the\nmetropolis. It was he who had selected the horses with which she had\ntaken the blue ribbon at the Show, had introduced her to the photographer\nwhose portraits of her formed the recurring ornament of \"Sunday\nSupplements,\" and had got together the group which constituted her social\nworld. It was a small group still, with heterogeneous figures suspended\nin large unpeopled spaces; but Lily did not take long to learn that its\nregulation was no longer in Mr. Stancy's hands. As often happens, the\npupil had outstripped the teacher, and Mrs. Hatch was already aware of\nheights of elegance as well as depths of luxury beyond the world of the\nEmporium.  This discovery at once produced in her a craving for higher\nguidance, for the adroit feminine hand which should give the right turn\nto her correspondence, the right \"look\" to her hats, the right succession\nto the items of her MENUS. It was, in short, as the regulator of a\ngerminating social life that Miss Bart's guidance was required; her\nostensible duties as secretary being restricted by the fact that Mrs.\nHatch, as yet, knew hardly any one to write to.\n\nThe daily details of Mrs. Hatch's existence were as strange to Lily as\nits general tenor. The lady's habits were marked by an Oriental indolence\nand disorder peculiarly trying to her companion. Mrs. Hatch and her\nfriends seemed to float together outside the bounds of time and space. No\ndefinite hours were kept; no fixed obligations existed: night and day\nflowed into one another in a blur of confused and retarded engagements,\nso that one had the impression of lunching at the tea-hour, while dinner\nwas often merged in the noisy after-theatre supper which prolonged Mrs.\nHatch's vigil till daylight.\n\nThrough this jumble of futile activities came and went a strange throng\nof hangers-on--manicures, beauty-doctors, hair-dressers, teachers of\nbridge, of French, of \"physical development\": figures sometimes\nindistinguishable, by their appearance, or by Mrs. Hatch's relation to\nthem, from the visitors constituting her recognized society. But\nstrangest of all to Lily was the encounter, in this latter group, of\nseveral of her acquaintances.  She had supposed, and not without relief,\nthat she was passing, for the moment, completely out of her own circle;\nbut she found that Mr. Stancy, one side of whose sprawling existence\noverlapped the edge of Mrs. Fisher's world, had drawn several of its\nbrightest ornaments into the circle of the Emporium. To find Ned\nSilverton among the habitual frequenters of Mrs. Hatch's drawing-room was\none of Lily's first astonishments; but she soon discovered that he was\nnot Mr. Stancy's most important recruit. It was on little Freddy Van\nOsburgh, the small slim heir of the Van Osburgh millions, that the\nattention of Mrs. Hatch's group was centred. Freddy, barely out of\ncollege, had risen above the horizon since Lily's eclipse, and she now\nsaw with surprise what an effulgence he shed on the outer twilight of\nMrs. Hatch's existence. This, then, was one of the things that young men\n\"went in\" for when released from the official social routine; this was\nthe kind of \"previous engagement\" that so frequently caused them to\ndisappoint the hopes of anxious hostesses. Lily had an odd sense of being\nbehind the social tapestry, on the side where the threads were knotted\nand the loose ends hung. For a moment she found a certain amusement in\nthe show, and in her own share of it: the situation had an ease and\nunconventionality distinctly refreshing after her experience of the irony\nof conventions. But these flashes of amusement were but brief reactions\nfrom the long disgust of her days. Compared with the vast gilded void of\nMrs. Hatch's existence, the life of Lily's former friends seemed packed\nwith ordered activities. Even the most irresponsible pretty woman of her\nacquaintance had her inherited obligations, her conventional\nbenevolences, her share in the working of the great civic machine; and\nall hung together in the solidarity of these traditional functions. The\nperformance of specific duties would have simplified Miss Bart's\nposition; but the vague attendance on Mrs. Hatch was not without its\nperplexities.\n\nIt was not her employer who created these perplexities. Mrs. Hatch showed\nfrom the first an almost touching desire for Lily's approval.  Far from\nasserting the superiority of wealth, her beautiful eyes seemed to urge\nthe plea of inexperience: she wanted to do what was \"nice,\" to be taught\nhow to be \"lovely.\" The difficulty was to find any point of contact\nbetween her ideals and Lily's.\n\nMrs. Hatch swam in a haze of indeterminate enthusiasms, of aspirations\nculled from the stage, the newspapers, the fashion journals, and a gaudy\nworld of sport still more completely beyond her companion's ken.  To\nseparate from these confused conceptions those most likely to advance the\nlady on her way, was Lily's obvious duty; but its performance was\nhampered by rapidly-growing doubts. Lily was in fact becoming more and\nmore aware of a certain ambiguity in her situation.  It was not that she\nhad, in the conventional sense, any doubt of Mrs. Hatch's\nirreproachableness. The lady's offences were always against taste rather\nthan conduct; her divorce record seemed due to geographical rather than\nethical conditions; and her worst laxities were likely to proceed from a\nwandering and extravagant good-nature.  But if Lily did not mind her\ndetaining her manicure for luncheon, or offering the \"Beauty-Doctor\" a\nseat in Freddy Van Osburgh's box at the play, she was not equally at ease\nin regard to some less apparent lapses from convention. Ned Silverton's\nrelation to Stancy seemed, for instance, closer and less clear than any\nnatural affinities would warrant; and both appeared united in the effort\nto cultivate Freddy Van Osburgh's growing taste for Mrs. Hatch. There was\nas yet nothing definable in the situation, which might well resolve\nitself into a huge joke on the part of the other two; but Lily had a\nvague sense that the subject of their experiment was too young, too rich\nand too credulous.  Her embarrassment was increased by the fact that\nFreddy seemed to regard her as cooperating with himself in the social\ndevelopment of Mrs. Hatch: a view that suggested, on his part, a\npermanent interest in the lady's future. There were moments when Lily\nfound an ironic amusement in this aspect of the case. The thought of\nlaunching such a missile as Mrs. Hatch at the perfidious bosom of society\nwas not without its charm: Miss Bart had even beguiled her leisure with\nvisions of the fair Norma introduced for the first time to a family\nbanquet at the Van Osburghs'. But the thought of being personally\nconnected with the transaction was less agreeable; and her momentary\nflashes of amusement were followed by increasing periods of doubt.\n\nThe sense of these doubts was uppermost when, late one afternoon, she was\nsurprised by a visit from Lawrence Selden. He found her alone in the\nwilderness of pink damask, for in Mrs. Hatch's world the tea-hour was not\ndedicated to social rites, and the lady was in the hands of her masseuse.\n\n### Summary:"}
{"original_length": 17326, "trunc_length": 16384, "text": "\n\nSummarize the following text into a summary of less than 800 words.\n### Text:\n\n\n\"Look at those spangles, Miss Bart--every one of 'em sewed on crooked.\"\n\nThe tall forewoman, a pinched perpendicular figure, dropped the condemned\nstructure of wire and net on the table at Lily's side, and passed on to\nthe next figure in the line.\n\nThere were twenty of them in the work-room, their fagged profiles, under\nexaggerated hair, bowed in the harsh north light above the utensils of\ntheir art; for it was something more than an industry, surely, this\ncreation of ever-varied settings for the face of fortunate womanhood.\nTheir own faces were sallow with the unwholesomeness of hot air and\nsedentary toil, rather than with any actual signs of want: they were\nemployed in a fashionable millinery establishment, and were fairly well\nclothed and well paid; but the youngest among them was as dull and\ncolourless as the middle-aged. In the whole work-room there was only one\nskin beneath which the blood still visibly played; and that now burned\nwith vexation as Miss Bart, under the lash of the forewoman's comment,\nbegan to strip the hat-frame of its over-lapping spangles.\n\nTo Gerty Farish's hopeful spirit a solution appeared to have been reached\nwhen she remembered how beautifully Lily could trim hats.  Instances of\nyoung lady-milliners establishing themselves under fashionable patronage,\nand imparting to their \"creations\" that indefinable touch which the\nprofessional hand can never give, had flattered Gerty's visions of the\nfuture, and convinced even Lily that her separation from Mrs. Norma Hatch\nneed not reduce her to dependence on her friends.\n\nThe parting had occurred a few weeks after Selden's visit, and would have\ntaken place sooner had it not been for the resistance set up in Lily by\nhis ill-starred offer of advice. The sense of being involved in a\ntransaction she would not have cared to examine too closely had soon\nafterward defined itself in the light of a hint from Mr. Stancy that, if\nshe \"saw them through,\" she would have no reason to be sorry. The\nimplication that such loyalty would meet with a direct reward had\nhastened her flight, and flung her back, ashamed and penitent, on the\nbroad bosom of Gerty's sympathy. She did not, however, propose to lie\nthere prone, and Gerty's inspiration about the hats at once revived her\nhopes of profitable activity. Here was, after all, something that her\ncharming listless hands could really do; she had no doubt of their\ncapacity for knotting a ribbon or placing a flower to advantage. And of\ncourse only these finishing touches would be expected of her: subordinate\nfingers, blunt, grey, needle-pricked fingers, would prepare the shapes\nand stitch the linings, while she presided over the charming little front\nshop--a shop all white panels, mirrors, and moss-green hangings--where\nher finished creations, hats, wreaths, aigrettes and the rest, perched on\ntheir stands like birds just poising for flight.\n\nBut at the very outset of Gerty's campaign this vision of the\ngreen-and-white shop had been dispelled. Other young ladies of fashion\nhad been thus \"set-up,\" selling their hats by the mere attraction of a\nname and the reputed knack of tying a bow; but these privileged beings\ncould command a faith in their powers materially expressed by the\nreadiness to pay their shop-rent and advance a handsome sum for current\nexpenses. Where was Lily to find such support? And even could it have\nbeen found, how were the ladies on whose approval she depended to be\ninduced to give her their patronage? Gerty learned that whatever sympathy\nher friend's case might have excited a few months since had been\nimperilled, if not lost, by her association with Mrs. Hatch. Once again,\nLily had withdrawn from an ambiguous situation in time to save her\nself-respect, but too late for public vindication.  Freddy Van Osburgh\nwas not to marry Mrs. Hatch; he had been rescued at the eleventh\nhour--some said by the efforts of Gus Trenor and Rosedale--and despatched\nto Europe with old Ned Van Alstyne; but the risk he had run would always\nbe ascribed to Miss Bart's connivance, and would somehow serve as a\nsumming-up and corroboration of the vague general distrust of her. It was\na relief to those who had hung back from her to find themselves thus\njustified, and they were inclined to insist a little on her connection\nwith the Hatch case in order to show that they had been right.\n\nGerty's quest, at any rate, brought up against a solid wall of\nresistance; and even when Carry Fisher, momentarily penitent for her\nshare in the Hatch affair, joined her efforts to Miss Farish's, they met\nwith no better success. Gerty had tried to veil her failure in tender\nambiguities; but Carry, always the soul of candour, put the case squarely\nto her friend.\n\n\"I went straight to Judy Trenor; she has fewer prejudices than the\nothers, and besides she's always hated Bertha Dorset. But what HAVE you\ndone to her, Lily? At the very first word about giving you a start she\nflamed out about some money you'd got from Gus; I never knew her so hot\nbefore. You know she'll let him do anything but spend money on his\nfriends: the only reason she's decent to me now is that she knows I'm not\nhard up.--He speculated for you, you say? Well, what's the harm? He had\nno business to lose. He DIDN'T lose? Then what on earth--but I never\nCOULD understand you, Lily!\"\n\nThe end of it was that, after anxious enquiry and much deliberation, Mrs.\nFisher and Gerty, for once oddly united in their effort to help their\nfriend, decided on placing her in the work-room of Mme. Regina's renowned\nmillinery establishment. Even this arrangement was not effected without\nconsiderable negotiation, for Mme. Regina had a strong prejudice against\nuntrained assistance, and was induced to yield only by the fact that she\nowed the patronage of Mrs. Bry and Mrs. Gormer to Carry Fisher's\ninfluence. She had been willing from the first to employ Lily in the\nshow-room: as a displayer of hats, a fashionable beauty might be a\nvaluable asset. But to this suggestion Miss Bart opposed a negative which\nGerty emphatically supported, while Mrs. Fisher, inwardly unconvinced,\nbut resigned to this latest proof of Lily's unreason, agreed that perhaps\nin the end it would be more useful that she should learn the trade. To\nRegina's work-room Lily was therefore committed by her friends, and there\nMrs. Fisher left her with a sigh of relief, while Gerty's watchfulness\ncontinued to hover over her at a distance.\n\nLily had taken up her work early in January: it was now two months later,\nand she was still being rebuked for her inability to sew spangles on a\nhat-frame. As she returned to her work she heard a titter pass down the\ntables. She knew she was an object of criticism and amusement to the\nother work-women. They were, of course, aware of her history--the exact\nsituation of every girl in the room was known and freely discussed by all\nthe others--but the knowledge did not produce in them any awkward sense\nof class distinction: it merely explained why her untutored fingers were\nstill blundering over the rudiments of the trade.  Lily had no desire\nthat they should recognize any social difference in her; but she had\nhoped to be received as their equal, and perhaps before long to show\nherself their superior by a special deftness of touch, and it was\nhumiliating to find that, after two months of drudgery, she still\nbetrayed her lack of early training.  Remote was the day when she might\naspire to exercise the talents she felt confident of possessing; only\nexperienced workers were entrusted with the delicate art of shaping and\ntrimming the hat, and the forewoman still held her inexorably to the\nroutine of preparatory work.\n\nShe began to rip the spangles from the frame, listening absently to the\nbuzz of talk which rose and fell with the coming and going of Miss\nHaines's active figure. The air was closer than usual, because Miss\nHaines, who had a cold, had not allowed a window to be opened even during\nthe noon recess; and Lily's head was so heavy with the weight of a\nsleepless night that the chatter of her companions had the incoherence of\na dream.\n\n\"I TOLD her he'd never look at her again; and he didn't. I wouldn't have,\neither--I think she acted real mean to him. He took her to the Arion\nBall, and had a hack for her both ways....  She's taken ten bottles, and\nher headaches don't seem no better--but she's written a testimonial to\nsay the first bottle cured her, and she got five dollars and her picture\nin the paper.... Mrs. Trenor's hat? The one with the green Paradise?\nHere, Miss Haines--it'll be ready right off.... That was one of the\nTrenor girls here yesterday with Mrs. George Dorset.  How'd I know? Why,\nMadam sent for me to alter the flower in that Virot hat--the blue tulle:\nshe's tall and slight, with her hair fuzzed out--a good deal like Mamie\nLeach, on'y thinner....\"\n\nOn and on it flowed, a current of meaningless sound, on which,\nstartlingly enough, a familiar name now and then floated to the surface.\nIt was the strangest part of Lily's strange experience, the hearing of\nthese names, the seeing the fragmentary and distorted image of the world\nshe had lived in reflected in the mirror of the working-girls' minds. She\nhad never before suspected the mixture of insatiable curiosity and\ncontemptuous freedom with which she and her kind were discussed in this\nunderworld of toilers who lived on their vanity and self-indulgence.\nEvery girl in Mme. Regina's work-room knew to whom the headgear in her\nhands was destined, and had her opinion of its future wearer, and a\ndefinite knowledge of the latter's place in the social system. That Lily\nwas a star fallen from that sky did not, after the first stir of\ncuriosity had subsided, materially add to their interest in her. She had\nfallen, she had \"gone under,\" and true to the ideal of their race, they\nwere awed only by success--by the gross tangible image of material\nachievement. The consciousness of her different point of view merely kept\nthem at a little distance from her, as though she were a foreigner with\nwhom it was an effort to talk.\n\n\"Miss Bart, if you can't sew those spangles on more regular I guess you'd\nbetter give the hat to Miss Kilroy.\"\n\nLily looked down ruefully at her handiwork. The forewoman was right: the\nsewing on of the spangles was inexcusably bad. What made her so much more\nclumsy than usual? Was it a growing distaste for her task, or actual\nphysical disability? She felt tired and confused: it was an effort to put\nher thoughts together. She rose and handed the hat to Miss Kilroy, who\ntook it with a suppressed smile.\n\n\"I'm sorry; I'm afraid I am not well,\" she said to the forewoman.\n\nMiss Haines offered no comment. From the first she had augured ill of\nMme. Regina's consenting to include a fashionable apprentice among her\nworkers. In that temple of art no raw beginners were wanted, and Miss\nHaines would have been more than human had she not taken a certain\npleasure in seeing her forebodings confirmed.\n\n\"You'd better go back to binding edges,\" she said drily. Lily slipped out\nlast among the band of liberated work-women. She did not care to be\nmingled in their noisy dispersal: once in the street, she always felt an\nirresistible return to her old standpoint, an instinctive shrinking from\nall that was unpolished and promiscuous. In the days--how distant they\nnow seemed!--when she had visited the Girls' Club with Gerty Farish, she\nhad felt an enlightened interest in the working-classes; but that was\nbecause she looked down on them from above, from the happy altitude of\nher grace and her beneficence. Now that she was on a level with them, the\npoint of view was less interesting.\n\nShe felt a touch on her arm, and met the penitent eye of Miss Kilroy.\n\"Miss Bart, I guess you can sew those spangles on as well as I can when\nyou're feeling right. Miss Haines didn't act fair to you.\"\n\nLily's colour rose at the unexpected advance: it was a long time since\nreal kindness had looked at her from any eyes but Gerty's.\n\n\"Oh, thank you: I'm not particularly well, but Miss Haines was right. I\nAM clumsy.\"\n\n\"Well, it's mean work for anybody with a headache.\" Miss Kilroy paused\nirresolutely. \"You ought to go right home and lay down.  Ever try\norangeine?\"\n\n\"Thank you.\" Lily held out her hand. \"It's very kind of you--I mean to go\nhome.\"\n\nShe looked gratefully at Miss Kilroy, but neither knew what more to say.\nLily was aware that the other was on the point of offering to go home\nwith her, but she wanted to be alone and silent--even kindness, the sort\nof kindness that Miss Kilroy could give, would have jarred on her just\nthen.\n\n\"Thank you,\" she repeated as she turned away.\n\nShe struck westward through the dreary March twilight, toward the street\nwhere her boarding-house stood. She had resolutely refused Gerty's offer\nof hospitality. Something of her mother's fierce shrinking from\nobservation and sympathy was beginning to develop in her, and the\npromiscuity of small quarters and close intimacy seemed, on the whole,\nless endurable than the solitude of a hall bedroom in a house where she\ncould come and go unremarked among other workers. For a while she had\nbeen sustained by this desire for privacy and independence; but now,\nperhaps from increasing physical weariness, the lassitude brought about\nby hours of unwonted confinement, she was beginning to feel acutely the\nugliness and discomfort of her surroundings. The day's task done, she\ndreaded to return to her narrow room, with its blotched wallpaper and\nshabby paint; and she hated every step of the walk thither, through the\ndegradation of a New York street in the last stages of decline from\nfashion to commerce.\n\nBut what she dreaded most of all was having to pass the chemist's at the\ncorner of Sixth Avenue. She had meant to take another street: she had\nusually done so of late. But today her steps were irresistibly drawn\ntoward the flaring plate-glass corner; she tried to take the lower\ncrossing, but a laden dray crowded her back, and she struck across the\nstreet obliquely, reaching the sidewalk just opposite the chemist's door.\n\nOver the counter she caught the eye of the clerk who had waited on her\nbefore, and slipped the prescription into his hand. There could be no\nquestion about the prescription: it was a copy of one of Mrs. Hatch's,\nobligingly furnished by that lady's chemist.  Lily was confident that the\nclerk would fill it without hesitation; yet the nervous dread of a\nrefusal, or even of an expression of doubt, communicated itself to her\nrestless hands as she affected to examine the bottles of perfume stacked\non the glass case before her.\n\nThe clerk had read the prescription without comment; but in the act of\nhanding out the bottle he paused.\n\n\"You don't want to increase the dose, you know,\" he remarked.  Lily's\nheart contracted.\n\nWhat did he mean by looking at her in that way?\n\n\"Of course not,\" she murmured, holding out her hand.\n\n\"That's all right: it's a queer-acting drug. A drop or two more, and off\nyou go--the doctors don't know why.\"\n\nThe dread lest he should question her, or keep the bottle back, choked\nthe murmur of acquiescence in her throat; and when at length she emerged\nsafely from the shop she was almost dizzy with the intensity of her\nrelief. The mere touch of the packet thrilled her tired nerves with the\ndelicious promise of a night of sleep, and in the reaction from her\nmomentary fear she felt as if the first fumes of drowsiness were already\nstealing over her.\n\nIn her confusion she stumbled against a man who was hurrying down the\nlast steps of the elevated station. He drew back, and she heard her name\nuttered with surprise. It was Rosedale, fur-coated, glossy and\nprosperous--but why did she seem to see him so far off, and as if through\na mist of splintered crystals?  Before she could account for the\nphenomenon she found herself shaking hands with him. They had parted with\nscorn on her side and anger upon his; but all trace of these emotions\nseemed to vanish as their hands met, and she was only aware of a confused\nwish that she might continue to hold fast to him.\n\n\"Why, what's the matter, Miss Lily? You're not well!\" he exclaimed; and\nshe forced her lips into a pallid smile of reassurance.\n\n\"I'm a little tired--it's nothing. Stay with me a moment, please,\" she\nfaltered. That she should be asking this service of Rosedale!\n\nHe glanced at the dirty and unpropitious corner on which they stood, with\nthe shriek of the \"elevated\" and the tumult of trams and waggons\ncontending hideously in their ears.\n\n\"We can't stay here; but let me take you somewhere for a cup of tea.  The\nLONGWORTH is only a few yards off, and there'll be no one there at this\nhour.\"\n\nA cup of tea in quiet, somewhere out of the noise and ugliness, seemed\nfor the moment the one solace she could bear. A few steps brought them to\nthe ladies' door of the hotel he had named, and a moment later he was\nseated opposite to her, and the waiter had placed the tea-tray between\nthem.\n\n\"Not a drop of brandy or whiskey first? You look regularly done up, Miss\nLily. Well, take your tea strong, then; and, waiter, get a cushion for\nthe lady's back.\"\n\nLily smiled faintly at the injunction to take her tea strong. It was the\ntemptation she was always struggling to resist. Her craving for the keen\nstimulant was forever conflicting with that other craving for sleep--the\nmidnight craving which only the little phial in her hand could still. But\ntoday, at any rate, the tea could hardly be too strong: she counted on it\nto pour warmth and resolution into her empty veins.\n\nAs she leaned back before him, her lids drooping in utter lassitude,\nthough the first warm draught already tinged her face with returning\nlife, Rosedale was seized afresh by the poignant surprise of her beauty.\nThe dark pencilling of fatigue under her eyes, the morbid blue-veined\npallour of the temples, brought out the brightness of her hair and lips,\nas though all her ebbing vitality were centred there.  Against the dull\nchocolate-coloured background of the restaurant, the purity of her head\nstood out as it had never done in the most brightly-lit ball-room. He\nlooked at her with a startled uncomfortable feeling, as though her beauty\nwere a forgotten enemy that had lain in ambush and now sprang out on him\nunawares.\n\nTo clear the air he tried to take an easy tone with her. \"Why, Miss Lily,\nI haven't seen you for an age. I didn't know what had become of you.\"\n\nAs he spoke, he was checked by an embarrassing sense of the complications\nto which this might lead. Though he had not seen her he had heard of her;\nhe knew of her connection with Mrs. Hatch, and of the talk resulting from\nit. Mrs. Hatch's MILIEU was one which he had once assiduously frequented,\nand now as devoutly shunned.\n\nLily, to whom the tea had restored her usual clearness of mind, saw what\nwas in his thoughts and said with a slight smile: \"You would not be\nlikely to know about me. I have joined the working classes.\"\n\nHe stared in genuine wonder. \"You don't mean--? Why, what on earth are\nyou doing?\"\n\n\"Learning to be a milliner--at least TRYING to learn,\" she hastily\nqualified the statement.\n\nRosedale suppressed a low whistle of surprise. \"Come off--you ain't\nserious, are you?\"\n\n\"Perfectly serious. I'm obliged to work for my living.\"\n\n\"But I understood--I thought you were with Norma Hatch.\"\n\n\"You heard I had gone to her as her secretary?\"\n\n\"Something of the kind, I believe.\" He leaned forward to refill her cup.\n\nLily guessed the possibilities of embarrassment which the topic held for\nhim, and raising her eyes to his, she said suddenly: \"I left her two\nmonths ago.\"\n\nRosedale continued to fumble awkwardly with the tea-pot, and she felt\nsure that he had heard what had been said of her. But what was there that\nRosedale did not hear?\n\n\"Wasn't it a soft berth?\" he enquired, with an attempt at lightness.\n\n\"Too soft--one might have sunk in too deep.\" Lily rested one arm on the\nedge of the table, and sat looking at him more intently than she had ever\nlooked before. An uncontrollable impulse was urging her to put her case\nto this man, from whose curiosity she had always so fiercely defended\nherself.\n\n\"You know Mrs. Hatch, I think? Well, perhaps you can understand that she\nmight make things too easy for one.\"\n\nRosedale looked faintly puzzled, and she remembered that allusiveness was\nlost on him.\n\n\"It was no place for you, anyhow,\" he agreed, so suffused and immersed in\nthe light of her full gaze that he found himself being drawn into strange\ndepths of intimacy. He who had had to subsist on mere fugitive glances,\nlooks winged in flight and swiftly lost under covert, now found her eyes\nsettling on him with a brooding intensity that fairly dazzled him.\n\n\"I left,\" Lily continued, \"lest people should say I was helping Mrs.\nHatch to marry Freddy Van Osburgh--who is not in the least too good for\nher--and as they still continue to say it, I see that I might as well\nhave stayed where I was.\"\n\n\"Oh, Freddy----\" Rosedale brushed aside the topic with an air of its\nunimportance which gave a sense of the immense perspective he had\nacquired. \"Freddy don't count--but I knew YOU weren't mixed up in that.\nIt ain't your style.\"\n\nLily coloured slightly: she could not conceal from herself that the words\ngave her pleasure. She would have liked to sit there, drinking more tea,\nand continuing to talk of herself to Rosedale.  But the old habit of\nobserving the conventions reminded her that it was time to bring their\ncolloquy to an end, and she made a faint motion to push back her chair.\n\nRosedale stopped her with a protesting gesture. \"Wait a minute--don't go\nyet; sit quiet and rest a little longer. You look thoroughly played out.\nAnd you haven't told me----\" He broke off, conscious of going farther\nthan he had meant. She saw the struggle and understood it; understood\nalso the nature of the spell to which he yielded as, with his eyes on her\nface, he began again abruptly: \"What on earth did you mean by saying just\nnow that you were learning to be a milliner?\"\n\n\"Just what I said. I am an apprentice at Regina's.\"\n\n\"Good Lord--YOU? But what for? I knew your aunt had turned you down: Mrs.\nFisher told me about it. But I understood you got a legacy from her----\"\n\n\"I got ten thousand dollars; but the legacy is not to be paid till next\nsummer.\"\n\n\"Well, but--look here: you could BORROW on it any time you wanted.\"\n\nShe shook her head gravely. \"No; for I owe it already.\"\n\n\"Owe it? The whole ten thousand?\"\n\n\"Every penny.\" She paused, and then continued abruptly, with her eyes on\nhis face: \"I think Gus Trenor spoke to you once about having made some\nmoney for me in stocks.\"\n\nShe waited, and Rosedale, congested with embarrassment, muttered that he\nremembered something of the kind.\n\n\"He made about nine thousand dollars,\" Lily pursued, in the same tone of\neager communicativeness. \"At the time, I understood that he was\nspeculating with my own money: it was incredibly stupid of me, but I knew\nnothing of business. Afterward I found out that he had NOT used my\nmoney--that what he said he had made for me he had really given me. It\nwas meant in kindness, of course; but it was not the sort of obligation\none could remain under.  Unfortunately I had spent the money before I\ndiscovered my mistake; and so my legacy will have to go to pay it back.\nThat is the reason why I am trying to learn a trade.\"\n\nShe made the statement clearly, deliberately, with pauses between the\nsentences, so that each should have time to sink deeply into her hearer's\nmind. She had a passionate desire that some one should know the truth\nabout this transaction, and also that the rumour of her intention to\nrepay the money should reach Judy Trenor's ears. And it had suddenly\noccurred to her that Rosedale, who had surprised Trenor's confidence, was\nthe fitting person to receive and transmit her version of the facts. She\nhad even felt a momentary exhilaration at the thought of thus relieving\nherself of her detested secret; but the sensation gradually faded in the\ntelling, and as she ended her pallour was suffused with a deep blush of\nmisery.\n\nRosedale continued to stare at her in wonder; but the wonder took the\nturn she had least expected.\n\n\"But see here--if that's the case, it cleans you out altogether?\"\n\nHe put it to her as if she had not grasped the consequences of her act;\nas if her incorrigible ignorance of business were about to precipitate\nher into a fresh act of folly.\n\n\"Altogether--yes,\" she calmly agreed.\n\nHe sat silent, his thick hands clasped on the table, his little puzzled\neyes exploring the recesses of the deserted restaurant.\n\n\"See here--that's fine,\" he exclaimed abruptly.\n\nLily rose from her seat with a deprecating laugh. \"Oh, no--it's merely a\nbore,\" she asserted, gathering together the ends of her feather scarf.\n\nRosedale remained seated, too intent on his thoughts to notice her\nmovement. \"Miss Lily, if you want any backing--I like pluck----\" broke\nfrom him disconnectedly.\n\n\"Thank you.\" She held out her hand. \"Your tea has given me a tremendous\nbacking. I feel equal to anything now.\"\n\nHer gesture seemed to show a definite intention of dismissal, but her\ncompanion had tossed a bill to the waiter, and was slipping his short\narms into his expensive overcoat.\n\n\"Wait a minute--you've got to let me walk home with you,\" he said.\n\nLily uttered no protest, and when he had paused to make sure of his\nchange they emerged from the hotel and crossed Sixth Avenue again. As she\nled the way westward past a long line of areas which, through the\ndistortion of their paintless rails, revealed with increasing candour the\nDISJECTA MEMBRA of bygone dinners, Lily felt that Rosedale was taking\ncontemptuous note of the neighbourhood; and before the doorstep at which\nshe finally paused he looked up with an air of incredulous disgust.\n\n\"This isn't the place? Some one told me you were living with Miss Farish.\"\n\n\"No: I am boarding here. I have lived too long on my friends.\"\n\nHe continued to scan the blistered brown stone front, the windows draped\nwith discoloured lace, and the Pompeian decoration of the muddy\nvestibule; then he looked back at her face and said with a visible\neffort: \"You'll let me come and see you some day?\"\n\nShe smiled, recognizing the heroism of the offer to the point of being\nfrankly touched by it. \"Thank you--I shall be very glad,\" she made\nanswer, in the first sincere words she had ever spoken to him.\n\n\n\nThat evening in her own room Miss Bart--who had fled early from the heavy\nfumes of the basement dinner-table--sat musing upon the impulse which had\nled her to unbosom herself to Rosedale. Beneath it she discovered an\nincreasing sense of loneliness--a dread of returning to the solitude of\nher room, while she could be anywhere else, or in any company but her\nown. Circumstances, of late, had combined to cut her off more and more\nfrom her few remaining friends. On Carry Fisher's part the withdrawal was\nperhaps not quite involuntary. Having made her final effort on Lily's\nbehalf, and landed her safely in Mme. Regina's work-room, Mrs. Fisher\nseemed disposed to rest from her labours; and Lily, understanding the\nreason, could not condemn her. Carry had in fact come dangerously near to\nbeing involved in the episode of Mrs. Norma Hatch, and it had taken some\nverbal ingenuity to extricate herself. She frankly owned to having\nbrought Lily and Mrs. Hatch together, but then she did not know Mrs.\nHatch--she had expressly warned Lily that she did not know Mrs.\nHatch--and besides, she was not Lily's keeper, and really the girl was\nold enough to take care of herself. Carry did not put her own case so\nbrutally, but she allowed it to be thus put for her by her latest bosom\nfriend, Mrs. Jack Stepney: Mrs. Stepney, trembling over the narrowness of\nher only brother's escape, but eager to vindicate Mrs. Fisher, at whose\nhouse she could count on the \"jolly parties\" which had become a necessity\nto her since marriage had emancipated her from the Van Osburgh point of\nview.\n\nLily understood the situation and could make allowances for it.  Carry\nhad been a good friend to her in difficult days, and perhaps only a\nfriendship like Gerty's could be proof against such an increasing strain.\nGerty's friendship did indeed hold fast; yet Lily was beginning to avoid\nher also. For she could not go to Gerty's without risk of meeting Selden;\nand to meet him now would be pure pain. It was pain enough even to think\nof him, whether she considered him in the distinctness of her waking\nthoughts, or felt the obsession of his presence through the blur of her\ntormented nights. That was one of the reasons why she had turned again to\nMrs. Hatch's prescription. In the uneasy snatches of her natural dreams\nhe came to her sometimes in the old guise of fellowship and tenderness;\nand she would rise from the sweet delusion mocked and emptied of her\ncourage. But in the sleep which the phial procured she sank far below\nsuch half-waking visitations, sank into depths of dreamless annihilation\nfrom which she woke each morning with an obliterated past.\n\nGradually, to be sure, the stress of the old thoughts would return; but\nat least they did not importune her waking hour. The drug gave her a\nmomentary illusion of complete renewal, from which she drew strength to\ntake up her daily work. The strength was more and more needed as the\nperplexities of her future increased. She knew that to Gerty and Mrs.\nFisher she was only passing through a temporary period of probation,\nsince they believed that the apprenticeship she was serving at Mme.\nRegina's would enable her, when Mrs. Peniston's legacy was paid, to\nrealize the vision of the green-and-white shop with the fuller competence\nacquired by her preliminary training. But to Lily herself, aware that the\nlegacy could not be put to such a use, the preliminary training seemed a\nwasted effort. She understood clearly enough that, even if she could ever\nlearn to compete with hands formed from childhood for their special work,\nthe small pay she received would not be a sufficient addition to her\nincome to compensate her for such drudgery. And the realization of this\nfact brought her recurringly face to face with the temptation to use the\nlegacy in establishing her business. Once installed, and in command of\nher own work-women, she believed she had sufficient tact and ability to\nattract a fashionable CLIENTELE; and if the business succeeded she could\ngradually lay aside money enough to discharge her debt to Trenor. But the\ntask might take years to accomplish, even if she continued to stint\nherself to the utmost; and meanwhile her pride would be crushed under the\nweight of an intolerable obligation.\n\nThese were her superficial considerations; but under them lurked the\nsecret dread that the obligation might not always remain intolerable.\nShe knew she could not count on her continuity of purpose, and what\nreally frightened her was the thought that she might gradually\naccommodate herself to remaining indefinitely in Trenor's debt, as she\nhad accommodated herself to the part allotted her on the Sabrina, and as\nshe had so nearly drifted into acquiescing with Stancy's scheme for the\nadvancement of Mrs. Hatch. Her danger lay, as she knew, in her old\nincurable dread of discomfort and poverty; in the fear of that mounting\ntide of dinginess against which her mother had so passionately warned\nher. And now a new vista of peril opened before her. She understood that\nRosedale was ready to lend her money; and the longing to take advantage\nof his offer began to haunt her insidiously. It was of course impossible\nto accept a loan from Rosedale; but proximate possibilities hovered\ntemptingly before her. She was quite sure that he would come and see her\nagain, and almost sure that, if he did, she could bring him to the point\nof offering to marry her on the terms she had previously rejected.  Would\nshe still reject them if they were offered? More and more, with every\nfresh mischance befalling her, did the pursuing furies seem to take the\nshape of Bertha Dorset; and close at hand, safely locked among her\npapers, lay the means of ending their pursuit. The temptation, which her\nscorn of Rosedale had once enabled her to reject, now insistently\nreturned upon her; and how much strength was left her to oppose it?\n\nWhat little there was must at any rate be husbanded to the utmost; she\ncould not trust herself again to the perils of a sleepless night.\nThrough the long hours of silence the dark spirit of fatigue and\nloneliness crouched upon her breast, leaving her so drained of bodily\nstrength that her morning thoughts swam in a haze of weakness. The only\nhope of renewal lay in the little bottle at her bed-side; and how much\nlonger that hope would last she dared not conjecture.\n\n\n\nLily, lingering for a moment on the corner, looked out on the afternoon\nspectacle of Fifth Avenue. It was a day in late April, and the sweetness\nof spring was in the air. It mitigated the ugliness of the long crowded\nthoroughfare, blurred the gaunt roof-lines, threw a mauve veil over the\ndiscouraging perspective of the side streets, and gave a touch of poetry\nto the delicate haze of green that marked the entrance to the Park.\n\nAs Lily stood there, she recognized several familiar faces in the passing\ncarriages. The season was over, and its ruling forces had disbanded; but\na few still lingered, delaying their departure for Europe, or passing\nthrough town on their return from the South.  Among them was Mrs. Van\nOsburgh, swaying majestically in her C-spring barouche, with Mrs. Percy\nGryce at her side, and the new heir to the Gryce millions enthroned\nbefore them on his nurse's knees. They were succeeded by Mrs. Hatch's\nelectric victoria, in which that lady reclined in the lonely splendour of\na spring toilet obviously designed for company; and a moment or two later\ncame Judy Trenor, accompanied by Lady Skiddaw, who had come over for her\nannual tarpon fishing and a dip into \"the street.\"\n\nThis fleeting glimpse of her past served to emphasize the sense of\naimlessness with which Lily at length turned toward home. She had nothing\nto do for the rest of the day, nor for the days to come; for the season\nwas over in millinery as well as in society, and a week earlier Mme.\nRegina had notified her that her services were no longer required. Mme.\nRegina always reduced her staff on the first of May, and Miss Bart's\nattendance had of late been so irregular--she had so often been unwell,\nand had done so little work when she came--that it was only as a favour\nthat her dismissal had hitherto been deferred.\n\nLily did not question the justice of the decision. She was conscious of\nhaving been forgetful, awkward and slow to learn. It was bitter to\nacknowledge her inferiority even to herself, but the fact had been\nbrought home to her that as a bread-winner she could never compete with\nprofessional ability.  Since she had been brought up to be ornamental,\nshe could hardly blame herself for failing to serve any practical\npurpose; but the discovery put an end to her consoling sense of universal\nefficiency.\n\nAs she turned homeward her thoughts shrank in anticipation from the fact\nthat there would be nothing to get up for the next morning. The luxury of\nlying late in bed was a pleasure belonging to the life of ease; it had no\npart in the utilitarian existence of the boarding-house. She liked to\nleave her room early, and to return to it as late as possible; and she\nwas walking slowly now in order to postpone the detested approach to her\ndoorstep.\n\nBut the doorstep, as she drew near it, acquired a sudden interest from\nthe fact that it was occupied--and indeed filled--by the conspicuous\nfigure of Mr. Rosedale, whose presence seemed to take on an added\namplitude from the meanness of his surroundings.\n\nThe sight stirred Lily with an irresistible sense of triumph.  Rosedale,\na day or two after their chance meeting, had called to enquire if she had\nrecovered from her indisposition; but since then she had not seen or\nheard from him, and his absence seemed to betoken a struggle to keep\naway, to let her pass once more out of his life. If this were the case,\nhis return showed that the struggle had been unsuccessful, for Lily knew\nhe was not the man to waste his time in an ineffectual sentimental\ndalliance. He was too busy, too practical, and above all too much\npreoccupied with his own advancement, to indulge in such unprofitable\nasides.\n\nIn the peacock-blue parlour, with its bunches of dried pampas grass, and\ndiscoloured steel engravings of sentimental episodes, he looked about him\nwith unconcealed disgust, laying his hat distrustfully on the dusty\nconsole adorned with a Rogers statuette.\n\nLily sat down on one of the plush and rosewood sofas, and he deposited\nhimself in a rocking-chair draped with a starched antimacassar which\nscraped unpleasantly against the pink fold of skin above his collar.\n\n\"My goodness--you can't go on living here!\" he exclaimed.\n\nLily smiled at his tone. \"I am not sure that I can; but I have gone over\nmy expenses very carefully, and I rather think I shall be able to manage\nit.\"\n\n\"Be able to manage it? That's not what I mean--it's no place for you!\"\n\n\"It's what I mean; for I have been out of work for the last week.\"\n\n\"Out of work--out of work! What a way for you to talk! The idea of your\nhaving to work--it's preposterous.\" He brought out his sentences in short\nviolent jerks, as though they were forced up from a deep inner crater of\nindignation. \"It's a farce--a crazy farce,\" he repeated, his eyes fixed\non the long vista of the room reflected in the blotched glass between the\nwindows.\n\nLily continued to meet his expostulations with a smile. \"I don't know why\nI should regard myself as an exception----\" she began.\n\n\"Because you ARE; that's why; and your being in a place like this is a\ndamnable outrage. I can't talk of it calmly.\"\n\nShe had in truth never seen him so shaken out of his usual glibness; and\nthere was something almost moving to her in his inarticulate struggle\nwith his emotions.\n\nHe rose with a start which left the rocking-chair quivering on its beam\nends, and placed himself squarely before her.\n\n\"Look here, Miss Lily, I'm going to Europe next week: going over to Paris\nand London for a couple of months--and I can't leave you like this. I\ncan't do it. I know it's none of my business--you've let me understand\nthat often enough; but things are worse with you now than they have been\nbefore, and you must see that you've got to accept help from somebody.\nYou spoke to me the other day about some debt to Trenor.  I know what you\nmean--and I respect you for feeling as you do about it.\"\n\nA blush of surprise rose to Lily's pale face, but before she could\ninterrupt him he had continued eagerly: \"Well, I'll lend you the money to\npay Trenor; and I won't--I--see here, don't take me up till I've\nfinished. What I mean is, it'll be a plain business arrangement, such as\none man would make with another.  Now, what have you got to say against\nthat?\"\n\nLily's blush deepened to a glow in which humiliation and gratitude were\nmingled; and both sentiments revealed themselves in the unexpected\ngentleness of her reply.\n\n\"Only this: that it is exactly what Gus Trenor proposed; and that I can\nnever again be sure of understanding the plainest business arrangement.\"\nThen, realizing that this answer contained a germ of injustice, she\nadded, even more kindly: \"Not that I don't appreciate your kindness--that\nI'm not grateful for it. But a business arrangement between us would in\nany case be impossible, because I shall have no security to give when my\ndebt to Gus Trenor has been paid.\"\n\nRosedale received this statement in silence: he seemed to feel the note\nof finality in her voice, yet to be unable to accept it as closing the\nquestion between them.\n\nIn the silence Lily had a clear perception of what was passing through\nhis mind. Whatever perplexity he felt as to the inexorableness of her\ncourse--however little he penetrated its motive--she saw that it\nunmistakably tended to strengthen her hold over him. It was as though the\nsense in her of unexplained scruples and resistances had the same\nattraction as the delicacy of feature, the fastidiousness of manner,\nwhich gave her an external rarity, an air of being impossible to match.\nAs he advanced in social experience this uniqueness had acquired a\ngreater value for him, as though he were a collector who had learned to\ndistinguish minor differences of design and quality in some long-coveted\nobject.\n\nLily, perceiving all this, understood that he would marry her at once, on\nthe sole condition of a reconciliation with Mrs. Dorset; and the\ntemptation was the less easy to put aside because, little by little,\ncircumstances were breaking down her dislike for Rosedale. The dislike,\nindeed, still subsisted; but it was penetrated here and there by the\nperception of mitigating qualities in him: of a certain gross kindliness,\na rather helpless fidelity of sentiment, which seemed to be struggling\nthrough the hard surface of his material ambitions.\n\nReading his dismissal in her eyes, he held out his hand with a gesture\nwhich conveyed something of this inarticulate conflict.\n\n\"If you'd only let me, I'd set you up over them all--I'd put you where\nyou could wipe your feet on 'em!\" he declared; and it touched her oddly\nto see that his new passion had not altered his old standard of values.\n\n\n\nLily took no sleeping-drops that night. She lay awake viewing her\nsituation in the crude light which Rosedale's visit had shed on it. In\nfending off the offer he was so plainly ready to renew, had she not\nsacrificed to one of those abstract notions of honour that might be\ncalled the conventionalities of the moral life?  What debt did she owe to\na social order which had condemned and banished her without trial?  She\nhad never been heard in her own defence; she was innocent of the charge\non which she had been found guilty; and the irregularity of her\nconviction might seem to justify the use of methods as irregular in\nrecovering her lost rights. Bertha Dorset, to save herself, had not\nscrupled to ruin her by an open falsehood; why should she hesitate to\nmake private use of the facts that chance had put in her way? After all,\nhalf the opprobrium of such an act lies in the name attached to it.  Call\nit blackmail and it becomes unthinkable; but explain that it injures no\none, and that the rights regained by it were unjustly forfeited, and he\nmust be a formalist indeed who can find no plea in its defence.\n\nThe arguments pleading for it with Lily were the old unanswerable ones of\nthe personal situation: the sense of injury, the sense of failure, the\npassionate craving for a fair chance against the selfish despotism of\nsociety. She had learned by experience that she had neither the aptitude\nnor the moral constancy to remake her life on new lines; to become a\nworker among workers, and let the world of luxury and pleasure sweep by\nher unregarded. She could not hold herself much to blame for this\nineffectiveness, and she was perhaps less to blame than she believed.\nInherited tendencies had combined with early training to make her the\nhighly specialized product she was: an organism as helpless out of its\nnarrow range as the sea-anemone torn from the rock. She had been\nfashioned to adorn and delight; to what other end does nature round the\nrose-leaf and paint the humming-bird's breast?  And was it her fault that\nthe purely decorative mission is less easily and harmoniously fulfilled\namong social beings than in the world of nature? That it is apt to be\nhampered by material necessities or complicated by moral scruples?\n\nThese last were the two antagonistic forces which fought out their battle\nin her breast during the long watches of the night; and when she rose the\nnext morning she hardly knew where the victory lay. She was exhausted by\nthe reaction of a night without sleep, coming after many nights of rest\nartificially obtained; and in the distorting light of fatigue the future\nstretched out before her grey, interminable and desolate.\n\nShe lay late in bed, refusing the coffee and fried eggs which the\nfriendly Irish servant thrust through her door, and hating the intimate\ndomestic noises of the house and the cries and rumblings of the street.\nHer week of idleness had brought home to her with exaggerated force these\nsmall aggravations of the boarding-house world, and she yearned for that\nother luxurious world, whose machinery is so carefully concealed that one\nscene flows into another without perceptible agency.\n\nAt length she rose and dressed. Since she had left Mme. Regina's she had\nspent her days in the streets, partly to escape from the uncongenial\npromiscuities of the boarding-house, and partly in the hope that physical\nfatigue would help her to sleep. But once out of the house, she could not\ndecide where to go; for she had avoided Gerty since her dismissal from\nthe milliner's, and she was not sure of a welcome anywhere else.\n\nThe morning was in harsh contrast to the previous day. A cold grey sky\nthreatened rain, and a high wind drove the dust in wild spirals up and\ndown the streets. Lily walked up Fifth Avenue toward the Park, hoping to\nfind a sheltered nook where she might sit; but the wind chilled her, and\nafter an hour's wandering under the tossing boughs she yielded to her\nincreasing weariness, and took refuge in a little restaurant in\nFifty-ninth Street. She was not hungry, and had meant to go without\nluncheon; but she was too tired to return home, and the long perspective\nof white tables showed alluringly through the windows.\n\nThe room was full of women and girls, all too much engaged in the rapid\nabsorption of tea and pie to remark her entrance. A hum of shrill voices\nreverberated against the low ceiling, leaving Lily shut out in a little\ncircle of silence. She felt a sudden pang of profound loneliness. She had\nlost the sense of time, and it seemed to her as though she had not spoken\nto any one for days. Her eyes sought the faces about her, craving a\nresponsive glance, some sign of an intuition of her trouble. But the\nsallow preoccupied women, with their bags and note-books and rolls of\nmusic, were all engrossed in their own affairs, and even those who sat by\nthemselves were busy running over proof-sheets or devouring magazines\nbetween their hurried gulps of tea.  Lily alone was stranded in a great\nwaste of disoccupation.\n\nShe drank several cups of the tea which was served with her portion of\nstewed oysters, and her brain felt clearer and livelier when she emerged\nonce more into the street. She realized now that, as she sat in the\nrestaurant, she had unconsciously arrived at a final decision. The\ndiscovery gave her an immediate illusion of activity: it was exhilarating\nto think that she had actually a reason for hurrying home.  To prolong\nher enjoyment of the sensation she decided to walk; but the distance was\nso great that she found herself glancing nervously at the clocks on the\nway. One of the surprises of her unoccupied state was the discovery that\ntime, when it is left to itself and no definite demands are made on it,\ncannot be trusted to move at any recognized pace.  Usually it loiters;\nbut just when one has come to count upon its slowness, it may suddenly\nbreak into a wild irrational gallop.\n\nShe found, however, on reaching home, that the hour was still early\nenough for her to sit down and rest a few minutes before putting her plan\ninto execution. The delay did not perceptibly weaken her resolve.  She\nwas frightened and yet stimulated by the reserved force of resolution\nwhich she felt within herself: she saw it was going to be easier, a great\ndeal easier, than she had imagined.\n\nAt five o'clock she rose, unlocked her trunk, and took out a sealed\npacket which she slipped into the bosom of her dress. Even the contact\nwith the packet did not shake her nerves as she had half-expected it\nwould. She seemed encased in a strong armour of indifference, as though\nthe vigorous exertion of her will had finally benumbed her finer\nsensibilities.\n\nShe dressed herself once more for the street, locked her door and went\nout. When she emerged on the pavement, the day was still high, but a\nthreat of rain darkened the sky and cold gusts shook the signs projecting\nfrom the basement shops along the street. She reached Fifth Avenue and\nbegan to walk slowly northward. She was sufficiently familiar with Mrs.\nDorset's habits to know that she could always be found at home after\nfive.  She might not, indeed, be accessible to visitors, especially to a\nvisitor so unwelcome, and against whom it was quite possible that she had\nguarded herself by special orders; but Lily had written a note which she\nmeant to send up with her name, and which she thought would secure her\nadmission.\n\nShe had allowed herself time to walk to Mrs. Dorset's, thinking that the\nquick movement through the cold evening air would help to steady her\nnerves; but she really felt no need of being tranquillized. Her survey of\nthe situation remained calm and unwavering.\n\nAs she reached Fiftieth Street the clouds broke abruptly, and a rush of\ncold rain slanted into her face. She had no umbrella and the moisture\nquickly penetrated her thin spring dress. She was still half a mile from\nher destination, and she decided to walk across to Madison Avenue and\ntake the electric car. As she turned into the side street, a vague memory\nstirred in her. The row of budding trees, the new brick and limestone\nhouse-fronts, the Georgian flat-house with flowerboxes on its balconies,\nwere merged together into the setting of a familiar scene.  It was down\nthis street that she had walked with Selden, that September day two years\nago; a few yards ahead was the doorway they had entered together. The\nrecollection loosened a throng of benumbed sensations--longings, regrets,\nimaginings, the throbbing brood of the only spring her heart had ever\nknown. It was strange to find herself passing his house on such an\nerrand. She seemed suddenly to see her action as he would see it--and the\nfact of his own connection with it, the fact that, to attain her end, she\nmust trade on his name, and profit by a secret of his past, chilled her\nblood with shame. What a long way she had travelled since the day of\ntheir first talk together!  Even then her feet had been set in the path\nshe was now following--even then she had resisted the hand he had held\nout.\n\nAll her resentment of his fancied coldness was swept away in this\noverwhelming rush of recollection. Twice he had been ready to help\nher--to help her by loving her, as he had said--and if, the third time,\nhe had seemed to fail her, whom but herself could she accuse?...\nWell, that part of her life was over; she did not know why her thoughts\nstill clung to it. But the sudden longing to see him remained; it grew to\nhunger as she paused on the pavement opposite his door. The street was\ndark and empty, swept by the rain. She had a vision of his quiet room, of\nthe bookshelves, and the fire on the hearth. She looked up and saw a\nlight in his window; then she crossed the street and entered the house.\n\n\n\nThe library looked as she had pictured it. The green-shaded lamps made\ntranquil circles of light in the gathering dusk, a little fire flickered\non the hearth, and Selden's easy-chair, which stood near it, had been\npushed aside when he rose to admit her.\n\nHe had checked his first movement of surprise, and stood silent, waiting\nfor her to speak, while she paused a moment on the threshold, assailed by\na rush of memories.\n\nThe scene was unchanged. She recognized the row of shelves from which he\nhad taken down his La Bruyere, and the worn arm of the chair he had\nleaned against while she examined the precious volume. But then the wide\nSeptember light had filled the room, making it seem a part of the outer\nworld: now the shaded lamps and the warm hearth, detaching it from the\ngathering darkness of the street, gave it a sweeter touch of intimacy.\n\nBecoming gradually aware of the surprise under Selden's silence, Lily\nturned to him and said simply: \"I came to tell you that I was sorry for\nthe way we parted--for what I said to you that day at Mrs. Hatch's.\"\n\nThe words rose to her lips spontaneously. Even on her way up the stairs,\nshe had not thought of preparing a pretext for her visit, but she now\nfelt an intense longing to dispel the cloud of misunderstanding that hung\nbetween them.\n\nSelden returned her look with a smile. \"I was sorry too that we should\nhave parted in that way; but I am not sure I didn't bring it on myself.\nLuckily I had foreseen the risk I was taking----\"\n\n\"So that you really didn't care----?\" broke from her with a flash of her\nold irony.\n\n\"So that I was prepared for the consequences,\" he corrected\ngood-humouredly. \"But we'll talk of all this later. Do come and sit by\nthe fire. I can recommend that arm-chair, if you'll let me put a cushion\nbehind you.\"\n\nWhile he spoke she had moved slowly to the middle of the room, and paused\nnear his writing-table, where the lamp, striking upward, cast exaggerated\nshadows on the pallour of her delicately-hollowed face.\n\n\"You look tired--do sit down,\" he repeated gently.\n\nShe did not seem to hear the request. \"I wanted you to know that I left\nMrs. Hatch immediately after I saw you,\" she said, as though continuing\nher confession.\n\n\"Yes--yes; I know,\" he assented, with a rising tinge of embarrassment.\n\n\"And that I did so because you told me to. Before you came I had already\nbegun to see that it would be impossible to remain with her--for the\nreasons you gave me; but I wouldn't admit it--I wouldn't let you see that\nI understood what you meant.\"\n\n\"Ah, I might have trusted you to find your own way out--don't overwhelm\nme with the sense of my officiousness!\"\n\nHis light tone, in which, had her nerves been steadier, she would have\nrecognized the mere effort to bridge over an awkward moment, jarred on\nher passionate desire to be understood. In her strange state of\nextra-lucidity, which gave her the sense of being already at the heart of\nthe situation, it seemed incredible that any one should think it\nnecessary to linger in the conventional outskirts of word-play and\nevasion.\n\n\"It was not that--I was not ungrateful,\" she insisted. But the power of\nexpression failed her suddenly; she felt a tremor in her throat, and two\ntears gathered and fell slowly from her eyes.\n\nSelden moved forward and took her hand. \"You are very tired. Why won't\nyou sit down and let me make you comfortable?\"\n\nHe drew her to the arm-chair near the fire, and placed a cushion behind\nher shoulders.\n\n\"And now you must let me make you some tea: you know I always have that\namount of hospitality at my command.\"\n\nShe shook her head, and two more tears ran over. But she did not weep\neasily, and the long habit of self-control reasserted itself, though she\nwas still too tremulous to speak.\n\n\"You know I can coax the water to boil in five minutes,\" Selden\ncontinued, speaking as though she were a troubled child.\n\nHis words recalled the vision of that other afternoon when they had sat\ntogether over his tea-table and talked jestingly of her future. There\nwere moments when that day seemed more remote than any other event in her\nlife; and yet she could always relive it in its minutest detail.\n\nShe made a gesture of refusal. \"No: I drink too much tea. I would rather\nsit quiet--I must go in a moment,\" she added confusedly.\n\nSelden continued to stand near her, leaning against the mantelpiece.  The\ntinge of constraint was beginning to be more distinctly perceptible under\nthe friendly ease of his manner. Her self-absorption had not allowed her\nto perceive it at first; but now that her consciousness was once more\nputting forth its eager feelers, she saw that her presence was becoming\nan embarrassment to him. Such a situation can be saved only by an\nimmediate outrush of feeling; and on Selden's side the determining\nimpulse was still lacking.\n\nThe discovery did not disturb Lily as it might once have done.  She had\npassed beyond the phase of well-bred reciprocity, in which every\ndemonstration must be scrupulously proportioned to the emotion it\nelicits, and generosity of feeling is the only ostentation condemned.\nBut the sense of loneliness returned with redoubled force as she saw\nherself forever shut out from Selden's inmost self. She had come to him\nwith no definite purpose; the mere longing to see him had directed her;\nbut the secret hope she had carried with her suddenly revealed itself in\nits death-pang.\n\n\"I must go,\" she repeated, making a motion to rise from her chair.\n\n### Summary:"}
{"original_length": 17102, "trunc_length": 16384, "text": "\n\nSummarize the following text into a summary of less than 800 words.\n### Text:\n\n\n\nMr. Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had\nbeen but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part of\nhis life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and\nmiserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he\nhad merely kept the necessary terms, without forming at it any useful\nacquaintance. The subjection in which his father had brought him up, had\ngiven him originally great humility of manner, but it was now a good\ndeal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in\nretirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected\nprosperity. A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de\nBourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he\nfelt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness,\nmingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a\nclergyman, and his rights as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of\npride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility.\n\nHaving now a good house and very sufficient income, he intended to\nmarry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had\na wife in view, as he meant to chuse one of the daughters, if he found\nthem as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report.\nThis was his plan of amends--of atonement--for inheriting their father's\nestate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and\nsuitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own\npart.\n\nHis plan did not vary on seeing them.--Miss Bennet's lovely face\nconfirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what\nwas due to seniority; and for the first evening _she_ was his settled\nchoice. The next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a quarter\nof an hour's tete-a-tete with Mrs. Bennet before breakfast, a\nconversation beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturally\nto the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress for it might be found at\nLongbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general\nencouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on.--\"As to\nher _younger_ daughters she could not take upon her to say--she could\nnot positively answer--but she did not _know_ of any prepossession;--her\n_eldest_ daughter, she must just mention--she felt it incumbent on her\nto hint, was likely to be very soon engaged.\"\n\nMr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth--and it was soon\ndone--done while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire. Elizabeth, equally\nnext to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course.\n\nMrs. Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have\ntwo daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of\nthe day before, was now high in her good graces.\n\nLydia's intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten; every sister\nexcept Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr. Collins was to attend them,\nat the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him,\nand have his library to himself; for thither Mr. Collins had followed\nhim after breakfast, and there he would continue, nominally engaged with\none of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr.\nBennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford. Such\ndoings discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly. In his library he had been\nalways sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told\nElizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the\nhouse, he was used to be free from them there; his civility, therefore,\nwas most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in their\nwalk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker\nthan a reader, was extremely well pleased to close his large book, and\ngo.\n\nIn pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his\ncousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton. The attention of\nthe younger ones was then no longer to be gained by _him_. Their eyes\nwere immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers,\nand nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed, or a really new muslin\nin a shop window, could recal them.\n\nBut the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom\nthey had never seen before, of most gentleman-like appearance, walking\nwith an officer on the other side of the way. The officer was the very\nMr. Denny, concerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire,\nand he bowed as they passed. All were struck with the stranger's air,\nall wondered who he could be, and Kitty and Lydia, determined if\npossible to find out, led the way across the street, under pretence of\nwanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained\nthe pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same\nspot. Mr. Denny addressed them directly, and entreated permission to\nintroduce his friend, Mr. Wickham, who had returned with him the day\nbefore from town, and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in\ntheir corps. This was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted\nonly regimentals to make him completely charming. His appearance was\ngreatly in his favour; he had all the best part of beauty, a fine\ncountenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address. The introduction\nwas followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation--a\nreadiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the\nwhole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably,\nwhen the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy and Bingley were\nseen riding down the street. On distinguishing the ladies of the group,\nthe two gentlemen came directly towards them, and began the usual\ncivilities. Bingley was the principal spokesman, and Miss Bennet the\nprincipal object. He was then, he said, on his way to Longbourn on\npurpose to inquire after her. Mr. Darcy corroborated it with a bow, and\nwas beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth, when they\nwere suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger, and Elizabeth\nhappening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other,\nwas all astonishment at the effect of the meeting. Both changed colour,\none looked white, the other red. Mr. Wickham, after a few moments,\ntouched his hat--a salutation which Mr. Darcy just deigned to return.\nWhat could be the meaning of it?--It was impossible to imagine; it was\nimpossible not to long to know.\n\nIn another minute Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what\npassed, took leave and rode on with his friend.\n\nMr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of\nMr. Philips's house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss Lydia's\npressing entreaties that they would come in, and even in spite of Mrs.\nPhilips' throwing up the parlour window, and loudly seconding the\ninvitation.\n\nMrs. Philips was always glad to see her nieces, and the two eldest, from\ntheir recent absence, were particularly welcome, and she was eagerly\nexpressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as their own\ncarriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing about, if\nshe had not happened to see Mr. Jones's shop boy in the street, who had\ntold her that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield\nbecause the Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility was claimed\ntowards Mr. Collins by Jane's introduction of him. She received him with\nher very best politeness, which he returned with as much more,\napologising for his intrusion, without any previous acquaintance with\nher, which he could not help flattering himself however might be\njustified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to\nher notice. Mrs. Philips was quite awed by such an excess of good\nbreeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to\nby exclamations and inquiries about the other, of whom, however, she\ncould only tell her nieces what they already knew, that Mr. Denny had\nbrought him from London, and that he was to have a lieutenant's\ncommission in the ----shire. She had been watching him the last hour,\nshe said, as he walked up and down the street, and had Mr. Wickham\nappeared Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the occupation,\nbut unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the\nofficers, who in comparison with the stranger, were become \"stupid,\ndisagreeable fellows.\" Some of them were to dine with the Philipses the\nnext day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr.\nWickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn\nwould come in the evening. This was agreed to, and Mrs. Philips\nprotested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery\ntickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards. The prospect of such\ndelights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits. Mr.\nCollins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured\nwith unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless.\n\nAs they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass\nbetween the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have defended either or\nboth, had they appeared to be wrong, she could no more explain such\nbehaviour than her sister.\n\nMr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by admiring Mrs.\nPhilips's manners and politeness. He protested that except Lady\nCatherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman; for\nshe had not only received him with the utmost civility, but had even\npointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although\nutterly unknown to her before. Something he supposed might be attributed\nto his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so much\nattention in the whole course of his life.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs no objection was made to the young people's engagement with their\naunt, and all Mr. Collins's scruples of leaving Mr. and Mrs. Bennet for\na single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach\nconveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and the\ngirls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room,\nthat Mr. Wickham had accepted their uncle's invitation, and was then in\nthe house.\n\nWhen this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, Mr.\nCollins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much\nstruck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he\nmight almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour\nat Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much\ngratification; but when Mrs. Philips understood from him what Rosings\nwas, and who was its proprietor, when she had listened to the\ndescription of only one of Lady Catherine's drawing-rooms, and found\nthat the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all\nthe force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison\nwith the housekeeper's room.\n\nIn describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion,\nwith occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and the\nimprovements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the\ngentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs. Philips a very attentive\nlistener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she\nheard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as\nsoon as she could. To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin,\nand who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine\ntheir own indifferent imitations of china on the mantle-piece, the\ninterval of waiting appeared very long. It was over at last however. The\ngentlemen did approach; and when Mr. Wickham walked into the room,\nElizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking\nof him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration. The\nofficers of the ----shire were in general a very creditable,\ngentleman-like set, and the best of them were of the present party; but\nMr. Wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and\nwalk, as _they_ were superior to the broad-faced stuffy uncle Philips,\nbreathing port wine, who followed them into the room.\n\nMr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was\nturned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated\nhimself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into\nconversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, and on the\nprobability of a rainy season, made her feel that the commonest,\ndullest, most thread-bare topic might be rendered interesting by the\nskill of the speaker.\n\nWith such rivals for the notice of the fair, as Mr. Wickham and the\nofficers, Mr. Collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance; to the\nyoung ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a\nkind listener in Mrs. Philips, and was, by her watchfulness, most\nabundantly supplied with coffee and muffin.\n\nWhen the card tables were placed, he had an opportunity of obliging her\nin return, by sitting down to whist.\n\n\"I know little of the game, at present,\" said he, \"but I shall be glad\nto improve myself, for in my situation of life----\" Mrs. Philips was\nvery thankful for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason.\n\nMr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he\nreceived at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia. At first there\nseemed danger of Lydia's engrossing him entirely, for she was a most\ndetermined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets,\nshe soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets\nand exclaiming after prizes, to have attention for any one in\nparticular. Allowing for the common demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was\ntherefore at leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to\nhear him, though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to\nbe told, the history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy. She dared not\neven mention that gentleman. Her curiosity however was unexpectedly\nrelieved. Mr. Wickham began the subject himself. He inquired how far\nNetherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in\nan hesitating manner how long Mr. Darcy had been staying there.\n\n\"About a month,\" said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject\ndrop, added, \"He is a man of very large property in Derbyshire, I\nunderstand.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Wickham;--\"his estate there is a noble one. A clear ten\nthousand per annum. You could not have met with a person more capable of\ngiving you certain information on that head than myself--for I have been\nconnected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy.\"\n\nElizabeth could not but look surprised.\n\n\"You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion, after\nseeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting\nyesterday.--Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?\"\n\n\"As much as I ever wish to be,\" cried Elizabeth warmly,--\"I have spent\nfour days in the same house with him, and I think him very\ndisagreeable.\"\n\n\"I have no right to give _my_ opinion,\" said Wickham, \"as to his being\nagreeable or otherwise. I am not qualified to form one. I have known him\ntoo long and too well to be a fair judge. It is impossible for _me_ to\nbe impartial. But I believe your opinion of him would in general\nastonish--and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly\nanywhere else.--Here you are in your own family.\"\n\n\"Upon my word I say no more _here_ than I might say in any house in the\nneighbourhood, except Netherfield. He is not at all liked in\nHertfordshire. Every body is disgusted with his pride. You will not find\nhim more favourably spoken of by any one.\"\n\n\"I cannot pretend to be sorry,\" said Wickham, after a short\ninterruption, \"that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond\ntheir deserts; but with _him_ I believe it does not often happen. The\nworld is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his\nhigh and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chuses to be seen.\"\n\n\"I should take him, even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be an\nill-tempered man.\" Wickham only shook his head.\n\n\"I wonder,\" said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, \"whether he is\nlikely to be in this country much longer.\"\n\n\"I do not at all know; but I _heard_ nothing of his going away when I\nwas at Netherfield. I hope your plans in favour of the ----shire will\nnot be affected by his being in the neighbourhood.\"\n\n\"Oh! no--it is not for _me_ to be driven away by Mr. Darcy. If _he_\nwishes to avoid seeing _me_, he must go. We are not on friendly terms,\nand it always gives me pain to meet him, but I have no reason for\navoiding _him_ but what I might proclaim to all the world; a sense of\nvery great ill usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he is.\nHis father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best men\nthat ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never be\nin company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a\nthousand tender recollections. His behaviour to myself has been\nscandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him any thing and every\nthing, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory\nof his father.\"\n\nElizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with\nall her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry.\n\nMr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the\nneighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that he\nhad yet seen, and speaking of the latter especially, with gentle but\nvery intelligible gallantry.\n\n\"It was the prospect of constant society, and good society,\" he added,\n\"which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire. I knew it to be a\nmost respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend Denny tempted me\nfarther by his account of their present quarters, and the very great\nattentions and excellent acquaintance Meryton had procured them.\nSociety, I own, is necessary to me. I have been a disappointed man, and\nmy spirits will not bear solitude. I _must_ have employment and society.\nA military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have\nnow made it eligible. The church _ought_ to have been my profession--I\nwas brought up for the church, and I should at this time have been in\npossession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we\nwere speaking of just now.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\"\n\n\"Yes--the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best\nliving in his gift. He was my godfather, and excessively attached to me.\nI cannot do justice to his kindness. He meant to provide for me amply,\nand thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given\nelsewhere.\"\n\n\"Good heavens!\" cried Elizabeth; \"but how could _that_ be?--How could\nhis will be disregarded?--Why did not you seek legal redress?\"\n\n\"There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to\ngive me no hope from law. A man of honour could not have doubted the\nintention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merely\nconditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim\nto it by extravagance, imprudence, in short any thing or nothing.\nCertain it is, that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I\nwas of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no\nless certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done\nany thing to deserve to lose it. I have a warm, unguarded temper, and I\nmay perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too\nfreely. I can recal nothing worse. But the fact is, that we are very\ndifferent sort of men, and that he hates me.\"\n\n\"This is quite shocking!--He deserves to be publicly disgraced.\"\n\n\"Some time or other he _will_ be--but it shall not be by _me_. Till I\ncan forget his father, I can never defy or expose _him_.\"\n\nElizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than\never as he expressed them.\n\n\"But what,\" said she, after a pause, \"can have been his motive?--what\ncan have induced him to behave so cruelly?\"\n\n\"A thorough, determined dislike of me--a dislike which I cannot but\nattribute in some measure to jealousy. Had the late Mr. Darcy liked me\nless, his son might have borne with me better; but his father's uncommon\nattachment to me, irritated him I believe very early in life. He had not\na temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sort of\npreference which was often given me.\"\n\n\"I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this--though I have never liked\nhim, I had not thought so very ill of him--I had supposed him to be\ndespising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of\ndescending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as\nthis!\"\n\nAfter a few minutes reflection, however, she continued, \"I _do_ remember\nhis boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability of his\nresentments, of his having an unforgiving temper. His disposition must\nbe dreadful.\"\n\n\"I will not trust myself on the subject,\" replied Wickham, \"_I_ can\nhardly be just to him.\"\n\nElizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, \"To\ntreat in such a manner, the god-son, the friend, the favourite of his\nfather!\"--She could have added, \"A young man too, like _you_, whose very\ncountenance may vouch for your being amiable\"--but she contented\nherself with \"And one, too, who had probably been his own companion from\nchildhood, connected together, as I think you said, in the closest\nmanner!\"\n\n\"We were born in the same parish, within the same park, the greatest\npart of our youth was passed together; inmates of the same house,\nsharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care. _My_\nfather began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr. Philips,\nappears to do so much credit to--but he gave up every thing to be of use\nto the late Mr. Darcy, and devoted all his time to the care of the\nPemberley property. He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most\nintimate, confidential friend. Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to\nbe under the greatest obligations to my father's active superintendance,\nand when immediately before my father's death, Mr. Darcy gave him a\nvoluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it to\nbe as much a debt of gratitude to _him_, as of affection to myself.\"\n\n\"How strange!\" cried Elizabeth. \"How abominable!--I wonder that the very\npride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you!--If from no better\nmotive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest,--for\ndishonesty I must call it.\"\n\n\"It _is_ wonderful,\"--replied Wickham,--\"for almost all his actions may\nbe traced to pride;--and pride has often been his best friend. It has\nconnected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling. But we are none\nof us consistent; and in his behaviour to me, there were stronger\nimpulses even than pride.\"\n\n\"Can such abominable pride as his, have ever done him good?\"\n\n\"Yes. It has often led him to be liberal and generous,--to give his\nmoney freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve\nthe poor. Family pride, and _filial_ pride, for he is very proud of what\nhis father was, have done this. Not to appear to disgrace his family, to\ndegenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the\nPemberley House, is a powerful motive. He has also _brotherly_ pride,\nwhich with _some_ brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and careful\nguardian of his sister; and you will hear him generally cried up as the\nmost attentive and best of brothers.\"\n\n\"What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy?\"\n\nHe shook his head.--\"I wish I could call her amiable. It gives me pain\nto speak ill of a Darcy. But she is too much like her brother,--very,\nvery proud.--As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and\nextremely fond of me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her\namusement. But she is nothing to me now. She is a handsome girl, about\nfifteen or sixteen, and I understand highly accomplished. Since her\nfather's death, her home has been London, where a lady lives with her,\nand superintends her education.\"\n\nAfter many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could not\nhelp reverting once more to the first, and saying,\n\n\"I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley! How can Mr. Bingley,\nwho seems good humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable,\nbe in friendship with such a man? How can they suit each other?--Do you\nknow Mr. Bingley?\"\n\n\"Not at all.\"\n\n\"He is a sweet tempered, amiable, charming man. He cannot know what Mr.\nDarcy is.\"\n\n\"Probably not;--but Mr. Darcy can please where he chuses. He does not\nwant abilities. He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth\nhis while. Among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is a\nvery different man from what he is to the less prosperous. His pride\nnever deserts him; but with the rich, he is liberal-minded, just,\nsincere, rational, honourable, and perhaps agreeable,--allowing\nsomething for fortune and figure.\"\n\nThe whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round\nthe other table, and Mr. Collins took his station between his cousin\nElizabeth and Mrs. Philips.--The usual inquiries as to his success were\nmade by the latter. It had not been very great; he had lost every point;\nbut when Mrs. Philips began to express her concern thereupon, he assured\nher with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance,\nthat he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged she would not\nmake herself uneasy.\n\n\"I know very well, madam,\" said he, \"that when persons sit down to a\ncard table, they must take their chance of these things,--and happily I\nam not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object. There\nare undoubtedly many who could not say the same, but thanks to Lady\nCatherine de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding\nlittle matters.\"\n\nMr. Wickham's attention was caught; and after observing Mr. Collins for\na few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation\nwere very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh.\n\n\"Lady Catherine de Bourgh,\" she replied, \"has very lately given him a\nliving. I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to her\nnotice, but he certainly has not known her long.\"\n\n\"You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy\nwere sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr. Darcy.\"\n\n\"No, indeed, I did not.--I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine's\nconnections. I never heard of her existence till the day before\nyesterday.\"\n\n\"Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is\nbelieved that she and her cousin will unite the two estates.\"\n\nThis information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor Miss\nBingley. Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her\naffection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already\nself-destined to another.\n\n\"Mr. Collins,\" said she, \"speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her\ndaughter; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship,\nI suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in spite of her being his\npatroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman.\"\n\n\"I believe her to be both in a great degree,\" replied Wickham; \"I have\nnot seen her for many years, but I very well remember that I never liked\nher, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent. She has the\nreputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe\nshe derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from\nher authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride of her nephew, who\nchuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of\nthe first class.\"\n\nElizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and\nthey continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put\nan end to cards; and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr.\nWickham's attentions. There could be no conversation in the noise of\nMrs. Philips's supper party, but his manners recommended him to every\nbody. Whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done\ngracefully. Elizabeth went away with her head full of him. She could\nthink of nothing but of Mr. Wickham, and of what he had told her, all\nthe way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as\nthey went, for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent. Lydia\ntalked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the\nfish she had won, and Mr. Collins, in describing the civility of Mr. and\nMrs. Philips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses\nat whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing\nthat he crouded his cousins, had more to say than he could well manage\nbefore the carriage stopped at Longbourn House.\n\n\n\n\n\nElizabeth related to Jane the next day, what had passed between Mr.\nWickham and herself. Jane listened with astonishment and concern;--she\nknew not how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr.\nBingley's regard; and yet, it was not in her nature to question the\nveracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham.--The\npossibility of his having really endured such unkindness, was enough to\ninterest all her tender feelings; and nothing therefore remained to be\ndone, but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each, and\nthrow into the account of accident or mistake, whatever could not be\notherwise explained.\n\n\"They have both,\" said she, \"been deceived, I dare say, in some way or\nother, of which we can form no idea. Interested people have perhaps\nmisrepresented each to the other. It is, in short, impossible for us to\nconjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them,\nwithout actual blame on either side.\"\n\n\"Very true, indeed;--and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to say in\nbehalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the\nbusiness?--Do clear _them_ too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of\nsomebody.\"\n\n\"Laugh as much as you chuse, but you will not laugh me out of my\nopinion. My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light\nit places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his father's favourite in such a\nmanner,--one, whom his father had promised to provide for.--It is\nimpossible. No man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his\ncharacter, could be capable of it. Can his most intimate friends be so\nexcessively deceived in him? oh! no.\"\n\n\"I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley's being imposed on, than\nthat Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me\nlast night; names, facts, every thing mentioned without ceremony.--If it\nbe not so, let Mr. Darcy contradict it. Besides, there was truth in his\nlooks.\"\n\n\"It is difficult indeed--it is distressing.--One does not know what to\nthink.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon;--one knows exactly what to think.\"\n\nBut Jane could think with certainty on only one point,--that Mr.\nBingley, if he _had been_ imposed on, would have much to suffer when the\naffair became public.\n\nThe two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this\nconversation passed, by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom\nthey had been speaking; Mr. Bingley and his sisters came to give their\npersonal invitation for the long expected ball at Netherfield, which was\nfixed for the following Tuesday. The two ladies were delighted to see\ntheir dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and\nrepeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their\nseparation. To the rest of the family they paid little attention;\navoiding Mrs. Bennet as much as possible, saying not much to Elizabeth,\nand nothing at all to the others. They were soon gone again, rising from\ntheir seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise, and\nhurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs. Bennet's civilities.\n\nThe prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every\nfemale of the family. Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as given in\ncompliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered by\nreceiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself, instead of a\nceremonious card. Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the\nsociety of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and\nElizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr.\nWickham, and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in Mr. Darcy's\nlooks and behaviour. The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia,\ndepended less on any single event, or any particular person, for though\nthey each, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr.\nWickham, he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and\na ball was at any rate, a ball. And even Mary could assure her family\nthat she had no disinclination for it.\n\n\"While I can have my mornings to myself,\" said she, \"it is enough.--I\nthink it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements.\nSociety has claims on us all; and I profess myself one of those who\nconsider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for every\nbody.\"\n\nElizabeth's spirits were so high on the occasion, that though she did\nnot often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins, she could not help asking\nhim whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley's invitation, and if he\ndid, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening's\namusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no\nscruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke\neither from the Archbishop, or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to\ndance.\n\n\"I am by no means of opinion, I assure you,\" said he, \"that a ball of\nthis kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people, can\nhave any evil tendency; and I am so far from objecting to dancing myself\nthat I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins\nin the course of the evening, and I take this opportunity of soliciting\nyours, Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially,--a\npreference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right\ncause, and not to any disrespect for her.\"\n\nElizabeth felt herself completely taken in. She had fully proposed being\nengaged by Wickham for those very dances:--and to have Mr. Collins\ninstead! her liveliness had been never worse timed. There was no help\nfor it however. Mr. Wickham's happiness and her own was per force\ndelayed a little longer, and Mr. Collins's proposal accepted with as\ngood a grace as she could. She was not the better pleased with his\ngallantry, from the idea it suggested of something more.--It now first\nstruck her, that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy of\nbeing the mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a\nquadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors.\nThe idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing\ncivilities toward herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a\ncompliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than\ngratified herself, by this effect of her charms, it was not long before\nher mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage\nwas exceedingly agreeable to _her_. Elizabeth however did not chuse to\ntake the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the\nconsequence of any reply. Mr. Collins might never make the offer, and\ntill he did, it was useless to quarrel about him.\n\nIf there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the\nyounger Miss Bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time,\nfor from the day of the invitation, to the day of the ball, there was\nsuch a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once. No\naunt, no officers, no news could be sought after;--the very shoe-roses\nfor Netherfield were got by proxy. Even Elizabeth might have found some\ntrial of her patience in weather, which totally suspended the\nimprovement of her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and nothing less than\na dance on Tuesday, could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday and\nMonday, endurable to Kitty and Lydia.\n\n\n\n\n\nTill Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield and looked in\nvain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a\ndoubt of his being present had never occurred to her. The certainty of\nmeeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that\nmight not unreasonably have alarmed her. She had dressed with more than\nusual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all\nthat remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than\nmight be won in the course of the evening. But in an instant arose the\ndreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for Mr. Darcy's\npleasure in the Bingleys' invitation to the officers; and though this\nwas not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was\npronounced by his friend Mr. Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, and\nwho told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business\nthe day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant\nsmile,\n\n\"I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, if\nhe had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here.\"\n\nThis part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught by\nElizabeth, and as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for\nWickham's absence than if her first surmise had been just, every feeling\nof displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate\ndisappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to\nthe polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to\nmake.--Attention, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to\nWickham. She was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and\nturned away with a degree of ill humour, which she could not wholly\nsurmount even in speaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind partiality\nprovoked her.\n\nBut Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect\nof her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her\nspirits; and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she had\nnot seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to\nthe oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular\nnotice. The two first dances, however, brought a return of distress;\nthey were dances of mortification. Mr. Collins, awkward and solemn,\napologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being\naware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable\npartner for a couple of dances can give. The moment of her release from\nhim was ecstacy.\n\nShe danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of\nWickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked. When those dances\nwere over she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with\nher, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy, who took\nher so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without\nknowing what she did, she accepted him. He walked away again\nimmediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of\nmind; Charlotte tried to console her.\n\n\"I dare say you will find him very agreeable.\"\n\n\"Heaven forbid!--_That_ would be the greatest misfortune of all!--To\nfind a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate!--Do not wish me\nsuch an evil.\"\n\nWhen the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her\nhand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a\nsimpleton and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant\nin the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence. Elizabeth made no\nanswer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which\nshe was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and\nreading in her neighbours' looks their equal amazement in beholding it.\nThey stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to\nimagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and at\nfirst was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would\nbe the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she made\nsome slight observation on the dance. He replied, and was again silent.\nAfter a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with\n\n\"It is _your_ turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy.--_I_ talked about\nthe dance, and _you_ ought to make some kind of remark on the size of\nthe room, or the number of couples.\"\n\nHe smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be\nsaid.\n\n\"Very well.--That reply will do for the present.--Perhaps by and bye I\nmay observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public\nones.--But _now_ we may be silent.\"\n\n\"Do you talk by rule then, while you are dancing?\"\n\n\"Sometimes. One must speak a little, you know. It would look odd to be\nentirely silent for half an hour together, and yet for the advantage of\n_some_, conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the\ntrouble of saying as little as possible.\"\n\n\"Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you\nimagine that you are gratifying mine?\"\n\n\"Both,\" replied Elizabeth archly; \"for I have always seen a great\nsimilarity in the turn of our minds.--We are each of an unsocial,\ntaciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say\nsomething that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to\nposterity with all the eclat of a proverb.\"\n\n\"This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure,\"\nsaid he. \"How near it may be to _mine_, I cannot pretend to say.--_You_\nthink it a faithful portrait undoubtedly.\"\n\n\"I must not decide on my own performance.\"\n\nHe made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone down\nthe dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often\nwalk to Meryton. She answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resist\nthe temptation, added, \"When you met us there the other day, we had just\nbeen forming a new acquaintance.\"\n\nThe effect was immediate. A deeper shade of hauteur overspread his\nfeatures, but he said not a word, and Elizabeth, though blaming herself\nfor her own weakness, could not go on. At length Darcy spoke, and in a\nconstrained manner said,\n\n\"Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his\n_making_ friends--whether he may be equally capable of _retaining_ them,\nis less certain.\"\n\n\"He has been so unlucky as to lose _your_ friendship,\" replied Elizabeth\nwith emphasis, \"and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all\nhis life.\"\n\nDarcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject. At\nthat moment Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass\nthrough the set to the other side of the room; but on perceiving Mr.\nDarcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his\ndancing and his partner.\n\n\"I have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear Sir. Such very\nsuperior dancing is not often seen. It is evident that you belong to the\nfirst circles. Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not\ndisgrace you, and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated,\nespecially when a certain desirable event, my dear Miss Eliza, (glancing\nat her sister and Bingley,) shall take place. What congratulations will\nthen flow in! I appeal to Mr. Darcy:--but let me not interrupt you,\nSir.--You will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching\nconverse of that young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me.\"\n\nThe latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but Sir\nWilliam's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his\neyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and\nJane, who were dancing together. Recovering himself, however, shortly,\nhe turned to his partner, and said,\n\n\"Sir William's interruption has made me forget what we were talking of.\"\n\n\"I do not think we were speaking at all. Sir William could not have\ninterrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for\nthemselves.--We have tried two or three subjects already without\nsuccess, and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine.\"\n\n\"What think you of books?\" said he, smiling.\n\n\"Books--Oh! no.--I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same\nfeelings.\"\n\n\"I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be\nno want of subject.--We may compare our different opinions.\"\n\n\"No--I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of\nsomething else.\"\n\n\"The _present_ always occupies you in such scenes--does it?\" said he,\nwith a look of doubt.\n\n\"Yes, always,\" she replied, without knowing what she said, for her\nthoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared\nby her suddenly exclaiming, \"I remember hearing you once say, Mr. Darcy,\nthat you hardly ever forgave, that your resentment once created was\nunappeasable. You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its _being\ncreated_.\"\n\n\"I am,\" said he, with a firm voice.\n\n\"And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?\"\n\n\"I hope not.\"\n\n\"It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion,\nto be secure of judging properly at first.\"\n\n\"May I ask to what these questions tend?\"\n\n\"Merely to the illustration of _your_ character,\" said she, endeavouring\nto shake off her gravity. \"I am trying to make it out.\"\n\n\"And what is your success?\"\n\nShe shook her head. \"I do not get on at all. I hear such different\naccounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly.\"\n\n\"I can readily believe,\" answered he gravely, \"that report may vary\ngreatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were\nnot to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to\nfear that the performance would reflect no credit on either.\"\n\n\"But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another\nopportunity.\"\n\n\"I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours,\" he coldly replied.\nShe said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in\nsilence; on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree, for\nin Darcy's breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her,\nwhich soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against\nanother.\n\nThey had not long separated when Miss Bingley came towards her, and with\nan expression of civil disdain thus accosted her,\n\n\"So, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George\nWickham!--Your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a\nthousand questions; and I find that the young man forgot to tell you,\namong his other communications, that he was the son of old Wickham, the\nlate Mr. Darcy's steward. Let me recommend you, however, as a friend,\nnot to give implicit confidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr.\nDarcy's using him ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he\nhas been always remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has\ntreated Mr. Darcy in a most infamous manner. I do not know the\nparticulars, but I know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to\nblame, that he cannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned, and that\nthough my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his\ninvitation to the officers, he was excessively glad to find that he had\ntaken himself out of the way. His coming into the country at all, is a\nmost insolent thing indeed, and I wonder how he could presume to do it.\nI pity you, Miss Eliza, for this discovery of your favourite's guilt;\nbut really considering his descent, one could not expect much better.\"\n\n\"His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same,\" said\nElizabeth angrily; \"for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse\nthan of being the son of Mr. Darcy's steward, and of _that_, I can\nassure you, he informed me himself.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer.\n\"Excuse my interference.--It was kindly meant.\"\n\n\"Insolent girl!\" said Elizabeth to herself.--\"You are much mistaken if\nyou expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this. I see\nnothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr.\nDarcy.\" She then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make\ninquiries on the same subject of Bingley. Jane met her with a smile of\nsuch sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently\nmarked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the\nevening.--Elizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that moment\nsolicitude for Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and every thing\nelse gave way before the hope of Jane's being in the fairest way for\nhappiness.\n\n\"I want to know,\" said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her\nsister's, \"what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham. But perhaps you have\nbeen too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person; in which case\nyou may be sure of my pardon.\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Jane, \"I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing\nsatisfactory to tell you. Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of his\nhistory, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have\nprincipally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct,\nthe probity and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that\nMr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has\nreceived; and I am sorry to say that by his account as well as his\nsister's, Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man. I am\nafraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy's\nregard.\"\n\n\"Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?\"\n\n\"No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton.\"\n\n\"This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy. I am\nperfectly satisfied. But what does he say of the living?\"\n\n\"He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard\nthem from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to\nhim _conditionally_ only.\"\n\n\"I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley's sincerity,\" said Elizabeth warmly;\n\"but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only. Mr.\nBingley's defence of his friend was a very able one I dare say, but\nsince he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt\nthe rest from that friend himself, I shall venture still to think of\nboth gentlemen as I did before.\"\n\nShe then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on\nwhich there could be no difference of sentiment. Elizabeth listened with\ndelight to the happy, though modest hopes which Jane entertained of\nBingley's regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence\nin it. On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew\nto Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last\npartner she had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them and\ntold her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to\nmake a most important discovery.\n\n\"I have found out,\" said he, \"by a singular accident, that there is now\nin the room a near relation of my patroness. I happened to overhear the\ngentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of\nthis house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of her mother\nLady Catherine. How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would\nhave thought of my meeting with--perhaps--a nephew of Lady Catherine de\nBourgh in this assembly!--I am most thankful that the discovery is made\nin time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to do,\nand trust he will excuse my not having done it before. My total\nignorance of the connection must plead my apology.\"\n\n\"You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy?\"\n\n\"Indeed I am. I shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier.\nI believe him to be Lady Catherine's _nephew_. It will be in my power to\nassure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se'night.\"\n\nElizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme; assuring him\nthat Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as\nan impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that it\nwas not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either\nside, and that if it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in\nconsequence, to begin the acquaintance.--Mr. Collins listened to her\nwith the determined air of following his own inclination, and when she\nceased speaking, replied thus,\n\n\"My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world of your\nexcellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your\nunderstanding, but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference\nbetween the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity, and those\nwhich regulate the clergy; for give me leave to observe that I consider\nthe clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank\nin the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the\nsame time maintained. You must therefore allow me to follow the dictates\nof my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to perform what I look\non as a point of duty. Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your\nadvice, which on every other subject shall be my constant guide, though\nin the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education and\nhabitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like\nyourself.\" And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr. Darcy, whose\nreception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose astonishment at\nbeing so addressed was very evident. Her cousin prefaced his speech with\na solemn bow, and though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if\nhearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words \"apology,\"\n\"Hunsford,\" and \"Lady Catherine de Bourgh.\"--It vexed her to see him\nexpose himself to such a man. Mr. Darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained\nwonder, and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him time to speak, replied\nwith an air of distant civility. Mr. Collins, however, was not\ndiscouraged from speaking again, and Mr. Darcy's contempt seemed\nabundantly increasing with the length of his second speech, and at the\nend of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way. Mr.\nCollins then returned to Elizabeth.\n\n\"I have no reason, I assure you,\" said he, \"to be dissatisfied with my\nreception. Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention. He answered\nme with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying,\nthat he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine's discernment as to be\ncertain she could never bestow a favour unworthily. It was really a very\nhandsome thought. Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him.\"\n\nAs Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned\nher attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley, and the\ntrain of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to,\nmade her perhaps almost as happy as Jane. She saw her in idea settled in\nthat very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection\ncould bestow; and she felt capable under such circumstances, of\nendeavouring even to like Bingley's two sisters. Her mother's thoughts\nshe plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to\nventure near her, lest she might hear too much. When they sat down to\nsupper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which\nplaced them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find\nthat her mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely,\nopenly, and of nothing else but of her expectation that Jane would be\nsoon married to Mr. Bingley.--It was an animating subject, and Mrs.\nBennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of\nthe match. His being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living\nbut three miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation;\nand then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of\nJane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as\nshe could do. It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger\ndaughters, as Jane's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of\nother rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be\nable to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that\nshe might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked. It was\nnecessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on\nsuch occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs.\nBennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life. She\nconcluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally\nfortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no\nchance of it.\n\nIn vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother's\nwords, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible\nwhisper; for to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the\nchief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them. Her\nmother only scolded her for being nonsensical.\n\n\"What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him? I am\nsure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say\nnothing _he_ may not like to hear.\"\n\n\"For heaven's sake, madam, speak lower.--What advantage can it be to you\nto offend Mr. Darcy?--You will never recommend yourself to his friend by\nso doing.\"\n\nNothing that she could say, however, had any influence. Her mother\nwould talk of her views in the same intelligible tone. Elizabeth blushed\nand blushed again with shame and vexation. She could not help frequently\nglancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what\nshe dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was\nconvinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her. The expression\nof his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and\nsteady gravity.\n\nAt length however Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who\nhad been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no\nlikelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken.\nElizabeth now began to revive. But not long was the interval of\ntranquillity; for when supper was over, singing was talked of, and she\nhad the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty,\npreparing to oblige the company. By many significant looks and silent\nentreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of\ncomplaisance,--but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an\nopportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song.\n\n### Summary:"}
{"original_length": 17735, "trunc_length": 16384, "text": "\n\nSummarize the following text into a summary of less than 800 words.\n### Text:\n\n\n\nColonel Fitzwilliam's manners were very much admired at the parsonage,\nand the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of\ntheir engagements at Rosings. It was some days, however, before they\nreceived any invitation thither, for while there were visitors in the\nhouse, they could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day,\nalmost a week after the gentlemen's arrival, that they were honoured by\nsuch an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to\ncome there in the evening. For the last week they had seen very little\nof either Lady Catherine or her daughter. Colonel Fitzwilliam had called\nat the parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr. Darcy they had\nonly seen at church.\n\nThe invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they joined\nthe party in Lady Catherine's drawing-room. Her ladyship received them\ncivilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so\nacceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact,\nalmost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy,\nmuch more than to any other person in the room.\n\nColonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; any thing was a\nwelcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs. Collins's pretty friend had\nmoreover caught his fancy very much. He now seated himself by her, and\ntalked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying\nat home, of new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so\nwell entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much\nspirit and flow, as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself, as\nwell as of Mr. Darcy. _His_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned\ntowards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship after a\nwhile shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not\nscruple to call out,\n\n\"What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam? What is it you are talking\nof? What are you telling Miss Bennet? Let me hear what it is.\"\n\n\"We are speaking of music, Madam,\" said he, when no longer able to avoid\na reply.\n\n\"Of music! Then pray speak aloud. It is of all subjects my delight. I\nmust have my share in the conversation, if you are speaking of music.\nThere are few people in England, I suppose, who have more true enjoyment\nof music than myself, or a better natural taste. If I had ever learnt, I\nshould have been a great proficient. And so would Anne, if her health\nhad allowed her to apply. I am confident that she would have performed\ndelightfully. How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?\"\n\nMr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister's proficiency.\n\n\"I am very glad to hear such a good account of her,\" said Lady\nCatherine; \"and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel,\nif she does not practise a great deal.\"\n\n\"I assure you, Madam,\" he replied, \"that she does not need such advice.\nShe practises very constantly.\"\n\n\"So much the better. It cannot be done too much; and when I next write\nto her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account. I often\ntell young ladies, that no excellence in music is to be acquired,\nwithout constant practice. I have told Miss Bennet several times, that\nshe will never play really well, unless she practises more; and though\nMrs. Collins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as I have often\ntold her, to come to Rosings every day, and play on the piano-forte in\nMrs. Jenkinson's room. She would be in nobody's way, you know, in that\npart of the house.\"\n\nMr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt's ill breeding, and made\nno answer.\n\nWhen coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having\npromised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument. He\ndrew a chair near her. Lady Catherine listened to half a song, and then\ntalked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away from\nher, and moving with his usual deliberation towards the piano-forte,\nstationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer's\ncountenance. Elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first\nconvenient pause, turned to him with an arch smile, and said,\n\n\"You mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this state to hear\nme? But I will not be alarmed though your sister _does_ play so well.\nThere is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at\nthe will of others. My courage always rises with every attempt to\nintimidate me.\"\n\n\"I shall not say that you are mistaken,\" he replied, \"because you could\nnot really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and I\nhave had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know, that you\nfind great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact\nare not your own.\"\n\nElizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to\nColonel Fitzwilliam, \"Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of\nme, and teach you not to believe a word I say. I am particularly unlucky\nin meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character, in a\npart of the world, where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree\nof credit. Indeed, Mr. Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention\nall that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire--and, give me\nleave to say, very impolitic too--for it is provoking me to retaliate,\nand such things may come out, as will shock your relations to hear.\"\n\n\"I am not afraid of you,\" said he, smilingly.\n\n\"Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of,\" cried Colonel\nFitzwilliam. \"I should like to know how he behaves among strangers.\"\n\n\"You shall hear then--but prepare yourself for something very dreadful.\nThe first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire, you must know,\nwas at a ball--and at this ball, what do you think he did? He danced\nonly four dances! I am sorry to pain you--but so it was. He danced only\nfour dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain knowledge,\nmore than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner. Mr.\nDarcy, you cannot deny the fact.\"\n\n\"I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly\nbeyond my own party.\"\n\n\"True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room. Well, Colonel\nFitzwilliam, what do I play next? My fingers wait your orders.\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" said Darcy, \"I should have judged better, had I sought an\nintroduction, but I am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers.\"\n\n\"Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?\" said Elizabeth, still\naddressing Colonel Fitzwilliam. \"Shall we ask him why a man of sense and\neducation, and who has lived in the world, is ill qualified to recommend\nhimself to strangers?\"\n\n\"I can answer your question,\" said Fitzwilliam, \"without applying to\nhim. It is because he will not give himself the trouble.\"\n\n\"I certainly have not the talent which some people possess,\" said Darcy,\n\"of conversing easily with those I have never seen before. I cannot\ncatch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their\nconcerns, as I often see done.\"\n\n\"My fingers,\" said Elizabeth, \"do not move over this instrument in the\nmasterly manner which I see so many women's do. They have not the same\nforce or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression. But then I\nhave always supposed it to be my own fault--because I would not take the\ntrouble of practising. It is not that I do not believe _my_ fingers as\ncapable as any other woman's of superior execution.\"\n\nDarcy smiled and said, \"You are perfectly right. You have employed your\ntime much better. No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can\nthink any thing wanting. We neither of us perform to strangers.\"\n\nHere they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to know\nwhat they were talking of. Elizabeth immediately began playing again.\nLady Catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said\nto Darcy,\n\n\"Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss, if she practised more, and\ncould have the advantage of a London master. She has a very good notion\nof fingering, though her taste is not equal to Anne's. Anne would have\nbeen a delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn.\"\n\nElizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his\ncousin's praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she\ndiscern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss\nDe Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley, that he might have\nbeen just as likely to marry _her_, had she been his relation.\n\nLady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth's performance, mixing\nwith them many instructions on execution and taste. Elizabeth received\nthem with all the forbearance of civility; and at the request of the\ngentlemen remained at the instrument till her Ladyship's carriage was\nready to take them all home.\n\n\n\n\n\nElizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to Jane,\nwhile Mrs. Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village,\nwhen she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of a\nvisitor. As she had heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely to be\nLady Catherine, and under that apprehension was putting away her\nhalf-finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions,\nwhen the door opened, and to her very great surprise, Mr. Darcy, and Mr.\nDarcy only, entered the room.\n\nHe seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised for his\nintrusion, by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to\nbe within.\n\nThey then sat down, and when her enquiries after Rosings were made,\nseemed in danger of sinking into total silence. It was absolutely\nnecessary, therefore, to think of something, and in this emergence\nrecollecting _when_ she had seen him last in Hertfordshire, and feeling\ncurious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty\ndeparture, she observed,\n\n\"How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, Mr. Darcy!\nIt must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr. Bingley to see you\nall after him so soon; for, if I recollect right, he went but the day\nbefore. He and his sisters were well, I hope, when you left London.\"\n\n\"Perfectly so--I thank you.\"\n\nShe found that she was to receive no other answer--and, after a short\npause, added,\n\n\"I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of ever\nreturning to Netherfield again?\"\n\n\"I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend\nvery little of his time there in future. He has many friends, and he is\nat a time of life when friends and engagements are continually\nincreasing.\"\n\n\"If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for the\nneighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we\nmight possibly get a settled family there. But perhaps Mr. Bingley did\nnot take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as\nfor his own, and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same\nprinciple.\"\n\n\"I should not be surprised,\" said Darcy, \"if he were to give it up, as\nsoon as any eligible purchase offers.\"\n\nElizabeth made no answer. She was afraid of talking longer of his\nfriend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the\ntrouble of finding a subject to him.\n\nHe took the hint, and soon began with, \"This seems a very comfortable\nhouse. Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to it when Mr.\nCollins first came to Hunsford.\"\n\n\"I believe she did--and I am sure she could not have bestowed her\nkindness on a more grateful object.\"\n\n\"Mr. Collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife.\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of\nthe very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made\nhim happy if they had. My friend has an excellent understanding--though\nI am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr. Collins as the wisest\nthing she ever did. She seems perfectly happy, however, and in a\nprudential light, it is certainly a very good match for her.\"\n\n\"It must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a\ndistance of her own family and friends.\"\n\n\"An easy distance do you call it? It is nearly fifty miles.\"\n\n\"And what is fifty miles of good road? Little more than half a day's\njourney. Yes, I call it a _very_ easy distance.\"\n\n\"I should never have considered the distance as one of the _advantages_\nof the match,\" cried Elizabeth. \"I should never have said Mrs. Collins\nwas settled _near_ her family.\"\n\n\"It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire. Any thing beyond\nthe very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far.\"\n\nAs he spoke there was a sort of smile, which Elizabeth fancied she\nunderstood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and\nNetherfield, and she blushed as she answered,\n\n\"I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her\nfamily. The far and the near must be relative, and depend on many\nvarying circumstances. Where there is fortune to make the expence of\ntravelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil. But that is not the\ncase _here_. Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a comfortable income, but not\nsuch a one as will allow of frequent journeys--and I am persuaded my\nfriend would not call herself _near_ her family under less than _half_\nthe present distance.\"\n\nMr. Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, \"_You_ cannot\nhave a right to such very strong local attachment. _You_ cannot have\nbeen always at Longbourn.\"\n\nElizabeth looked surprised. The gentleman experienced some change of\nfeeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and,\nglancing over it, said, in a colder voice,\n\n\"Are you pleased with Kent?\"\n\nA short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side\ncalm and concise--and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte\nand her sister, just returned from their walk. The tete-a-tete surprised\nthem. Mr. Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding\non Miss Bennet, and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying\nmuch to any body, went away.\n\n\"What can be the meaning of this!\" said Charlotte, as soon as he was\ngone. \"My dear Eliza he must be in love with you, or he would never have\ncalled on us in this familiar way.\"\n\nBut when Elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very likely,\neven to Charlotte's wishes, to be the case; and after various\nconjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from\nthe difficulty of finding any thing to do, which was the more probable\nfrom the time of year. All field sports were over. Within doors there\nwas Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard table, but gentlemen cannot be\nalways within doors; and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the\npleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the\ntwo cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither\nalmost every day. They called at various times of the morning, sometimes\nseparately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their\naunt. It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he\nhad pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended\nhim still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in\nbeing with him, as well as by his evident admiration of her, of her\nformer favourite George Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw\nthere was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners,\nshe believed he might have the best informed mind.\n\nBut why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more difficult\nto understand. It could not be for society, as he frequently sat there\nten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak, it\nseemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice--a sacrifice to\npropriety, not a pleasure to himself. He seldom appeared really\nanimated. Mrs. Collins knew not what to make of him. Colonel\nFitzwilliam's occasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was\ngenerally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told\nher; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of\nlove, and the object of that love, her friend Eliza, she sat herself\nseriously to work to find it out.--She watched him whenever they were at\nRosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much success. He\ncertainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that\nlook was disputable. It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often\ndoubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it\nseemed nothing but absence of mind.\n\nShe had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his\nbeing partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs.\nCollins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of\nraising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her\nopinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend's dislike would\nvanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power.\n\nIn her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying\nColonel Fitzwilliam. He was beyond comparison the pleasantest man; he\ncertainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but,\nto counterbalance these advantages, Mr. Darcy had considerable patronage\nin the church, and his cousin could have none at all.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than once did Elizabeth in her ramble within the Park, unexpectedly\nmeet Mr. Darcy.--She felt all the perverseness of the mischance that\nshould bring him where no one else was brought; and to prevent its ever\nhappening again, took care to inform him at first, that it was a\nfavourite haunt of hers.--How it could occur a second time therefore was\nvery odd!--Yet it did, and even a third. It seemed like wilful\nill-nature, or a voluntary penance, for on these occasions it was not\nmerely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away, but he\nactually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her. He never\nsaid a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of\nlistening much; but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre\nthat he was asking some odd unconnected questions--about her pleasure in\nbeing at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her opinion of Mr.\nand Mrs. Collins's happiness; and that in speaking of Rosings and her\nnot perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to expect that whenever\nshe came into Kent again she would be staying _there_ too. His words\nseemed to imply it. Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his thoughts?\nShe supposed, if he meant any thing, he must mean an allusion to what\nmight arise in that quarter. It distressed her a little, and she was\nquite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the\nParsonage.\n\nShe was engaged one day as she walked, in re-perusing Jane's last\nletter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not\nwritten in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by Mr. Darcy,\nshe saw on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her. Putting\naway the letter immediately and forcing a smile, she said,\n\n\"I did not know before that you ever walked this way.\"\n\n\"I have been making the tour of the Park,\" he replied, \"as I generally\ndo every year, and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage. Are\nyou going much farther?\"\n\n\"No, I should have turned in a moment.\"\n\nAnd accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the Parsonage\ntogether.\n\n\"Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?\" said she.\n\n\"Yes--if Darcy does not put it off again. But I am at his disposal. He\narranges the business just as he pleases.\"\n\n\"And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least\ngreat pleasure in the power of choice. I do not know any body who seems\nmore to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr. Darcy.\"\n\n\"He likes to have his own way very well,\" replied Colonel Fitzwilliam.\n\"But so we all do. It is only that he has better means of having it than\nmany others, because he is rich, and many others are poor. I speak\nfeelingly. A younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and\ndependence.\"\n\n\"In my opinion, the younger son of an Earl can know very little of\neither. Now, seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and\ndependence? When have you been prevented by want of money from going\nwherever you chose, or procuring any thing you had a fancy for?\"\n\n\"These are home questions--and perhaps I cannot say that I have\nexperienced many hardships of that nature. But in matters of greater\nweight, I may suffer from the want of money. Younger sons cannot marry\nwhere they like.\"\n\n\"Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often\ndo.\"\n\n\"Our habits of expence make us too dependant, and there are not many in\nmy rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to\nmoney.\"\n\n\"Is this,\" thought Elizabeth, \"meant for me?\" and she coloured at the\nidea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, \"And pray, what is\nthe usual price of an Earl's younger son? Unless the elder brother is\nvery sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds.\"\n\nHe answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped. To interrupt\na silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed,\nshe soon afterwards said,\n\n\"I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of\nhaving somebody at his disposal. I wonder he does not marry, to secure a\nlasting convenience of that kind. But, perhaps his sister does as well\nfor the present, and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he\nlikes with her.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Colonel Fitzwilliam, \"that is an advantage which he must\ndivide with me. I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy.\"\n\n\"Are you, indeed? And pray what sort of guardians do you make? Does your\ncharge give you much trouble? Young ladies of her age, are sometimes a\nlittle difficult to manage, and if she has the true Darcy spirit, she\nmay like to have her own way.\"\n\nAs she spoke, she observed him looking at her earnestly, and the manner\nin which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to\ngive them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other\ngot pretty near the truth. She directly replied,\n\n\"You need not be frightened. I never heard any harm of her; and I dare\nsay she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world. She is a\nvery great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst and\nMiss Bingley. I think I have heard you say that you know them.\"\n\n\"I know them a little. Their brother is a pleasant gentleman-like\nman--he is a great friend of Darcy's.\"\n\n\"Oh! yes,\" said Elizabeth drily--\"Mr. Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr.\nBingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him.\"\n\n\"Care of him!--Yes, I really believe Darcy _does_ take care of him in\nthose points where he most wants care. From something that he told me in\nour journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to\nhim. But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose that\nBingley was the person meant. It was all conjecture.\"\n\n\"What is it you mean?\"\n\n\"It is a circumstance which Darcy of course would not wish to be\ngenerally known, because if it were to get round to the lady's family,\nit would be an unpleasant thing.\"\n\n\"You may depend upon my not mentioning it.\"\n\n\"And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be\nBingley. What he told me was merely this; that he congratulated himself\non having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most\nimprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other\nparticulars, and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him\nthe kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from\nknowing them to have been together the whole of last summer.\"\n\n\"Did Mr. Darcy give you his reasons for this interference?\"\n\n\"I understood that there were some very strong objections against the\nlady.\"\n\n\"And what arts did he use to separate them?\"\n\n\"He did not talk to me of his own arts,\" said Fitzwilliam smiling. \"He\nonly told me, what I have now told you.\"\n\nElizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with\nindignation. After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her why she\nwas so thoughtful.\n\n\"I am thinking of what you have been telling me,\" said she. \"Your\ncousin's conduct does not suit my feelings. Why was he to be the judge?\"\n\n\"You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?\"\n\n\"I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the propriety of\nhis friend's inclination, or why, upon his own judgment alone, he was to\ndetermine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy.\" \"But,\"\nshe continued, recollecting herself, \"as we know none of the\nparticulars, it is not fair to condemn him. It is not to be supposed\nthat there was much affection in the case.\"\n\n\"That is not an unnatural surmise,\" said Fitzwilliam, \"but it is\nlessening the honour of my cousin's triumph very sadly.\"\n\nThis was spoken jestingly, but it appeared to her so just a picture of\nMr. Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer; and,\ntherefore, abruptly changing the conversation, talked on indifferent\nmatters till they reached the parsonage. There, shut into her own room,\nas soon as their visitor left them, she could think without interruption\nof all that she had heard. It was not to be supposed that any other\npeople could be meant than those with whom she was connected. There\ncould not exist in the world _two_ men, over whom Mr. Darcy could have\nsuch boundless influence. That he had been concerned in the measures\ntaken to separate Mr. Bingley and Jane, she had never doubted; but she\nhad always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and\narrangement of them. If his own vanity, however, did not mislead him,\n_he_ was the cause, his pride and caprice were the cause of all that\nJane had suffered, and still continued to suffer. He had ruined for a\nwhile every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart\nin the world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have\ninflicted.\n\n\"There were some very strong objections against the lady,\" were Colonel\nFitzwilliam's words, and these strong objections probably were, her\nhaving one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in\nbusiness in London.\n\n\"To Jane herself,\" she exclaimed, \"there could be no possibility of\nobjection. All loveliness and goodness as she is! Her understanding\nexcellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating. Neither could\nany thing be urged against my father, who, though with some\npeculiarities, has abilities which Mr. Darcy himself need not disdain,\nand respectability which he will probably never reach.\" When she thought\nof her mother indeed, her confidence gave way a little, but she would\nnot allow that any objections _there_ had material weight with Mr.\nDarcy, whose pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from\nthe want of importance in his friend's connections, than from their want\nof sense; and she was quite decided at last, that he had been partly\ngoverned by this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of\nretaining Mr. Bingley for his sister.\n\nThe agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on a\nheadache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that, added to\nher unwillingness to see Mr. Darcy, it determined her not to attend her\ncousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea. Mrs. Collins,\nseeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to go, and as much\nas possible prevented her husband from pressing her, but Mr. Collins\ncould not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine's being rather\ndispleased by her staying at home.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself as\nmuch as possible against Mr. Darcy, chose for her employment the\nexamination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her\nbeing in Kent. They contained no actual complaint, nor was there any\nrevival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering.\nBut in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that\ncheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style, and which,\nproceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself, and kindly\ndisposed towards every one, had been scarcely ever clouded. Elizabeth\nnoticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an\nattention which it had hardly received on the first perusal. Mr. Darcy's\nshameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict, gave her a\nkeener sense of her sister's sufferings. It was some consolation to\nthink that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the next,\nand a still greater, that in less than a fortnight she should herself be\nwith Jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her\nspirits, by all that affection could do.\n\nShe could not think of Darcy's leaving Kent, without remembering that\nhis cousin was to go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear\nthat he had no intentions at all, and agreeable as he was, she did not\nmean to be unhappy about him.\n\nWhile settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the\ndoor bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its\nbeing Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in\nthe evening, and might now come to enquire particularly after her. But\nthis idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently\naffected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the\nroom. In an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her\nhealth, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better.\nShe answered him with cold civility. He sat down for a few moments, and\nthen getting up walked about the room. Elizabeth was surprised, but said\nnot a word. After a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an\nagitated manner, and thus began,\n\n\"In vain have I struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be\nrepressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love\nyou.\"\n\nElizabeth's astonishment was beyond expression. She stared, coloured,\ndoubted, and was silent. This he considered sufficient encouragement,\nand the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her,\nimmediately followed. He spoke well, but there were feelings besides\nthose of the heart to be detailed, and he was not more eloquent on the\nsubject of tenderness than of pride. His sense of her inferiority--of\nits being a degradation--of the family obstacles which judgment had\nalways opposed to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed\ndue to the consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to\nrecommend his suit.\n\nIn spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to\nthe compliment of such a man's affection, and though her intentions did\nnot vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to\nreceive; till, roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she lost\nall compassion in anger. She tried, however, to compose herself to\nanswer him with patience, when he should have done. He concluded with\nrepresenting to her the strength of that attachment which, in spite of\nall his endeavours, he had found impossible to conquer; and with\nexpressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of\nhis hand. As he said this, she could easily see that he had no doubt of\na favourable answer. He _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety, but his\ncountenance expressed real security. Such a circumstance could only\nexasperate farther, and when he ceased, the colour rose into her\ncheeks, and she said,\n\n\"In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to\nexpress a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however\nunequally they may be returned. It is natural that obligation should be\nfelt, and if I could _feel_ gratitude, I would now thank you. But I\ncannot--I have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly\nbestowed it most unwillingly. I am sorry to have occasioned pain to any\none. It has been most unconsciously done, however, and I hope will be of\nshort duration. The feelings which, you tell me, have long prevented the\nacknowledgment of your regard, can have little difficulty in overcoming\nit after this explanation.\"\n\nMr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantle-piece with his eyes fixed\non her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than\nsurprise. His complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance of\nhis mind was visible in every feature. He was struggling for the\nappearance of composure, and would not open his lips, till he believed\nhimself to have attained it. The pause was to Elizabeth's feelings\ndreadful. At length, in a voice of forced calmness, he said,\n\n\"And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting! I\nmight, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little _endeavour_ at\ncivility, I am thus rejected. But it is of small importance.\"\n\n\"I might as well enquire,\" replied she, \"why with so evident a design of\noffending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me\nagainst your will, against your reason, and even against your character?\nWas not this some excuse for incivility, if I _was_ uncivil? But I have\nother provocations. You know I have. Had not my own feelings decided\nagainst you, had they been indifferent, or had they even been\nfavourable, do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept\nthe man, who has been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the\nhappiness of a most beloved sister?\"\n\nAs she pronounced these words, Mr. Darcy changed colour; but the emotion\nwas short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she\ncontinued.\n\n\"I have every reason in the world to think ill of you. No motive can\nexcuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_. You dare not,\nyou cannot deny that you have been the principal, if not the only means\nof dividing them from each other, of exposing one to the censure of the\nworld for caprice and instability, the other to its derision for\ndisappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest\nkind.\"\n\nShe paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening\nwith an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse.\nHe even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity.\n\n\"Can you deny that you have done it?\" she repeated.\n\nWith assumed tranquillity he then replied, \"I have no wish of denying\nthat I did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your\nsister, or that I rejoice in my success. Towards _him_ I have been\nkinder than towards myself.\"\n\nElizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection,\nbut its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her.\n\n\"But it is not merely this affair,\" she continued, \"on which my dislike\nis founded. Long before it had taken place, my opinion of you was\ndecided. Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received\nmany months ago from Mr. Wickham. On this subject, what can you have to\nsay? In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself?\nor under what misrepresentation, can you here impose upon others?\"\n\n\"You take an eager interest in that gentleman's concerns,\" said Darcy in\na less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.\n\n\"Who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help feeling an\ninterest in him?\"\n\n\"His misfortunes!\" repeated Darcy contemptuously; \"yes, his misfortunes\nhave been great indeed.\"\n\n\"And of your infliction,\" cried Elizabeth with energy. \"You have reduced\nhim to his present state of poverty, comparative poverty. You have\nwithheld the advantages, which you must know to have been designed for\nhim. You have deprived the best years of his life, of that independence\nwhich was no less his due than his desert. You have done all this! and\nyet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and\nridicule.\"\n\n\"And this,\" cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room,\n\"is your opinion of me! This is the estimation in which you hold me! I\nthank you for explaining it so fully. My faults, according to this\ncalculation, are heavy indeed! But perhaps,\" added he, stopping in his\nwalk, and turning towards her, \"these offences might have been\noverlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the\nscruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design. These\nbitter accusations might have been suppressed, had I with greater policy\nconcealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of my being\nimpelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by\nreflection, by every thing. But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence.\nNor am I ashamed of the feelings I related. They were natural and just.\nCould you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections?\nTo congratulate myself on the hope of relations, whose condition in life\nis so decidedly beneath my own?\"\n\nElizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to\nthe utmost to speak with composure when she said,\n\n\"You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your\ndeclaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared me the\nconcern which I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a\nmore gentleman-like manner.\"\n\nShe saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and she continued,\n\n\"You could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way\nthat would have tempted me to accept it.\"\n\nAgain his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an\nexpression of mingled incredulity and mortification. She went on.\n\n\"From the very beginning, from the first moment I may almost say, of my\nacquaintance with you, your manners impressing me with the fullest\nbelief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the\nfeelings of others, were such as to form that ground-work of\ndisapprobation, on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a\ndislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the\nlast man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.\"\n\n\"You have said quite enough, madam. I perfectly comprehend your\nfeelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been.\nForgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best\nwishes for your health and happiness.\"\n\nAnd with these words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth heard him\nthe next moment open the front door and quit the house.\n\nThe tumult of her mind was now painfully great. She knew not how to\nsupport herself, and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an\nhour. Her astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed, was\nincreased by every review of it. That she should receive an offer of\nmarriage from Mr. Darcy! that he should have been in love with her for\nso many months! so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all\nthe objections which had made him prevent his friend's marrying her\nsister, and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case,\nwas almost incredible! it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously\nso strong an affection. But his pride, his abominable pride, his\nshameless avowal of what he had done with respect to Jane, his\nunpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though he could not justify it,\nand the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr. Wickham, his\ncruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon overcame the\npity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited.\n\nShe continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of Lady\nCatherine's carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter\nCharlotte's observation, and hurried her away to her room.\n\n\n\n\n\nElizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations\nwhich had at length closed her eyes. She could not yet recover from the\nsurprise of what had happened; it was impossible to think of any thing\nelse, and totally indisposed for employment, she resolved soon after\nbreakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise. She was proceeding\ndirectly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcy's\nsometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park,\nshe turned up the lane, which led her farther from the turnpike road.\nThe park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed\none of the gates into the ground.\n\nAfter walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was\ntempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and\nlook into the park. The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent, had\nmade a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the\nverdure of the early trees. She was on the point of continuing her walk,\nwhen she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which\nedged the park; he was moving that way; and fearful of its being Mr.\nDarcy, she was directly retreating. But the person who advanced, was now\nnear enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness, pronounced\nher name. She had turned away, but on hearing herself called, though in\na voice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy, she moved again towards the\ngate. He had by that time reached it also, and holding out a letter,\nwhich she instinctively took, said with a look of haughty composure, \"I\nhave been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you.\nWill you do me the honour of reading that letter?\"--And then, with a\nslight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of\nsight.\n\nWith no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity,\nElizabeth opened the letter, and to her still increasing wonder,\nperceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper, written\nquite through, in a very close hand.--The envelope itself was likewise\nfull.--Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it. It was dated\nfrom Rosings, at eight o'clock in the morning, and was as follows:--\n\n     \"Be not alarmed, Madam, on receiving this letter, by the\n     apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments,\n     or renewal of those offers, which were last night so disgusting to\n     you. I write without any intention of paining you, or humbling\n     myself, by dwelling on wishes, which, for the happiness of both,\n     cannot be too soon forgotten; and the effort which the formation,\n     and the perusal of this letter must occasion, should have been\n     spared, had not my character required it to be written and read.\n     You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand your\n     attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but I\n     demand it of your justice.\n\n     \"Two offences of a very different nature, and by no means of equal\n     magnitude, you last night laid to my charge. The first mentioned\n     was, that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached\n     Mr. Bingley from your sister,--and the other, that I had, in\n     defiance of various claims, in defiance of honour and humanity,\n     ruined the immediate prosperity, and blasted the prospects of Mr.\n     Wickham.--Wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of\n     my youth, the acknowledged favourite of my father, a young man who\n     had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage, and who\n     had been brought up to expect its exertion, would be a depravity,\n     to which the separation of two young persons, whose affection could\n     be the growth of only a few weeks, could bear no comparison.--But\n     from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally\n     bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope to be in\n     future secured, when the following account of my actions and their\n     motives has been read.--If, in the explanation of them which is\n     due to myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which\n     may be offensive to your's, I can only say that I am sorry.--The\n     necessity must be obeyed--and farther apology would be absurd.--I\n     had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common with\n     others, that Bingley preferred your eldest sister, to any other\n     young woman in the country.--But it was not till the evening of the\n     dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a\n     serious attachment.--I had often seen him in love before.--At that\n     ball, while I had the honour of dancing with you, I was first made\n     acquainted, by Sir William Lucas's accidental information, that\n     Bingley's attentions to your sister had given rise to a general\n     expectation of their marriage. He spoke of it as a certain event,\n     of which the time alone could be undecided. From that moment I\n     observed my friend's behaviour attentively; and I could then\n     perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had\n     ever witnessed in him. Your sister I also watched.--Her look and\n     manners were open, cheerful and engaging as ever, but without any\n     symptom of peculiar regard, and I remained convinced from the\n     evening's scrutiny, that though she received his attentions with\n     pleasure, she did not invite them by any participation of\n     sentiment.--If _you_ have not been mistaken here, _I_ must have\n     been in an error. Your superior knowledge of your sister must make\n     the latter probable.--If it be so, if I have been misled by such\n     error, to inflict pain on her, your resentment has not been\n     unreasonable. But I shall not scruple to assert, that the serenity\n     of your sister's countenance and air was such, as might have given\n     the most acute observer, a conviction that, however amiable her\n     temper, her heart was not likely to be easily touched.--That I was\n     desirous of believing her indifferent is certain,--but I will\n     venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually\n     influenced by my hopes or fears.--I did not believe her to be\n     indifferent because I wished it;--I believed it on impartial\n     conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason.--My objections to\n     the marriage were not merely those, which I last night acknowledged\n     to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside, in my\n     own case; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to\n     my friend as to me.--But there were other causes of\n     repugnance;--causes which, though still existing, and existing to\n     an equal degree in both instances, I had myself endeavoured to\n     forget, because they were not immediately before me.--These causes\n     must be stated, though briefly.--The situation of your mother's\n     family, though objectionable, was nothing in comparison of that\n     total want of propriety so frequently, so almost uniformly betrayed\n     by herself, by your three younger sisters, and occasionally even by\n     your father.--Pardon me.--It pains me to offend you. But amidst\n     your concern for the defects of your nearest relations, and your\n     displeasure at this representation of them, let it give you\n     consolation to consider that, to have conducted yourselves so as to\n     avoid any share of the like censure, is praise no less generally\n     bestowed on you and your eldest sister, than it is honourable to\n     the sense and disposition of both.--I will only say farther, that\n     from what passed that evening, my opinion of all parties was\n     confirmed, and every inducement heightened, which could have led me\n     before, to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy\n     connection.--He left Netherfield for London, on the day following,\n     as you, I am certain, remember, with the design of soon\n     returning.--The part which I acted, is now to be explained.--His\n     sisters' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own; our\n     coincidence of feeling was soon discovered; and, alike sensible\n     that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother, we shortly\n     resolved on joining him directly in London.--We accordingly\n     went--and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to\n     my friend, the certain evils of such a choice.--I described, and\n     enforced them earnestly.--But, however this remonstrance might have\n     staggered or delayed his determination, I do not suppose that it\n     would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been\n     seconded by the assurance which I hesitated not in giving, of your\n     sister's indifference. He had before believed her to return his\n     affection with sincere, if not with equal regard.--But Bingley has\n     great natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgment\n     than on his own.--To convince him, therefore, that he had deceived\n     himself, was no very difficult point. To persuade him against\n     returning into Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been given,\n     was scarcely the work of a moment.--I cannot blame myself for\n     having done thus much. There is but one part of my conduct in the\n     whole affair, on which I do not reflect with satisfaction; it is\n     that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to\n     conceal from him your sister's being in town. I knew it myself, as\n     it was known to Miss Bingley, but her brother is even yet ignorant\n     of it.--That they might have met without ill consequence, is\n     perhaps probable;--but his regard did not appear to me enough\n     extinguished for him to see her without some danger.--Perhaps this\n     concealment, this disguise, was beneath me.--It is done, however,\n     and it was done for the best.--On this subject I have nothing more\n     to say, no other apology to offer. If I have wounded your sister's\n     feelings, it was unknowingly done; and though the motives which\n     governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient, I have\n     not yet learnt to condemn them.--With respect to that other, more\n     weighty accusation, of having injured Mr. Wickham, I can only\n     refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my\n     family. Of what he has _particularly_ accused me I am ignorant; but\n     of the truth of what I shall relate, I can summon more than one\n     witness of undoubted veracity. Mr. Wickham is the son of a very\n     respectable man, who had for many years the management of all the\n     Pemberley estates; and whose good conduct in the discharge of his\n     trust, naturally inclined my father to be of service to him, and on\n     George Wickham, who was his god-son, his kindness was therefore\n     liberally bestowed. My father supported him at school, and\n     afterwards at Cambridge;--most important assistance, as his own\n     father, always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have\n     been unable to give him a gentleman's education. My father was not\n     only fond of this young man's society, whose manners were always\n     engaging; he had also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the\n     church would be his profession, intended to provide for him in it.\n     As for myself, it is many, many years since I first began to think\n     of him in a very different manner. The vicious propensities--the\n     want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge\n     of his best friend, could not escape the observation of a young man\n     of nearly the same age with himself, and who had opportunities of\n     seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr. Darcy could not have.\n     Here again I shall give you pain--to what degree you only can tell.\n     But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham has created, a\n     suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his\n     real character. It adds even another motive. My excellent father\n     died about five years ago; and his attachment to Mr. Wickham was to\n     the last so steady, that in his will he particularly recommended it\n     to me, to promote his advancement in the best manner that his\n     profession might allow, and if he took orders, desired that a\n     valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became\n     vacant. There was also a legacy of one thousand pounds. His own\n     father did not long survive mine, and within half a year from these\n     events, Mr. Wickham wrote to inform me that, having finally\n     resolved against taking orders, he hoped I should not think it\n     unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary\n     advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he could not be\n     benefited. He had some intention, he added, of studying the law,\n     and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would\n     be a very insufficient support therein. I rather wished, than\n     believed him to be sincere; but at any rate, was perfectly ready to\n     accede to his proposal. I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a\n     clergyman. The business was therefore soon settled. He resigned all\n     claim to assistance in the church, were it possible that he could\n     ever be in a situation to receive it, and accepted in return three\n     thousand pounds. All connection between us seemed now dissolved. I\n     thought too ill of him, to invite him to Pemberley, or admit his\n     society in town. In town I believe he chiefly lived, but his\n     studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free from all\n     restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation. For\n     about three years I heard little of him; but on the decease of the\n     incumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he applied\n     to me again by letter for the presentation. His circumstances, he\n     assured me, and I had no difficulty in believing it, were\n     exceedingly bad. He had found the law a most unprofitable study,\n     and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if I would\n     present him to the living in question--of which he trusted there\n     could be little doubt, as he was well assured that I had no other\n     person to provide for, and I could not have forgotten my revered\n     father's intentions. You will hardly blame me for refusing to\n     comply with this entreaty, or for resisting every repetition of it.\n     His resentment was in proportion to the distress of his\n     circumstances--and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me\n     to others, as in his reproaches to myself. After this period, every\n     appearance of acquaintance was dropt. How he lived I know not. But\n     last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice. I\n     must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget\n     myself, and which no obligation less than the present should induce\n     me to unfold to any human being. Having said thus much, I feel no\n     doubt of your secrecy. My sister, who is more than ten years my\n     junior, was left to the guardianship of my mother's nephew, Colonel\n     Fitzwilliam, and myself. About a year ago, she was taken from\n     school, and an establishment formed for her in London; and last\n     summer she went with the lady who presided over it, to Ramsgate;\n     and thither also went Mr. Wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there\n     proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and Mrs.\n     Younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and by\n     her connivance and aid, he so far recommended himself to Georgiana,\n     whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his\n     kindness to her as a child, that she was persuaded to believe\n     herself in love, and to consent to an elopement. She was then but\n     fifteen, which must be her excuse; and after stating her\n     imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed the knowledge of it to\n     herself. I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the\n     intended elopement, and then Georgiana, unable to support the idea\n     of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as\n     a father, acknowledged the whole to me. You may imagine what I felt\n     and how I acted. Regard for my sister's credit and feelings\n     prevented any public exposure, but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left\n     the place immediately, and Mrs. Younge was of course removed from\n     her charge. Mr. Wickham's chief object was unquestionably my\n     sister's fortune, which is thirty thousand pounds; but I cannot\n     help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me, was a\n     strong inducement. His revenge would have been complete indeed.\n     This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we\n     have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject\n     it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty\n     towards Mr. Wickham. I know not in what manner, under what form of\n     falsehood he has imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to\n     be wondered at. Ignorant as you previously were of every thing\n     concerning either, detection could not be in your power, and\n     suspicion certainly not in your inclination. You may possibly\n     wonder why all this was not told you last night. But I was not then\n     master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed.\n     For the truth of every thing here related, I can appeal more\n     particularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam, who from our\n     near relationship and constant intimacy, and still more as one of\n     the executors of my father's will, has been unavoidably acquainted\n     with every particular of these transactions. If your abhorrence of\n     _me_ should make _my_ assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented\n     by the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there may\n     be the possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour to find\n     some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course\n     of the morning. I will only add, God bless you.\n\n     \"FITZWILLIAM DARCY.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIf Elizabeth, when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to\ncontain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of\nits contents. But such as they were, it may be well supposed how eagerly\nshe went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited.\nHer feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined. With amazement did\nshe first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power;\nand steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to\ngive, which a just sense of shame would not conceal. With a strong\nprejudice against every thing he might say, she began his account of\nwhat had happened at Netherfield. She read, with an eagerness which\nhardly left her power of comprehension, and from impatience of knowing\nwhat the next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the\nsense of the one before her eyes. His belief of her sister's\ninsensibility, she instantly resolved to be false, and his account of\nthe real, the worst objections to the match, made her too angry to have\nany wish of doing him justice. He expressed no regret for what he had\ndone which satisfied her; his style was not penitent, but haughty. It\nwas all pride and insolence.\n\nBut when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr. Wickham, when\nshe read with somewhat clearer attention, a relation of events, which,\nif true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which\nbore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself, her feelings\nwere yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition.\nAstonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her. She wished\nto discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, \"This must be false!\nThis cannot be! This must be the grossest falsehood!\"--and when she had\ngone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing any thing of the\nlast page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not\nregard it, that she would never look in it again.\n\nIn this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on\nnothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the letter\nwas unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she could, she\nagain began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham, and\ncommanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence.\nThe account of his connection with the Pemberley family, was exactly\nwhat he had related himself; and the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy,\nthough she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his\nown words.\n\n### Summary:"}
{"original_length": 17383, "trunc_length": 16384, "text": "\n\nSummarize the following text into a summary of less than 800 words.\n### Text:\n\n\n\nFor two months the fugitives remained absent; in those two months, Mrs.\nLinton encountered and conquered the worst shock of what was denominated\na brain fever.  No mother could have nursed an only child more devotedly\nthan Edgar tended her.  Day and night he was watching, and patiently\nenduring all the annoyances that irritable nerves and a shaken reason\ncould inflict; and, though Kenneth remarked that what he saved from the\ngrave would only recompense his care by forming the source of constant\nfuture anxiety--in fact, that his health and strength were being\nsacrificed to preserve a mere ruin of humanity--he knew no limits in\ngratitude and joy when Catherine's life was declared out of danger; and\nhour after hour he would sit beside her, tracing the gradual return to\nbodily health, and flattering his too sanguine hopes with the illusion\nthat her mind would settle back to its right balance also, and she would\nsoon be entirely her former self.\n\nThe first time she left her chamber was at the commencement of the\nfollowing March.  Mr. Linton had put on her pillow, in the morning, a\nhandful of golden crocuses; her eye, long stranger to any gleam of\npleasure, caught them in waking, and shone delighted as she gathered them\neagerly together.\n\n'These are the earliest flowers at the Heights,' she exclaimed.  'They\nremind me of soft thaw winds, and warm sunshine, and nearly melted snow.\nEdgar, is there not a south wind, and is not the snow almost gone?'\n\n'The snow is quite gone down here, darling,' replied her husband; 'and I\nonly see two white spots on the whole range of moors: the sky is blue,\nand the larks are singing, and the becks and brooks are all brim full.\nCatherine, last spring at this time, I was longing to have you under this\nroof; now, I wish you were a mile or two up those hills: the air blows so\nsweetly, I feel that it would cure you.'\n\n'I shall never be there but once more,' said the invalid; 'and then\nyou'll leave me, and I shall remain for ever.  Next spring you'll long\nagain to have me under this roof, and you'll look back and think you were\nhappy to-day.'\n\nLinton lavished on her the kindest caresses, and tried to cheer her by\nthe fondest words; but, vaguely regarding the flowers, she let the tears\ncollect on her lashes and stream down her cheeks unheeding.  We knew she\nwas really better, and, therefore, decided that long confinement to a\nsingle place produced much of this despondency, and it might be partially\nremoved by a change of scene.  The master told me to light a fire in the\nmany-weeks' deserted parlour, and to set an easy-chair in the sunshine by\nthe window; and then he brought her down, and she sat a long while\nenjoying the genial heat, and, as we expected, revived by the objects\nround her: which, though familiar, were free from the dreary associations\ninvesting her hated sick chamber.  By evening she seemed greatly\nexhausted; yet no arguments could persuade her to return to that\napartment, and I had to arrange the parlour sofa for her bed, till\nanother room could be prepared.  To obviate the fatigue of mounting and\ndescending the stairs, we fitted up this, where you lie at present--on\nthe same floor with the parlour; and she was soon strong enough to move\nfrom one to the other, leaning on Edgar's arm.  Ah, I thought myself, she\nmight recover, so waited on as she was.  And there was double cause to\ndesire it, for on her existence depended that of another: we cherished\nthe hope that in a little while Mr. Linton's heart would be gladdened,\nand his lands secured from a stranger's grip, by the birth of an heir.\n\nI should mention that Isabella sent to her brother, some six weeks from\nher departure, a short note, announcing her marriage with Heathcliff.  It\nappeared dry and cold; but at the bottom was dotted in with pencil an\nobscure apology, and an entreaty for kind remembrance and reconciliation,\nif her proceeding had offended him: asserting that she could not help it\nthen, and being done, she had now no power to repeal it.  Linton did not\nreply to this, I believe; and, in a fortnight more, I got a long letter,\nwhich I considered odd, coming from the pen of a bride just out of the\nhoneymoon.  I'll read it: for I keep it yet.  Any relic of the dead is\nprecious, if they were valued living.\n\n* * * * *\n\nDEAR ELLEN, it begins,--I came last night to Wuthering Heights, and\nheard, for the first time, that Catherine has been, and is yet, very ill.\nI must not write to her, I suppose, and my brother is either too angry or\ntoo distressed to answer what I sent him.  Still, I must write to\nsomebody, and the only choice left me is you.\n\nInform Edgar that I'd give the world to see his face again--that my heart\nreturned to Thrushcross Grange in twenty-four hours after I left it, and\nis there at this moment, full of warm feelings for him, and Catherine!  _I\ncan't follow it though_--(these words are underlined)--they need not\nexpect me, and they may draw what conclusions they please; taking care,\nhowever, to lay nothing at the door of my weak will or deficient\naffection.\n\nThe remainder of the letter is for yourself alone.  I want to ask you two\nquestions: the first is,--How did you contrive to preserve the common\nsympathies of human nature when you resided here?  I cannot recognise any\nsentiment which those around share with me.\n\nThe second question I have great interest in; it is this--Is Mr.\nHeathcliff a man?  If so, is he mad?  And if not, is he a devil?  I\nsha'n't tell my reasons for making this inquiry; but I beseech you to\nexplain, if you can, what I have married: that is, when you call to see\nme; and you must call, Ellen, very soon.  Don't write, but come, and\nbring me something from Edgar.\n\nNow, you shall hear how I have been received in my new home, as I am led\nto imagine the Heights will be.  It is to amuse myself that I dwell on\nsuch subjects as the lack of external comforts: they never occupy my\nthoughts, except at the moment when I miss them.  I should laugh and\ndance for joy, if I found their absence was the total of my miseries, and\nthe rest was an unnatural dream!\n\nThe sun set behind the Grange as we turned on to the moors; by that, I\njudged it to be six o'clock; and my companion halted half an hour, to\ninspect the park, and the gardens, and, probably, the place itself, as\nwell as he could; so it was dark when we dismounted in the paved yard of\nthe farm-house, and your old fellow-servant, Joseph, issued out to\nreceive us by the light of a dip candle.  He did it with a courtesy that\nredounded to his credit.  His first act was to elevate his torch to a\nlevel with my face, squint malignantly, project his under-lip, and turn\naway.  Then he took the two horses, and led them into the stables;\nreappearing for the purpose of locking the outer gate, as if we lived in\nan ancient castle.\n\nHeathcliff stayed to speak to him, and I entered the kitchen--a dingy,\nuntidy hole; I daresay you would not know it, it is so changed since it\nwas in your charge.  By the fire stood a ruffianly child, strong in limb\nand dirty in garb, with a look of Catherine in his eyes and about his\nmouth.\n\n'This is Edgar's legal nephew,' I reflected--'mine in a manner; I must\nshake hands, and--yes--I must kiss him.  It is right to establish a good\nunderstanding at the beginning.'\n\nI approached, and, attempting to take his chubby fist, said--'How do you\ndo, my dear?'\n\nHe replied in a jargon I did not comprehend.\n\n'Shall you and I be friends, Hareton?' was my next essay at conversation.\n\nAn oath, and a threat to set Throttler on me if I did not 'frame off'\nrewarded my perseverance.\n\n'Hey, Throttler, lad!' whispered the little wretch, rousing a half-bred\nbull-dog from its lair in a corner.  'Now, wilt thou be ganging?' he\nasked authoritatively.\n\nLove for my life urged a compliance; I stepped over the threshold to wait\ntill the others should enter.  Mr. Heathcliff was nowhere visible; and\nJoseph, whom I followed to the stables, and requested to accompany me in,\nafter staring and muttering to himself, screwed up his nose and\nreplied--'Mim! mim! mim!  Did iver Christian body hear aught like it?\nMincing un' munching!  How can I tell whet ye say?'\n\n'I say, I wish you to come with me into the house!' I cried, thinking him\ndeaf, yet highly disgusted at his rudeness.\n\n'None o' me!  I getten summut else to do,' he answered, and continued his\nwork; moving his lantern jaws meanwhile, and surveying my dress and\ncountenance (the former a great deal too fine, but the latter, I'm sure,\nas sad as he could desire) with sovereign contempt.\n\nI walked round the yard, and through a wicket, to another door, at which\nI took the liberty of knocking, in hopes some more civil servant might\nshow himself.  After a short suspense, it was opened by a tall, gaunt\nman, without neckerchief, and otherwise extremely slovenly; his features\nwere lost in masses of shaggy hair that hung on his shoulders; and _his_\neyes, too, were like a ghostly Catherine's with all their beauty\nannihilated.\n\n'What's your business here?' he demanded, grimly.  'Who are you?'\n\n'My name was Isabella Linton,' I replied.  'You've seen me before, sir.\nI'm lately married to Mr. Heathcliff, and he has brought me here--I\nsuppose, by your permission.'\n\n'Is he come back, then?' asked the hermit, glaring like a hungry wolf.\n\n'Yes--we came just now,' I said; 'but he left me by the kitchen door; and\nwhen I would have gone in, your little boy played sentinel over the\nplace, and frightened me off by the help of a bull-dog.'\n\n'It's well the hellish villain has kept his word!' growled my future\nhost, searching the darkness beyond me in expectation of discovering\nHeathcliff; and then he indulged in a soliloquy of execrations, and\nthreats of what he would have done had the 'fiend' deceived him.\n\nI repented having tried this second entrance, and was almost inclined to\nslip away before he finished cursing, but ere I could execute that\nintention, he ordered me in, and shut and re-fastened the door.  There\nwas a great fire, and that was all the light in the huge apartment, whose\nfloor had grown a uniform grey; and the once brilliant pewter-dishes,\nwhich used to attract my gaze when I was a girl, partook of a similar\nobscurity, created by tarnish and dust.  I inquired whether I might call\nthe maid, and be conducted to a bedroom!  Mr. Earnshaw vouchsafed no\nanswer.  He walked up and down, with his hands in his pockets, apparently\nquite forgetting my presence; and his abstraction was evidently so deep,\nand his whole aspect so misanthropical, that I shrank from disturbing him\nagain.\n\nYou'll not be surprised, Ellen, at my feeling particularly cheerless,\nseated in worse than solitude on that inhospitable hearth, and\nremembering that four miles distant lay my delightful home, containing\nthe only people I loved on earth; and there might as well be the\nAtlantic to part us, instead of those four miles: I could not overpass\nthem! I questioned with myself--where must I turn for comfort? and--mind\nyou don't tell Edgar, or Catherine--above every sorrow beside, this rose\npre-eminent: despair at finding nobody who could or would be my ally\nagainst Heathcliff! I had sought shelter at Wuthering Heights, almost\ngladly, because I was secured by that arrangement from living alone with\nhim; but he knew the people we were coming amongst, and he did not fear\ntheir intermeddling.\n\nI sat and thought a doleful time: the clock struck eight, and nine, and\nstill my companion paced to and fro, his head bent on his breast, and\nperfectly silent, unless a groan or a bitter ejaculation forced itself\nout at intervals.  I listened to detect a woman's voice in the house, and\nfilled the interim with wild regrets and dismal anticipations, which, at\nlast, spoke audibly in irrepressible sighing and weeping.  I was not\naware how openly I grieved, till Earnshaw halted opposite, in his\nmeasured walk, and gave me a stare of newly-awakened surprise.  Taking\nadvantage of his recovered attention, I exclaimed--'I'm tired with my\njourney, and I want to go to bed!  Where is the maid-servant?  Direct me\nto her, as she won't come to me!'\n\n'We have none,' he answered; 'you must wait on yourself!'\n\n'Where must I sleep, then?' I sobbed; I was beyond regarding\nself-respect, weighed down by fatigue and wretchedness.\n\n'Joseph will show you Heathcliff's chamber,' said he; 'open that\ndoor--he's in there.'\n\nI was going to obey, but he suddenly arrested me, and added in the\nstrangest tone--'Be so good as to turn your lock, and draw your\nbolt--don't omit it!'\n\n'Well!' I said.  'But why, Mr. Earnshaw?'  I did not relish the notion of\ndeliberately fastening myself in with Heathcliff.\n\n'Look here!' he replied, pulling from his waistcoat a\ncuriously-constructed pistol, having a double-edged spring knife attached\nto the barrel.  'That's a great tempter to a desperate man, is it not?  I\ncannot resist going up with this every night, and trying his door.  If\nonce I find it open he's done for; I do it invariably, even though the\nminute before I have been recalling a hundred reasons that should make me\nrefrain: it is some devil that urges me to thwart my own schemes by\nkilling him.  You fight against that devil for love as long as you may;\nwhen the time comes, not all the angels in heaven shall save him!'\n\nI surveyed the weapon inquisitively.  A hideous notion struck me: how\npowerful I should be possessing such an instrument!  I took it from his\nhand, and touched the blade.  He looked astonished at the expression my\nface assumed during a brief second: it was not horror, it was\ncovetousness.  He snatched the pistol back, jealously; shut the knife,\nand returned it to its concealment.\n\n'I don't care if you tell him,' said he.  'Put him on his guard, and\nwatch for him.  You know the terms we are on, I see: his danger does not\nshock you.'\n\n'What has Heathcliff done to you?' I asked.  'In what has he wronged you,\nto warrant this appalling hatred?  Wouldn't it be wiser to bid him quit\nthe house?'\n\n'No!' thundered Earnshaw;'should he offer to leave me, he's a dead man:\npersuade him to attempt it, and you are a murderess!  Am I to lose _all_,\nwithout a chance of retrieval?  Is Hareton to be a beggar?  Oh,\ndamnation!  I _will_ have it back; and I'll have _his_ gold too; and then\nhis blood; and hell shall have his soul!  It will be ten times blacker\nwith that guest than ever it was before!'\n\nYou've acquainted me, Ellen, with your old master's habits.  He is\nclearly on the verge of madness: he was so last night at least.  I\nshuddered to be near him, and thought on the servant's ill-bred\nmoroseness as comparatively agreeable.  He now recommenced his moody\nwalk, and I raised the latch, and escaped into the kitchen.  Joseph was\nbending over the fire, peering into a large pan that swung above it; and\na wooden bowl of oatmeal stood on the settle close by.  The contents of\nthe pan began to boil, and he turned to plunge his hand into the bowl; I\nconjectured that this preparation was probably for our supper, and, being\nhungry, I resolved it should be eatable; so, crying out sharply, '_I'll_\nmake the porridge!'  I removed the vessel out of his reach, and proceeded\nto take off my hat and riding-habit.  'Mr. Earnshaw,' I continued,\n'directs me to wait on myself: I will.  I'm not going to act the lady\namong you, for fear I should starve.'\n\n'Gooid Lord!' he muttered, sitting down, and stroking his ribbed\nstockings from the knee to the ankle.  'If there's to be fresh\northerings--just when I getten used to two maisters, if I mun hev' a\n_mistress_ set o'er my heead, it's like time to be flitting.  I niver\n_did_ think to see t' day that I mud lave th' owld place--but I doubt\nit's nigh at hand!'\n\nThis lamentation drew no notice from me: I went briskly to work, sighing\nto remember a period when it would have been all merry fun; but compelled\nspeedily to drive off the remembrance.  It racked me to recall past\nhappiness and the greater peril there was of conjuring up its apparition,\nthe quicker the thible ran round, and the faster the handfuls of meal\nfell into the water.  Joseph beheld my style of cookery with growing\nindignation.\n\n'Thear!' he ejaculated.  'Hareton, thou willn't sup thy porridge\nto-neeght; they'll be naught but lumps as big as my neive.  Thear, agean!\nI'd fling in bowl un' all, if I wer ye!  There, pale t' guilp off, un'\nthen ye'll hae done wi' 't.  Bang, bang.  It's a mercy t' bothom isn't\ndeaved out!'\n\nIt _was_ rather a rough mess, I own, when poured into the basins; four\nhad been provided, and a gallon pitcher of new milk was brought from the\ndairy, which Hareton seized and commenced drinking and spilling from the\nexpansive lip.  I expostulated, and desired that he should have his in a\nmug; affirming that I could not taste the liquid treated so dirtily.  The\nold cynic chose to be vastly offended at this nicety; assuring me,\nrepeatedly, that 'the barn was every bit as good' as I, 'and every bit as\nwollsome,' and wondering how I could fashion to be so conceited.\nMeanwhile, the infant ruffian continued sucking; and glowered up at me\ndefyingly, as he slavered into the jug.\n\n'I shall have my supper in another room,' I said.  'Have you no place you\ncall a parlour?'\n\n'_Parlour_!' he echoed, sneeringly, '_parlour_!  Nay, we've noa\n_parlours_.  If yah dunnut loike wer company, there's maister's; un' if\nyah dunnut loike maister, there's us.'\n\n'Then I shall go up-stairs,' I answered;'show me a chamber.'\n\nI put my basin on a tray, and went myself to fetch some more milk.  With\ngreat grumblings, the fellow rose, and preceded me in my ascent: we\nmounted to the garrets; he opened a door, now and then, to look into the\napartments we passed.\n\n'Here's a rahm,' he said, at last, flinging back a cranky board on\nhinges.  'It's weel eneugh to ate a few porridge in.  There's a pack o'\ncorn i' t' corner, thear, meeterly clane; if ye're feared o' muckying yer\ngrand silk cloes, spread yer hankerchir o' t' top on't.'\n\nThe 'rahm' was a kind of lumber-hole smelling strong of malt and grain;\nvarious sacks of which articles were piled around, leaving a wide, bare\nspace in the middle.\n\n'Why, man,' I exclaimed, facing him angrily, 'this is not a place to\nsleep in.  I wish to see my bed-room.'\n\n'_Bed-rume_!' he repeated, in a tone of mockery. 'Yah's see all t'\n_bed-rumes_ thear is--yon's mine.'\n\nHe pointed into the second garret, only differing from the first in being\nmore naked about the walls, and having a large, low, curtainless bed,\nwith an indigo-coloured quilt, at one end.\n\n'What do I want with yours?' I retorted.  'I suppose Mr. Heathcliff does\nnot lodge at the top of the house, does he?'\n\n'Oh! it's Maister _Hathecliff's_ ye're wanting?' cried he, as if making a\nnew discovery.  'Couldn't ye ha' said soa, at onst? un' then, I mud ha'\ntelled ye, baht all this wark, that that's just one ye cannut see--he\nallas keeps it locked, un' nob'dy iver mells on't but hisseln.'\n\n'You've a nice house, Joseph,' I could not refrain from observing, 'and\npleasant inmates; and I think the concentrated essence of all the madness\nin the world took up its abode in my brain the day I linked my fate with\ntheirs!  However, that is not to the present purpose--there are other\nrooms.  For heaven's sake be quick, and let me settle somewhere!'\n\nHe made no reply to this adjuration; only plodding doggedly down the\nwooden steps, and halting, before an apartment which, from that halt and\nthe superior quality of its furniture, I conjectured to be the best one.\nThere was a carpet--a good one, but the pattern was obliterated by dust;\na fireplace hung with cut-paper, dropping to pieces; a handsome\noak-bedstead with ample crimson curtains of rather expensive material and\nmodern make; but they had evidently experienced rough usage: the\nvallances hung in festoons, wrenched from their rings, and the iron rod\nsupporting them was bent in an arc on one side, causing the drapery to\ntrail upon the floor.  The chairs were also damaged, many of them\nseverely; and deep indentations deformed the panels of the walls.  I was\nendeavouring to gather resolution for entering and taking possession,\nwhen my fool of a guide announced,--'This here is t' maister's.'  My\nsupper by this time was cold, my appetite gone, and my patience\nexhausted.  I insisted on being provided instantly with a place of\nrefuge, and means of repose.\n\n'Whear the divil?' began the religious elder.  'The Lord bless us!  The\nLord forgie us!  Whear the _hell_ wold ye gang? ye marred, wearisome\nnowt!  Ye've seen all but Hareton's bit of a cham'er.  There's not\nanother hoile to lig down in i' th' hahse!'\n\nI was so vexed, I flung my tray and its contents on the ground; and then\nseated myself at the stairs'-head, hid my face in my hands, and cried.\n\n'Ech! ech!' exclaimed Joseph.  'Weel done, Miss Cathy! weel done, Miss\nCathy!  Howsiver, t' maister sall just tum'le o'er them brooken pots; un'\nthen we's hear summut; we's hear how it's to be.  Gooid-for-naught\nmadling! ye desarve pining fro' this to Chrustmas, flinging t' precious\ngifts o'God under fooit i' yer flaysome rages!  But I'm mista'en if ye\nshew yer sperrit lang.  Will Hathecliff bide sich bonny ways, think ye? I\nnobbut wish he may catch ye i' that plisky.  I nobbut wish he may.'\n\nAnd so he went on scolding to his den beneath, taking the candle with\nhim; and I remained in the dark. The period of reflection succeeding\nthis silly action compelled me to admit the necessity of smothering my\npride and choking my wrath, and bestirring myself to remove its effects.\nAn unexpected aid presently appeared in the shape of Throttler, whom I\nnow recognised as a son of our old Skulker: it had spent its whelphood\nat the Grange, and was given by my father to Mr. Hindley. I fancy it\nknew me: it pushed its nose against mine by way of salute, and then\nhastened to devour the porridge; while I groped from step to step,\ncollecting the shattered earthenware, and drying the spatters of milk\nfrom the banister with my pocket-handkerchief. Our labours were scarcely\nover when I heard Earnshaw's tread in the passage; my assistant tucked\nin his tail, and pressed to the wall; I stole into the nearest doorway.\nThe dog's endeavour to avoid him was unsuccessful; as I guessed by a\nscutter down-stairs, and a prolonged, piteous yelping. I had better\nluck: he passed on, entered his chamber, and shut the door. Directly\nafter Joseph came up with Hareton, to put him to bed. I had found\nshelter in Hareton's room, and the old man, on seeing me, said,--'They's\nrahm for boath ye un' yer pride, now, I sud think i' the hahse. It's\nempty; ye may hev' it all to yerseln, un' Him as allus maks a third, i'\nsich ill company!'\n\nGladly did I take advantage of this intimation; and the minute I flung\nmyself into a chair, by the fire, I nodded, and slept.  My slumber was\ndeep and sweet, though over far too soon.  Mr. Heathcliff awoke me; he\nhad just come in, and demanded, in his loving manner, what I was doing\nthere?  I told him the cause of my staying up so late--that he had the\nkey of our room in his pocket.  The adjective _our_ gave mortal offence.\nHe swore it was not, nor ever should be, mine; and he'd--but I'll not\nrepeat his language, nor describe his habitual conduct: he is ingenious\nand unresting in seeking to gain my abhorrence!  I sometimes wonder at\nhim with an intensity that deadens my fear: yet, I assure you, a tiger or\na venomous serpent could not rouse terror in me equal to that which he\nwakens.  He told me of Catherine's illness, and accused my brother of\ncausing it promising that I should be Edgar's proxy in suffering, till he\ncould get hold of him.\n\nI do hate him--I am wretched--I have been a fool!  Beware of uttering one\nbreath of this to any one at the Grange.  I shall expect you every\nday--don't disappoint me!--ISABELLA.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs soon as I had perused this epistle I went to the master, and informed\nhim that his sister had arrived at the Heights, and sent me a letter\nexpressing her sorrow for Mrs. Linton's situation, and her ardent desire\nto see him; with a wish that he would transmit to her, as early as\npossible, some token of forgiveness by me.\n\n'Forgiveness!' said Linton.  'I have nothing to forgive her, Ellen.  You\nmay call at Wuthering Heights this afternoon, if you like, and say that I\nam not angry, but I'm sorry to have lost her; especially as I can never\nthink she'll be happy.  It is out of the question my going to see her,\nhowever: we are eternally divided; and should she really wish to oblige\nme, let her persuade the villain she has married to leave the country.'\n\n'And you won't write her a little note, sir?' I asked, imploringly.\n\n'No,' he answered.  'It is needless.  My communication with Heathcliff's\nfamily shall be as sparing as his with mine.  It shall not exist!'\n\nMr. Edgar's coldness depressed me exceedingly; and all the way from the\nGrange I puzzled my brains how to put more heart into what he said, when\nI repeated it; and how to soften his refusal of even a few lines to\nconsole Isabella. I daresay she had been on the watch for me since\nmorning: I saw her looking through the lattice as I came up the garden\ncauseway, and I nodded to her; but she drew back, as if afraid of being\nobserved. I entered without knocking. There never was such a dreary,\ndismal scene as the formerly cheerful house presented! I must confess,\nthat if I had been in the young lady's place, I would, at least, have\nswept the hearth, and wiped the tables with a duster. But she already\npartook of the pervading spirit of neglect which encompassed her. Her\npretty face was wan and listless; her hair uncurled: some locks hanging\nlankly down, and some carelessly twisted round her head. Probably she\nhad not touched her dress since yester evening. Hindley was not there.\nMr. Heathcliff sat at a table, turning over some papers in his\npocket-book; but he rose when I appeared, asked me how I did, quite\nfriendly, and offered me a chair. He was the only thing there that\nseemed decent; and I thought he never looked better. So much had\ncircumstances altered their positions, that he would certainly have\nstruck a stranger as a born and bred gentleman; and his wife as a\nthorough little slattern! She came forward eagerly to greet me, and held\nout one hand to take the expected letter. I shook my head. She wouldn't\nunderstand the hint, but followed me to a sideboard, where I went to lay\nmy bonnet, and importuned me in a whisper to give her directly what I\nhad brought. Heathcliff guessed the meaning of her manoeuvres, and\nsaid--'If you have got anything for Isabella (as no doubt you have,\nNelly), give it to her. You needn't make a secret of it: we have no\nsecrets between us.'\n\n'Oh, I have nothing,' I replied, thinking it best to speak the truth at\nonce.  'My master bid me tell his sister that she must not expect either\na letter or a visit from him at present.  He sends his love, ma'am, and\nhis wishes for your happiness, and his pardon for the grief you have\noccasioned; but he thinks that after this time his household and the\nhousehold here should drop intercommunication, as nothing could come of\nkeeping it up.'\n\nMrs. Heathcliff's lip quivered slightly, and she returned to her seat in\nthe window.  Her husband took his stand on the hearthstone, near me, and\nbegan to put questions concerning Catherine.  I told him as much as I\nthought proper of her illness, and he extorted from me, by\ncross-examination, most of the facts connected with its origin.  I blamed\nher, as she deserved, for bringing it all on herself; and ended by hoping\nthat he would follow Mr. Linton's example and avoid future interference\nwith his family, for good or evil.\n\n'Mrs. Linton is now just recovering,' I said;'she'll never be like she\nwas, but her life is spared; and if you really have a regard for her,\nyou'll shun crossing her way again: nay, you'll move out of this country\nentirely; and that you may not regret it, I'll inform you Catherine\nLinton is as different now from your old friend Catherine Earnshaw, as\nthat young lady is different from me.  Her appearance is changed greatly,\nher character much more so; and the person who is compelled, of\nnecessity, to be her companion, will only sustain his affection hereafter\nby the remembrance of what she once was, by common humanity, and a sense\nof duty!'\n\n'That is quite possible,' remarked Heathcliff, forcing himself to seem\ncalm: 'quite possible that your master should have nothing but common\nhumanity and a sense of duty to fall back upon.  But do you imagine that\nI shall leave Catherine to his _duty_ and _humanity_? and can you compare\nmy feelings respecting Catherine to his?  Before you leave this house, I\nmust exact a promise from you that you'll get me an interview with her:\nconsent, or refuse, I _will_ see her!  What do you say?'\n\n'I say, Mr. Heathcliff,' I replied, 'you must not: you never shall,\nthrough my means.  Another encounter between you and the master would\nkill her altogether.'\n\n'With your aid that may be avoided,' he continued; 'and should there be\ndanger of such an event--should he be the cause of adding a single\ntrouble more to her existence--why, I think I shall be justified in going\nto extremes!  I wish you had sincerity enough to tell me whether\nCatherine would suffer greatly from his loss: the fear that she would\nrestrains me.  And there you see the distinction between our feelings:\nhad he been in my place, and I in his, though I hated him with a hatred\nthat turned my life to gall, I never would have raised a hand against\nhim.  You may look incredulous, if you please!  I never would have\nbanished him from her society as long as she desired his.  The moment her\nregard ceased, I would have torn his heart out, and drunk his blood!  But,\ntill then--if you don't believe me, you don't know me--till then, I would\nhave died by inches before I touched a single hair of his head!'\n\n'And yet,' I interrupted, 'you have no scruples in completely ruining all\nhopes of her perfect restoration, by thrusting yourself into her\nremembrance now, when she has nearly forgotten you, and involving her in\na new tumult of discord and distress.'\n\n'You suppose she has nearly forgotten me?' he said.  'Oh, Nelly! you know\nshe has not!  You know as well as I do, that for every thought she spends\non Linton she spends a thousand on me!  At a most miserable period of my\nlife, I had a notion of the kind: it haunted me on my return to the\nneighbourhood last summer; but only her own assurance could make me admit\nthe horrible idea again.  And then, Linton would be nothing, nor Hindley,\nnor all the dreams that ever I dreamt.  Two words would comprehend my\nfuture--_death_ and _hell_: existence, after losing her, would be hell.\nYet I was a fool to fancy for a moment that she valued Edgar Linton's\nattachment more than mine.  If he loved with all the powers of his puny\nbeing, he couldn't love as much in eighty years as I could in a day.  And\nCatherine has a heart as deep as I have: the sea could be as readily\ncontained in that horse-trough as her whole affection be monopolised by\nhim.  Tush!  He is scarcely a degree dearer to her than her dog, or her\nhorse.  It is not in him to be loved like me: how can she love in him\nwhat he has not?'\n\n'Catherine and Edgar are as fond of each other as any two people can be,'\ncried Isabella, with sudden vivacity.  'No one has a right to talk in\nthat manner, and I won't hear my brother depreciated in silence!'\n\n'Your brother is wondrous fond of you too, isn't he?' observed\nHeathcliff, scornfully.  'He turns you adrift on the world with\nsurprising alacrity.'\n\n'He is not aware of what I suffer,' she replied.  'I didn't tell him\nthat.'\n\n'You have been telling him something, then: you have written, have you?'\n\n'To say that I was married, I did write--you saw the note.'\n\n'And nothing since?'\n\n'No.'\n\n'My young lady is looking sadly the worse for her change of condition,' I\nremarked.  'Somebody's love comes short in her case, obviously; whose, I\nmay guess; but, perhaps, I shouldn't say.'\n\n'I should guess it was her own,' said Heathcliff.  'She degenerates into\na mere slut!  She is tired of trying to please me uncommonly early.  You'd\nhardly credit it, but the very morrow of our wedding she was weeping to\ngo home.  However, she'll suit this house so much the better for not\nbeing over nice, and I'll take care she does not disgrace me by rambling\nabroad.'\n\n'Well, sir,' returned I, 'I hope you'll consider that Mrs. Heathcliff is\naccustomed to be looked after and waited on; and that she has been\nbrought up like an only daughter, whom every one was ready to serve.  You\nmust let her have a maid to keep things tidy about her, and you must\ntreat her kindly.  Whatever be your notion of Mr. Edgar, you cannot doubt\nthat she has a capacity for strong attachments, or she wouldn't have\nabandoned the elegancies, and comforts, and friends of her former home,\nto fix contentedly, in such a wilderness as this, with you.'\n\n'She abandoned them under a delusion,' he answered; 'picturing in me a\nhero of romance, and expecting unlimited indulgences from my chivalrous\ndevotion.  I can hardly regard her in the light of a rational creature,\nso obstinately has she persisted in forming a fabulous notion of my\ncharacter and acting on the false impressions she cherished.  But, at\nlast, I think she begins to know me: I don't perceive the silly smiles\nand grimaces that provoked me at first; and the senseless incapability of\ndiscerning that I was in earnest when I gave her my opinion of her\ninfatuation and herself.  It was a marvellous effort of perspicacity to\ndiscover that I did not love her.  I believed, at one time, no lessons\ncould teach her that!  And yet it is poorly learnt; for this morning she\nannounced, as a piece of appalling intelligence, that I had actually\nsucceeded in making her hate me!  A positive labour of Hercules, I assure\nyou!  If it be achieved, I have cause to return thanks.  Can I trust your\nassertion, Isabella?  Are you sure you hate me?  If I let you alone for\nhalf a day, won't you come sighing and wheedling to me again?  I daresay\nshe would rather I had seemed all tenderness before you: it wounds her\nvanity to have the truth exposed.  But I don't care who knows that the\npassion was wholly on one side: and I never told her a lie about it.  She\ncannot accuse me of showing one bit of deceitful softness.  The first\nthing she saw me do, on coming out of the Grange, was to hang up her\nlittle dog; and when she pleaded for it, the first words I uttered were a\nwish that I had the hanging of every being belonging to her, except one:\npossibly she took that exception for herself.  But no brutality disgusted\nher: I suppose she has an innate admiration of it, if only her precious\nperson were secure from injury!  Now, was it not the depth of\nabsurdity--of genuine idiotcy, for that pitiful, slavish, mean-minded\nbrach to dream that I could love her?  Tell your master, Nelly, that I\nnever, in all my life, met with such an abject thing as she is.  She even\ndisgraces the name of Linton; and I've sometimes relented, from pure lack\nof invention, in my experiments on what she could endure, and still creep\nshamefully cringing back!  But tell him, also, to set his fraternal and\nmagisterial heart at ease: that I keep strictly within the limits of the\nlaw.  I have avoided, up to this period, giving her the slightest right\nto claim a separation; and, what's more, she'd thank nobody for dividing\nus.  If she desired to go, she might: the nuisance of her presence\noutweighs the gratification to be derived from tormenting her!'\n\n'Mr. Heathcliff,' said I, 'this is the talk of a madman; your wife, most\nlikely, is convinced you are mad; and, for that reason, she has borne\nwith you hitherto: but now that you say she may go, she'll doubtless\navail herself of the permission.  You are not so bewitched, ma'am, are\nyou, as to remain with him of your own accord?'\n\n'Take care, Ellen!' answered Isabella, her eyes sparkling irefully; there\nwas no misdoubting by their expression the full success of her partner's\nendeavours to make himself detested.  'Don't put faith in a single word\nhe speaks.  He's a lying fiend! a monster, and not a human being!  I've\nbeen told I might leave him before; and I've made the attempt, but I dare\nnot repeat it!  Only, Ellen, promise you'll not mention a syllable of his\ninfamous conversation to my brother or Catherine.  Whatever he may\npretend, he wishes to provoke Edgar to desperation: he says he has\nmarried me on purpose to obtain power over him; and he sha'n't obtain\nit--I'll die first!  I just hope, I pray, that he may forget his\ndiabolical prudence and kill me!  The single pleasure I can imagine is to\ndie, or to see him dead!'\n\n'There--that will do for the present!' said Heathcliff.  'If you are\ncalled upon in a court of law, you'll remember her language, Nelly!  And\ntake a good look at that countenance: she's near the point which would\nsuit me.  No; you're not fit to be your own guardian, Isabella, now; and\nI, being your legal protector, must retain you in my custody, however\ndistasteful the obligation may be.  Go up-stairs; I have something to say\nto Ellen Dean in private.  That's not the way: up-stairs, I tell you!\nWhy, this is the road upstairs, child!'\n\nHe seized, and thrust her from the room; and returned muttering--'I have\nno pity!  I have no pity!  The more the worms writhe, the more I yearn to\ncrush out their entrails!  It is a moral teething; and I grind with\ngreater energy in proportion to the increase of pain.'\n\n'Do you understand what the word pity means?' I said, hastening to resume\nmy bonnet.  'Did you ever feel a touch of it in your life?'\n\n'Put that down!' he interrupted, perceiving my intention to depart.  'You\nare not going yet.  Come here now, Nelly: I must either persuade or\ncompel you to aid me in fulfilling my determination to see Catherine, and\nthat without delay.  I swear that I meditate no harm: I don't desire to\ncause any disturbance, or to exasperate or insult Mr. Linton; I only wish\nto hear from herself how she is, and why she has been ill; and to ask if\nanything that I could do would be of use to her.  Last night I was in the\nGrange garden six hours, and I'll return there to-night; and every night\nI'll haunt the place, and every day, till I find an opportunity of\nentering.  If Edgar Linton meets me, I shall not hesitate to knock him\ndown, and give him enough to insure his quiescence while I stay.  If his\nservants oppose me, I shall threaten them off with these pistols.  But\nwouldn't it be better to prevent my coming in contact with them, or their\nmaster?  And you could do it so easily.  I'd warn you when I came, and\nthen you might let me in unobserved, as soon as she was alone, and watch\ntill I departed, your conscience quite calm: you would be hindering\nmischief.'\n\nI protested against playing that treacherous part in my employer's house:\nand, besides, I urged the cruelty and selfishness of his destroying Mrs.\nLinton's tranquillity for his satisfaction.  'The commonest occurrence\nstartles her painfully,' I said.  'She's all nerves, and she couldn't\nbear the surprise, I'm positive.  Don't persist, sir! or else I shall be\nobliged to inform my master of your designs; and he'll take measures to\nsecure his house and its inmates from any such unwarrantable intrusions!'\n\n'In that case I'll take measures to secure you, woman!' exclaimed\nHeathcliff; 'you shall not leave Wuthering Heights till to-morrow\nmorning.  It is a foolish story to assert that Catherine could not bear\nto see me; and as to surprising her, I don't desire it: you must prepare\nher--ask her if I may come.  You say she never mentions my name, and that\nI am never mentioned to her.  To whom should she mention me if I am a\nforbidden topic in the house?  She thinks you are all spies for her\nhusband.  Oh, I've no doubt she's in hell among you!  I guess by her\nsilence, as much as anything, what she feels.  You say she is often\nrestless, and anxious-looking: is that a proof of tranquillity?  You talk\nof her mind being unsettled.  How the devil could it be otherwise in her\nfrightful isolation?  And that insipid, paltry creature attending her\nfrom _duty_ and _humanity_!  From _pity_ and _charity_!  He might as well\nplant an oak in a flower-pot, and expect it to thrive, as imagine he can\nrestore her to vigour in the soil of his shallow cares?  Let us settle it\nat once: will you stay here, and am I to fight my way to Catherine over\nLinton and his footman?  Or will you be my friend, as you have been\nhitherto, and do what I request?  Decide! because there is no reason for\nmy lingering another minute, if you persist in your stubborn ill-nature!'\n\nWell, Mr. Lockwood, I argued and complained, and flatly refused him fifty\ntimes; but in the long run he forced me to an agreement.  I engaged to\ncarry a letter from him to my mistress; and should she consent, I\npromised to let him have intelligence of Linton's next absence from home,\nwhen he might come, and get in as he was able: I wouldn't be there, and\nmy fellow-servants should be equally out of the way.  Was it right or\nwrong?  I fear it was wrong, though expedient.  I thought I prevented\nanother explosion by my compliance; and I thought, too, it might create a\nfavourable crisis in Catherine's mental illness: and then I remembered\nMr. Edgar's stern rebuke of my carrying tales; and I tried to smooth away\nall disquietude on the subject, by affirming, with frequent iteration,\nthat that betrayal of trust, if it merited so harsh an appellation,\nshould be the last.  Notwithstanding, my journey homeward was sadder than\nmy journey thither; and many misgivings I had, ere I could prevail on\nmyself to put the missive into Mrs. Linton's hand.\n\nBut here is Kenneth; I'll go down, and tell him how much better you are.\nMy history is _dree_, as we say, and will serve to while away another\nmorning.\n\nDree, and dreary!  I reflected as the good woman descended to receive the\ndoctor: and not exactly of the kind which I should have chosen to amuse\nme.  But never mind!  I'll extract wholesome medicines from Mrs. Dean's\nbitter herbs; and firstly, let me beware of the fascination that lurks in\nCatherine Heathcliff's brilliant eyes.  I should be in a curious taking\nif I surrendered my heart to that young person, and the daughter turned\nout a second edition of the mother.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother week over--and I am so many days nearer health, and spring!  I\nhave now heard all my neighbour's history, at different sittings, as the\nhousekeeper could spare time from more important occupations.  I'll\ncontinue it in her own words, only a little condensed.  She is, on the\nwhole, a very fair narrator, and I don't think I could improve her style.\n\nIn the evening, she said, the evening of my visit to the Heights, I knew,\nas well as if I saw him, that Mr. Heathcliff was about the place; and I\nshunned going out, because I still carried his letter in my pocket, and\ndidn't want to be threatened or teased any more.  I had made up my mind\nnot to give it till my master went somewhere, as I could not guess how\nits receipt would affect Catherine.  The consequence was, that it did not\nreach her before the lapse of three days.  The fourth was Sunday, and I\nbrought it into her room after the family were gone to church.  There was\na manservant left to keep the house with me, and we generally made a\npractice of locking the doors during the hours of service; but on that\noccasion the weather was so warm and pleasant that I set them wide open,\nand, to fulfil my engagement, as I knew who would be coming, I told my\ncompanion that the mistress wished very much for some oranges, and he\nmust run over to the village and get a few, to be paid for on the morrow.\nHe departed, and I went up-stairs.\n\nMrs. Linton sat in a loose white dress, with a light shawl over her\nshoulders, in the recess of the open window, as usual.  Her thick, long\nhair had been partly removed at the beginning of her illness, and now she\nwore it simply combed in its natural tresses over her temples and neck.\nHer appearance was altered, as I had told Heathcliff; but when she was\ncalm, there seemed unearthly beauty in the change.  The flash of her eyes\nhad been succeeded by a dreamy and melancholy softness; they no longer\ngave the impression of looking at the objects around her: they appeared\nalways to gaze beyond, and far beyond--you would have said out of this\nworld.  Then, the paleness of her face--its haggard aspect having\nvanished as she recovered flesh--and the peculiar expression arising from\nher mental state, though painfully suggestive of their causes, added to\nthe touching interest which she awakened; and--invariably to me, I know,\nand to any person who saw her, I should think--refuted more tangible\nproofs of convalescence, and stamped her as one doomed to decay.\n\nA book lay spread on the sill before her, and the scarcely perceptible\nwind fluttered its leaves at intervals.  I believe Linton had laid it\nthere: for she never endeavoured to divert herself with reading, or\noccupation of any kind, and he would spend many an hour in trying to\nentice her attention to some subject which had formerly been her\namusement.  She was conscious of his aim, and in her better moods endured\nhis efforts placidly, only showing their uselessness by now and then\nsuppressing a wearied sigh, and checking him at last with the saddest of\nsmiles and kisses.  At other times, she would turn petulantly away, and\nhide her face in her hands, or even push him off angrily; and then he\ntook care to let her alone, for he was certain of doing no good.\n\nGimmerton chapel bells were still ringing; and the full, mellow flow of\nthe beck in the valley came soothingly on the ear.  It was a sweet\nsubstitute for the yet absent murmur of the summer foliage, which drowned\nthat music about the Grange when the trees were in leaf.  At Wuthering\nHeights it always sounded on quiet days following a great thaw or a\nseason of steady rain.  And of Wuthering Heights Catherine was thinking\nas she listened: that is, if she thought or listened at all; but she had\nthe vague, distant look I mentioned before, which expressed no\nrecognition of material things either by ear or eye.\n\n'There's a letter for you, Mrs. Linton,' I said, gently inserting it in\none hand that rested on her knee.  'You must read it immediately, because\nit wants an answer.  Shall I break the seal?'  'Yes,' she answered,\nwithout altering the direction of her eyes.  I opened it--it was very\nshort.  'Now,' I continued,'read it.'  She drew away her hand, and let\nit fall.  I replaced it in her lap, and stood waiting till it should\nplease her to glance down; but that movement was so long delayed that at\nlast I resumed--'Must I read it, ma'am?  It is from Mr. Heathcliff.'\n\nThere was a start and a troubled gleam of recollection, and a struggle to\narrange her ideas.  She lifted the letter, and seemed to peruse it; and\nwhen she came to the signature she sighed: yet still I found she had not\ngathered its import, for, upon my desiring to hear her reply, she merely\npointed to the name, and gazed at me with mournful and questioning\neagerness.\n\n'Well, he wishes to see you,' said I, guessing her need of an\ninterpreter.  'He's in the garden by this time, and impatient to know\nwhat answer I shall bring.'\n\nAs I spoke, I observed a large dog lying on the sunny grass beneath raise\nits ears as if about to bark, and then smoothing them back, announce, by\na wag of the tail, that some one approached whom it did not consider a\nstranger.  Mrs. Linton bent forward, and listened breathlessly.  The\nminute after a step traversed the hall; the open house was too tempting\nfor Heathcliff to resist walking in: most likely he supposed that I was\ninclined to shirk my promise, and so resolved to trust to his own\naudacity.  With straining eagerness Catherine gazed towards the entrance\nof her chamber.  He did not hit the right room directly: she motioned me\nto admit him, but he found it out ere I could reach the door, and in a\nstride or two was at her side, and had her grasped in his arms.\n\nHe neither spoke nor loosed his hold for some five minutes, during which\nperiod he bestowed more kisses than ever he gave in his life before, I\ndaresay: but then my mistress had kissed him first, and I plainly saw\nthat he could hardly bear, for downright agony, to look into her face!\nThe same conviction had stricken him as me, from the instant he beheld\nher, that there was no prospect of ultimate recovery there--she was\nfated, sure to die.\n\n'Oh, Cathy!  Oh, my life! how can I bear it?' was the first sentence he\nuttered, in a tone that did not seek to disguise his despair.  And now he\nstared at her so earnestly that I thought the very intensity of his gaze\nwould bring tears into his eyes; but they burned with anguish: they did\nnot melt.\n\n'What now?' said Catherine, leaning back, and returning his look with a\nsuddenly clouded brow: her humour was a mere vane for constantly varying\ncaprices.  'You and Edgar have broken my heart, Heathcliff!  And you both\ncome to bewail the deed to me, as if you were the people to be pitied!  I\nshall not pity you, not I.  You have killed me--and thriven on it, I\nthink.  How strong you are!  How many years do you mean to live after I\nam gone?'\n\nHeathcliff had knelt on one knee to embrace her; he attempted to rise,\nbut she seized his hair, and kept him down.\n\n'I wish I could hold you,' she continued, bitterly, 'till we were both\ndead!  I shouldn't care what you suffered.  I care nothing for your\nsufferings.  Why shouldn't you suffer?  I do!  Will you forget me?  Will\nyou be happy when I am in the earth?  Will you say twenty years hence,\n\"That's the grave of Catherine Earnshaw?  I loved her long ago, and was\nwretched to lose her; but it is past.  I've loved many others since: my\nchildren are dearer to me than she was; and, at death, I shall not\nrejoice that I am going to her: I shall be sorry that I must leave\nthem!\"  Will you say so, Heathcliff?'\n\n'Don't torture me till I'm as mad as yourself,' cried he, wrenching his\nhead free, and grinding his teeth.\n\nThe two, to a cool spectator, made a strange and fearful picture.  Well\nmight Catherine deem that heaven would be a land of exile to her, unless\nwith her mortal body she cast away her moral character also.  Her present\ncountenance had a wild vindictiveness in its white cheek, and a bloodless\nlip and scintillating eye; and she retained in her closed fingers a\nportion of the locks she had been grasping.  As to her companion, while\nraising himself with one hand, he had taken her arm with the other; and\nso inadequate was his stock of gentleness to the requirements of her\ncondition, that on his letting go I saw four distinct impressions left\nblue in the colourless skin.\n\n'Are you possessed with a devil,' he pursued, savagely, 'to talk in that\nmanner to me when you are dying?  Do you reflect that all those words\nwill be branded in my memory, and eating deeper eternally after you have\nleft me?  You know you lie to say I have killed you: and, Catherine, you\nknow that I could as soon forget you as my existence!  Is it not\nsufficient for your infernal selfishness, that while you are at peace I\nshall writhe in the torments of hell?'\n\n'I shall not be at peace,' moaned Catherine, recalled to a sense of\nphysical weakness by the violent, unequal throbbing of her heart, which\nbeat visibly and audibly under this excess of agitation.  She said\nnothing further till the paroxysm was over; then she continued, more\nkindly--\n\n'I'm not wishing you greater torment than I have, Heathcliff.  I only\nwish us never to be parted: and should a word of mine distress you\nhereafter, think I feel the same distress underground, and for my own\nsake, forgive me!  Come here and kneel down again!  You never harmed me\nin your life.  Nay, if you nurse anger, that will be worse to remember\nthan my harsh words!  Won't you come here again?  Do!'\n\nHeathcliff went to the back of her chair, and leant over, but not so far\nas to let her see his face, which was livid with emotion.  She bent round\nto look at him; he would not permit it: turning abruptly, he walked to\nthe fireplace, where he stood, silent, with his back towards us.  Mrs.\nLinton's glance followed him suspiciously: every movement woke a new\nsentiment in her.  After a pause and a prolonged gaze, she resumed;\naddressing me in accents of indignant disappointment:--\n\n'Oh, you see, Nelly, he would not relent a moment to keep me out of the\ngrave.  _That_ is how I'm loved!  Well, never mind.  That is not _my_\nHeathcliff.  I shall love mine yet; and take him with me: he's in my\nsoul.  And,' added she musingly, 'the thing that irks me most is this\nshattered prison, after all.  I'm tired of being enclosed here.  I'm\nwearying to escape into that glorious world, and to be always there: not\nseeing it dimly through tears, and yearning for it through the walls of\nan aching heart: but really with it, and in it.\n\n### Summary:"}
{"original_length": 17433, "trunc_length": 16384, "text": "\n\nSummarize the following text into a summary of less than 800 words.\n### Text:\n\n\n\nThe evening after the funeral, my young lady and I were seated in the\nlibrary; now musing mournfully--one of us despairingly--on our loss, now\nventuring conjectures as to the gloomy future.\n\nWe had just agreed the best destiny which could await Catherine would be\na permission to continue resident at the Grange; at least during Linton's\nlife: he being allowed to join her there, and I to remain as housekeeper.\nThat seemed rather too favourable an arrangement to be hoped for; and yet\nI did hope, and began to cheer up under the prospect of retaining my home\nand my employment, and, above all, my beloved young mistress; when a\nservant--one of the discarded ones, not yet departed--rushed hastily in,\nand said 'that devil Heathcliff' was coming through the court: should he\nfasten the door in his face?\n\nIf we had been mad enough to order that proceeding, we had not time.  He\nmade no ceremony of knocking or announcing his name: he was master, and\navailed himself of the master's privilege to walk straight in, without\nsaying a word.  The sound of our informant's voice directed him to the\nlibrary; he entered and motioning him out, shut the door.\n\nIt was the same room into which he had been ushered, as a guest, eighteen\nyears before: the same moon shone through the window; and the same autumn\nlandscape lay outside.  We had not yet lighted a candle, but all the\napartment was visible, even to the portraits on the wall: the splendid\nhead of Mrs. Linton, and the graceful one of her husband.  Heathcliff\nadvanced to the hearth.  Time had little altered his person either.  There\nwas the same man: his dark face rather sallower and more composed, his\nframe a stone or two heavier, perhaps, and no other difference.  Catherine\nhad risen with an impulse to dash out, when she saw him.\n\n'Stop!' he said, arresting her by the arm.  'No more runnings away!  Where\nwould you go?  I'm come to fetch you home; and I hope you'll be a dutiful\ndaughter and not encourage my son to further disobedience.  I was\nembarrassed how to punish him when I discovered his part in the business:\nhe's such a cobweb, a pinch would annihilate him; but you'll see by his\nlook that he has received his due!  I brought him down one evening, the\nday before yesterday, and just set him in a chair, and never touched him\nafterwards.  I sent Hareton out, and we had the room to ourselves.  In\ntwo hours, I called Joseph to carry him up again; and since then my\npresence is as potent on his nerves as a ghost; and I fancy he sees me\noften, though I am not near.  Hareton says he wakes and shrieks in the\nnight by the hour together, and calls you to protect him from me; and,\nwhether you like your precious mate, or not, you must come: he's your\nconcern now; I yield all my interest in him to you.'\n\n'Why not let Catherine continue here,' I pleaded, 'and send Master Linton\nto her?  As you hate them both, you'd not miss them: they can only be a\ndaily plague to your unnatural heart.'\n\n'I'm seeking a tenant for the Grange,' he answered; 'and I want my\nchildren about me, to be sure.  Besides, that lass owes me her services\nfor her bread.  I'm not going to nurture her in luxury and idleness after\nLinton is gone.  Make haste and get ready, now; and don't oblige me to\ncompel you.'\n\n'I shall,' said Catherine.  'Linton is all I have to love in the world,\nand though you have done what you could to make him hateful to me, and me\nto him, you cannot make us hate each other.  And I defy you to hurt him\nwhen I am by, and I defy you to frighten me!'\n\n'You are a boastful champion,' replied Heathcliff; 'but I don't like you\nwell enough to hurt him: you shall get the full benefit of the torment,\nas long as it lasts.  It is not I who will make him hateful to you--it is\nhis own sweet spirit.  He's as bitter as gall at your desertion and its\nconsequences: don't expect thanks for this noble devotion.  I heard him\ndraw a pleasant picture to Zillah of what he would do if he were as\nstrong as I: the inclination is there, and his very weakness will sharpen\nhis wits to find a substitute for strength.'\n\n'I know he has a bad nature,' said Catherine: 'he's your son.  But I'm\nglad I've a better, to forgive it; and I know he loves me, and for that\nreason I love him.  Mr. Heathcliff _you_ have _nobody_ to love you; and,\nhowever miserable you make us, we shall still have the revenge of\nthinking that your cruelty arises from your greater misery.  You _are_\nmiserable, are you not?  Lonely, like the devil, and envious like him?\n_Nobody_ loves you--_nobody_ will cry for you when you die!  I wouldn't\nbe you!'\n\nCatherine spoke with a kind of dreary triumph: she seemed to have made up\nher mind to enter into the spirit of her future family, and draw pleasure\nfrom the griefs of her enemies.\n\n'You shall be sorry to be yourself presently,' said her father-in-law,\n'if you stand there another minute.  Begone, witch, and get your things!'\n\nShe scornfully withdrew.  In her absence I began to beg for Zillah's\nplace at the Heights, offering to resign mine to her; but he would suffer\nit on no account.  He bid me be silent; and then, for the first time,\nallowed himself a glance round the room and a look at the pictures.\nHaving studied Mrs. Linton's, he said--'I shall have that home.  Not\nbecause I need it, but--'  He turned abruptly to the fire, and continued,\nwith what, for lack of a better word, I must call a smile--'I'll tell you\nwhat I did yesterday!  I got the sexton, who was digging Linton's grave,\nto remove the earth off her coffin lid, and I opened it.  I thought,\nonce, I would have stayed there: when I saw her face again--it is hers\nyet!--he had hard work to stir me; but he said it would change if the air\nblew on it, and so I struck one side of the coffin loose, and covered it\nup: not Linton's side, damn him!  I wish he'd been soldered in lead.  And\nI bribed the sexton to pull it away when I'm laid there, and slide mine\nout too; I'll have it made so: and then by the time Linton gets to us\nhe'll not know which is which!'\n\n'You were very wicked, Mr. Heathcliff!' I exclaimed; 'were you not\nashamed to disturb the dead?'\n\n'I disturbed nobody, Nelly,' he replied; 'and I gave some ease to myself.\nI shall be a great deal more comfortable now; and you'll have a better\nchance of keeping me underground, when I get there.  Disturbed her?  No!\nshe has disturbed me, night and day, through eighteen\nyears--incessantly--remorselessly--till yesternight; and yesternight I\nwas tranquil.  I dreamt I was sleeping the last sleep by that sleeper,\nwith my heart stopped and my cheek frozen against hers.'\n\n'And if she had been dissolved into earth, or worse, what would you have\ndreamt of then?' I said.\n\n'Of dissolving with her, and being more happy still!' he answered.  'Do\nyou suppose I dread any change of that sort?  I expected such a\ntransformation on raising the lid--but I'm better pleased that it should\nnot commence till I share it.  Besides, unless I had received a distinct\nimpression of her passionless features, that strange feeling would hardly\nhave been removed.  It began oddly.  You know I was wild after she died;\nand eternally, from dawn to dawn, praying her to return to me her spirit!\nI have a strong faith in ghosts: I have a conviction that they can, and\ndo, exist among us!  The day she was buried, there came a fall of snow.\nIn the evening I went to the churchyard.  It blew bleak as winter--all\nround was solitary.  I didn't fear that her fool of a husband would\nwander up the glen so late; and no one else had business to bring them\nthere.  Being alone, and conscious two yards of loose earth was the sole\nbarrier between us, I said to myself--\"I'll have her in my arms again!  If\nshe be cold, I'll think it is this north wind that chills _me_; and if\nshe be motionless, it is sleep.\"  I got a spade from the tool-house, and\nbegan to delve with all my might--it scraped the coffin; I fell to work\nwith my hands; the wood commenced cracking about the screws; I was on the\npoint of attaining my object, when it seemed that I heard a sigh from\nsome one above, close at the edge of the grave, and bending down.  \"If I\ncan only get this off,\" I muttered, \"I wish they may shovel in the earth\nover us both!\" and I wrenched at it more desperately still.  There was\nanother sigh, close at my ear.  I appeared to feel the warm breath of it\ndisplacing the sleet-laden wind.  I knew no living thing in flesh and\nblood was by; but, as certainly as you perceive the approach to some\nsubstantial body in the dark, though it cannot be discerned, so certainly\nI felt that Cathy was there: not under me, but on the earth.  A sudden\nsense of relief flowed from my heart through every limb.  I relinquished\nmy labour of agony, and turned consoled at once: unspeakably consoled.\nHer presence was with me: it remained while I re-filled the grave, and\nled me home.  You may laugh, if you will; but I was sure I should see her\nthere.  I was sure she was with me, and I could not help talking to her.\nHaving reached the Heights, I rushed eagerly to the door.  It was\nfastened; and, I remember, that accursed Earnshaw and my wife opposed my\nentrance.  I remember stopping to kick the breath out of him, and then\nhurrying up-stairs, to my room and hers.  I looked round impatiently--I\nfelt her by me--I could _almost_ see her, and yet I _could not_!  I ought\nto have sweat blood then, from the anguish of my yearning--from the\nfervour of my supplications to have but one glimpse!  I had not one.  She\nshowed herself, as she often was in life, a devil to me!  And, since\nthen, sometimes more and sometimes less, I've been the sport of that\nintolerable torture!  Infernal! keeping my nerves at such a stretch that,\nif they had not resembled catgut, they would long ago have relaxed to the\nfeebleness of Linton's.  When I sat in the house with Hareton, it seemed\nthat on going out I should meet her; when I walked on the moors I should\nmeet her coming in.  When I went from home I hastened to return; she\n_must_ be somewhere at the Heights, I was certain!  And when I slept in\nher chamber--I was beaten out of that.  I couldn't lie there; for the\nmoment I closed my eyes, she was either outside the window, or sliding\nback the panels, or entering the room, or even resting her darling head\non the same pillow as she did when a child; and I must open my lids to\nsee.  And so I opened and closed them a hundred times a night--to be\nalways disappointed!  It racked me!  I've often groaned aloud, till that\nold rascal Joseph no doubt believed that my conscience was playing the\nfiend inside of me.  Now, since I've seen her, I'm pacified--a little.  It\nwas a strange way of killing: not by inches, but by fractions of\nhairbreadths, to beguile me with the spectre of a hope through eighteen\nyears!'\n\nMr. Heathcliff paused and wiped his forehead; his hair clung to it, wet\nwith perspiration; his eyes were fixed on the red embers of the fire, the\nbrows not contracted, but raised next the temples; diminishing the grim\naspect of his countenance, but imparting a peculiar look of trouble, and\na painful appearance of mental tension towards one absorbing subject.  He\nonly half addressed me, and I maintained silence.  I didn't like to hear\nhim talk!  After a short period he resumed his meditation on the picture,\ntook it down and leant it against the sofa to contemplate it at better\nadvantage; and while so occupied Catherine entered, announcing that she\nwas ready, when her pony should be saddled.\n\n'Send that over to-morrow,' said Heathcliff to me; then turning to her,\nhe added: 'You may do without your pony: it is a fine evening, and you'll\nneed no ponies at Wuthering Heights; for what journeys you take, your own\nfeet will serve you.  Come along.'\n\n'Good-bye, Ellen!' whispered my dear little mistress.\n\nAs she kissed me, her lips felt like ice.  'Come and see me, Ellen; don't\nforget.'\n\n'Take care you do no such thing, Mrs. Dean!' said her new father.  'When\nI wish to speak to you I'll come here.  I want none of your prying at my\nhouse!'\n\nHe signed her to precede him; and casting back a look that cut my heart,\nshe obeyed.  I watched them, from the window, walk down the garden.\nHeathcliff fixed Catherine's arm under his: though she disputed the act\nat first evidently; and with rapid strides he hurried her into the alley,\nwhose trees concealed them.\n\n\n\n\n\nI have paid a visit to the Heights, but I have not seen her since she\nleft: Joseph held the door in his hand when I called to ask after her,\nand wouldn't let me pass.  He said Mrs. Linton was 'thrang,' and the\nmaster was not in.  Zillah has told me something of the way they go on,\notherwise I should hardly know who was dead and who living.  She thinks\nCatherine haughty, and does not like her, I can guess by her talk.  My\nyoung lady asked some aid of her when she first came; but Mr. Heathcliff\ntold her to follow her own business, and let his daughter-in-law look\nafter herself; and Zillah willingly acquiesced, being a narrow-minded,\nselfish woman.  Catherine evinced a child's annoyance at this neglect;\nrepaid it with contempt, and thus enlisted my informant among her\nenemies, as securely as if she had done her some great wrong.  I had a\nlong talk with Zillah about six weeks ago, a little before you came, one\nday when we foregathered on the moor; and this is what she told me.\n\n'The first thing Mrs. Linton did,' she said, 'on her arrival at the\nHeights, was to run up-stairs, without even wishing good-evening to me\nand Joseph; she shut herself into Linton's room, and remained till\nmorning.  Then, while the master and Earnshaw were at breakfast, she\nentered the house, and asked all in a quiver if the doctor might be sent\nfor? her cousin was very ill.\n\n'\"We know that!\" answered Heathcliff; \"but his life is not worth a\nfarthing, and I won't spend a farthing on him.\"\n\n'\"But I cannot tell how to do,\" she said; \"and if nobody will help me,\nhe'll die!\"\n\n'\"Walk out of the room,\" cried the master, \"and let me never hear a word\nmore about him!  None here care what becomes of him; if you do, act the\nnurse; if you do not, lock him up and leave him.\"\n\n'Then she began to bother me, and I said I'd had enough plague with the\ntiresome thing; we each had our tasks, and hers was to wait on Linton:\nMr. Heathcliff bid me leave that labour to her.\n\n'How they managed together, I can't tell.  I fancy he fretted a great\ndeal, and moaned hisseln night and day; and she had precious little rest:\none could guess by her white face and heavy eyes.  She sometimes came\ninto the kitchen all wildered like, and looked as if she would fain beg\nassistance; but I was not going to disobey the master: I never dare\ndisobey him, Mrs. Dean; and, though I thought it wrong that Kenneth\nshould not be sent for, it was no concern of mine either to advise or\ncomplain, and I always refused to meddle.  Once or twice, after we had\ngone to bed, I've happened to open my door again and seen her sitting\ncrying on the stairs'-top; and then I've shut myself in quick, for fear\nof being moved to interfere.  I did pity her then, I'm sure: still I\ndidn't wish to lose my place, you know.\n\n'At last, one night she came boldly into my chamber, and frightened me\nout of my wits, by saying, \"Tell Mr. Heathcliff that his son is dying--I'm\nsure he is, this time.  Get up, instantly, and tell him.\"\n\n'Having uttered this speech, she vanished again.  I lay a quarter of an\nhour listening and trembling.  Nothing stirred--the house was quiet.\n\n'She's mistaken, I said to myself.  He's got over it.  I needn't disturb\nthem; and I began to doze.  But my sleep was marred a second time by a\nsharp ringing of the bell--the only bell we have, put up on purpose for\nLinton; and the master called to me to see what was the matter, and\ninform them that he wouldn't have that noise repeated.\n\n'I delivered Catherine's message.  He cursed to himself, and in a few\nminutes came out with a lighted candle, and proceeded to their room.  I\nfollowed.  Mrs. Heathcliff was seated by the bedside, with her hands\nfolded on her knees.  Her father-in-law went up, held the light to\nLinton's face, looked at him, and touched him; afterwards he turned to\nher.\n\n'\"Now--Catherine,\" he said, \"how do you feel?\"\n\n'She was dumb.\n\n'\"How do you feel, Catherine?\" he repeated.\n\n'\"He's safe, and I'm free,\" she answered: \"I should feel well--but,\" she\ncontinued, with a bitterness she couldn't conceal, \"you have left me so\nlong to struggle against death alone, that I feel and see only death!  I\nfeel like death!\"\n\n'And she looked like it, too!  I gave her a little wine.  Hareton and\nJoseph, who had been wakened by the ringing and the sound of feet, and\nheard our talk from outside, now entered.  Joseph was fain, I believe, of\nthe lad's removal; Hareton seemed a thought bothered: though he was more\ntaken up with staring at Catherine than thinking of Linton.  But the\nmaster bid him get off to bed again: we didn't want his help.  He\nafterwards made Joseph remove the body to his chamber, and told me to\nreturn to mine, and Mrs. Heathcliff remained by herself.\n\n'In the morning, he sent me to tell her she must come down to breakfast:\nshe had undressed, and appeared going to sleep, and said she was ill; at\nwhich I hardly wondered.  I informed Mr. Heathcliff, and he\nreplied,--\"Well, let her be till after the funeral; and go up now and\nthen to get her what is needful; and, as soon as she seems better, tell\nme.\"'\n\nCathy stayed upstairs a fortnight, according to Zillah; who visited her\ntwice a day, and would have been rather more friendly, but her attempts\nat increasing kindness were proudly and promptly repelled.\n\nHeathcliff went up once, to show her Linton's will.  He had bequeathed\nthe whole of his, and what had been her, moveable property, to his\nfather: the poor creature was threatened, or coaxed, into that act during\nher week's absence, when his uncle died.  The lands, being a minor, he\ncould not meddle with.  However, Mr. Heathcliff has claimed and kept them\nin his wife's right and his also: I suppose legally; at any rate,\nCatherine, destitute of cash and friends, cannot disturb his possession.\n\n'Nobody,' said Zillah, 'ever approached her door, except that once, but\nI; and nobody asked anything about her.  The first occasion of her coming\ndown into the house was on a Sunday afternoon.  She had cried out, when I\ncarried up her dinner, that she couldn't bear any longer being in the\ncold; and I told her the master was going to Thrushcross Grange, and\nEarnshaw and I needn't hinder her from descending; so, as soon as she\nheard Heathcliff's horse trot off, she made her appearance, donned in\nblack, and her yellow curls combed back behind her ears as plain as a\nQuaker: she couldn't comb them out.\n\n'Joseph and I generally go to chapel on Sundays:' the kirk, you know, has\nno minister now, explained Mrs. Dean; and they call the Methodists' or\nBaptists' place (I can't say which it is) at Gimmerton, a chapel.  'Joseph\nhad gone,' she continued, 'but I thought proper to bide at home.  Young\nfolks are always the better for an elder's over-looking; and Hareton,\nwith all his bashfulness, isn't a model of nice behaviour.  I let him\nknow that his cousin would very likely sit with us, and she had been\nalways used to see the Sabbath respected; so he had as good leave his\nguns and bits of indoor work alone, while she stayed.  He coloured up at\nthe news, and cast his eyes over his hands and clothes.  The train-oil\nand gunpowder were shoved out of sight in a minute.  I saw he meant to\ngive her his company; and I guessed, by his way, he wanted to be\npresentable; so, laughing, as I durst not laugh when the master is by, I\noffered to help him, if he would, and joked at his confusion.  He grew\nsullen, and began to swear.\n\n'Now, Mrs. Dean,' Zillah went on, seeing me not pleased by her manner,\n'you happen think your young lady too fine for Mr. Hareton; and happen\nyou're right: but I own I should love well to bring her pride a peg\nlower.  And what will all her learning and her daintiness do for her,\nnow?  She's as poor as you or I: poorer, I'll be bound: you're saying,\nand I'm doing my little all that road.'\n\nHareton allowed Zillah to give him her aid; and she flattered him into a\ngood humour; so, when Catherine came, half forgetting her former insults,\nhe tried to make himself agreeable, by the housekeeper's account.\n\n'Missis walked in,' she said, 'as chill as an icicle, and as high as a\nprincess.  I got up and offered her my seat in the arm-chair.  No, she\nturned up her nose at my civility.  Earnshaw rose, too, and bid her come\nto the settle, and sit close by the fire: he was sure she was starved.\n\n'\"I've been starved a month and more,\" she answered, resting on the word\nas scornful as she could.\n\n'And she got a chair for herself, and placed it at a distance from both\nof us.  Having sat till she was warm, she began to look round, and\ndiscovered a number of books on the dresser; she was instantly upon her\nfeet again, stretching to reach them: but they were too high up.  Her\ncousin, after watching her endeavours a while, at last summoned courage\nto help her; she held her frock, and he filled it with the first that\ncame to hand.\n\n'That was a great advance for the lad.  She didn't thank him; still, he\nfelt gratified that she had accepted his assistance, and ventured to\nstand behind as she examined them, and even to stoop and point out what\nstruck his fancy in certain old pictures which they contained; nor was he\ndaunted by the saucy style in which she jerked the page from his finger:\nhe contented himself with going a bit farther back and looking at her\ninstead of the book.  She continued reading, or seeking for something to\nread.  His attention became, by degrees, quite centred in the study of\nher thick silky curls: her face he couldn't see, and she couldn't see\nhim.  And, perhaps, not quite awake to what he did, but attracted like a\nchild to a candle, at last he proceeded from staring to touching; he put\nout his hand and stroked one curl, as gently as if it were a bird.  He\nmight have stuck a knife into her neck, she started round in such a\ntaking.\n\n'\"Get away this moment!  How dare you touch me?  Why are you stopping\nthere?\" she cried, in a tone of disgust.  \"I can't endure you!  I'll go\nupstairs again, if you come near me.\"\n\n'Mr. Hareton recoiled, looking as foolish as he could do: he sat down in\nthe settle very quiet, and she continued turning over her volumes another\nhalf hour; finally, Earnshaw crossed over, and whispered to me.\n\n'\"Will you ask her to read to us, Zillah?  I'm stalled of doing naught;\nand I do like--I could like to hear her!  Dunnot say I wanted it, but ask\nof yourseln.\"\n\n'\"Mr. Hareton wishes you would read to us, ma'am,\" I said, immediately.\n\"He'd take it very kind--he'd be much obliged.\"\n\n'She frowned; and looking up, answered--\n\n'\"Mr. Hareton, and the whole set of you, will be good enough to\nunderstand that I reject any pretence at kindness you have the hypocrisy\nto offer!  I despise you, and will have nothing to say to any of you!\nWhen I would have given my life for one kind word, even to see one of\nyour faces, you all kept off.  But I won't complain to you!  I'm driven\ndown here by the cold; not either to amuse you or enjoy your society.\"\n\n'\"What could I ha' done?\" began Earnshaw.  \"How was I to blame?\"\n\n'\"Oh! you are an exception,\" answered Mrs. Heathcliff.  \"I never missed\nsuch a concern as you.\"\n\n'\"But I offered more than once, and asked,\" he said, kindling up at her\npertness, \"I asked Mr. Heathcliff to let me wake for you--\"\n\n'\"Be silent!  I'll go out of doors, or anywhere, rather than have your\ndisagreeable voice in my ear!\" said my lady.\n\n'Hareton muttered she might go to hell, for him! and unslinging his gun,\nrestrained himself from his Sunday occupations no longer.  He talked now,\nfreely enough; and she presently saw fit to retreat to her solitude: but\nthe frost had set in, and, in spite of her pride, she was forced to\ncondescend to our company, more and more.  However, I took care there\nshould be no further scorning at my good nature: ever since, I've been as\nstiff as herself; and she has no lover or liker among us: and she does\nnot deserve one; for, let them say the least word to her, and she'll curl\nback without respect of any one.  She'll snap at the master himself, and\nas good as dares him to thrash her; and the more hurt she gets, the more\nvenomous she grows.'\n\nAt first, on hearing this account from Zillah, I determined to leave my\nsituation, take a cottage, and get Catherine to come and live with me:\nbut Mr. Heathcliff would as soon permit that as he would set up Hareton\nin an independent house; and I can see no remedy, at present, unless she\ncould marry again; and that scheme it does not come within my province to\narrange.\n\n* * * * *\n\nThus ended Mrs. Dean's story.  Notwithstanding the doctor's prophecy, I\nam rapidly recovering strength; and though it be only the second week in\nJanuary, I propose getting out on horseback in a day or two, and riding\nover to Wuthering Heights, to inform my landlord that I shall spend the\nnext six months in London; and, if he likes, he may look out for another\ntenant to take the place after October.  I would not pass another winter\nhere for much.\n\n\n\n\n\nYesterday was bright, calm, and frosty.  I went to the Heights as I\nproposed: my housekeeper entreated me to bear a little note from her to\nher young lady, and I did not refuse, for the worthy woman was not\nconscious of anything odd in her request.  The front door stood open, but\nthe jealous gate was fastened, as at my last visit; I knocked and invoked\nEarnshaw from among the garden-beds; he unchained it, and I entered.  The\nfellow is as handsome a rustic as need be seen.  I took particular notice\nof him this time; but then he does his best apparently to make the least\nof his advantages.\n\nI asked if Mr. Heathcliff were at home?  He answered, No; but he would be\nin at dinner-time.  It was eleven o'clock, and I announced my intention\nof going in and waiting for him; at which he immediately flung down his\ntools and accompanied me, in the office of watchdog, not as a substitute\nfor the host.\n\nWe entered together; Catherine was there, making herself useful in\npreparing some vegetables for the approaching meal; she looked more\nsulky and less spirited than when I had seen her first. She hardly\nraised her eyes to notice me, and continued her employment with the same\ndisregard to common forms of politeness as before; never returning my\nbow and good-morning by the slightest acknowledgment.\n\n'She does not seem so amiable,' I thought, 'as Mrs. Dean would persuade\nme to believe.  She's a beauty, it is true; but not an angel.'\n\nEarnshaw surlily bid her remove her things to the kitchen.  'Remove them\nyourself,' she said, pushing them from her as soon as she had done; and\nretiring to a stool by the window, where she began to carve figures of\nbirds and beasts out of the turnip-parings in her lap.  I approached her,\npretending to desire a view of the garden; and, as I fancied, adroitly\ndropped Mrs. Dean's note on to her knee, unnoticed by Hareton--but she\nasked aloud, 'What is that?'  And chucked it off.\n\n'A letter from your old acquaintance, the housekeeper at the Grange,' I\nanswered; annoyed at her exposing my kind deed, and fearful lest it\nshould be imagined a missive of my own.  She would gladly have gathered\nit up at this information, but Hareton beat her; he seized and put it in\nhis waistcoat, saying Mr. Heathcliff should look at it first.  Thereat,\nCatherine silently turned her face from us, and, very stealthily, drew\nout her pocket-handkerchief and applied it to her eyes; and her cousin,\nafter struggling awhile to keep down his softer feelings, pulled out the\nletter and flung it on the floor beside her, as ungraciously as he could.\nCatherine caught and perused it eagerly; then she put a few questions to\nme concerning the inmates, rational and irrational, of her former home;\nand gazing towards the hills, murmured in soliloquy:\n\n'I should like to be riding Minny down there!  I should like to be\nclimbing up there!  Oh!  I'm tired--I'm _stalled_, Hareton!'  And she\nleant her pretty head back against the sill, with half a yawn and half a\nsigh, and lapsed into an aspect of abstracted sadness: neither caring nor\nknowing whether we remarked her.\n\n'Mrs. Heathcliff,' I said, after sitting some time mute, 'you are not\naware that I am an acquaintance of yours? so intimate that I think it\nstrange you won't come and speak to me.  My housekeeper never wearies of\ntalking about and praising you; and she'll be greatly disappointed if I\nreturn with no news of or from you, except that you received her letter\nand said nothing!'\n\nShe appeared to wonder at this speech, and asked,--\n\n'Does Ellen like you?'\n\n'Yes, very well,' I replied, hesitatingly.\n\n'You must tell her,' she continued, 'that I would answer her letter, but\nI have no materials for writing: not even a book from which I might tear\na leaf.'\n\n'No books!' I exclaimed.  'How do you contrive to live here without them?\nif I may take the liberty to inquire.  Though provided with a large\nlibrary, I'm frequently very dull at the Grange; take my books away, and\nI should be desperate!'\n\n'I was always reading, when I had them,' said Catherine; 'and Mr.\nHeathcliff never reads; so he took it into his head to destroy my books.\nI have not had a glimpse of one for weeks.  Only once, I searched through\nJoseph's store of theology, to his great irritation; and once, Hareton, I\ncame upon a secret stock in your room--some Latin and Greek, and some\ntales and poetry: all old friends.  I brought the last here--and you\ngathered them, as a magpie gathers silver spoons, for the mere love of\nstealing!  They are of no use to you; or else you concealed them in the\nbad spirit that, as you cannot enjoy them, nobody else shall.  Perhaps\n_your_ envy counselled Mr. Heathcliff to rob me of my treasures?  But\nI've most of them written on my brain and printed in my heart, and you\ncannot deprive me of those!'\n\nEarnshaw blushed crimson when his cousin made this revelation of his\nprivate literary accumulations, and stammered an indignant denial of her\naccusations.\n\n'Mr. Hareton is desirous of increasing his amount of knowledge,' I said,\ncoming to his rescue.  'He is not _envious_, but _emulous_ of your\nattainments.  He'll be a clever scholar in a few years.'\n\n'And he wants me to sink into a dunce, meantime,' answered Catherine.\n'Yes, I hear him trying to spell and read to himself, and pretty blunders\nhe makes!  I wish you would repeat Chevy Chase as you did yesterday: it\nwas extremely funny.  I heard you; and I heard you turning over the\ndictionary to seek out the hard words, and then cursing because you\ncouldn't read their explanations!'\n\nThe young man evidently thought it too bad that he should be laughed at\nfor his ignorance, and then laughed at for trying to remove it.  I had a\nsimilar notion; and, remembering Mrs. Dean's anecdote of his first\nattempt at enlightening the darkness in which he had been reared, I\nobserved,--'But, Mrs. Heathcliff, we have each had a commencement, and\neach stumbled and tottered on the threshold; had our teachers scorned\ninstead of aiding us, we should stumble and totter yet.'\n\n'Oh!' she replied, 'I don't wish to limit his acquirements: still, he has\nno right to appropriate what is mine, and make it ridiculous to me with\nhis vile mistakes and mispronunciations!  Those books, both prose and\nverse, are consecrated to me by other associations; and I hate to have\nthem debased and profaned in his mouth!  Besides, of all, he has selected\nmy favourite pieces that I love the most to repeat, as if out of\ndeliberate malice.'\n\nHareton's chest heaved in silence a minute: he laboured under a severe\nsense of mortification and wrath, which it was no easy task to suppress.\nI rose, and, from a gentlemanly idea of relieving his embarrassment, took\nup my station in the doorway, surveying the external prospect as I stood.\nHe followed my example, and left the room; but presently reappeared,\nbearing half a dozen volumes in his hands, which he threw into\nCatherine's lap, exclaiming,--'Take them!  I never want to hear, or read,\nor think of them again!'\n\n'I won't have them now,' she answered.  'I shall connect them with you,\nand hate them.'\n\nShe opened one that had obviously been often turned over, and read a\nportion in the drawling tone of a beginner; then laughed, and threw it\nfrom her.  'And listen,' she continued, provokingly, commencing a verse\nof an old ballad in the same fashion.\n\nBut his self-love would endure no further torment: I heard, and not\naltogether disapprovingly, a manual check given to her saucy tongue.  The\nlittle wretch had done her utmost to hurt her cousin's sensitive though\nuncultivated feelings, and a physical argument was the only mode he had\nof balancing the account, and repaying its effects on the inflictor.  He\nafterwards gathered the books and hurled them on the fire.  I read in his\ncountenance what anguish it was to offer that sacrifice to spleen.  I\nfancied that as they consumed, he recalled the pleasure they had already\nimparted, and the triumph and ever-increasing pleasure he had anticipated\nfrom them; and I fancied I guessed the incitement to his secret studies\nalso.  He had been content with daily labour and rough animal enjoyments,\ntill Catherine crossed his path.  Shame at her scorn, and hope of her\napproval, were his first prompters to higher pursuits; and instead of\nguarding him from one and winning him to the other, his endeavours to\nraise himself had produced just the contrary result.\n\n'Yes that's all the good that such a brute as you can get from them!'\ncried Catherine, sucking her damaged lip, and watching the conflagration\nwith indignant eyes.\n\n'You'd _better_ hold your tongue, now,' he answered fiercely.\n\nAnd his agitation precluded further speech; he advanced hastily to the\nentrance, where I made way for him to pass.  But ere he had crossed the\ndoor-stones, Mr. Heathcliff, coming up the causeway, encountered him, and\nlaying hold of his shoulder asked,--'What's to do now, my lad?'\n\n'Naught, naught,' he said, and broke away to enjoy his grief and anger in\nsolitude.\n\nHeathcliff gazed after him, and sighed.\n\n'It will be odd if I thwart myself,' he muttered, unconscious that I was\nbehind him.  'But when I look for his father in his face, I find _her_\nevery day more!  How the devil is he so like?  I can hardly bear to see\nhim.'\n\nHe bent his eyes to the ground, and walked moodily in.  There was a\nrestless, anxious expression in his countenance.  I had never remarked\nthere before; and he looked sparer in person.  His daughter-in-law, on\nperceiving him through the window, immediately escaped to the kitchen, so\nthat I remained alone.\n\n'I'm glad to see you out of doors again, Mr. Lockwood,' he said, in reply\nto my greeting; 'from selfish motives partly: I don't think I could\nreadily supply your loss in this desolation.  I've wondered more than\nonce what brought you here.'\n\n'An idle whim, I fear, sir,' was my answer; 'or else an idle whim is\ngoing to spirit me away.  I shall set out for London next week; and I\nmust give you warning that I feel no disposition to retain Thrushcross\nGrange beyond the twelve months I agreed to rent it.  I believe I shall\nnot live there any more.'\n\n'Oh, indeed; you're tired of being banished from the world, are you?' he\nsaid.  'But if you be coming to plead off paying for a place you won't\noccupy, your journey is useless: I never relent in exacting my due from\nany one.'\n\n'I'm coming to plead off nothing about it,' I exclaimed, considerably\nirritated.  'Should you wish it, I'll settle with you now,' and I drew my\nnote-book from my pocket.\n\n'No, no,' he replied, coolly; 'you'll leave sufficient behind to cover\nyour debts, if you fail to return: I'm not in such a hurry.  Sit down and\ntake your dinner with us; a guest that is safe from repeating his visit\ncan generally be made welcome.  Catherine! bring the things in: where are\nyou?'\n\nCatherine reappeared, bearing a tray of knives and forks.\n\n'You may get your dinner with Joseph,' muttered Heathcliff, aside, 'and\nremain in the kitchen till he is gone.'\n\nShe obeyed his directions very punctually: perhaps she had no temptation\nto transgress.  Living among clowns and misanthropists, she probably\ncannot appreciate a better class of people when she meets them.\n\nWith Mr. Heathcliff, grim and saturnine, on the one hand, and Hareton,\nabsolutely dumb, on the other, I made a somewhat cheerless meal, and bade\nadieu early.  I would have departed by the back way, to get a last\nglimpse of Catherine and annoy old Joseph; but Hareton received orders to\nlead up my horse, and my host himself escorted me to the door, so I could\nnot fulfil my wish.\n\n'How dreary life gets over in that house!' I reflected, while riding down\nthe road.  'What a realisation of something more romantic than a fairy\ntale it would have been for Mrs. Linton Heathcliff, had she and I struck\nup an attachment, as her good nurse desired, and migrated together into\nthe stirring atmosphere of the town!'\n\n\n\n\n\n1802.--This September I was invited to devastate the moors of a friend in\nthe north, and on my journey to his abode, I unexpectedly came within\nfifteen miles of Gimmerton.  The ostler at a roadside public-house was\nholding a pail of water to refresh my horses, when a cart of very green\noats, newly reaped, passed by, and he remarked,--'Yon's frough Gimmerton,\nnah!  They're allas three wick' after other folk wi' ther harvest.'\n\n'Gimmerton?' I repeated--my residence in that locality had already grown\ndim and dreamy.  'Ah!  I know.  How far is it from this?'\n\n'Happen fourteen mile o'er th' hills; and a rough road,' he answered.\n\nA sudden impulse seized me to visit Thrushcross Grange.  It was scarcely\nnoon, and I conceived that I might as well pass the night under my own\nroof as in an inn.  Besides, I could spare a day easily to arrange\nmatters with my landlord, and thus save myself the trouble of invading\nthe neighbourhood again.  Having rested awhile, I directed my servant to\ninquire the way to the village; and, with great fatigue to our beasts, we\nmanaged the distance in some three hours.\n\nI left him there, and proceeded down the valley alone.  The grey church\nlooked greyer, and the lonely churchyard lonelier.  I distinguished a\nmoor-sheep cropping the short turf on the graves.  It was sweet, warm\nweather--too warm for travelling; but the heat did not hinder me from\nenjoying the delightful scenery above and below: had I seen it nearer\nAugust, I'm sure it would have tempted me to waste a month among its\nsolitudes.  In winter nothing more dreary, in summer nothing more divine,\nthan those glens shut in by hills, and those bluff, bold swells of heath.\n\nI reached the Grange before sunset, and knocked for admittance; but the\nfamily had retreated into the back premises, I judged, by one thin, blue\nwreath, curling from the kitchen chimney, and they did not hear.  I rode\ninto the court.  Under the porch, a girl of nine or ten sat knitting, and\nan old woman reclined on the housesteps, smoking a meditative pipe.\n\n'Is Mrs. Dean within?' I demanded of the dame.\n\n'Mistress Dean?  Nay!' she answered,'she doesn't bide here: shoo's up at\nth' Heights.'\n\n'Are you the housekeeper, then?' I continued.\n\n'Eea, aw keep th' hause,' she replied.\n\n'Well, I'm Mr. Lockwood, the master.  Are there any rooms to lodge me in,\nI wonder?  I wish to stay all night.'\n\n'T' maister!' she cried in astonishment.  'Whet, whoiver knew yah wur\ncoming?  Yah sud ha' send word.  They's nowt norther dry nor mensful\nabaht t' place: nowt there isn't!'\n\nShe threw down her pipe and bustled in, the girl followed, and I entered\ntoo; soon perceiving that her report was true, and, moreover, that I had\nalmost upset her wits by my unwelcome apparition, I bade her be composed.\nI would go out for a walk; and, meantime she must try to prepare a corner\nof a sitting-room for me to sup in, and a bedroom to sleep in.  No\nsweeping and dusting, only good fire and dry sheets were necessary.  She\nseemed willing to do her best; though she thrust the hearth-brush into\nthe grates in mistake for the poker, and malappropriated several other\narticles of her craft: but I retired, confiding in her energy for a\nresting-place against my return.  Wuthering Heights was the goal of my\nproposed excursion.  An afterthought brought me back, when I had quitted\nthe court.\n\n'All well at the Heights?' I inquired of the woman.\n\n'Eea, f'r owt ee knaw!' she answered, skurrying away with a pan of hot\ncinders.\n\nI would have asked why Mrs. Dean had deserted the Grange, but it was\nimpossible to delay her at such a crisis, so I turned away and made my\nexit, rambling leisurely along, with the glow of a sinking sun behind,\nand the mild glory of a rising moon in front--one fading, and the other\nbrightening--as I quitted the park, and climbed the stony by-road\nbranching off to Mr. Heathcliff's dwelling.  Before I arrived in sight of\nit, all that remained of day was a beamless amber light along the west:\nbut I could see every pebble on the path, and every blade of grass, by\nthat splendid moon.  I had neither to climb the gate nor to knock--it\nyielded to my hand.  That is an improvement, I thought.  And I noticed\nanother, by the aid of my nostrils; a fragrance of stocks and wallflowers\nwafted on the air from amongst the homely fruit-trees.\n\nBoth doors and lattices were open; and yet, as is usually the case in a\ncoal-district, a fine red fire illumined the chimney: the comfort which\nthe eye derives from it renders the extra heat endurable.  But the house\nof Wuthering Heights is so large that the inmates have plenty of space\nfor withdrawing out of its influence; and accordingly what inmates there\nwere had stationed themselves not far from one of the windows.  I could\nboth see them and hear them talk before I entered, and looked and\nlistened in consequence; being moved thereto by a mingled sense of\ncuriosity and envy, that grew as I lingered.\n\n'Con-_trary_!' said a voice as sweet as a silver bell.  'That for the\nthird time, you dunce!  I'm not going to tell you again. Recollect, or\nI'll pull your hair!'\n\n'Contrary, then,' answered another, in deep but softened tones. 'And now,\nkiss me, for minding so well.'\n\n'No, read it over first correctly, without a single mistake.'\n\nThe male speaker began to read: he was a young man, respectably dressed\nand seated at a table, having a book before him.  His handsome features\nglowed with pleasure, and his eyes kept impatiently wandering from the\npage to a small white hand over his shoulder, which recalled him by a\nsmart slap on the cheek, whenever its owner detected such signs of\ninattention.  Its owner stood behind; her light, shining ringlets\nblending, at intervals, with his brown looks, as she bent to superintend\nhis studies; and her face--it was lucky he could not see her face, or he\nwould never have been so steady.  I could; and I bit my lip in spite, at\nhaving thrown away the chance I might have had of doing something besides\nstaring at its smiting beauty.\n\nThe task was done, not free from further blunders; but the pupil claimed\na reward, and received at least five kisses; which, however, he\ngenerously returned.  Then they came to the door, and from their\nconversation I judged they were about to issue out and have a walk on the\nmoors.  I supposed I should be condemned in Hareton Earnshaw's heart, if\nnot by his mouth, to the lowest pit in the infernal regions if I showed\nmy unfortunate person in his neighbourhood then; and feeling very mean\nand malignant, I skulked round to seek refuge in the kitchen.  There was\nunobstructed admittance on that side also; and at the door sat my old\nfriend Nelly Dean, sewing and singing a song; which was often interrupted\nfrom within by harsh words of scorn and intolerance, uttered in far from\nmusical accents.\n\n'I'd rayther, by th' haulf, hev' 'em swearing i' my lugs fro'h morn to\nneeght, nor hearken ye hahsiver!' said the tenant of the kitchen, in\nanswer to an unheard speech of Nelly's.  'It's a blazing shame, that I\ncannot oppen t' blessed Book, but yah set up them glories to sattan, and\nall t' flaysome wickednesses that iver were born into th' warld!  Oh!\nye're a raight nowt; and shoo's another; and that poor lad 'll be lost\natween ye.  Poor lad!' he added, with a groan; 'he's witched: I'm sartin\non't.  Oh, Lord, judge 'em, for there's norther law nor justice among wer\nrullers!'\n\n'No! or we should be sitting in flaming fagots, I suppose,' retorted the\nsinger.  'But wisht, old man, and read your Bible like a Christian, and\nnever mind me.  This is \"Fairy Annie's Wedding\"--a bonny tune--it goes to\na dance.'\n\nMrs. Dean was about to recommence, when I advanced; and recognising me\ndirectly, she jumped to her feet, crying--'Why, bless you, Mr. Lockwood!\nHow could you think of returning in this way?  All's shut up at\nThrushcross Grange.  You should have given us notice!'\n\n'I've arranged to be accommodated there, for as long as I shall stay,' I\nanswered.  'I depart again to-morrow.  And how are you transplanted here,\nMrs. Dean? tell me that.'\n\n'Zillah left, and Mr. Heathcliff wished me to come, soon after you went\nto London, and stay till you returned.  But, step in, pray! Have you\nwalked from Gimmerton this evening?'\n\n'From the Grange,' I replied; 'and while they make me lodging room there,\nI want to finish my business with your master; because I don't think of\nhaving another opportunity in a hurry.'\n\n'What business, sir?' said Nelly, conducting me into the house. 'He's\ngone out at present, and won't return soon.'\n\n'About the rent,' I answered.\n\n'Oh! then it is with Mrs. Heathcliff you must settle,' she observed; 'or\nrather with me.  She has not learnt to manage her affairs yet, and I act\nfor her: there's nobody else.'\n\nI looked surprised.\n\n'Ah! you have not heard of Heathcliff's death, I see,' she continued.\n\n'Heathcliff dead!' I exclaimed, astonished.  'How long ago?'\n\n'Three months since: but sit down, and let me take your hat, and I'll\ntell you all about it.  Stop, you have had nothing to eat, have you?'\n\n'I want nothing: I have ordered supper at home.  You sit down too. I\nnever dreamt of his dying!  Let me hear how it came to pass.  You say you\ndon't expect them back for some time--the young people?'\n\n'No--I have to scold them every evening for their late rambles: but they\ndon't care for me.  At least, have a drink of our old ale; it will do you\ngood: you seem weary.'\n\nShe hastened to fetch it before I could refuse, and I heard Joseph asking\nwhether 'it warn't a crying scandal that she should have followers at her\ntime of life?  And then, to get them jocks out o' t' maister's cellar!  He\nfair shaamed to 'bide still and see it.'\n\nShe did not stay to retaliate, but re-entered in a minute, bearing a\nreaming silver pint, whose contents I lauded with becoming earnestness.\nAnd afterwards she furnished me with the sequel of Heathcliff's history.\nHe had a 'queer' end, as she expressed it.\n\nI was summoned to Wuthering Heights, within a fortnight of your leaving\nus, she said; and I obeyed joyfully, for Catherine's sake. My first\ninterview with her grieved and shocked me: she had altered so much since\nour separation.  Mr. Heathcliff did not explain his reasons for taking a\nnew mind about my coming here; he only told me he wanted me, and he was\ntired of seeing Catherine: I must make the little parlour my\nsitting-room, and keep her with me. It was enough if he were obliged to\nsee her once or twice a day. She seemed pleased at this arrangement; and,\nby degrees, I smuggled over a great number of books, and other articles,\nthat had formed her amusement at the Grange; and flattered myself we\nshould get on in tolerable comfort.  The delusion did not last long.\nCatherine, contented at first, in a brief space grew irritable and\nrestless. For one thing, she was forbidden to move out of the garden, and\nit fretted her sadly to be confined to its narrow bounds as spring drew\non; for another, in following the house, I was forced to quit her\nfrequently, and she complained of loneliness: she preferred quarrelling\nwith Joseph in the kitchen to sitting at peace in her solitude.  I did\nnot mind their skirmishes: but Hareton was often obliged to seek the\nkitchen also, when the master wanted to have the house to himself! and\nthough in the beginning she either left it at his approach, or quietly\njoined in my occupations, and shunned remarking or addressing him--and\nthough he was always as sullen and silent as possible--after a while, she\nchanged her behaviour, and became incapable of letting him alone: talking\nat him; commenting on his stupidity and idleness; expressing her wonder\nhow he could endure the life he lived--how he could sit a whole evening\nstaring into the fire, and dozing.\n\n'He's just like a dog, is he not, Ellen?' she once observed, 'or a\ncart-horse? He does his work, eats his food, and sleeps eternally! What\na blank, dreary mind he must have! Do you ever dream, Hareton? And, if\nyou do, what is it about? But you can't speak to me!'\n\nThen she looked at him; but he would neither open his mouth nor look\nagain.\n\n'He's, perhaps, dreaming now,' she continued.  'He twitched his shoulder\nas Juno twitches hers.  Ask him, Ellen.'\n\n'Mr. Hareton will ask the master to send you up-stairs, if you don't\nbehave!' I said.  He had not only twitched his shoulder but clenched his\nfist, as if tempted to use it.\n\n'I know why Hareton never speaks, when I am in the kitchen,' she\nexclaimed, on another occasion.  'He is afraid I shall laugh at him.\nEllen, what do you think?  He began to teach himself to read once; and,\nbecause I laughed, he burned his books, and dropped it: was he not a\nfool?'\n\n'Were not you naughty?' I said; 'answer me that.'\n\n'Perhaps I was,' she went on; 'but I did not expect him to be so silly.\nHareton, if I gave you a book, would you take it now?  I'll try!'\n\nShe placed one she had been perusing on his hand; he flung it off, and\nmuttered, if she did not give over, he would break her neck.\n\n'Well, I shall put it here,' she said, 'in the table-drawer; and I'm\ngoing to bed.'\n\nThen she whispered me to watch whether he touched it, and departed.  But\nhe would not come near it; and so I informed her in the morning, to her\ngreat disappointment.  I saw she was sorry for his persevering sulkiness\nand indolence: her conscience reproved her for frightening him off\nimproving himself: she had done it effectually.  But her ingenuity was at\nwork to remedy the injury: while I ironed, or pursued other such\nstationary employments as I could not well do in the parlour, she would\nbring some pleasant volume and read it aloud to me.  When Hareton was\nthere, she generally paused in an interesting part, and left the book\nlying about: that she did repeatedly; but he was as obstinate as a mule,\nand, instead of snatching at her bait, in wet weather he took to smoking\nwith Joseph; and they sat like automatons, one on each side of the fire,\nthe elder happily too deaf to understand her wicked nonsense, as he would\nhave called it, the younger doing his best to seem to disregard it.  On\nfine evenings the latter followed his shooting expeditions, and Catherine\nyawned and sighed, and teased me to talk to her, and ran off into the\ncourt or garden the moment I began; and, as a last resource, cried, and\nsaid she was tired of living: her life was useless.\n\nMr. Heathcliff, who grew more and more disinclined to society, had almost\nbanished Earnshaw from his apartment.  Owing to an accident at the\ncommencement of March, he became for some days a fixture in the kitchen.\nHis gun burst while out on the hills by himself; a splinter cut his arm,\nand he lost a good deal of blood before he could reach home.  The\nconsequence was that, perforce, he was condemned to the fireside and\ntranquillity, till he made it up again.  It suited Catherine to have him\nthere: at any rate, it made her hate her room up-stairs more than ever:\nand she would compel me to find out business below, that she might\naccompany me.\n\nOn Easter Monday, Joseph went to Gimmerton fair with some cattle; and, in\nthe afternoon, I was busy getting up linen in the kitchen.  Earnshaw sat,\nmorose as usual, at the chimney corner, and my little mistress was\nbeguiling an idle hour with drawing pictures on the window-panes, varying\nher amusement by smothered bursts of songs, and whispered ejaculations,\nand quick glances of annoyance and impatience in the direction of her\ncousin, who steadfastly smoked, and looked into the grate.  At a notice\nthat I could do with her no longer intercepting my light, she removed to\nthe hearthstone.  I bestowed little attention on her proceedings, but,\npresently, I heard her begin--'I've found out, Hareton, that I want--that\nI'm glad--that I should like you to be my cousin now, if you had not\ngrown so cross to me, and so rough.'\n\nHareton returned no answer.\n\n'Hareton, Hareton, Hareton! do you hear?' she continued.\n\n### Summary:"}
{"original_length": 17790, "trunc_length": 16384, "text": "\n\nSummarize the following text into a summary of less than 800 words.\n### Text:\n\n\nSir Thomas was to return in November, and his eldest son had duties to\ncall him earlier home. The approach of September brought tidings of Mr.\nBertram, first in a letter to the gamekeeper and then in a letter\nto Edmund; and by the end of August he arrived himself, to be gay,\nagreeable, and gallant again as occasion served, or Miss Crawford\ndemanded; to tell of races and Weymouth, and parties and friends, to\nwhich she might have listened six weeks before with some interest, and\naltogether to give her the fullest conviction, by the power of actual\ncomparison, of her preferring his younger brother.\n\nIt was very vexatious, and she was heartily sorry for it; but so it was;\nand so far from now meaning to marry the elder, she did not even want\nto attract him beyond what the simplest claims of conscious beauty\nrequired: his lengthened absence from Mansfield, without anything but\npleasure in view, and his own will to consult, made it perfectly clear\nthat he did not care about her; and his indifference was so much more\nthan equalled by her own, that were he now to step forth the owner of\nMansfield Park, the Sir Thomas complete, which he was to be in time, she\ndid not believe she could accept him.\n\nThe season and duties which brought Mr. Bertram back to Mansfield took\nMr. Crawford into Norfolk. Everingham could not do without him in the\nbeginning of September. He went for a fortnight--a fortnight of such\ndullness to the Miss Bertrams as ought to have put them both on their\nguard, and made even Julia admit, in her jealousy of her sister, the\nabsolute necessity of distrusting his attentions, and wishing him not\nto return; and a fortnight of sufficient leisure, in the intervals of\nshooting and sleeping, to have convinced the gentleman that he ought\nto keep longer away, had he been more in the habit of examining his own\nmotives, and of reflecting to what the indulgence of his idle vanity was\ntending; but, thoughtless and selfish from prosperity and bad example,\nhe would not look beyond the present moment. The sisters, handsome,\nclever, and encouraging, were an amusement to his sated mind; and\nfinding nothing in Norfolk to equal the social pleasures of Mansfield,\nhe gladly returned to it at the time appointed, and was welcomed thither\nquite as gladly by those whom he came to trifle with further.\n\nMaria, with only Mr. Rushworth to attend to her, and doomed to the\nrepeated details of his day's sport, good or bad, his boast of his dogs,\nhis jealousy of his neighbours, his doubts of their qualifications,\nand his zeal after poachers, subjects which will not find their way to\nfemale feelings without some talent on one side or some attachment on\nthe other, had missed Mr. Crawford grievously; and Julia, unengaged and\nunemployed, felt all the right of missing him much more. Each sister\nbelieved herself the favourite. Julia might be justified in so doing by\nthe hints of Mrs. Grant, inclined to credit what she wished, and Maria\nby the hints of Mr. Crawford himself. Everything returned into the same\nchannel as before his absence; his manners being to each so animated and\nagreeable as to lose no ground with either, and just stopping short of\nthe consistence, the steadiness, the solicitude, and the warmth which\nmight excite general notice.\n\nFanny was the only one of the party who found anything to dislike; but\nsince the day at Sotherton, she could never see Mr. Crawford with either\nsister without observation, and seldom without wonder or censure; and\nhad her confidence in her own judgment been equal to her exercise of it\nin every other respect, had she been sure that she was seeing clearly,\nand judging candidly, she would probably have made some important\ncommunications to her usual confidant. As it was, however, she only\nhazarded a hint, and the hint was lost. \"I am rather surprised,\" said\nshe, \"that Mr. Crawford should come back again so soon, after being here\nso long before, full seven weeks; for I had understood he was so\nvery fond of change and moving about, that I thought something would\ncertainly occur, when he was once gone, to take him elsewhere. He is\nused to much gayer places than Mansfield.\"\n\n\"It is to his credit,\" was Edmund's answer; \"and I dare say it gives his\nsister pleasure. She does not like his unsettled habits.\"\n\n\"What a favourite he is with my cousins!\"\n\n\"Yes, his manners to women are such as must please. Mrs. Grant, I\nbelieve, suspects him of a preference for Julia; I have never seen much\nsymptom of it, but I wish it may be so. He has no faults but what a\nserious attachment would remove.\"\n\n\"If Miss Bertram were not engaged,\" said Fanny cautiously, \"I could\nsometimes almost think that he admired her more than Julia.\"\n\n\"Which is, perhaps, more in favour of his liking Julia best, than you,\nFanny, may be aware; for I believe it often happens that a man, before\nhe has quite made up his own mind, will distinguish the sister or\nintimate friend of the woman he is really thinking of more than the\nwoman herself. Crawford has too much sense to stay here if he found\nhimself in any danger from Maria; and I am not at all afraid for her,\nafter such a proof as she has given that her feelings are not strong.\"\n\nFanny supposed she must have been mistaken, and meant to think\ndifferently in future; but with all that submission to Edmund could\ndo, and all the help of the coinciding looks and hints which she\noccasionally noticed in some of the others, and which seemed to say that\nJulia was Mr. Crawford's choice, she knew not always what to think. She\nwas privy, one evening, to the hopes of her aunt Norris on the subject,\nas well as to her feelings, and the feelings of Mrs. Rushworth, on a\npoint of some similarity, and could not help wondering as she listened;\nand glad would she have been not to be obliged to listen, for it was\nwhile all the other young people were dancing, and she sitting,\nmost unwillingly, among the chaperons at the fire, longing for the\nre-entrance of her elder cousin, on whom all her own hopes of a partner\nthen depended. It was Fanny's first ball, though without the preparation\nor splendour of many a young lady's first ball, being the thought only\nof the afternoon, built on the late acquisition of a violin player in\nthe servants' hall, and the possibility of raising five couple with\nthe help of Mrs. Grant and a new intimate friend of Mr. Bertram's just\narrived on a visit. It had, however, been a very happy one to Fanny\nthrough four dances, and she was quite grieved to be losing even a\nquarter of an hour. While waiting and wishing, looking now at\nthe dancers and now at the door, this dialogue between the two\nabove-mentioned ladies was forced on her--\n\n\"I think, ma'am,\" said Mrs. Norris, her eyes directed towards Mr.\nRushworth and Maria, who were partners for the second time, \"we shall\nsee some happy faces again now.\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am, indeed,\" replied the other, with a stately simper, \"there\nwill be some satisfaction in looking on _now_, and I think it was rather\na pity they should have been obliged to part. Young folks in their\nsituation should be excused complying with the common forms. I wonder my\nson did not propose it.\"\n\n\"I dare say he did, ma'am. Mr. Rushworth is never remiss. But dear Maria\nhas such a strict sense of propriety, so much of that true delicacy\nwhich one seldom meets with nowadays, Mrs. Rushworth--that wish of\navoiding particularity! Dear ma'am, only look at her face at this\nmoment; how different from what it was the two last dances!\"\n\nMiss Bertram did indeed look happy, her eyes were sparkling with\npleasure, and she was speaking with great animation, for Julia and her\npartner, Mr. Crawford, were close to her; they were all in a cluster\ntogether. How she had looked before, Fanny could not recollect, for she\nhad been dancing with Edmund herself, and had not thought about her.\n\nMrs. Norris continued, \"It is quite delightful, ma'am, to see young\npeople so properly happy, so well suited, and so much the thing! I\ncannot but think of dear Sir Thomas's delight. And what do you say,\nma'am, to the chance of another match? Mr. Rushworth has set a good\nexample, and such things are very catching.\"\n\nMrs. Rushworth, who saw nothing but her son, was quite at a loss.\n\n\"The couple above, ma'am. Do you see no symptoms there?\"\n\n\"Oh dear! Miss Julia and Mr. Crawford. Yes, indeed, a very pretty match.\nWhat is his property?\"\n\n\"Four thousand a year.\"\n\n\"Very well. Those who have not more must be satisfied with what they\nhave. Four thousand a year is a pretty estate, and he seems a very\ngenteel, steady young man, so I hope Miss Julia will be very happy.\"\n\n\"It is not a settled thing, ma'am, yet. We only speak of it among\nfriends. But I have very little doubt it _will_ be. He is growing\nextremely particular in his attentions.\"\n\nFanny could listen no farther. Listening and wondering were all\nsuspended for a time, for Mr. Bertram was in the room again; and though\nfeeling it would be a great honour to be asked by him, she thought it\nmust happen. He came towards their little circle; but instead of asking\nher to dance, drew a chair near her, and gave her an account of the\npresent state of a sick horse, and the opinion of the groom, from\nwhom he had just parted. Fanny found that it was not to be, and in the\nmodesty of her nature immediately felt that she had been unreasonable\nin expecting it. When he had told of his horse, he took a newspaper from\nthe table, and looking over it, said in a languid way, \"If you want to\ndance, Fanny, I will stand up with you.\" With more than equal civility\nthe offer was declined; she did not wish to dance. \"I am glad of it,\"\nsaid he, in a much brisker tone, and throwing down the newspaper again,\n\"for I am tired to death. I only wonder how the good people can keep\nit up so long. They had need be _all_ in love, to find any amusement in\nsuch folly; and so they are, I fancy. If you look at them you may see\nthey are so many couple of lovers--all but Yates and Mrs. Grant--and,\nbetween ourselves, she, poor woman, must want a lover as much as any one\nof them. A desperate dull life hers must be with the doctor,\" making\na sly face as he spoke towards the chair of the latter, who proving,\nhowever, to be close at his elbow, made so instantaneous a change of\nexpression and subject necessary, as Fanny, in spite of everything,\ncould hardly help laughing at. \"A strange business this in America, Dr.\nGrant! What is your opinion? I always come to you to know what I am to\nthink of public matters.\"\n\n\"My dear Tom,\" cried his aunt soon afterwards, \"as you are not dancing,\nI dare say you will have no objection to join us in a rubber; shall\nyou?\" Then leaving her seat, and coming to him to enforce the proposal,\nadded in a whisper, \"We want to make a table for Mrs. Rushworth, you\nknow. Your mother is quite anxious about it, but cannot very well spare\ntime to sit down herself, because of her fringe. Now, you and I and Dr.\nGrant will just do; and though _we_ play but half-crowns, you know, you\nmay bet half-guineas with _him_.\"\n\n\"I should be most happy,\" replied he aloud, and jumping up with\nalacrity, \"it would give me the greatest pleasure; but that I am\nthis moment going to dance.\" Come, Fanny, taking her hand, \"do not be\ndawdling any longer, or the dance will be over.\"\n\nFanny was led off very willingly, though it was impossible for her to\nfeel much gratitude towards her cousin, or distinguish, as he certainly\ndid, between the selfishness of another person and his own.\n\n\"A pretty modest request upon my word,\" he indignantly exclaimed as they\nwalked away. \"To want to nail me to a card-table for the next two hours\nwith herself and Dr. Grant, who are always quarrelling, and that poking\nold woman, who knows no more of whist than of algebra. I wish my good\naunt would be a little less busy! And to ask me in such a way too!\nwithout ceremony, before them all, so as to leave me no possibility\nof refusing. _That_ is what I dislike most particularly. It raises my\nspleen more than anything, to have the pretence of being asked, of\nbeing given a choice, and at the same time addressed in such a way as\nto oblige one to do the very thing, whatever it be! If I had not luckily\nthought of standing up with you I could not have got out of it. It is\na great deal too bad. But when my aunt has got a fancy in her head,\nnothing can stop her.\"\n\n\n\nThe Honourable John Yates, this new friend, had not much to recommend\nhim beyond habits of fashion and expense, and being the younger son of\na lord with a tolerable independence; and Sir Thomas would probably\nhave thought his introduction at Mansfield by no means desirable. Mr.\nBertram's acquaintance with him had begun at Weymouth, where they had\nspent ten days together in the same society, and the friendship, if\nfriendship it might be called, had been proved and perfected by Mr.\nYates's being invited to take Mansfield in his way, whenever he could,\nand by his promising to come; and he did come rather earlier than had\nbeen expected, in consequence of the sudden breaking-up of a large party\nassembled for gaiety at the house of another friend, which he had left\nWeymouth to join. He came on the wings of disappointment, and with his\nhead full of acting, for it had been a theatrical party; and the play\nin which he had borne a part was within two days of representation,\nwhen the sudden death of one of the nearest connexions of the family\nhad destroyed the scheme and dispersed the performers. To be so near\nhappiness, so near fame, so near the long paragraph in praise of the\nprivate theatricals at Ecclesford, the seat of the Right Hon. Lord\nRavenshaw, in Cornwall, which would of course have immortalised the\nwhole party for at least a twelvemonth! and being so near, to lose\nit all, was an injury to be keenly felt, and Mr. Yates could talk of\nnothing else. Ecclesford and its theatre, with its arrangements and\ndresses, rehearsals and jokes, was his never-failing subject, and to\nboast of the past his only consolation.\n\nHappily for him, a love of the theatre is so general, an itch for acting\nso strong among young people, that he could hardly out-talk the interest\nof his hearers. From the first casting of the parts to the epilogue it\nwas all bewitching, and there were few who did not wish to have been a\nparty concerned, or would have hesitated to try their skill. The play\nhad been Lovers' Vows, and Mr. Yates was to have been Count Cassel. \"A\ntrifling part,\" said he, \"and not at all to my taste, and such a one\nas I certainly would not accept again; but I was determined to make no\ndifficulties. Lord Ravenshaw and the duke had appropriated the only two\ncharacters worth playing before I reached Ecclesford; and though Lord\nRavenshaw offered to resign his to me, it was impossible to take it, you\nknow. I was sorry for _him_ that he should have so mistaken his powers,\nfor he was no more equal to the Baron--a little man with a weak voice,\nalways hoarse after the first ten minutes. It must have injured the\npiece materially; but _I_ was resolved to make no difficulties. Sir\nHenry thought the duke not equal to Frederick, but that was because\nSir Henry wanted the part himself; whereas it was certainly in the best\nhands of the two. I was surprised to see Sir Henry such a stick. Luckily\nthe strength of the piece did not depend upon him. Our Agatha was\ninimitable, and the duke was thought very great by many. And upon the\nwhole, it would certainly have gone off wonderfully.\"\n\n\"It was a hard case, upon my word\"; and, \"I do think you were very much\nto be pitied,\" were the kind responses of listening sympathy.\n\n\"It is not worth complaining about; but to be sure the poor old dowager\ncould not have died at a worse time; and it is impossible to help\nwishing that the news could have been suppressed for just the three days\nwe wanted. It was but three days; and being only a grandmother, and all\nhappening two hundred miles off, I think there would have been no great\nharm, and it was suggested, I know; but Lord Ravenshaw, who I suppose is\none of the most correct men in England, would not hear of it.\"\n\n\"An afterpiece instead of a comedy,\" said Mr. Bertram. \"Lovers' Vows\nwere at an end, and Lord and Lady Ravenshaw left to act My Grandmother\nby themselves. Well, the jointure may comfort _him_; and perhaps,\nbetween friends, he began to tremble for his credit and his lungs in the\nBaron, and was not sorry to withdraw; and to make _you_ amends, Yates, I\nthink we must raise a little theatre at Mansfield, and ask you to be our\nmanager.\"\n\nThis, though the thought of the moment, did not end with the moment; for\nthe inclination to act was awakened, and in no one more strongly than in\nhim who was now master of the house; and who, having so much leisure as\nto make almost any novelty a certain good, had likewise such a degree of\nlively talents and comic taste, as were exactly adapted to the novelty\nof acting. The thought returned again and again. \"Oh for the Ecclesford\ntheatre and scenery to try something with.\" Each sister could echo the\nwish; and Henry Crawford, to whom, in all the riot of his gratifications\nit was yet an untasted pleasure, was quite alive at the idea. \"I really\nbelieve,\" said he, \"I could be fool enough at this moment to undertake\nany character that ever was written, from Shylock or Richard III down to\nthe singing hero of a farce in his scarlet coat and cocked hat. I feel\nas if I could be anything or everything; as if I could rant and storm,\nor sigh or cut capers, in any tragedy or comedy in the English language.\nLet us be doing something. Be it only half a play, an act, a scene; what\nshould prevent us? Not these countenances, I am sure,\" looking towards\nthe Miss Bertrams; \"and for a theatre, what signifies a theatre? We\nshall be only amusing ourselves. Any room in this house might suffice.\"\n\n\"We must have a curtain,\" said Tom Bertram; \"a few yards of green baize\nfor a curtain, and perhaps that may be enough.\"\n\n\"Oh, quite enough,\" cried Mr. Yates, \"with only just a side wing or two\nrun up, doors in flat, and three or four scenes to be let down; nothing\nmore would be necessary on such a plan as this. For mere amusement among\nourselves we should want nothing more.\"\n\n\"I believe we must be satisfied with _less_,\" said Maria. \"There would\nnot be time, and other difficulties would arise. We must rather adopt\nMr. Crawford's views, and make the _performance_, not the _theatre_, our\nobject. Many parts of our best plays are independent of scenery.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said Edmund, who began to listen with alarm. \"Let us do nothing\nby halves. If we are to act, let it be in a theatre completely fitted\nup with pit, boxes, and gallery, and let us have a play entire from\nbeginning to end; so as it be a German play, no matter what, with a good\ntricking, shifting afterpiece, and a figure-dance, and a hornpipe, and a\nsong between the acts. If we do not outdo Ecclesford, we do nothing.\"\n\n\"Now, Edmund, do not be disagreeable,\" said Julia. \"Nobody loves a play\nbetter than you do, or can have gone much farther to see one.\"\n\n\"True, to see real acting, good hardened real acting; but I would hardly\nwalk from this room to the next to look at the raw efforts of those who\nhave not been bred to the trade: a set of gentlemen and ladies, who have\nall the disadvantages of education and decorum to struggle through.\"\n\nAfter a short pause, however, the subject still continued, and was\ndiscussed with unabated eagerness, every one's inclination increasing\nby the discussion, and a knowledge of the inclination of the rest; and\nthough nothing was settled but that Tom Bertram would prefer a comedy,\nand his sisters and Henry Crawford a tragedy, and that nothing in the\nworld could be easier than to find a piece which would please them all,\nthe resolution to act something or other seemed so decided as to\nmake Edmund quite uncomfortable. He was determined to prevent it, if\npossible, though his mother, who equally heard the conversation which\npassed at table, did not evince the least disapprobation.\n\nThe same evening afforded him an opportunity of trying his strength.\nMaria, Julia, Henry Crawford, and Mr. Yates were in the billiard-room.\nTom, returning from them into the drawing-room, where Edmund was\nstanding thoughtfully by the fire, while Lady Bertram was on the sofa at\na little distance, and Fanny close beside her arranging her work, thus\nbegan as he entered--\"Such a horribly vile billiard-table as ours is not\nto be met with, I believe, above ground. I can stand it no longer, and I\nthink, I may say, that nothing shall ever tempt me to it again; but one\ngood thing I have just ascertained: it is the very room for a theatre,\nprecisely the shape and length for it; and the doors at the farther\nend, communicating with each other, as they may be made to do in five\nminutes, by merely moving the bookcase in my father's room, is the very\nthing we could have desired, if we had sat down to wish for it; and\nmy father's room will be an excellent greenroom. It seems to join the\nbilliard-room on purpose.\"\n\n\"You are not serious, Tom, in meaning to act?\" said Edmund, in a low\nvoice, as his brother approached the fire.\n\n\"Not serious! never more so, I assure you. What is there to surprise you\nin it?\"\n\n\"I think it would be very wrong. In a _general_ light, private\ntheatricals are open to some objections, but as _we_ are circumstanced,\nI must think it would be highly injudicious, and more than injudicious\nto attempt anything of the kind. It would shew great want of feeling\non my father's account, absent as he is, and in some degree of constant\ndanger; and it would be imprudent, I think, with regard to Maria, whose\nsituation is a very delicate one, considering everything, extremely\ndelicate.\"\n\n\"You take up a thing so seriously! as if we were going to act three\ntimes a week till my father's return, and invite all the country. But\nit is not to be a display of that sort. We mean nothing but a little\namusement among ourselves, just to vary the scene, and exercise our\npowers in something new. We want no audience, no publicity. We may be\ntrusted, I think, in chusing some play most perfectly unexceptionable;\nand I can conceive no greater harm or danger to any of us in conversing\nin the elegant written language of some respectable author than in\nchattering in words of our own. I have no fears and no scruples. And\nas to my father's being absent, it is so far from an objection, that I\nconsider it rather as a motive; for the expectation of his return must\nbe a very anxious period to my mother; and if we can be the means of\namusing that anxiety, and keeping up her spirits for the next few weeks,\nI shall think our time very well spent, and so, I am sure, will he. It\nis a _very_ anxious period for her.\"\n\nAs he said this, each looked towards their mother. Lady Bertram, sunk\nback in one corner of the sofa, the picture of health, wealth, ease,\nand tranquillity, was just falling into a gentle doze, while Fanny was\ngetting through the few difficulties of her work for her.\n\nEdmund smiled and shook his head.\n\n\"By Jove! this won't do,\" cried Tom, throwing himself into a chair with\na hearty laugh. \"To be sure, my dear mother, your anxiety--I was unlucky\nthere.\"\n\n\"What is the matter?\" asked her ladyship, in the heavy tone of one\nhalf-roused; \"I was not asleep.\"\n\n\"Oh dear, no, ma'am, nobody suspected you! Well, Edmund,\" he continued,\nreturning to the former subject, posture, and voice, as soon as Lady\nBertram began to nod again, \"but _this_ I _will_ maintain, that we shall\nbe doing no harm.\"\n\n\"I cannot agree with you; I am convinced that my father would totally\ndisapprove it.\"\n\n\"And I am convinced to the contrary. Nobody is fonder of the exercise\nof talent in young people, or promotes it more, than my father, and for\nanything of the acting, spouting, reciting kind, I think he has always a\ndecided taste. I am sure he encouraged it in us as boys. How many a time\nhave we mourned over the dead body of Julius Caesar, and to _be'd_ and\nnot _to_ _be'd_, in this very room, for his amusement? And I am sure,\n_my_ _name_ _was_ _Norval_, every evening of my life through one\nChristmas holidays.\"\n\n\"It was a very different thing. You must see the difference yourself. My\nfather wished us, as schoolboys, to speak well, but he would never\nwish his grown-up daughters to be acting plays. His sense of decorum is\nstrict.\"\n\n\"I know all that,\" said Tom, displeased. \"I know my father as well as\nyou do; and I'll take care that his daughters do nothing to distress\nhim. Manage your own concerns, Edmund, and I'll take care of the rest of\nthe family.\"\n\n\"If you are resolved on acting,\" replied the persevering Edmund, \"I must\nhope it will be in a very small and quiet way; and I think a theatre\nought not to be attempted. It would be taking liberties with my father's\nhouse in his absence which could not be justified.\"\n\n\"For everything of that nature I will be answerable,\" said Tom, in a\ndecided tone. \"His house shall not be hurt. I have quite as great an\ninterest in being careful of his house as you can have; and as to such\nalterations as I was suggesting just now, such as moving a bookcase, or\nunlocking a door, or even as using the billiard-room for the space of a\nweek without playing at billiards in it, you might just as well suppose\nhe would object to our sitting more in this room, and less in the\nbreakfast-room, than we did before he went away, or to my sister's\npianoforte being moved from one side of the room to the other. Absolute\nnonsense!\"\n\n\"The innovation, if not wrong as an innovation, will be wrong as an\nexpense.\"\n\n\"Yes, the expense of such an undertaking would be prodigious! Perhaps\nit might cost a whole twenty pounds. Something of a theatre we must have\nundoubtedly, but it will be on the simplest plan: a green curtain and a\nlittle carpenter's work, and that's all; and as the carpenter's work\nmay be all done at home by Christopher Jackson himself, it will be\ntoo absurd to talk of expense; and as long as Jackson is employed,\neverything will be right with Sir Thomas. Don't imagine that nobody in\nthis house can see or judge but yourself. Don't act yourself, if you do\nnot like it, but don't expect to govern everybody else.\"\n\n\"No, as to acting myself,\" said Edmund, \"_that_ I absolutely protest\nagainst.\"\n\nTom walked out of the room as he said it, and Edmund was left to sit\ndown and stir the fire in thoughtful vexation.\n\nFanny, who had heard it all, and borne Edmund company in every feeling\nthroughout the whole, now ventured to say, in her anxiety to suggest\nsome comfort, \"Perhaps they may not be able to find any play to suit\nthem. Your brother's taste and your sisters' seem very different.\"\n\n\"I have no hope there, Fanny. If they persist in the scheme, they will\nfind something. I shall speak to my sisters and try to dissuade _them_,\nand that is all I can do.\"\n\n\"I should think my aunt Norris would be on your side.\"\n\n\"I dare say she would, but she has no influence with either Tom or my\nsisters that could be of any use; and if I cannot convince them myself,\nI shall let things take their course, without attempting it through\nher. Family squabbling is the greatest evil of all, and we had better do\nanything than be altogether by the ears.\"\n\nHis sisters, to whom he had an opportunity of speaking the next morning,\nwere quite as impatient of his advice, quite as unyielding to his\nrepresentation, quite as determined in the cause of pleasure, as Tom.\nTheir mother had no objection to the plan, and they were not in the\nleast afraid of their father's disapprobation. There could be no harm in\nwhat had been done in so many respectable families, and by so many women\nof the first consideration; and it must be scrupulousness run mad that\ncould see anything to censure in a plan like theirs, comprehending only\nbrothers and sisters and intimate friends, and which would never be\nheard of beyond themselves. Julia _did_ seem inclined to admit that\nMaria's situation might require particular caution and delicacy--but\nthat could not extend to _her_--she was at liberty; and Maria evidently\nconsidered her engagement as only raising her so much more above\nrestraint, and leaving her less occasion than Julia to consult either\nfather or mother. Edmund had little to hope, but he was still urging the\nsubject when Henry Crawford entered the room, fresh from the Parsonage,\ncalling out, \"No want of hands in our theatre, Miss Bertram. No want\nof understrappers: my sister desires her love, and hopes to be admitted\ninto the company, and will be happy to take the part of any old duenna\nor tame confidante, that you may not like to do yourselves.\"\n\nMaria gave Edmund a glance, which meant, \"What say you now? Can we\nbe wrong if Mary Crawford feels the same?\" And Edmund, silenced,\nwas obliged to acknowledge that the charm of acting might well carry\nfascination to the mind of genius; and with the ingenuity of love, to\ndwell more on the obliging, accommodating purport of the message than on\nanything else.\n\nThe scheme advanced. Opposition was vain; and as to Mrs. Norris, he\nwas mistaken in supposing she would wish to make any. She started no\ndifficulties that were not talked down in five minutes by her eldest\nnephew and niece, who were all-powerful with her; and as the whole\narrangement was to bring very little expense to anybody, and none at all\nto herself, as she foresaw in it all the comforts of hurry, bustle,\nand importance, and derived the immediate advantage of fancying herself\nobliged to leave her own house, where she had been living a month at\nher own cost, and take up her abode in theirs, that every hour might be\nspent in their service, she was, in fact, exceedingly delighted with the\nproject.\n\n\n\nFanny seemed nearer being right than Edmund had supposed. The business\nof finding a play that would suit everybody proved to be no trifle; and\nthe carpenter had received his orders and taken his measurements, had\nsuggested and removed at least two sets of difficulties, and having made\nthe necessity of an enlargement of plan and expense fully evident, was\nalready at work, while a play was still to seek. Other preparations\nwere also in hand. An enormous roll of green baize had arrived from\nNorthampton, and been cut out by Mrs. Norris (with a saving by her good\nmanagement of full three-quarters of a yard), and was actually forming\ninto a curtain by the housemaids, and still the play was wanting; and\nas two or three days passed away in this manner, Edmund began almost to\nhope that none might ever be found.\n\nThere were, in fact, so many things to be attended to, so many people\nto be pleased, so many best characters required, and, above all, such a\nneed that the play should be at once both tragedy and comedy, that there\ndid seem as little chance of a decision as anything pursued by youth and\nzeal could hold out.\n\nOn the tragic side were the Miss Bertrams, Henry Crawford, and Mr.\nYates; on the comic, Tom Bertram, not _quite_ alone, because it was\nevident that Mary Crawford's wishes, though politely kept back, inclined\nthe same way: but his determinateness and his power seemed to make\nallies unnecessary; and, independent of this great irreconcilable\ndifference, they wanted a piece containing very few characters in the\nwhole, but every character first-rate, and three principal women. All\nthe best plays were run over in vain. Neither Hamlet, nor Macbeth, nor\nOthello, nor Douglas, nor The Gamester, presented anything that could\nsatisfy even the tragedians; and The Rivals, The School for Scandal,\nWheel of Fortune, Heir at Law, and a long et cetera, were successively\ndismissed with yet warmer objections. No piece could be proposed that\ndid not supply somebody with a difficulty, and on one side or the other\nit was a continual repetition of, \"Oh no, _that_ will never do! Let us\nhave no ranting tragedies. Too many characters. Not a tolerable\nwoman's part in the play. Anything but _that_, my dear Tom. It would be\nimpossible to fill it up. One could not expect anybody to take such a\npart. Nothing but buffoonery from beginning to end. _That_ might do,\nperhaps, but for the low parts. If I _must_ give my opinion, I have\nalways thought it the most insipid play in the English language. _I_ do\nnot wish to make objections; I shall be happy to be of any use, but I\nthink we could not chuse worse.\"\n\nFanny looked on and listened, not unamused to observe the selfishness\nwhich, more or less disguised, seemed to govern them all, and wondering\nhow it would end. For her own gratification she could have wished that\nsomething might be acted, for she had never seen even half a play, but\neverything of higher consequence was against it.\n\n\"This will never do,\" said Tom Bertram at last. \"We are wasting time\nmost abominably. Something must be fixed on. No matter what, so that\nsomething is chosen. We must not be so nice. A few characters too many\nmust not frighten us. We must _double_ them. We must descend a little.\nIf a part is insignificant, the greater our credit in making anything of\nit. From this moment I make no difficulties. I take any part you chuse\nto give me, so as it be comic. Let it but be comic, I condition for\nnothing more.\"\n\nFor about the fifth time he then proposed the Heir at Law, doubting only\nwhether to prefer Lord Duberley or Dr. Pangloss for himself; and very\nearnestly, but very unsuccessfully, trying to persuade the others that\nthere were some fine tragic parts in the rest of the dramatis personae.\n\nThe pause which followed this fruitless effort was ended by the same\nspeaker, who, taking up one of the many volumes of plays that lay on the\ntable, and turning it over, suddenly exclaimed--\"Lovers' Vows! And why\nshould not Lovers' Vows do for _us_ as well as for the Ravenshaws? How\ncame it never to be thought of before? It strikes me as if it would do\nexactly. What say you all? Here are two capital tragic parts for Yates\nand Crawford, and here is the rhyming Butler for me, if nobody else\nwants it; a trifling part, but the sort of thing I should not dislike,\nand, as I said before, I am determined to take anything and do my best.\nAnd as for the rest, they may be filled up by anybody. It is only Count\nCassel and Anhalt.\"\n\nThe suggestion was generally welcome. Everybody was growing weary of\nindecision, and the first idea with everybody was, that nothing had been\nproposed before so likely to suit them all. Mr. Yates was particularly\npleased: he had been sighing and longing to do the Baron at Ecclesford,\nhad grudged every rant of Lord Ravenshaw's, and been forced to re-rant\nit all in his own room. The storm through Baron Wildenheim was the\nheight of his theatrical ambition; and with the advantage of knowing\nhalf the scenes by heart already, he did now, with the greatest\nalacrity, offer his services for the part. To do him justice, however,\nhe did not resolve to appropriate it; for remembering that there was\nsome very good ranting-ground in Frederick, he professed an equal\nwillingness for that. Henry Crawford was ready to take either. Whichever\nMr. Yates did not chuse would perfectly satisfy him, and a short parley\nof compliment ensued. Miss Bertram, feeling all the interest of an\nAgatha in the question, took on her to decide it, by observing to Mr.\nYates that this was a point in which height and figure ought to\nbe considered, and that _his_ being the tallest, seemed to fit him\npeculiarly for the Baron. She was acknowledged to be quite right, and\nthe two parts being accepted accordingly, she was certain of the proper\nFrederick. Three of the characters were now cast, besides Mr. Rushworth,\nwho was always answered for by Maria as willing to do anything; when\nJulia, meaning, like her sister, to be Agatha, began to be scrupulous on\nMiss Crawford's account.\n\n\"This is not behaving well by the absent,\" said she. \"Here are not women\nenough. Amelia and Agatha may do for Maria and me, but here is nothing\nfor your sister, Mr. Crawford.\"\n\nMr. Crawford desired _that_ might not be thought of: he was very sure\nhis sister had no wish of acting but as she might be useful, and that\nshe would not allow herself to be considered in the present case. But\nthis was immediately opposed by Tom Bertram, who asserted the part of\nAmelia to be in every respect the property of Miss Crawford, if she\nwould accept it. \"It falls as naturally, as necessarily to her,\"\nsaid he, \"as Agatha does to one or other of my sisters. It can be no\nsacrifice on their side, for it is highly comic.\"\n\nA short silence followed. Each sister looked anxious; for each felt the\nbest claim to Agatha, and was hoping to have it pressed on her by the\nrest. Henry Crawford, who meanwhile had taken up the play, and with\nseeming carelessness was turning over the first act, soon settled the\nbusiness.\n\n\"I must entreat Miss _Julia_ Bertram,\" said he, \"not to engage in the\npart of Agatha, or it will be the ruin of all my solemnity. You must\nnot, indeed you must not\" (turning to her). \"I could not stand your\ncountenance dressed up in woe and paleness. The many laughs we have had\ntogether would infallibly come across me, and Frederick and his knapsack\nwould be obliged to run away.\"\n\nPleasantly, courteously, it was spoken; but the manner was lost in the\nmatter to Julia's feelings. She saw a glance at Maria which confirmed\nthe injury to herself: it was a scheme, a trick; she was slighted, Maria\nwas preferred; the smile of triumph which Maria was trying to suppress\nshewed how well it was understood; and before Julia could command\nherself enough to speak, her brother gave his weight against her too,\nby saying, \"Oh yes! Maria must be Agatha. Maria will be the best Agatha.\nThough Julia fancies she prefers tragedy, I would not trust her in it.\nThere is nothing of tragedy about her. She has not the look of it. Her\nfeatures are not tragic features, and she walks too quick, and speaks\ntoo quick, and would not keep her countenance. She had better do the old\ncountrywoman: the Cottager's wife; you had, indeed, Julia. Cottager's\nwife is a very pretty part, I assure you. The old lady relieves the\nhigh-flown benevolence of her husband with a good deal of spirit. You\nshall be Cottager's wife.\"\n\n\"Cottager's wife!\" cried Mr. Yates. \"What are you talking of? The most\ntrivial, paltry, insignificant part; the merest commonplace; not a\ntolerable speech in the whole. Your sister do that! It is an insult\nto propose it. At Ecclesford the governess was to have done it. We\nall agreed that it could not be offered to anybody else. A little more\njustice, Mr. Manager, if you please. You do not deserve the office, if\nyou cannot appreciate the talents of your company a little better.\"\n\n\"Why, as to _that_, my good friend, till I and my company have really\nacted there must be some guesswork; but I mean no disparagement to\nJulia. We cannot have two Agathas, and we must have one Cottager's\nwife; and I am sure I set her the example of moderation myself in being\nsatisfied with the old Butler. If the part is trifling she will have\nmore credit in making something of it; and if she is so desperately bent\nagainst everything humorous, let her take Cottager's speeches instead of\nCottager's wife's, and so change the parts all through; _he_ is solemn\nand pathetic enough, I am sure. It could make no difference in the play,\nand as for Cottager himself, when he has got his wife's speeches, _I_\nwould undertake him with all my heart.\"\n\n\"With all your partiality for Cottager's wife,\" said Henry Crawford, \"it\nwill be impossible to make anything of it fit for your sister, and we\nmust not suffer her good-nature to be imposed on. We must not _allow_\nher to accept the part. She must not be left to her own complaisance.\nHer talents will be wanted in Amelia. Amelia is a character more\ndifficult to be well represented than even Agatha. I consider Amelia\nis the most difficult character in the whole piece. It requires great\npowers, great nicety, to give her playfulness and simplicity without\nextravagance. I have seen good actresses fail in the part. Simplicity,\nindeed, is beyond the reach of almost every actress by profession.\nIt requires a delicacy of feeling which they have not. It requires a\ngentlewoman--a Julia Bertram. You _will_ undertake it, I hope?\" turning\nto her with a look of anxious entreaty, which softened her a little; but\nwhile she hesitated what to say, her brother again interposed with Miss\nCrawford's better claim.\n\n\"No, no, Julia must not be Amelia. It is not at all the part for her.\nShe would not like it. She would not do well. She is too tall and\nrobust. Amelia should be a small, light, girlish, skipping figure. It is\nfit for Miss Crawford, and Miss Crawford only. She looks the part, and I\nam persuaded will do it admirably.\"\n\nWithout attending to this, Henry Crawford continued his supplication.\n\"You must oblige us,\" said he, \"indeed you must. When you have studied\nthe character, I am sure you will feel it suit you. Tragedy may be your\nchoice, but it will certainly appear that comedy chuses _you_. You\nwill be to visit me in prison with a basket of provisions; you will\nnot refuse to visit me in prison? I think I see you coming in with your\nbasket.\"\n\nThe influence of his voice was felt. Julia wavered; but was he only\ntrying to soothe and pacify her, and make her overlook the previous\naffront? She distrusted him. The slight had been most determined. He\nwas, perhaps, but at treacherous play with her. She looked suspiciously\nat her sister; Maria's countenance was to decide it: if she were vexed\nand alarmed--but Maria looked all serenity and satisfaction, and Julia\nwell knew that on this ground Maria could not be happy but at her\nexpense. With hasty indignation, therefore, and a tremulous voice, she\nsaid to him, \"You do not seem afraid of not keeping your countenance\nwhen I come in with a basket of provisions--though one might have\nsupposed--but it is only as Agatha that I was to be so overpowering!\"\nShe stopped--Henry Crawford looked rather foolish, and as if he did not\nknow what to say. Tom Bertram began again--\n\n\"Miss Crawford must be Amelia. She will be an excellent Amelia.\"\n\n\"Do not be afraid of _my_ wanting the character,\" cried Julia, with\nangry quickness: \"I am _not_ to be Agatha, and I am sure I will do\nnothing else; and as to Amelia, it is of all parts in the world the\nmost disgusting to me. I quite detest her. An odious, little, pert,\nunnatural, impudent girl. I have always protested against comedy, and\nthis is comedy in its worst form.\" And so saying, she walked hastily\nout of the room, leaving awkward feelings to more than one, but exciting\nsmall compassion in any except Fanny, who had been a quiet auditor of\nthe whole, and who could not think of her as under the agitations of\n_jealousy_ without great pity.\n\nA short silence succeeded her leaving them; but her brother soon\nreturned to business and Lovers' Vows, and was eagerly looking over\nthe play, with Mr. Yates's help, to ascertain what scenery would be\nnecessary--while Maria and Henry Crawford conversed together in an\nunder-voice, and the declaration with which she began of, \"I am sure I\nwould give up the part to Julia most willingly, but that though I shall\nprobably do it very ill, I feel persuaded _she_ would do it worse,\" was\ndoubtless receiving all the compliments it called for.\n\nWhen this had lasted some time, the division of the party was completed\nby Tom Bertram and Mr. Yates walking off together to consult farther in\nthe room now beginning to be called _the_ _Theatre_, and Miss Bertram's\nresolving to go down to the Parsonage herself with the offer of Amelia\nto Miss Crawford; and Fanny remained alone.\n\nThe first use she made of her solitude was to take up the volume which\nhad been left on the table, and begin to acquaint herself with the play\nof which she had heard so much. Her curiosity was all awake, and she ran\nthrough it with an eagerness which was suspended only by intervals of\nastonishment, that it could be chosen in the present instance, that it\ncould be proposed and accepted in a private theatre! Agatha and Amelia\nappeared to her in their different ways so totally improper for home\nrepresentation--the situation of one, and the language of the other,\nso unfit to be expressed by any woman of modesty, that she could hardly\nsuppose her cousins could be aware of what they were engaging in; and\nlonged to have them roused as soon as possible by the remonstrance which\nEdmund would certainly make.\n\n\n\nMiss Crawford accepted the part very readily; and soon after Miss\nBertram's return from the Parsonage, Mr. Rushworth arrived, and another\ncharacter was consequently cast. He had the offer of Count Cassel\nand Anhalt, and at first did not know which to chuse, and wanted Miss\nBertram to direct him; but upon being made to understand the different\nstyle of the characters, and which was which, and recollecting that he\nhad once seen the play in London, and had thought Anhalt a very stupid\nfellow, he soon decided for the Count. Miss Bertram approved the\ndecision, for the less he had to learn the better; and though she could\nnot sympathise in his wish that the Count and Agatha might be to act\ntogether, nor wait very patiently while he was slowly turning over the\nleaves with the hope of still discovering such a scene, she very kindly\ntook his part in hand, and curtailed every speech that admitted being\nshortened; besides pointing out the necessity of his being very much\ndressed, and chusing his colours. Mr. Rushworth liked the idea of his\nfinery very well, though affecting to despise it; and was too much\nengaged with what his own appearance would be to think of the others,\nor draw any of those conclusions, or feel any of that displeasure which\nMaria had been half prepared for.\n\nThus much was settled before Edmund, who had been out all the morning,\nknew anything of the matter; but when he entered the drawing-room before\ndinner, the buzz of discussion was high between Tom, Maria, and Mr.\nYates; and Mr. Rushworth stepped forward with great alacrity to tell him\nthe agreeable news.\n\n\"We have got a play,\" said he. \"It is to be Lovers' Vows; and I am to be\nCount Cassel, and am to come in first with a blue dress and a pink satin\ncloak, and afterwards am to have another fine fancy suit, by way of a\nshooting-dress. I do not know how I shall like it.\"\n\nFanny's eyes followed Edmund, and her heart beat for him as she heard\nthis speech, and saw his look, and felt what his sensations must be.\n\n\"Lovers' Vows!\" in a tone of the greatest amazement, was his only reply\nto Mr. Rushworth, and he turned towards his brother and sisters as if\nhardly doubting a contradiction.\n\n\"Yes,\" cried Mr. Yates. \"After all our debatings and difficulties, we\nfind there is nothing that will suit us altogether so well, nothing so\nunexceptionable, as Lovers' Vows. The wonder is that it should not have\nbeen thought of before. My stupidity was abominable, for here we have\nall the advantage of what I saw at Ecclesford; and it is so useful to\nhave anything of a model! We have cast almost every part.\"\n\n\"But what do you do for women?\" said Edmund gravely, and looking at\nMaria.\n\nMaria blushed in spite of herself as she answered, \"I take the part\nwhich Lady Ravenshaw was to have done, and\" (with a bolder eye) \"Miss\nCrawford is to be Amelia.\"\n\n\"I should not have thought it the sort of play to be so easily filled\nup, with _us_,\" replied Edmund, turning away to the fire, where sat\nhis mother, aunt, and Fanny, and seating himself with a look of great\nvexation.\n\nMr. Rushworth followed him to say, \"I come in three times, and have\ntwo-and-forty speeches. That's something, is not it? But I do not much\nlike the idea of being so fine. I shall hardly know myself in a blue\ndress and a pink satin cloak.\"\n\nEdmund could not answer him. In a few minutes Mr. Bertram was called\nout of the room to satisfy some doubts of the carpenter; and being\naccompanied by Mr. Yates, and followed soon afterwards by Mr. Rushworth,\nEdmund almost immediately took the opportunity of saying, \"I cannot,\nbefore Mr. Yates, speak what I feel as to this play, without reflecting\non his friends at Ecclesford; but I must now, my dear Maria, tell _you_,\nthat I think it exceedingly unfit for private representation, and that I\nhope you will give it up. I cannot but suppose you _will_ when you have\nread it carefully over. Read only the first act aloud to either your\nmother or aunt, and see how you can approve it. It will not be necessary\nto send you to your _father's_ judgment, I am convinced.\"\n\n\"We see things very differently,\" cried Maria. \"I am perfectly\nacquainted with the play, I assure you; and with a very few omissions,\nand so forth, which will be made, of course, I can see nothing\nobjectionable in it; and _I_ am not the _only_ young woman you find who\nthinks it very fit for private representation.\"\n\n\"I am sorry for it,\" was his answer; \"but in this matter it is _you_ who\nare to lead. _You_ must set the example. If others have blundered, it\nis your place to put them right, and shew them what true delicacy is.\nIn all points of decorum _your_ conduct must be law to the rest of the\nparty.\"\n\nThis picture of her consequence had some effect, for no one loved better\nto lead than Maria; and with far more good-humour she answered, \"I am\nmuch obliged to you, Edmund; you mean very well, I am sure: but I still\nthink you see things too strongly; and I really cannot undertake to\nharangue all the rest upon a subject of this kind. _There_ would be the\ngreatest indecorum, I think.\"\n\n\"Do you imagine that I could have such an idea in my head? No; let your\nconduct be the only harangue. Say that, on examining the part, you feel\nyourself unequal to it; that you find it requiring more exertion and\nconfidence than you can be supposed to have. Say this with firmness, and\nit will be quite enough. All who can distinguish will understand your\nmotive. The play will be given up, and your delicacy honoured as it\nought.\"\n\n\"Do not act anything improper, my dear,\" said Lady Bertram. \"Sir Thomas\nwould not like it.--Fanny, ring the bell; I must have my dinner.--To be\nsure, Julia is dressed by this time.\"\n\n\"I am convinced, madam,\" said Edmund, preventing Fanny, \"that Sir Thomas\nwould not like it.\"\n\n\"There, my dear, do you hear what Edmund says?\"\n\n\"If I were to decline the part,\" said Maria, with renewed zeal, \"Julia\nwould certainly take it.\"\n\n\"What!\" cried Edmund, \"if she knew your reasons!\"\n\n\"Oh! she might think the difference between us--the difference in our\nsituations--that _she_ need not be so scrupulous as _I_ might feel\nnecessary. I am sure she would argue so. No; you must excuse me; I\ncannot retract my consent; it is too far settled, everybody would be so\ndisappointed, Tom would be quite angry; and if we are so very nice, we\nshall never act anything.\"\n\n\"I was just going to say the very same thing,\" said Mrs. Norris.\n\"If every play is to be objected to, you will act nothing, and the\npreparations will be all so much money thrown away, and I am sure _that_\nwould be a discredit to us all. I do not know the play; but, as Maria\nsays, if there is anything a little too warm (and it is so with most of\nthem) it can be easily left out. We must not be over-precise, Edmund. As\nMr. Rushworth is to act too, there can be no harm. I only wish Tom had\nknown his own mind when the carpenters began, for there was the loss\nof half a day's work about those side-doors. The curtain will be a good\njob, however. The maids do their work very well, and I think we shall be\nable to send back some dozens of the rings. There is no occasion to put\nthem so very close together. I _am_ of some use, I hope, in preventing\nwaste and making the most of things. There should always be one\nsteady head to superintend so many young ones. I forgot to tell Tom of\nsomething that happened to me this very day. I had been looking about me\nin the poultry-yard, and was just coming out, when who should I see but\nDick Jackson making up to the servants' hall-door with two bits of deal\nboard in his hand, bringing them to father, you may be sure; mother had\nchanced to send him of a message to father, and then father had bid\nhim bring up them two bits of board, for he could not no how do without\nthem. I knew what all this meant, for the servants' dinner-bell\nwas ringing at the very moment over our heads; and as I hate such\nencroaching people (the Jacksons are very encroaching, I have always\nsaid so: just the sort of people to get all they can), I said to the boy\ndirectly (a great lubberly fellow of ten years old, you know, who ought\nto be ashamed of himself), '_I'll_ take the boards to your father, Dick,\nso get you home again as fast as you can.' The boy looked very silly,\nand turned away without offering a word, for I believe I might speak\npretty sharp; and I dare say it will cure him of coming marauding about\nthe house for one while. I hate such greediness--so good as your father\nis to the family, employing the man all the year round!\"\n\nNobody was at the trouble of an answer; the others soon returned; and\nEdmund found that to have endeavoured to set them right must be his only\nsatisfaction.\n\nDinner passed heavily. Mrs. Norris related again her triumph over Dick\nJackson, but neither play nor preparation were otherwise much talked\nof, for Edmund's disapprobation was felt even by his brother, though\nhe would not have owned it. Maria, wanting Henry Crawford's animating\nsupport, thought the subject better avoided. Mr. Yates, who was trying\nto make himself agreeable to Julia, found her gloom less impenetrable on\nany topic than that of his regret at her secession from their company;\nand Mr. Rushworth, having only his own part and his own dress in his\nhead, had soon talked away all that could be said of either.\n\nBut the concerns of the theatre were suspended only for an hour or two:\nthere was still a great deal to be settled; and the spirits of evening\ngiving fresh courage, Tom, Maria, and Mr. Yates, soon after their being\nreassembled in the drawing-room, seated themselves in committee at a\nseparate table, with the play open before them, and were just getting\ndeep in the subject when a most welcome interruption was given by the\nentrance of Mr. and Miss Crawford, who, late and dark and dirty as it\nwas, could not help coming, and were received with the most grateful\njoy.\n\n\"Well, how do you go on?\" and \"What have you settled?\" and \"Oh! we\ncan do nothing without you,\" followed the first salutations; and Henry\nCrawford was soon seated with the other three at the table, while his\nsister made her way to Lady Bertram, and with pleasant attention was\ncomplimenting _her_. \"I must really congratulate your ladyship,\" said\nshe, \"on the play being chosen; for though you have borne it with\nexemplary patience, I am sure you must be sick of all our noise and\ndifficulties. The actors may be glad, but the bystanders must be\ninfinitely more thankful for a decision; and I do sincerely give you\njoy, madam, as well as Mrs. Norris, and everybody else who is in the\nsame predicament,\" glancing half fearfully, half slyly, beyond Fanny to\nEdmund.\n\nShe was very civilly answered by Lady Bertram, but Edmund said nothing.\nHis being only a bystander was not disclaimed. After continuing in chat\nwith the party round the fire a few minutes, Miss Crawford returned\nto the party round the table; and standing by them, seemed to\ninterest herself in their arrangements till, as if struck by a sudden\nrecollection, she exclaimed, \"My good friends, you are most composedly\nat work upon these cottages and alehouses, inside and out; but pray let\nme know my fate in the meanwhile. Who is to be Anhalt? What gentleman\namong you am I to have the pleasure of making love to?\"\n\nFor a moment no one spoke; and then many spoke together to tell the same\nmelancholy truth, that they had not yet got any Anhalt. \"Mr. Rushworth\nwas to be Count Cassel, but no one had yet undertaken Anhalt.\"\n\n\"I had my choice of the parts,\" said Mr. Rushworth; \"but I thought I\nshould like the Count best, though I do not much relish the finery I am\nto have.\"\n\n\"You chose very wisely, I am sure,\" replied Miss Crawford, with a\nbrightened look; \"Anhalt is a heavy part.\"\n\n\"_The_ _Count_ has two-and-forty speeches,\" returned Mr. Rushworth,\n\"which is no trifle.\"\n\n\"I am not at all surprised,\" said Miss Crawford, after a short pause,\n\"at this want of an Anhalt. Amelia deserves no better. Such a forward\nyoung lady may well frighten the men.\"\n\n\"I should be but too happy in taking the part, if it were possible,\"\ncried Tom; \"but, unluckily, the Butler and Anhalt are in together. I\nwill not entirely give it up, however; I will try what can be done--I\nwill look it over again.\"\n\n\"Your _brother_ should take the part,\" said Mr. Yates, in a low voice.\n\"Do not you think he would?\"\n\n\"_I_ shall not ask him,\" replied Tom, in a cold, determined manner.\n\nMiss Crawford talked of something else, and soon afterwards rejoined the\nparty at the fire.\n\n\"They do not want me at all,\" said she, seating herself. \"I only puzzle\nthem, and oblige them to make civil speeches. Mr.\n\n### Summary:"}
{"original_length": 17124, "trunc_length": 16384, "text": "\n\nSummarize the following text into a summary of less than 800 words.\n### Text:\n\n\n    Let the high Muse chant loves Olympian:\n    We are but mortals, and must sing of man.\n\n\nAn eminent philosopher among my friends, who can dignify even your ugly\nfurniture by lifting it into the serene light of science, has shown me\nthis pregnant little fact.  Your pier-glass or extensive surface of\npolished steel made to be rubbed by a housemaid, will be minutely and\nmultitudinously scratched in all directions; but place now against it a\nlighted candle as a centre of illumination, and lo! the scratches will\nseem to arrange themselves in a fine series of concentric circles round\nthat little sun.  It is demonstrable that the scratches are going\neverywhere impartially and it is only your candle which produces the\nflattering illusion of a concentric arrangement, its light falling with\nan exclusive optical selection.  These things are a parable.  The\nscratches are events, and the candle is the egoism of any person now\nabsent--of Miss Vincy, for example.  Rosamond had a Providence of her\nown who had kindly made her more charming than other girls, and who\nseemed to have arranged Fred's illness and Mr. Wrench's mistake in\norder to bring her and Lydgate within effective proximity.  It would\nhave been to contravene these arrangements if Rosamond had consented to\ngo away to Stone Court or elsewhere, as her parents wished her to do,\nespecially since Mr. Lydgate thought the precaution needless.\nTherefore, while Miss Morgan and the children were sent away to a\nfarmhouse the morning after Fred's illness had declared itself,\nRosamond refused to leave papa and mamma.\n\nPoor mamma indeed was an object to touch any creature born of woman;\nand Mr. Vincy, who doted on his wife, was more alarmed on her account\nthan on Fred's. But for his insistence she would have taken no rest:\nher brightness was all bedimmed; unconscious of her costume which had\nalways been so fresh and gay, she was like a sick bird with languid eye\nand plumage ruffled, her senses dulled to the sights and sounds that\nused most to interest her.  Fred's delirium, in which he seemed to be\nwandering out of her reach, tore her heart.  After her first outburst\nagainst Mr. Wrench she went about very quietly: her one low cry was to\nLydgate.  She would follow him out of the room and put her hand on his\narm moaning out, \"Save my boy.\"  Once she pleaded, \"He has always been\ngood to me, Mr. Lydgate: he never had a hard word for his mother,\"--as\nif poor Fred's suffering were an accusation against him.  All the\ndeepest fibres of the mother's memory were stirred, and the young man\nwhose voice took a gentler tone when he spoke to her, was one with the\nbabe whom she had loved, with a love new to her, before he was born.\n\n\"I have good hope, Mrs. Vincy,\" Lydgate would say.  \"Come down with me\nand let us talk about the food.\"  In that way he led her to the parlor\nwhere Rosamond was, and made a change for her, surprising her into\ntaking some tea or broth which had been prepared for her.  There was a\nconstant understanding between him and Rosamond on these matters.  He\nalmost always saw her before going to the sickroom, and she appealed to\nhim as to what she could do for mamma.  Her presence of mind and\nadroitness in carrying out his hints were admirable, and it is not\nwonderful that the idea of seeing Rosamond began to mingle itself with\nhis interest in the case.  Especially when the critical stage was\npassed, and he began to feel confident of Fred's recovery.  In the more\ndoubtful time, he had advised calling in Dr. Sprague (who, if he could,\nwould rather have remained neutral on Wrench's account); but after two\nconsultations, the conduct of the case was left to Lydgate, and there\nwas every reason to make him assiduous.  Morning and evening he was at\nMr. Vincy's, and gradually the visits became cheerful as Fred became\nsimply feeble, and lay not only in need of the utmost petting but\nconscious of it, so that Mrs. Vincy felt as if, after all, the illness\nhad made a festival for her tenderness.\n\nBoth father and mother held it an added reason for good spirits, when\nold Mr. Featherstone sent messages by Lydgate, saying that Fred must\nmake haste and get well, as he, Peter Featherstone, could not do\nwithout him, and missed his visits sadly.  The old man himself was\ngetting bedridden.  Mrs. Vincy told these messages to Fred when he\ncould listen, and he turned towards her his delicate, pinched face,\nfrom which all the thick blond hair had been cut away, and in which the\neyes seemed to have got larger, yearning for some word about\nMary--wondering what she felt about his illness.  No word passed his\nlips; but \"to hear with eyes belongs to love's rare wit,\" and the\nmother in the fulness of her heart not only divined Fred's longing, but\nfelt ready for any sacrifice in order to satisfy him.\n\n\"If I can only see my boy strong again,\" she said, in her loving folly;\n\"and who knows?--perhaps master of Stone Court! and he can marry\nanybody he likes then.\"\n\n\"Not if they won't have me, mother,\" said Fred.  The illness had made\nhim childish, and tears came as he spoke.\n\n\"Oh, take a bit of jelly, my dear,\" said Mrs. Vincy, secretly\nincredulous of any such refusal.\n\nShe never left Fred's side when her husband was not in the house, and\nthus Rosamond was in the unusual position of being much alone.\nLydgate, naturally, never thought of staying long with her, yet it\nseemed that the brief impersonal conversations they had together were\ncreating that peculiar intimacy which consists in shyness.  They were\nobliged to look at each other in speaking, and somehow the looking\ncould not be carried through as the matter of course which it really\nwas.  Lydgate began to feel this sort of consciousness unpleasant and\none day looked down, or anywhere, like an ill-worked puppet.  But this\nturned out badly: the next day, Rosamond looked down, and the\nconsequence was that when their eyes met again, both were more\nconscious than before.  There was no help for this in science, and as\nLydgate did not want to flirt, there seemed to be no help for it in\nfolly.  It was therefore a relief when neighbors no longer considered\nthe house in quarantine, and when the chances of seeing Rosamond alone\nwere very much reduced.\n\nBut that intimacy of mutual embarrassment, in which each feels that the\nother is feeling something, having once existed, its effect is not to\nbe done away with.  Talk about the weather and other well-bred topics\nis apt to seem a hollow device, and behavior can hardly become easy\nunless it frankly recognizes a mutual fascination--which of course need\nnot mean anything deep or serious.  This was the way in which Rosamond\nand Lydgate slid gracefully into ease, and made their intercourse\nlively again.  Visitors came and went as usual, there was once more\nmusic in the drawing-room, and all the extra hospitality of Mr. Vincy's\nmayoralty returned.  Lydgate, whenever he could, took his seat by\nRosamond's side, and lingered to hear her music, calling himself her\ncaptive--meaning, all the while, not to be her captive.  The\npreposterousness of the notion that he could at once set up a\nsatisfactory establishment as a married man was a sufficient guarantee\nagainst danger.  This play at being a little in love was agreeable, and\ndid not interfere with graver pursuits.  Flirtation, after all, was not\nnecessarily a singeing process.  Rosamond, for her part, had never\nenjoyed the days so much in her life before: she was sure of being\nadmired by some one worth captivating, and she did not distinguish\nflirtation from love, either in herself or in another.  She seemed to\nbe sailing with a fair wind just whither she would go, and her thoughts\nwere much occupied with a handsome house in Lowick Gate which she hoped\nwould by-and-by be vacant.  She was quite determined, when she was\nmarried, to rid herself adroitly of all the visitors who were not\nagreeable to her at her father's; and she imagined the drawing-room in\nher favorite house with various styles of furniture.\n\nCertainly her thoughts were much occupied with Lydgate himself; he\nseemed to her almost perfect: if he had known his notes so that his\nenchantment under her music had been less like an emotional elephant's,\nand if he had been able to discriminate better the refinements of her\ntaste in dress, she could hardly have mentioned a deficiency in him.\nHow different he was from young Plymdale or Mr. Caius Larcher!  Those\nyoung men had not a notion of French, and could speak on no subject\nwith striking knowledge, except perhaps the dyeing and carrying trades,\nwhich of course they were ashamed to mention; they were Middlemarch\ngentry, elated with their silver-headed whips and satin stocks, but\nembarrassed in their manners, and timidly jocose: even Fred was above\nthem, having at least the accent and manner of a university man.\nWhereas Lydgate was always listened to, bore himself with the careless\npoliteness of conscious superiority, and seemed to have the right\nclothes on by a certain natural affinity, without ever having to think\nabout them.  Rosamond was proud when he entered the room, and when he\napproached her with a distinguishing smile, she had a delicious sense\nthat she was the object of enviable homage.  If Lydgate had been aware\nof all the pride he excited in that delicate bosom, he might have been\njust as well pleased as any other man, even the most densely ignorant\nof humoral pathology or fibrous tissue: he held it one of the prettiest\nattitudes of the feminine mind to adore a man's pre-eminence without\ntoo precise a knowledge of what it consisted in.  But Rosamond was not\none of those helpless girls who betray themselves unawares, and whose\nbehavior is awkwardly driven by their impulses, instead of being\nsteered by wary grace and propriety.  Do you imagine that her rapid\nforecast and rumination concerning house-furniture and society were\never discernible in her conversation, even with her mamma?  On the\ncontrary, she would have expressed the prettiest surprise and\ndisapprobation if she had heard that another young lady had been\ndetected in that immodest prematureness--indeed, would probably have\ndisbelieved in its possibility.  For Rosamond never showed any\nunbecoming knowledge, and was always that combination of correct\nsentiments, music, dancing, drawing, elegant note-writing, private\nalbum for extracted verse, and perfect blond loveliness, which made the\nirresistible woman for the doomed man of that date.  Think no unfair\nevil of her, pray: she had no wicked plots, nothing sordid or\nmercenary; in fact, she never thought of money except as something\nnecessary which other people would always provide.  She was not in the\nhabit of devising falsehoods, and if her statements were no direct clew\nto fact, why, they were not intended in that light--they were among\nher elegant accomplishments, intended to please.  Nature had inspired\nmany arts in finishing Mrs. Lemon's favorite pupil, who by general\nconsent (Fred's excepted) was a rare compound of beauty, cleverness,\nand amiability.\n\nLydgate found it more and more agreeable to be with her, and there was\nno constraint now, there was a delightful interchange of influence in\ntheir eyes, and what they said had that superfluity of meaning for\nthem, which is observable with some sense of flatness by a third\nperson; still they had no interviews or asides from which a third\nperson need have been excluded.  In fact, they flirted; and Lydgate was\nsecure in the belief that they did nothing else.  If a man could not\nlove and be wise, surely he could flirt and be wise at the same time?\nReally, the men in Middlemarch, except Mr. Farebrother, were great\nbores, and Lydgate did not care about commercial politics or cards:\nwhat was he to do for relaxation?  He was often invited to the\nBulstrodes'; but the girls there were hardly out of the schoolroom; and\nMrs. Bulstrode's _naive_ way of conciliating piety and worldliness, the\nnothingness of this life and the desirability of cut glass, the\nconsciousness at once of filthy rags and the best damask, was not a\nsufficient relief from the weight of her husband's invariable\nseriousness.  The Vincys' house, with all its faults, was the\npleasanter by contrast; besides, it nourished Rosamond--sweet to look\nat as a half-opened blush-rose, and adorned with accomplishments for\nthe refined amusement of man.\n\nBut he made some enemies, other than medical, by his success with Miss\nVincy.  One evening he came into the drawing-room rather late, when\nseveral other visitors were there.  The card-table had drawn off the\nelders, and Mr. Ned Plymdale (one of the good matches in Middlemarch,\nthough not one of its leading minds) was in tete-a-tete with Rosamond.\nHe had brought the last \"Keepsake,\" the gorgeous watered-silk\npublication which marked modern progress at that time; and he\nconsidered himself very fortunate that he could be the first to look\nover it with her, dwelling on the ladies and gentlemen with shiny\ncopper-plate cheeks and copper-plate smiles, and pointing to comic\nverses as capital and sentimental stories as interesting.  Rosamond was\ngracious, and Mr. Ned was satisfied that he had the very best thing in\nart and literature as a medium for \"paying addresses\"--the very thing\nto please a nice girl.  He had also reasons, deep rather than\nostensible, for being satisfied with his own appearance.  To\nsuperficial observers his chin had too vanishing an aspect, looking as\nif it were being gradually reabsorbed.  And it did indeed cause him\nsome difficulty about the fit of his satin stocks, for which chins were\nat that time useful.\n\n\"I think the Honorable Mrs. S. is something like you,\" said Mr. Ned.\nHe kept the book open at the bewitching portrait, and looked at it\nrather languishingly.\n\n\"Her back is very large; she seems to have sat for that,\" said\nRosamond, not meaning any satire, but thinking how red young Plymdale's\nhands were, and wondering why Lydgate did not come.  She went on with\nher tatting all the while.\n\n\"I did not say she was as beautiful as you are,\" said Mr. Ned,\nventuring to look from the portrait to its rival.\n\n\"I suspect you of being an adroit flatterer,\" said Rosamond, feeling\nsure that she should have to reject this young gentleman a second time.\n\nBut now Lydgate came in; the book was closed before he reached\nRosamond's corner, and as he took his seat with easy confidence on the\nother side of her, young Plymdale's jaw fell like a barometer towards\nthe cheerless side of change.  Rosamond enjoyed not only Lydgate's\npresence but its effect: she liked to excite jealousy.\n\n\"What a late comer you are!\" she said, as they shook hands.  \"Mamma had\ngiven you up a little while ago.  How do you find Fred?\"\n\n\"As usual; going on well, but slowly.  I want him to go away--to Stone\nCourt, for example.  But your mamma seems to have some objection.\"\n\n\"Poor fellow!\" said Rosamond, prettily.  \"You will see Fred so\nchanged,\" she added, turning to the other suitor; \"we have looked to\nMr. Lydgate as our guardian angel during this illness.\"\n\nMr. Ned smiled nervously, while Lydgate, drawing the \"Keepsake\" towards\nhim and opening it, gave a short scornful laugh and tossed up his\nchin, as if in wonderment at human folly.\n\n\"What are you laughing at so profanely?\" said Rosamond, with bland\nneutrality.\n\n\"I wonder which would turn out to be the silliest--the engravings or\nthe writing here,\" said Lydgate, in his most convinced tone, while he\nturned over the pages quickly, seeming to see all through the book in\nno time, and showing his large white hands to much advantage, as\nRosamond thought.  \"Do look at this bridegroom coming out of church:\ndid you ever see such a'sugared invention'--as the Elizabethans used\nto say?  Did any haberdasher ever look so smirking?  Yet I will answer\nfor it the story makes him one of the first gentlemen in the land.\"\n\n\"You are so severe, I am frightened at you,\" said Rosamond, keeping her\namusement duly moderate.  Poor young Plymdale had lingered with\nadmiration over this very engraving, and his spirit was stirred.\n\n\"There are a great many celebrated people writing in the 'Keepsake,' at\nall events,\" he said, in a tone at once piqued and timid.  \"This is the\nfirst time I have heard it called silly.\"\n\n\"I think I shall turn round on you and accuse you of being a Goth,\"\nsaid Rosamond, looking at Lydgate with a smile.  \"I suspect you know\nnothing about Lady Blessington and L. E. L.\" Rosamond herself was not\nwithout relish for these writers, but she did not readily commit\nherself by admiration, and was alive to the slightest hint that\nanything was not, according to Lydgate, in the very highest taste.\n\n\"But Sir Walter Scott--I suppose Mr. Lydgate knows him,\" said young\nPlymdale, a little cheered by this advantage.\n\n\"Oh, I read no literature now,\" said Lydgate, shutting the book, and\npushing it away.  \"I read so much when I was a lad, that I suppose it\nwill last me all my life.  I used to know Scott's poems by heart.\"\n\n\"I should like to know when you left off,\" said Rosamond, \"because then\nI might be sure that I knew something which you did not know.\"\n\n\"Mr. Lydgate would say that was not worth knowing,\" said Mr. Ned,\npurposely caustic.\n\n\"On the contrary,\" said Lydgate, showing no smart; but smiling with\nexasperating confidence at Rosamond.  \"It would be worth knowing by the\nfact that Miss Vincy could tell it me.\"\n\nYoung Plymdale soon went to look at the whist-playing, thinking that\nLydgate was one of the most conceited, unpleasant fellows it had ever\nbeen his ill-fortune to meet.\n\n\"How rash you are!\" said Rosamond, inwardly delighted.  \"Do you see\nthat you have given offence?\"\n\n\"What! is it Mr. Plymdale's book?  I am sorry.  I didn't think about\nit.\"\n\n\"I shall begin to admit what you said of yourself when you first came\nhere--that you are a bear, and want teaching by the birds.\"\n\n\"Well, there is a bird who can teach me what she will.  Don't I listen\nto her willingly?\"\n\nTo Rosamond it seemed as if she and Lydgate were as good as engaged.\nThat they were some time to be engaged had long been an idea in her\nmind; and ideas, we know, tend to a more solid kind of existence, the\nnecessary materials being at hand.  It is true, Lydgate had the\ncounter-idea of remaining unengaged; but this was a mere negative, a\nshadow cast by other resolves which themselves were capable of\nshrinking.  Circumstance was almost sure to be on the side of\nRosamond's idea, which had a shaping activity and looked through\nwatchful blue eyes, whereas Lydgate's lay blind and unconcerned as a\njelly-fish which gets melted without knowing it.\n\nThat evening when he went home, he looked at his phials to see how a\nprocess of maceration was going on, with undisturbed interest; and he\nwrote out his daily notes with as much precision as usual.  The\nreveries from which it was difficult for him to detach himself were\nideal constructions of something else than Rosamond's virtues, and the\nprimitive tissue was still his fair unknown.  Moreover, he was\nbeginning to feel some zest for the growing though half-suppressed feud\nbetween him and the other medical men, which was likely to become more\nmanifest, now that Bulstrode's method of managing the new hospital was\nabout to be declared; and there were various inspiriting signs that his\nnon-acceptance by some of Peacock's patients might be counterbalanced\nby the impression he had produced in other quarters.  Only a few days\nlater, when he had happened to overtake Rosamond on the Lowick road and\nhad got down from his horse to walk by her side until he had quite\nprotected her from a passing drove, he had been stopped by a servant on\nhorseback with a message calling him in to a house of some importance\nwhere Peacock had never attended; and it was the second instance of\nthis kind.  The servant was Sir James Chettam's, and the house was\nLowick Manor.\n\n\n\n    1st Gent.  All times are good to seek your wedded home\n                   Bringing a mutual delight.\n\n    2d Gent.                          Why, true.\n                   The calendar hath not an evil day\n                   For souls made one by love, and even death\n                   Were sweetness, if it came like rolling waves\n                   While they two clasped each other, and foresaw\n                   No life apart.\n\n\nMr. and Mrs. Casaubon, returning from their wedding journey, arrived at\nLowick Manor in the middle of January.  A light snow was falling as\nthey descended at the door, and in the morning, when Dorothea passed\nfrom her dressing-room avenue the blue-green boudoir that we know of,\nshe saw the long avenue of limes lifting their trunks from a white\nearth, and spreading white branches against the dun and motionless sky.\nThe distant flat shrank in uniform whiteness and low-hanging uniformity\nof cloud.  The very furniture in the room seemed to have shrunk since\nshe saw it before: the stag in the tapestry looked more like a ghost in\nhis ghostly blue-green world; the volumes of polite literature in the\nbookcase looked more like immovable imitations of books.  The bright\nfire of dry oak-boughs burning on the logs seemed an incongruous\nrenewal of life and glow--like the figure of Dorothea herself as she\nentered carrying the red-leather cases containing the cameos for Celia.\n\nShe was glowing from her morning toilet as only healthful youth can\nglow: there was gem-like brightness on her coiled hair and in her hazel\neyes; there was warm red life in her lips; her throat had a breathing\nwhiteness above the differing white of the fur which itself seemed to\nwind about her neck and cling down her blue-gray pelisse with a\ntenderness gathered from her own, a sentient commingled innocence which\nkept its loveliness against the crystalline purity of the outdoor snow.\nAs she laid the cameo-cases on the table in the bow-window, she\nunconsciously kept her hands on them, immediately absorbed in looking\nout on the still, white enclosure which made her visible world.\n\nMr. Casaubon, who had risen early complaining of palpitation, was in\nthe library giving audience to his curate Mr. Tucker.  By-and-by Celia\nwould come in her quality of bridesmaid as well as sister, and through\nthe next weeks there would be wedding visits received and given; all in\ncontinuance of that transitional life understood to correspond with the\nexcitement of bridal felicity, and keeping up the sense of busy\nineffectiveness, as of a dream which the dreamer begins to suspect.\nThe duties of her married life, contemplated as so great beforehand,\nseemed to be shrinking with the furniture and the white vapor-walled\nlandscape.  The clear heights where she expected to walk in full\ncommunion had become difficult to see even in her imagination; the\ndelicious repose of the soul on a complete superior had been shaken\ninto uneasy effort and alarmed with dim presentiment.  When would the\ndays begin of that active wifely devotion which was to strengthen her\nhusband's life and exalt her own?  Never perhaps, as she had\npreconceived them; but somehow--still somehow.  In this solemnly\npledged union of her life, duty would present itself in some new form\nof inspiration and give a new meaning to wifely love.\n\nMeanwhile there was the snow and the low arch of dun vapor--there was\nthe stifling oppression of that gentlewoman's world, where everything\nwas done for her and none asked for her aid--where the sense of\nconnection with a manifold pregnant existence had to be kept up\npainfully as an inward vision, instead of coming from without in claims\nthat would have shaped her energies.--  \"What shall I do?\"  \"Whatever you\nplease, my dear:\" that had been her brief history since she had left\noff learning morning lessons and practising silly rhythms on the hated\npiano.  Marriage, which was to bring guidance into worthy and\nimperative occupation, had not yet freed her from the gentlewoman's\noppressive liberty: it had not even filled her leisure with the\nruminant joy of unchecked tenderness.  Her blooming full-pulsed youth\nstood there in a moral imprisonment which made itself one with the\nchill, colorless, narrowed landscape, with the shrunken furniture, the\nnever-read books, and the ghostly stag in a pale fantastic world that\nseemed to be vanishing from the daylight.\n\nIn the first minutes when Dorothea looked out she felt nothing but the\ndreary oppression; then came a keen remembrance, and turning away from\nthe window she walked round the room.  The ideas and hopes which were\nliving in her mind when she first saw this room nearly three months\nbefore were present now only as memories: she judged them as we judge\ntransient and departed things.  All existence seemed to beat with a\nlower pulse than her own, and her religious faith was a solitary cry,\nthe struggle out of a nightmare in which every object was withering and\nshrinking away from her.  Each remembered thing in the room was\ndisenchanted, was deadened as an unlit transparency, till her wandering\ngaze came to the group of miniatures, and there at last she saw\nsomething which had gathered new breath and meaning: it was the\nminiature of Mr. Casaubon's aunt Julia, who had made the unfortunate\nmarriage--of Will Ladislaw's grandmother.  Dorothea could fancy that\nit was alive now--the delicate woman's face which yet had a headstrong\nlook, a peculiarity difficult to interpret.  Was it only her friends\nwho thought her marriage unfortunate? or did she herself find it out to\nbe a mistake, and taste the salt bitterness of her tears in the\nmerciful silence of the night?  What breadths of experience Dorothea\nseemed to have passed over since she first looked at this miniature!\nShe felt a new companionship with it, as if it had an ear for her and\ncould see how she was looking at it.  Here was a woman who had known\nsome difficulty about marriage.  Nay, the colors deepened, the lips and\nchin seemed to get larger, the hair and eyes seemed to be sending out\nlight, the face was masculine and beamed on her with that full gaze\nwhich tells her on whom it falls that she is too interesting for the\nslightest movement of her eyelid to pass unnoticed and uninterpreted.\nThe vivid presentation came like a pleasant glow to Dorothea: she felt\nherself smiling, and turning from the miniature sat down and looked up\nas if she were again talking to a figure in front of her.  But the\nsmile disappeared as she went on meditating, and at last she said\naloud--\n\n\"Oh, it was cruel to speak so!  How sad--how dreadful!\"\n\nShe rose quickly and went out of the room, hurrying along the corridor,\nwith the irresistible impulse to go and see her husband and inquire if\nshe could do anything for him.  Perhaps Mr. Tucker was gone and Mr.\nCasaubon was alone in the library.  She felt as if all her morning's\ngloom would vanish if she could see her husband glad because of her\npresence.\n\nBut when she reached the head of the dark oak there was Celia coming\nup, and below there was Mr. Brooke, exchanging welcomes and\ncongratulations with Mr. Casaubon.\n\n\"Dodo!\" said Celia, in her quiet staccato; then kissed her sister,\nwhose arms encircled her, and said no more.  I think they both cried a\nlittle in a furtive manner, while Dorothea ran down-stairs to greet her\nuncle.\n\n\"I need not ask how you are, my dear,\" said Mr. Brooke, after kissing\nher forehead.  \"Rome has agreed with you, I see--happiness, frescos,\nthe antique--that sort of thing.  Well, it's very pleasant to have you\nback again, and you understand all about art now, eh?  But Casaubon is\na little pale, I tell him--a little pale, you know.  Studying hard in\nhis holidays is carrying it rather too far.  I overdid it at one\ntime\"--Mr. Brooke still held Dorothea's hand, but had turned his face\nto Mr. Casaubon--\"about topography, ruins, temples--I thought I had a\nclew, but I saw it would carry me too far, and nothing might come of\nit.  You may go any length in that sort of thing, and nothing may come\nof it, you know.\"\n\nDorothea's eyes also were turned up to her husband's face with some\nanxiety at the idea that those who saw him afresh after absence might\nbe aware of signs which she had not noticed.\n\n\"Nothing to alarm you, my dear,\" said Mr. Brooke, observing her\nexpression.  \"A little English beef and mutton will soon make a\ndifference.  It was all very well to look pale, sitting for the\nportrait of Aquinas, you know--we got your letter just in time.  But\nAquinas, now--he was a little too subtle, wasn't he?  Does anybody read\nAquinas?\"\n\n\"He is not indeed an author adapted to superficial minds,\" said Mr.\nCasaubon, meeting these timely questions with dignified patience.\n\n\"You would like coffee in your own room, uncle?\" said Dorothea, coming\nto the rescue.\n\n\"Yes; and you must go to Celia: she has great news to tell you, you\nknow.  I leave it all to her.\"\n\nThe blue-green boudoir looked much more cheerful when Celia was seated\nthere in a pelisse exactly like her sister's, surveying the cameos with\na placid satisfaction, while the conversation passed on to other topics.\n\n\"Do you think it nice to go to Rome on a wedding journey?\" said Celia,\nwith her ready delicate blush which Dorothea was used to on the\nsmallest occasions.\n\n\"It would not suit all--not you, dear, for example,\" said Dorothea,\nquietly.  No one would ever know what she thought of a wedding journey\nto Rome.\n\n\"Mrs. Cadwallader says it is nonsense, people going a long journey when\nthey are married.  She says they get tired to death of each other, and\ncan't quarrel comfortably, as they would at home.  And Lady Chettam\nsays she went to Bath.\"  Celia's color changed again and again--seemed\n\n    \"To come and go with tidings from the heart,\n     As it a running messenger had been.\"\n\nIt must mean more than Celia's blushing usually did.\n\n\"Celia! has something happened?\" said Dorothea, in a tone full of\nsisterly feeling.  \"Have you really any great news to tell me?\"\n\n\"It was because you went away, Dodo.  Then there was nobody but me for\nSir James to talk to,\" said Celia, with a certain roguishness in her\neyes.\n\n\"I understand.  It is as I used to hope and believe,\" said Dorothea,\ntaking her sister's face between her hands, and looking at her half\nanxiously.  Celia's marriage seemed more serious than it used to do.\n\n\"It was only three days ago,\" said Celia.  \"And Lady Chettam is very\nkind.\"\n\n\"And you are very happy?\"\n\n\"Yes.  We are not going to be married yet.  Because every thing is to\nbe got ready.  And I don't want to be married so very soon, because I\nthink it is nice to be engaged.  And we shall be married all our lives\nafter.\"\n\n\"I do believe you could not marry better, Kitty.  Sir James is a good,\nhonorable man,\" said Dorothea, warmly.\n\n\"He has gone on with the cottages, Dodo.  He will tell you about them\nwhen he comes.  Shall you be glad to see him?\"\n\n\"Of course I shall.  How can you ask me?\"\n\n\"Only I was afraid you would be getting so learned,\" said Celia,\nregarding Mr. Casaubon's learning as a kind of damp which might in due\ntime saturate a neighboring body.\n\n\n\n    \"I found that no genius in another could please me.  My\n    unfortunate paradoxes had entirely dried up that source of\n    comfort.\"--GOLDSMITH.\n\n\nOne morning, some weeks after her arrival at Lowick, Dorothea--but why\nalways Dorothea?  Was her point of view the only possible one with\nregard to this marriage?  I protest against all our interest, all our\neffort at understanding being given to the young skins that look\nblooming in spite of trouble; for these too will get faded, and will\nknow the older and more eating griefs which we are helping to neglect.\nIn spite of the blinking eyes and white moles objectionable to Celia,\nand the want of muscular curve which was morally painful to Sir James,\nMr. Casaubon had an intense consciousness within him, and was\nspiritually a-hungered like the rest of us.  He had done nothing\nexceptional in marrying--nothing but what society sanctions, and\nconsiders an occasion for wreaths and bouquets.  It had occurred to him\nthat he must not any longer defer his intention of matrimony, and he\nhad reflected that in taking a wife, a man of good position should\nexpect and carefully choose a blooming young lady--the younger the\nbetter, because more educable and submissive--of a rank equal to his\nown, of religious principles, virtuous disposition, and good\nunderstanding.  On such a young lady he would make handsome\nsettlements, and he would neglect no arrangement for her happiness: in\nreturn, he should receive family pleasures and leave behind him that\ncopy of himself which seemed so urgently required of a man--to the\nsonneteers of the sixteenth century.  Times had altered since then, and\nno sonneteer had insisted on Mr. Casaubon's leaving a copy of himself;\nmoreover, he had not yet succeeded in issuing copies of his\nmythological key; but he had always intended to acquit himself by\nmarriage, and the sense that he was fast leaving the years behind him,\nthat the world was getting dimmer and that he felt lonely, was a reason\nto him for losing no more time in overtaking domestic delights before\nthey too were left behind by the years.\n\nAnd when he had seen Dorothea he believed that he had found even more\nthan he demanded: she might really be such a helpmate to him as would\nenable him to dispense with a hired secretary, an aid which Mr.\nCasaubon had never yet employed and had a suspicious dread of.  (Mr.\nCasaubon was nervously conscious that he was expected to manifest a\npowerful mind.)  Providence, in its kindness, had supplied him with the\nwife he needed.  A wife, a modest young lady, with the purely\nappreciative, unambitious abilities of her sex, is sure to think her\nhusband's mind powerful.  Whether Providence had taken equal care of\nMiss Brooke in presenting her with Mr. Casaubon was an idea which could\nhardly occur to him.  Society never made the preposterous demand that a\nman should think as much about his own qualifications for making a\ncharming girl happy as he thinks of hers for making himself happy.  As\nif a man could choose not only his wife but his wife's husband!  Or as\nif he were bound to provide charms for his posterity in his own\nperson!--  When Dorothea accepted him with effusion, that was only\nnatural; and Mr. Casaubon believed that his happiness was going to\nbegin.\n\nHe had not had much foretaste of happiness in his previous life.  To\nknow intense joy without a strong bodily frame, one must have an\nenthusiastic soul.  Mr. Casaubon had never had a strong bodily frame,\nand his soul was sensitive without being enthusiastic: it was too\nlanguid to thrill out of self-consciousness into passionate delight; it\nwent on fluttering in the swampy ground where it was hatched, thinking\nof its wings and never flying.  His experience was of that pitiable\nkind which shrinks from pity, and fears most of all that it should be\nknown: it was that proud narrow sensitiveness which has not mass enough\nto spare for transformation into sympathy, and quivers thread-like in\nsmall currents of self-preoccupation or at best of an egoistic\nscrupulosity.  And Mr. Casaubon had many scruples: he was capable of a\nsevere self-restraint; he was resolute in being a man of honor\naccording to the code; he would be unimpeachable by any recognized\nopinion.  In conduct these ends had been attained; but the difficulty\nof making his Key to all Mythologies unimpeachable weighed like lead\nupon his mind; and the pamphlets--or \"Parerga\" as he called them--by\nwhich he tested his public and deposited small monumental records of\nhis march, were far from having been seen in all their significance.\nHe suspected the Archdeacon of not having read them; he was in painful\ndoubt as to what was really thought of them by the leading minds of\nBrasenose, and bitterly convinced that his old acquaintance Carp had\nbeen the writer of that depreciatory recension which was kept locked in\na small drawer of Mr. Casaubon's desk, and also in a dark closet of his\nverbal memory.  These were heavy impressions to struggle against, and\nbrought that melancholy embitterment which is the consequence of all\nexcessive claim: even his religious faith wavered with his wavering\ntrust in his own authorship, and the consolations of the Christian hope\nin immortality seemed to lean on the immortality of the still unwritten\nKey to all Mythologies.  For my part I am very sorry for him.  It is an\nuneasy lot at best, to be what we call highly taught and yet not to\nenjoy: to be present at this great spectacle of life and never to be\nliberated from a small hungry shivering self--never to be fully\npossessed by the glory we behold, never to have our consciousness\nrapturously transformed into the vividness of a thought, the ardor of a\npassion, the energy of an action, but always to be scholarly and\nuninspired, ambitious and timid, scrupulous and dim-sighted. Becoming a\ndean or even a bishop would make little difference, I fear, to Mr.\nCasaubon's uneasiness.  Doubtless some ancient Greek has observed that\nbehind the big mask and the speaking-trumpet, there must always be our\npoor little eyes peeping as usual and our timorous lips more or less\nunder anxious control.\n\nTo this mental estate mapped out a quarter of a century before, to\nsensibilities thus fenced in, Mr. Casaubon had thought of annexing\nhappiness with a lovely young bride; but even before marriage, as we\nhave seen, he found himself under a new depression in the consciousness\nthat the new bliss was not blissful to him.  Inclination yearned back\nto its old, easier custom.  And the deeper he went in domesticity the\nmore did the sense of acquitting himself and acting with propriety\npredominate over any other satisfaction.  Marriage, like religion and\nerudition, nay, like authorship itself, was fated to become an outward\nrequirement, and Edward Casaubon was bent on fulfilling unimpeachably\nall requirements.  Even drawing Dorothea into use in his study,\naccording to his own intention before marriage, was an effort which he\nwas always tempted to defer, and but for her pleading insistence it\nmight never have begun.  But she had succeeded in making it a matter of\ncourse that she should take her place at an early hour in the library\nand have work either of reading aloud or copying assigned her.  The\nwork had been easier to define because Mr. Casaubon had adopted an\nimmediate intention: there was to be a new Parergon, a small monograph\non some lately traced indications concerning the Egyptian mysteries\nwhereby certain assertions of Warburton's could be corrected.\nReferences were extensive even here, but not altogether shoreless; and\nsentences were actually to be written in the shape wherein they would\nbe scanned by Brasenose and a less formidable posterity.  These minor\nmonumental productions were always exciting to Mr. Casaubon; digestion\nwas made difficult by the interference of citations, or by the rivalry\nof dialectical phrases ringing against each other in his brain.  And\nfrom the first there was to be a Latin dedication about which\neverything was uncertain except that it was not to be addressed to\nCarp: it was a poisonous regret to Mr. Casaubon that he had once\naddressed a dedication to Carp in which he had numbered that member of\nthe animal kingdom among the viros nullo aevo perituros, a mistake\nwhich would infallibly lay the dedicator open to ridicule in the next\nage, and might even be chuckled over by Pike and Tench in the present.\n\nThus Mr. Casaubon was in one of his busiest epochs, and as I began to\nsay a little while ago, Dorothea joined him early in the library where\nhe had breakfasted alone.  Celia at this time was on a second visit to\nLowick, probably the last before her marriage, and was in the\ndrawing-room expecting Sir James.\n\nDorothea had learned to read the signs of her husband's mood, and she\nsaw that the morning had become more foggy there during the last hour.\nShe was going silently to her desk when he said, in that distant tone\nwhich implied that he was discharging a disagreeable duty--\n\n\"Dorothea, here is a letter for you, which was enclosed in one\naddressed to me.\"\n\nIt was a letter of two pages, and she immediately looked at the\nsignature.\n\n\"Mr. Ladislaw!  What can he have to say to me?\" she exclaimed, in a\ntone of pleased surprise.  \"But,\" she added, looking at Mr. Casaubon,\n\"I can imagine what he has written to you about.\"\n\n\"You can, if you please, read the letter,\" said Mr. Casaubon, severely\npointing to it with his pen, and not looking at her.  \"But I may as\nwell say beforehand, that I must decline the proposal it contains to\npay a visit here.  I trust I may be excused for desiring an interval of\ncomplete freedom from such distractions as have been hitherto\ninevitable, and especially from guests whose desultory vivacity makes\ntheir presence a fatigue.\"\n\nThere had been no clashing of temper between Dorothea and her husband\nsince that little explosion in Rome, which had left such strong traces\nin her mind that it had been easier ever since to quell emotion than to\nincur the consequence of venting it.  But this ill-tempered\nanticipation that she could desire visits which might be disagreeable\nto her husband, this gratuitous defence of himself against selfish\ncomplaint on her part, was too sharp a sting to be meditated on until\nafter it had been resented.  Dorothea had thought that she could have\nbeen patient with John Milton, but she had never imagined him behaving\nin this way; and for a moment Mr. Casaubon seemed to be stupidly\nundiscerning and odiously unjust.  Pity, that \"new-born babe\" which was\nby-and-by to rule many a storm within her, did not \"stride the blast\"\non this occasion.  With her first words, uttered in a tone that shook\nhim, she startled Mr. Casaubon into looking at her, and meeting the\nflash of her eyes.\n\n\"Why do you attribute to me a wish for anything that would annoy you?\nYou speak to me as if I were something you had to contend against.\nWait at least till I appear to consult my own pleasure apart from\nyours.\"\n\n\"Dorothea, you are hasty,\" answered Mr. Casaubon, nervously.\n\nDecidedly, this woman was too young to be on the formidable level of\nwifehood--unless she had been pale and featureless and taken\neverything for granted.\n\n\"I think it was you who were first hasty in your false suppositions\nabout my feeling,\" said Dorothea, in the same tone.  The fire was not\ndissipated yet, and she thought it was ignoble in her husband not to\napologize to her.\n\n\"We will, if you please, say no more on this subject, Dorothea.  I have\nneither leisure nor energy for this kind of debate.\"\n\nHere Mr. Casaubon dipped his pen and made as if he would return to his\nwriting, though his hand trembled so much that the words seemed to be\nwritten in an unknown character.  There are answers which, in turning\naway wrath, only send it to the other end of the room, and to have a\ndiscussion coolly waived when you feel that justice is all on your own\nside is even more exasperating in marriage than in philosophy.\n\nDorothea left Ladislaw's two letters unread on her husband's\nwriting-table and went to her own place, the scorn and indignation\nwithin her rejecting the reading of these letters, just as we hurl away\nany trash towards which we seem to have been suspected of mean\ncupidity.  She did not in the least divine the subtle sources of her\nhusband's bad temper about these letters: she only knew that they had\ncaused him to offend her.  She began to work at once, and her hand did\nnot tremble; on the contrary, in writing out the quotations which had\nbeen given to her the day before, she felt that she was forming her\nletters beautifully, and it seemed to her that she saw the construction\nof the Latin she was copying, and which she was beginning to\nunderstand, more clearly than usual.  In her indignation there was a\nsense of superiority, but it went out for the present in firmness of\nstroke, and did not compress itself into an inward articulate voice\npronouncing the once \"affable archangel\" a poor creature.\n\nThere had been this apparent quiet for half an hour, and Dorothea had\nnot looked away from her own table, when she heard the loud bang of a\nbook on the floor, and turning quickly saw Mr. Casaubon on the library\nsteps clinging forward as if he were in some bodily distress.  She\nstarted up and bounded towards him in an instant: he was evidently in\ngreat straits for breath.  Jumping on a stool she got close to his\nelbow and said with her whole soul melted into tender alarm--\n\n\"Can you lean on me, dear?\"\n\nHe was still for two or three minutes, which seemed endless to her,\nunable to speak or move, gasping for breath.  When at last he descended\nthe three steps and fell backward in the large chair which Dorothea had\ndrawn close to the foot of the ladder, he no longer gasped but seemed\nhelpless and about to faint.  Dorothea rang the bell violently, and\npresently Mr. Casaubon was helped to the couch: he did not faint, and\nwas gradually reviving, when Sir James Chettam came in, having been met\nin the hall with the news that Mr. Casaubon had \"had a fit in the\nlibrary.\"\n\n\"Good God! this is just what might have been expected,\" was his\nimmediate thought.  If his prophetic soul had been urged to\nparticularize, it seemed to him that \"fits\" would have been the\ndefinite expression alighted upon.  He asked his informant, the butler,\nwhether the doctor had been sent for.  The butler never knew his master\nto want the doctor before; but would it not be right to send for a\nphysician?\n\nWhen Sir James entered the library, however, Mr. Casaubon could make\nsome signs of his usual politeness, and Dorothea, who in the reaction\nfrom her first terror had been kneeling and sobbing by his side now\nrose and herself proposed that some one should ride off for a medical\nman.\n\n\"I recommend you to send for Lydgate,\" said Sir James.  \"My mother has\ncalled him in, and she has found him uncommonly clever.  She has had a\npoor opinion of the physicians since my father's death.\"\n\nDorothea appealed to her husband, and he made a silent sign of\napproval.  So Mr. Lydgate was sent for and he came wonderfully soon,\nfor the messenger, who was Sir James Chettam's man and knew Mr.\nLydgate, met him leading his horse along the Lowick road and giving his\narm to Miss Vincy.\n\nCelia, in the drawing-room, had known nothing of the trouble till Sir\nJames told her of it.  After Dorothea's account, he no longer\nconsidered the illness a fit, but still something \"of that nature.\"\n\n\"Poor dear Dodo--how dreadful!\" said Celia, feeling as much grieved as\nher own perfect happiness would allow.  Her little hands were clasped,\nand enclosed by Sir James's as a bud is enfolded by a liberal calyx.\n\"It is very shocking that Mr. Casaubon should be ill; but I never did\nlike him.  And I think he is not half fond enough of Dorothea; and he\nought to be, for I am sure no one else would have had him--do you\nthink they would?\"\n\n\"I always thought it a horrible sacrifice of your sister,\" said Sir\nJames.\n\n\"Yes.  But poor Dodo never did do what other people do, and I think she\nnever will.\"\n\n\"She is a noble creature,\" said the loyal-hearted Sir James.  He had\njust had a fresh impression of this kind, as he had seen Dorothea\nstretching her tender arm under her husband's neck and looking at him\nwith unspeakable sorrow.  He did not know how much penitence there was\nin the sorrow.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Celia, thinking it was very well for Sir James to say so,\nbut _he_ would not have been comfortable with Dodo.  \"Shall I go to\nher?  Could I help her, do you think?\"\n\n\"I think it would be well for you just to go and see her before Lydgate\ncomes,\" said Sir James, magnanimously.  \"Only don't stay long.\"\n\nWhile Celia was gone he walked up and down remembering what he had\noriginally felt about Dorothea's engagement, and feeling a revival of\nhis disgust at Mr. Brooke's indifference.  If Cadwallader--if every\none else had regarded the affair as he, Sir James, had done, the\nmarriage might have been hindered.  It was wicked to let a young girl\nblindly decide her fate in that way, without any effort to save her.\nSir James had long ceased to have any regrets on his own account: his\nheart was satisfied with his engagement to Celia.  But he had a\nchivalrous nature (was not the disinterested service of woman among the\nideal glories of old chivalry?): his disregarded love had not turned to\nbitterness; its death had made sweet odors--floating memories that\nclung with a consecrating effect to Dorothea.  He could remain her\nbrotherly friend, interpreting her actions with generous trustfulness.\n\n\n\n    \"Qui veut delasser hors de propos, lasse.\"--PASCAL.\n\n\nMr. Casaubon had no second attack of equal severity with the first, and\nin a few days began to recover his usual condition.  But Lydgate seemed\nto think the case worth a great deal of attention.  He not only used\nhis stethoscope (which had not become a matter of course in practice at\nthat time), but sat quietly by his patient and watched him.  To Mr.\nCasaubon's questions about himself, he replied that the source of the\nillness was the common error of intellectual men--a too eager and\nmonotonous application: the remedy was, to be satisfied with moderate\nwork, and to seek variety of relaxation.  Mr. Brooke, who sat by on one\noccasion, suggested that Mr. Casaubon should go fishing, as Cadwallader\ndid, and have a turning-room, make toys, table-legs, and that kind of\nthing.\n\n\"In short, you recommend me to anticipate the arrival of my second\nchildhood,\" said poor Mr. Casaubon, with some bitterness.  \"These\nthings,\" he added, looking at Lydgate, \"would be to me such relaxation\nas tow-picking is to prisoners in a house of correction.\"\n\n\"I confess,\" said Lydgate, smiling, \"amusement is rather an\nunsatisfactory prescription.  It is something like telling people to\nkeep up their spirits.  Perhaps I had better say, that you must submit\nto be mildly bored rather than to go on working.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" said Mr. Brooke.  \"Get Dorothea to play backgammon with you\nin the evenings.  And shuttlecock, now--I don't know a finer game than\nshuttlecock for the daytime.  I remember it all the fashion.  To be\nsure, your eyes might not stand that, Casaubon.  But you must unbend,\nyou know.  Why, you might take to some light study: conchology, now: I\nalways think that must be a light study.  Or get Dorothea to read you\nlight things, Smollett--'Roderick Random,' 'Humphrey Clinker:'  they\nare a little broad, but she may read anything now she's married, you\nknow.  I remember they made me laugh uncommonly--there's a droll bit\nabout a postilion's breeches.  We have no such humor now.  I have gone\nthrough all these things, but they might be rather new to you.\"\n\n\"As new as eating thistles,\" would have been an answer to represent Mr.\nCasaubon's feelings.  But he only bowed resignedly, with due respect to\nhis wife's uncle, and observed that doubtless the works he mentioned\nhad \"served as a resource to a certain order of minds.\"\n\n\"You see,\" said the able magistrate to Lydgate, when they were outside\nthe door, \"Casaubon has been a little narrow: it leaves him rather at a\nloss when you forbid him his particular work, which I believe is\nsomething very deep indeed--in the line of research, you know.  I would\nnever give way to that; I was always versatile.  But a clergyman is\ntied a little tight.  If they would make him a bishop, now!--he did a\nvery good pamphlet for Peel.  He would have more movement then, more\nshow; he might get a little flesh.  But I recommend you to talk to Mrs.\nCasaubon.  She is clever enough for anything, is my niece.  Tell her,\nher husband wants liveliness, diversion: put her on amusing tactics.\"\n\nWithout Mr. Brooke's advice, Lydgate had determined on speaking to\nDorothea.  She had not been present while her uncle was throwing out\nhis pleasant suggestions as to the mode in which life at Lowick might\nbe enlivened, but she was usually by her husband's side, and the\nunaffected signs of intense anxiety in her face and voice about\nwhatever touched his mind or health, made a drama which Lydgate was\ninclined to watch.  He said to himself that he was only doing right in\ntelling her the truth about her husband's probable future, but he\ncertainly thought also that it would be interesting to talk\nconfidentially with her.  A medical man likes to make psychological\nobservations, and sometimes in the pursuit of such studies is too\neasily tempted into momentous prophecy which life and death easily set\nat nought.  Lydgate had often been satirical on this gratuitous\nprediction, and he meant now to be guarded.\n\nHe asked for Mrs. Casaubon, but being told that she was out walking, he\nwas going away, when Dorothea and Celia appeared, both glowing from\ntheir struggle with the March wind.  When Lydgate begged to speak with\nher alone, Dorothea opened the library door which happened to be the\nnearest, thinking of nothing at the moment but what he might have to\nsay about Mr. Casaubon.  It was the first time she had entered this\nroom since her husband had been taken ill, and the servant had chosen\nnot to open the shutters.  But there was light enough to read by from\nthe narrow upper panes of the windows.\n\n\"You will not mind this sombre light,\" said Dorothea, standing in the\nmiddle of the room.  \"Since you forbade books, the library has been out\nof the question.  But Mr. Casaubon will soon be here again, I hope.  Is\nhe not making progress?\"\n\n\"Yes, much more rapid progress than I at first expected.  Indeed, he is\nalready nearly in his usual state of health.\"\n\n\"You do not fear that the illness will return?\" said Dorothea, whose\nquick ear had detected some significance in Lydgate's tone.\n\n\"Such cases are peculiarly difficult to pronounce upon,\" said Lydgate.\n\"The only point on which I can be confident is that it will be\ndesirable to be very watchful on Mr. Casaubon's account, lest he should\nin any way strain his nervous power.\"\n\n\"I beseech you to speak quite plainly,\" said Dorothea, in an imploring\ntone.  \"I cannot bear to think that there might be something which I\ndid not know, and which, if I had known it, would have made me act\ndifferently.\"  The words came out like a cry: it was evident that they\nwere the voice of some mental experience which lay not very far off.\n\n\"Sit down,\" she added, placing herself on the nearest chair, and\nthrowing off her bonnet and gloves, with an instinctive discarding of\nformality where a great question of destiny was concerned.\n\n\"What you say now justifies my own view,\" said Lydgate.  \"I think it is\none's function as a medical man to hinder regrets of that sort as far\nas possible.  But I beg you to observe that Mr. Casaubon's case is\nprecisely of the kind in which the issue is most difficult to pronounce\nupon.  He may possibly live for fifteen years or more, without much\nworse health than he has had hitherto.\"\n\nDorothea had turned very pale, and when Lydgate paused she said in a\nlow voice, \"You mean if we are very careful.\"\n\n\"Yes--careful against mental agitation of all kinds, and against\nexcessive application.\"\n\n\"He would be miserable, if he had to give up his work,\" said Dorothea,\nwith a quick prevision of that wretchedness.\n\n\"I am aware of that.  The only course is to try by all means, direct\nand indirect, to moderate and vary his occupations.  With a happy\nconcurrence of circumstances, there is, as I said, no immediate danger\nfrom that affection of the heart, which I believe to have been the\ncause of his late attack.  On the other hand, it is possible that the\ndisease may develop itself more rapidly: it is one of those cases in\nwhich death is sometimes sudden.  Nothing should be neglected which\nmight be affected by such an issue.\"\n\nThere was silence for a few moments, while Dorothea sat as if she had\nbeen turned to marble, though the life within her was so intense that\nher mind had never before swept in brief time over an equal range of\nscenes and motives.\n\n\"Help me, pray,\" she said, at last, in the same low voice as before.\n\"Tell me what I can do.\"\n\n\"What do you think of foreign travel?  You have been lately in Rome, I\nthink.\"\n\nThe memories which made this resource utterly hopeless were a new\ncurrent that shook Dorothea out of her pallid immobility.\n\n\"Oh, that would not do--that would be worse than anything,\" she said\nwith a more childlike despondency, while the tears rolled down.\n\"Nothing will be of any use that he does not enjoy.\"\n\n\"I wish that I could have spared you this pain,\" said Lydgate, deeply\ntouched, yet wondering about her marriage.  Women just like Dorothea\nhad not entered into his traditions.\n\n\"It was right of you to tell me.\n\n### Summary:"}
{"original_length": 17764, "trunc_length": 16384, "text": "\n\nSummarize the following text into a summary of less than 800 words.\n### Text:\n\n\n    \"How happy is he born and taught\n     That serveth not another's will;\n     Whose armor is his honest thought,\n     And simple truth his only skill!\n       .  .  .  .  .  .  .\n     This man is freed from servile bands\n     Of hope to rise or fear to fall;\n     Lord of himself though not of lands;\n     And having nothing yet hath all.\"\n                             --SIR HENRY WOTTON.\n\n\nDorothea's confidence in Caleb Garth's knowledge, which had begun on\nher hearing that he approved of her cottages, had grown fast during her\nstay at Freshitt, Sir James having induced her to take rides over the\ntwo estates in company with himself and Caleb, who quite returned her\nadmiration, and told his wife that Mrs. Casaubon had a head for\nbusiness most uncommon in a woman.  It must be remembered that by\n\"business\" Caleb never meant money transactions, but the skilful\napplication of labor.\n\n\"Most uncommon!\" repeated Caleb.  \"She said a thing I often used to\nthink myself when I was a lad:--'Mr. Garth, I should like to feel, if I\nlived to be old, that I had improved a great piece of land and built a\ngreat many good cottages, because the work is of a healthy kind while\nit is being done, and after it is done, men are the better for it.'\nThose were the very words: she sees into things in that way.\"\n\n\"But womanly, I hope,\" said Mrs. Garth, half suspecting that Mrs.\nCasaubon might not hold the true principle of subordination.\n\n\"Oh, you can't think!\" said Caleb, shaking his head.  \"You would like\nto hear her speak, Susan.  She speaks in such plain words, and a voice\nlike music.  Bless me! it reminds me of bits in the 'Messiah'--'and\nstraightway there appeared a multitude of the heavenly host, praising\nGod and saying;' it has a tone with it that satisfies your ear.\"\n\nCaleb was very fond of music, and when he could afford it went to hear\nan oratorio that came within his reach, returning from it with a\nprofound reverence for this mighty structure of tones, which made him\nsit meditatively, looking on the floor and throwing much unutterable\nlanguage into his outstretched hands.\n\nWith this good understanding between them, it was natural that Dorothea\nasked Mr. Garth to undertake any business connected with the three\nfarms and the numerous tenements attached to Lowick Manor; indeed, his\nexpectation of getting work for two was being fast fulfilled.  As he\nsaid, \"Business breeds.\"  And one form of business which was beginning\nto breed just then was the construction of railways.  A projected line\nwas to run through Lowick parish where the cattle had hitherto grazed\nin a peace unbroken by astonishment; and thus it happened that the\ninfant struggles of the railway system entered into the affairs of\nCaleb Garth, and determined the course of this history with regard to\ntwo persons who were dear to him.  The submarine railway may have its\ndifficulties; but the bed of the sea is not divided among various\nlanded proprietors with claims for damages not only measurable but\nsentimental.  In the hundred to which Middlemarch belonged railways\nwere as exciting a topic as the Reform Bill or the imminent horrors of\nCholera, and those who held the most decided views on the subject were\nwomen and landholders.  Women both old and young regarded travelling by\nsteam as presumptuous and dangerous, and argued against it by saying\nthat nothing should induce them to get into a railway carriage; while\nproprietors, differing from each other in their arguments as much as\nMr. Solomon Featherstone differed from Lord Medlicote, were yet\nunanimous in the opinion that in selling land, whether to the Enemy of\nmankind or to a company obliged to purchase, these pernicious agencies\nmust be made to pay a very high price to landowners for permission to\ninjure mankind.\n\nBut the slower wits, such as Mr. Solomon and Mrs. Waule, who both\noccupied land of their own, took a long time to arrive at this\nconclusion, their minds halting at the vivid conception of what it\nwould be to cut the Big Pasture in two, and turn it into three-cornered\nbits, which would be \"nohow;\" while accommodation-bridges and high\npayments were remote and incredible.\n\n\"The cows will all cast their calves, brother,\" said Mrs. Waule, in a\ntone of deep melancholy, \"if the railway comes across the Near Close;\nand I shouldn't wonder at the mare too, if she was in foal.  It's a\npoor tale if a widow's property is to be spaded away, and the law say\nnothing to it.  What's to hinder 'em from cutting right and left if\nthey begin?  It's well known, _I_ can't fight.\"\n\n\"The best way would be to say nothing, and set somebody on to send 'em\naway with a flea in their ear, when they came spying and measuring,\"\nsaid Solomon.  \"Folks did that about Brassing, by what I can\nunderstand.  It's all a pretence, if the truth was known, about their\nbeing forced to take one way.  Let 'em go cutting in another parish.\nAnd I don't believe in any pay to make amends for bringing a lot of\nruffians to trample your crops.  Where's a company's pocket?\"\n\n\"Brother Peter, God forgive him, got money out of a company,\" said Mrs.\nWaule.  \"But that was for the manganese.  That wasn't for railways to\nblow you to pieces right and left.\"\n\n\"Well, there's this to be said, Jane,\" Mr. Solomon concluded, lowering\nhis voice in a cautious manner--\"the more spokes we put in their wheel,\nthe more they'll pay us to let 'em go on, if they must come whether or\nnot.\"\n\nThis reasoning of Mr. Solomon's was perhaps less thorough than he\nimagined, his cunning bearing about the same relation to the course of\nrailways as the cunning of a diplomatist bears to the general chill or\ncatarrh of the solar system.  But he set about acting on his views in a\nthoroughly diplomatic manner, by stimulating suspicion.  His side of\nLowick was the most remote from the village, and the houses of the\nlaboring people were either lone cottages or were collected in a hamlet\ncalled Frick, where a water-mill and some stone-pits made a little\ncentre of slow, heavy-shouldered industry.\n\nIn the absence of any precise idea as to what railways were, public\nopinion in Frick was against them; for the human mind in that grassy\ncorner had not the proverbial tendency to admire the unknown, holding\nrather that it was likely to be against the poor man, and that\nsuspicion was the only wise attitude with regard to it.  Even the rumor\nof Reform had not yet excited any millennial expectations in Frick,\nthere being no definite promise in it, as of gratuitous grains to\nfatten Hiram Ford's pig, or of a publican at the \"Weights and Scales\"\nwho would brew beer for nothing, or of an offer on the part of the\nthree neighboring farmers to raise wages during winter.  And without\ndistinct good of this kind in its promises, Reform seemed on a footing\nwith the bragging of pedlers, which was a hint for distrust to every\nknowing person.  The men of Frick were not ill-fed, and were less given\nto fanaticism than to a strong muscular suspicion; less inclined to\nbelieve that they were peculiarly cared for by heaven, than to regard\nheaven itself as rather disposed to take them in--a disposition\nobservable in the weather.\n\nThus the mind of Frick was exactly of the sort for Mr. Solomon\nFeatherstone to work upon, he having more plenteous ideas of the same\norder, with a suspicion of heaven and earth which was better fed and\nmore entirely at leisure.  Solomon was overseer of the roads at that\ntime, and on his slow-paced cob often took his rounds by Frick to look\nat the workmen getting the stones there, pausing with a mysterious\ndeliberation, which might have misled you into supposing that he had\nsome other reason for staying than the mere want of impulse to move.\nAfter looking for a long while at any work that was going on, he would\nraise his eyes a little and look at the horizon; finally he would shake\nhis bridle, touch his horse with the whip, and get it to move slowly\nonward.  The hour-hand of a clock was quick by comparison with Mr.\nSolomon, who had an agreeable sense that he could afford to be slow.\nHe was in the habit of pausing for a cautious, vaguely designing chat\nwith every hedger or ditcher on his way, and was especially willing to\nlisten even to news which he had heard before, feeling himself at an\nadvantage over all narrators in partially disbelieving them.  One day,\nhowever, he got into a dialogue with Hiram Ford, a wagoner, in which he\nhimself contributed information.  He wished to know whether Hiram had\nseen fellows with staves and instruments spying about: they called\nthemselves railroad people, but there was no telling what they were or\nwhat they meant to do.  The least they pretended was that they were\ngoing to cut Lowick Parish into sixes and sevens.\n\n\"Why, there'll be no stirrin' from one pla-ace to another,\" said Hiram,\nthinking of his wagon and horses.\n\n\"Not a bit,\" said Mr. Solomon.  \"And cutting up fine land such as this\nparish!  Let 'em go into Tipton, say I. But there's no knowing what\nthere is at the bottom of it.  Traffic is what they put for'ard; but\nit's to do harm to the land and the poor man in the long-run.\"\n\n\"Why, they're Lunnon chaps, I reckon,\" said Hiram, who had a dim notion\nof London as a centre of hostility to the country.\n\n\"Ay, to be sure.  And in some parts against Brassing, by what I've\nheard say, the folks fell on 'em when they were spying, and broke their\npeep-holes as they carry, and drove 'em away, so as they knew better\nthan come again.\"\n\n\"It war good foon, I'd be bound,\" said Hiram, whose fun was much\nrestricted by circumstances.\n\n\"Well, I wouldn't meddle with 'em myself,\" said Solomon.  \"But some say\nthis country's seen its best days, and the sign is, as it's being\noverrun with these fellows trampling right and left, and wanting to cut\nit up into railways; and all for the big traffic to swallow up the\nlittle, so as there shan't be a team left on the land, nor a whip to\ncrack.\"\n\n\"I'll crack _my_ whip about their ear'n, afore they bring it to that,\nthough,\" said Hiram, while Mr. Solomon, shaking his bridle, moved\nonward.\n\nNettle-seed needs no digging.  The ruin of this countryside by\nrailroads was discussed, not only at the \"Weights and Scales,\" but in\nthe hay-field, where the muster of working hands gave opportunities for\ntalk such as were rarely had through the rural year.\n\nOne morning, not long after that interview between Mr. Farebrother and\nMary Garth, in which she confessed to him her feeling for Fred Vincy,\nit happened that her father had some business which took him to\nYoddrell's farm in the direction of Frick: it was to measure and value\nan outlying piece of land belonging to Lowick Manor, which Caleb\nexpected to dispose of advantageously for Dorothea (it must be\nconfessed that his bias was towards getting the best possible terms\nfrom railroad companies). He put up his gig at Yoddrell's, and in\nwalking with his assistant and measuring-chain to the scene of his\nwork, he encountered the party of the company's agents, who were\nadjusting their spirit-level. After a little chat he left them,\nobserving that by-and-by they would reach him again where he was going\nto measure.  It was one of those gray mornings after light rains, which\nbecome delicious about twelve o'clock, when the clouds part a little,\nand the scent of the earth is sweet along the lanes and by the\nhedgerows.\n\nThe scent would have been sweeter to Fred Vincy, who was coming along\nthe lanes on horseback, if his mind had not been worried by\nunsuccessful efforts to imagine what he was to do, with his father on\none side expecting him straightway to enter the Church, with Mary on\nthe other threatening to forsake him if he did enter it, and with the\nworking-day world showing no eager need whatever of a young gentleman\nwithout capital and generally unskilled.  It was the harder to Fred's\ndisposition because his father, satisfied that he was no longer\nrebellious, was in good humor with him, and had sent him on this\npleasant ride to see after some greyhounds.  Even when he had fixed on\nwhat he should do, there would be the task of telling his father.  But\nit must be admitted that the fixing, which had to come first, was the\nmore difficult task:--what secular avocation on earth was there for a\nyoung man (whose friends could not get him an \"appointment\") which was\nat once gentlemanly, lucrative, and to be followed without special\nknowledge?  Riding along the lanes by Frick in this mood, and\nslackening his pace while he reflected whether he should venture to go\nround by Lowick Parsonage to call on Mary, he could see over the hedges\nfrom one field to another.  Suddenly a noise roused his attention, and\non the far side of a field on his left hand he could see six or seven\nmen in smock-frocks with hay-forks in their hands making an offensive\napproach towards the four railway agents who were facing them, while\nCaleb Garth and his assistant were hastening across the field to join\nthe threatened group.  Fred, delayed a few moments by having to find\nthe gate, could not gallop up to the spot before the party in\nsmock-frocks, whose work of turning the hay had not been too pressing\nafter swallowing their mid-day beer, were driving the men in coats\nbefore them with their hay-forks; while Caleb Garth's assistant, a lad\nof seventeen, who had snatched up the spirit-level at Caleb's order,\nhad been knocked down and seemed to be lying helpless.  The coated men\nhad the advantage as runners, and Fred covered their retreat by getting\nin front of the smock-frocks and charging them suddenly enough to throw\ntheir chase into confusion.  \"What do you confounded fools mean?\"\nshouted Fred, pursuing the divided group in a zigzag, and cutting right\nand left with his whip.  \"I'll swear to every one of you before the\nmagistrate.  You've knocked the lad down and killed him, for what I\nknow.  You'll every one of you be hanged at the next assizes, if you\ndon't mind,\" said Fred, who afterwards laughed heartily as he\nremembered his own phrases.\n\nThe laborers had been driven through the gate-way into their hay-field,\nand Fred had checked his horse, when Hiram Ford, observing himself at a\nsafe challenging distance, turned back and shouted a defiance which he\ndid not know to be Homeric.\n\n\"Yo're a coward, yo are.  Yo git off your horse, young measter, and\nI'll have a round wi' ye, I wull.  Yo daredn't come on wi'out your hoss\nan' whip.  I'd soon knock the breath out on ye, I would.\"\n\n\"Wait a minute, and I'll come back presently, and have a round with you\nall in turn, if you like,\" said Fred, who felt confidence in his power\nof boxing with his dearly beloved brethren.  But just now he wanted to\nhasten back to Caleb and the prostrate youth.\n\nThe lad's ankle was strained, and he was in much pain from it, but he\nwas no further hurt, and Fred placed him on the horse that he might\nride to Yoddrell's and be taken care of there.\n\n\"Let them put the horse in the stable, and tell the surveyors they can\ncome back for their traps,\" said Fred.  \"The ground is clear now.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" said Caleb, \"here's a breakage.  They'll have to give up for\nto-day, and it will be as well.  Here, take the things before you on\nthe horse, Tom.  They'll see you coming, and they'll turn back.\"\n\n\"I'm glad I happened to be here at the right moment, Mr. Garth,\" said\nFred, as Tom rode away.  \"No knowing what might have happened if the\ncavalry had not come up in time.\"\n\n\"Ay, ay, it was lucky,\" said Caleb, speaking rather absently, and\nlooking towards the spot where he had been at work at the moment of\ninterruption.  \"But--deuce take it--this is what comes of men being\nfools--I'm hindered of my day's work.  I can't get along without\nsomebody to help me with the measuring-chain. However!\" He was\nbeginning to move towards the spot with a look of vexation, as if he\nhad forgotten Fred's presence, but suddenly he turned round and said\nquickly, \"What have you got to do to-day, young fellow?\"\n\n\"Nothing, Mr. Garth.  I'll help you with pleasure--can I?\" said Fred,\nwith a sense that he should be courting Mary when he was helping her\nfather.\n\n\"Well, you mustn't mind stooping and getting hot.\"\n\n\"I don't mind anything.  Only I want to go first and have a round with\nthat hulky fellow who turned to challenge me.  It would be a good\nlesson for him.  I shall not be five minutes.\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" said Caleb, with his most peremptory intonation.  \"I shall\ngo and speak to the men myself.  It's all ignorance.  Somebody has been\ntelling them lies.  The poor fools don't know any better.\"\n\n\"I shall go with you, then,\" said Fred.\n\n\"No, no; stay where you are.  I don't want your young blood.  I can\ntake care of myself.\"\n\nCaleb was a powerful man and knew little of any fear except the fear of\nhurting others and the fear of having to speechify.  But he felt it his\nduty at this moment to try and give a little harangue.  There was a\nstriking mixture in him--which came from his having always been a\nhard-working man himself--of rigorous notions about workmen and\npractical indulgence towards them.  To do a good day's work and to do\nit well, he held to be part of their welfare, as it was the chief part\nof his own happiness; but he had a strong sense of fellowship with\nthem.  When he advanced towards the laborers they had not gone to work\nagain, but were standing in that form of rural grouping which consists\nin each turning a shoulder towards the other, at a distance of two or\nthree yards.  They looked rather sulkily at Caleb, who walked quickly\nwith one hand in his pocket and the other thrust between the buttons of\nhis waistcoat, and had his every-day mild air when he paused among them.\n\n\"Why, my lads, how's this?\" he began, taking as usual to brief phrases,\nwhich seemed pregnant to himself, because he had many thoughts lying\nunder them, like the abundant roots of a plant that just manages to\npeep above the water.  \"How came you to make such a mistake as this?\nSomebody has been telling you lies.  You thought those men up there\nwanted to do mischief.\"\n\n\"Aw!\" was the answer, dropped at intervals by each according to his\ndegree of unreadiness.\n\n\"Nonsense!  No such thing!  They're looking out to see which way the\nrailroad is to take.  Now, my lads, you can't hinder the railroad: it\nwill be made whether you like it or not.  And if you go fighting\nagainst it, you'll get yourselves into trouble.  The law gives those\nmen leave to come here on the land.  The owner has nothing to say\nagainst it, and if you meddle with them you'll have to do with the\nconstable and Justice Blakesley, and with the handcuffs and Middlemarch\njail.  And you might be in for it now, if anybody informed against you.\"\n\nCaleb paused here, and perhaps the greatest orator could not have\nchosen either his pause or his images better for the occasion.\n\n\"But come, you didn't mean any harm.  Somebody told you the railroad\nwas a bad thing.  That was a lie.  It may do a bit of harm here and\nthere, to this and to that; and so does the sun in heaven.  But the\nrailway's a good thing.\"\n\n\"Aw! good for the big folks to make money out on,\" said old Timothy\nCooper, who had stayed behind turning his hay while the others had been\ngone on their spree;--\"I'n seen lots o' things turn up sin' I war a\nyoung un--the war an' the peace, and the canells, an' the oald King\nGeorge, an' the Regen', an' the new King George, an' the new un as has\ngot a new ne-ame--an' it's been all aloike to the poor mon.  What's the\ncanells been t' him?  They'n brought him neyther me-at nor be-acon, nor\nwage to lay by, if he didn't save it wi' clemmin' his own inside.\nTimes ha' got wusser for him sin' I war a young un.  An' so it'll be\nwi' the railroads.  They'll on'y leave the poor mon furder behind.  But\nthem are fools as meddle, and so I told the chaps here.  This is the\nbig folks's world, this is.  But yo're for the big folks, Muster Garth,\nyo are.\"\n\nTimothy was a wiry old laborer, of a type lingering in those times--who\nhad his savings in a stocking-foot, lived in a lone cottage, and was\nnot to be wrought on by any oratory, having as little of the feudal\nspirit, and believing as little, as if he had not been totally\nunacquainted with the Age of Reason and the Rights of Man.  Caleb was\nin a difficulty known to any person attempting in dark times and\nunassisted by miracle to reason with rustics who are in possession of\nan undeniable truth which they know through a hard process of feeling,\nand can let it fall like a giant's club on your neatly carved argument\nfor a social benefit which they do not feel.  Caleb had no cant at\ncommand, even if he could have chosen to use it; and he had been\naccustomed to meet all such difficulties in no other way than by doing\nhis \"business\" faithfully.  He answered--\n\n\"If you don't think well of me, Tim, never mind; that's neither here\nnor there now.  Things may be bad for the poor man--bad they are; but I\nwant the lads here not to do what will make things worse for\nthemselves.  The cattle may have a heavy load, but it won't help 'em to\nthrow it over into the roadside pit, when it's partly their own fodder.\"\n\n\"We war on'y for a bit o' foon,\" said Hiram, who was beginning to see\nconsequences.  \"That war all we war arter.\"\n\n\"Well, promise me not to meddle again, and I'll see that nobody informs\nagainst you.\"\n\n\"I'n ne'er meddled, an' I'n no call to promise,\" said Timothy.\n\n\"No, but the rest.  Come, I'm as hard at work as any of you to-day, and\nI can't spare much time.  Say you'll be quiet without the constable.\"\n\n\"Aw, we wooant meddle--they may do as they loike for oos\"--were the\nforms in which Caleb got his pledges; and then he hastened back to\nFred, who had followed him, and watched him in the gateway.\n\nThey went to work, and Fred helped vigorously.  His spirits had risen,\nand he heartily enjoyed a good slip in the moist earth under the\nhedgerow, which soiled his perfect summer trousers.  Was it his\nsuccessful onset which had elated him, or the satisfaction of helping\nMary's father?  Something more.  The accidents of the morning had\nhelped his frustrated imagination to shape an employment for himself\nwhich had several attractions.  I am not sure that certain fibres in\nMr. Garth's mind had not resumed their old vibration towards the very\nend which now revealed itself to Fred.  For the effective accident is\nbut the touch of fire where there is oil and tow; and it always\nappeared to Fred that the railway brought the needed touch.  But they\nwent on in silence except when their business demanded speech.  At\nlast, when they had finished and were walking away, Mr. Garth said--\n\n\"A young fellow needn't be a B. A. to do this sort of work, eh, Fred?\"\n\n\"I wish I had taken to it before I had thought of being a B. A.,\" said\nFred.  He paused a moment, and then added, more hesitatingly, \"Do you\nthink I am too old to learn your business, Mr. Garth?\"\n\n\"My business is of many sorts, my boy,\" said Mr. Garth, smiling.  \"A\ngood deal of what I know can only come from experience: you can't learn\nit off as you learn things out of a book.  But you are young enough to\nlay a foundation yet.\"  Caleb pronounced the last sentence\nemphatically, but paused in some uncertainty.  He had been under the\nimpression lately that Fred had made up his mind to enter the Church.\n\n\"You do think I could do some good at it, if I were to try?\" said Fred,\nmore eagerly.\n\n\"That depends,\" said Caleb, turning his head on one side and lowering\nhis voice, with the air of a man who felt himself to be saying\nsomething deeply religious.  \"You must be sure of two things: you must\nlove your work, and not be always looking over the edge of it, wanting\nyour play to begin.  And the other is, you must not be ashamed of your\nwork, and think it would be more honorable to you to be doing something\nelse.  You must have a pride in your own work and in learning to do it\nwell, and not be always saying, There's this and there's that--if I had\nthis or that to do, I might make something of it.  No matter what a man\nis--I wouldn't give twopence for him\"--here Caleb's mouth looked\nbitter, and he snapped his fingers--\"whether he was the prime minister\nor the rick-thatcher, if he didn't do well what he undertook to do.\"\n\n\"I can never feel that I should do that in being a clergyman,\" said\nFred, meaning to take a step in argument.\n\n\"Then let it alone, my boy,\" said Caleb, abruptly, \"else you'll never\nbe easy.  Or, if you _are_ easy, you'll be a poor stick.\"\n\n\"That is very nearly what Mary thinks about it,\" said Fred, coloring.\n\"I think you must know what I feel for Mary, Mr. Garth: I hope it does\nnot displease you that I have always loved her better than any one\nelse, and that I shall never love any one as I love her.\"\n\nThe expression of Caleb's face was visibly softening while Fred spoke.\nBut he swung his head with a solemn slowness, and said--\n\n\"That makes things more serious, Fred, if you want to take Mary's\nhappiness into your keeping.\"\n\n\"I know that, Mr. Garth,\" said Fred, eagerly, \"and I would do anything\nfor _her_.  She says she will never have me if I go into the Church;\nand I shall be the most miserable devil in the world if I lose all hope\nof Mary.  Really, if I could get some other profession,\nbusiness--anything that I am at all fit for, I would work hard, I would\ndeserve your good opinion.  I should like to have to do with outdoor\nthings.  I know a good deal about land and cattle already.  I used to\nbelieve, you know--though you will think me rather foolish for it--that\nI should have land of my own.  I am sure knowledge of that sort would\ncome easily to me, especially if I could be under you in any way.\"\n\n\"Softly, my boy,\" said Caleb, having the image of \"Susan\" before his\neyes.  \"What have you said to your father about all this?\"\n\n\"Nothing, yet; but I must tell him.  I am only waiting to know what I\ncan do instead of entering the Church.  I am very sorry to disappoint\nhim, but a man ought to be allowed to judge for himself when he is\nfour-and-twenty. How could I know when I was fifteen, what it would be\nright for me to do now?  My education was a mistake.\"\n\n\"But hearken to this, Fred,\" said Caleb.  \"Are you sure Mary is fond of\nyou, or would ever have you?\"\n\n\"I asked Mr. Farebrother to talk to her, because she had forbidden\nme--I didn't know what else to do,\" said Fred, apologetically.  \"And he\nsays that I have every reason to hope, if I can put myself in an\nhonorable position--I mean, out of the Church. I dare say you think it\nunwarrantable in me, Mr. Garth, to be troubling you and obtruding my\nown wishes about Mary, before I have done anything at all for myself.\nOf course I have not the least claim--indeed, I have already a debt to\nyou which will never be discharged, even when I have been, able to pay\nit in the shape of money.\"\n\n\"Yes, my boy, you have a claim,\" said Caleb, with much feeling in his\nvoice.  \"The young ones have always a claim on the old to help them\nforward.  I was young myself once and had to do without much help; but\nhelp would have been welcome to me, if it had been only for the\nfellow-feeling's sake.  But I must consider.  Come to me to-morrow at\nthe office, at nine o'clock. At the office, mind.\"\n\nMr. Garth would take no important step without consulting Susan, but it\nmust be confessed that before he reached home he had taken his\nresolution.  With regard to a large number of matters about which other\nmen are decided or obstinate, he was the most easily manageable man in\nthe world.  He never knew what meat he would choose, and if Susan had\nsaid that they ought to live in a four-roomed cottage, in order to\nsave, he would have said, \"Let us go,\" without inquiring into details.\nBut where Caleb's feeling and judgment strongly pronounced, he was a\nruler; and in spite of his mildness and timidity in reproving, every\none about him knew that on the exceptional occasions when he chose, he\nwas absolute.  He never, indeed, chose to be absolute except on some\none else's behalf.  On ninety-nine points Mrs. Garth decided, but on\nthe hundredth she was often aware that she would have to perform the\nsingularly difficult task of carrying out her own principle, and to\nmake herself subordinate.\n\n\"It is come round as I thought, Susan,\" said Caleb, when they were\nseated alone in the evening.  He had already narrated the adventure\nwhich had brought about Fred's sharing in his work, but had kept back\nthe further result.  \"The children _are_ fond of each other--I mean,\nFred and Mary.\"\n\nMrs. Garth laid her work on her knee, and fixed her penetrating eyes\nanxiously on her husband.\n\n\"After we'd done our work, Fred poured it all out to me.  He can't bear\nto be a clergyman, and Mary says she won't have him if he is one; and\nthe lad would like to be under me and give his mind to business.  And\nI've determined to take him and make a man of him.\"\n\n\"Caleb!\" said Mrs. Garth, in a deep contralto, expressive of resigned\nastonishment.\n\n\"It's a fine thing to do,\" said Mr. Garth, settling himself firmly\nagainst the back of his chair, and grasping the elbows.  \"I shall have\ntrouble with him, but I think I shall carry it through.  The lad loves\nMary, and a true love for a good woman is a great thing, Susan.  It\nshapes many a rough fellow.\"\n\n\"Has Mary spoken to you on the subject?\" said Mrs Garth, secretly a\nlittle hurt that she had to be informed on it herself.\n\n\"Not a word.  I asked her about Fred once; I gave her a bit of a\nwarning.  But she assured me she would never marry an idle\nself-indulgent man--nothing since.  But it seems Fred set on Mr.\nFarebrother to talk to her, because she had forbidden him to speak\nhimself, and Mr. Farebrother has found out that she is fond of Fred,\nbut says he must not be a clergyman.  Fred's heart is fixed on Mary,\nthat I can see: it gives me a good opinion of the lad--and we always\nliked him, Susan.\"\n\n\"It is a pity for Mary, I think,\" said Mrs. Garth.\n\n\"Why--a pity?\"\n\n\"Because, Caleb, she might have had a man who is worth twenty Fred\nVincy's.\"\n\n\"Ah?\" said Caleb, with surprise.\n\n\"I firmly believe that Mr. Farebrother is attached to her, and meant to\nmake her an offer; but of course, now that Fred has used him as an\nenvoy, there is an end to that better prospect.\" There was a severe\nprecision in Mrs. Garth's utterance.  She was vexed and disappointed,\nbut she was bent on abstaining from useless words.\n\nCaleb was silent a few moments under a conflict of feelings.  He looked\nat the floor and moved his head and hands in accompaniment to some\ninward argumentation.  At last he said--\n\n\"That would have made me very proud and happy, Susan, and I should have\nbeen glad for your sake.  I've always felt that your belongings have\nnever been on a level with you.  But you took me, though I was a plain\nman.\"\n\n\"I took the best and cleverest man I had ever known,\" said Mrs. Garth,\nconvinced that _she_ would never have loved any one who came short of\nthat mark.\n\n\"Well, perhaps others thought you might have done better.  But it would\nhave been worse for me.  And that is what touches me close about Fred.\nThe lad is good at bottom, and clever enough to do, if he's put in the\nright way; and he loves and honors my daughter beyond anything, and she\nhas given him a sort of promise according to what he turns out.  I say,\nthat young man's soul is in my hand; and I'll do the best I can for\nhim, so help me God!  It's my duty, Susan.\"\n\nMrs. Garth was not given to tears, but there was a large one rolling\ndown her face before her husband had finished.  It came from the\npressure of various feelings, in which there was much affection and\nsome vexation.  She wiped it away quickly, saying--\n\n\"Few men besides you would think it a duty to add to their anxieties in\nthat way, Caleb.\"\n\n\"That signifies nothing--what other men would think.  I've got a clear\nfeeling inside me, and that I shall follow; and I hope your heart will\ngo with me, Susan, in making everything as light as can be to Mary,\npoor child.\"\n\nCaleb, leaning back in his chair, looked with anxious appeal towards\nhis wife.  She rose and kissed him, saying, \"God bless you, Caleb!  Our\nchildren have a good father.\"\n\nBut she went out and had a hearty cry to make up for the suppression of\nher words.  She felt sure that her husband's conduct would be\nmisunderstood, and about Fred she was rational and unhopeful.  Which\nwould turn out to have the more foresight in it--her rationality or\nCaleb's ardent generosity?\n\nWhen Fred went to the office the next morning, there was a test to be\ngone through which he was not prepared for.\n\n\"Now Fred,\" said Caleb, \"you will have some desk-work. I have always\ndone a good deal of writing myself, but I can't do without help, and as\nI want you to understand the accounts and get the values into your\nhead, I mean to do without another clerk.  So you must buckle to.  How\nare you at writing and arithmetic?\"\n\nFred felt an awkward movement of the heart; he had not thought of\ndesk-work; but he was in a resolute mood, and not going to shrink.\n\"I'm not afraid of arithmetic, Mr. Garth: it always came easily to me.\nI think you know my writing.\"\n\n\"Let us see,\" said Caleb, taking up a pen, examining it carefully and\nhanding it, well dipped, to Fred with a sheet of ruled paper.  \"Copy me\na line or two of that valuation, with the figures at the end.\"\n\nAt that time the opinion existed that it was beneath a gentleman to\nwrite legibly, or with a hand in the least suitable to a clerk.  Fred\nwrote the lines demanded in a hand as gentlemanly as that of any\nviscount or bishop of the day: the vowels were all alike and the\nconsonants only distinguishable as turning up or down, the strokes had\na blotted solidity and the letters disdained to keep the line--in\nshort, it was a manuscript of that venerable kind easy to interpret\nwhen you know beforehand what the writer means.\n\nAs Caleb looked on, his visage showed a growing depression, but when\nFred handed him the paper he gave something like a snarl, and rapped\nthe paper passionately with the back of his hand.  Bad work like this\ndispelled all Caleb's mildness.\n\n\"The deuce!\" he exclaimed, snarlingly.  \"To think that this is a\ncountry where a man's education may cost hundreds and hundreds, and it\nturns you out this!\"  Then in a more pathetic tone, pushing up his\nspectacles and looking at the unfortunate scribe, \"The Lord have mercy\non us, Fred, I can't put up with this!\"\n\n\"What can I do, Mr. Garth?\" said Fred, whose spirits had sunk very low,\nnot only at the estimate of his handwriting, but at the vision of\nhimself as liable to be ranked with office clerks.\n\n\"Do?  Why, you must learn to form your letters and keep the line.\nWhat's the use of writing at all if nobody can understand it?\" asked\nCaleb, energetically, quite preoccupied with the bad quality of the\nwork.  \"Is there so little business in the world that you must be\nsending puzzles over the country?  But that's the way people are\nbrought up.  I should lose no end of time with the letters some people\nsend me, if Susan did not make them out for me.  It's disgusting.\" Here\nCaleb tossed the paper from him.\n\nAny stranger peeping into the office at that moment might have wondered\nwhat was the drama between the indignant man of business, and the\nfine-looking young fellow whose blond complexion was getting rather\npatchy as he bit his lip with mortification.  Fred was struggling with\nmany thoughts.  Mr. Garth had been so kind and encouraging at the\nbeginning of their interview, that gratitude and hopefulness had been\nat a high pitch, and the downfall was proportionate.  He had not\nthought of desk-work--in fact, like the majority of young gentlemen, he\nwanted an occupation which should be free from disagreeables.  I cannot\ntell what might have been the consequences if he had not distinctly\npromised himself that he would go to Lowick to see Mary and tell her\nthat he was engaged to work under her father.  He did not like to\ndisappoint himself there.\n\n\"I am very sorry,\" were all the words that he could muster.  But Mr.\nGarth was already relenting.\n\n\"We must make the best of it, Fred,\" he began, with a return to his\nusual quiet tone.  \"Every man can learn to write.  I taught myself.  Go\nat it with a will, and sit up at night if the day-time isn't enough.\nWe'll be patient, my boy.  Callum shall go on with the books for a bit,\nwhile you are learning.  But now I must be off,\" said Caleb, rising.\n\"You must let your father know our agreement.  You'll save me Callum's\nsalary, you know, when you can write; and I can afford to give you\neighty pounds for the first year, and more after.\"\n\nWhen Fred made the necessary disclosure to his parents, the relative\neffect on the two was a surprise which entered very deeply into his\nmemory.  He went straight from Mr. Garth's office to the warehouse,\nrightly feeling that the most respectful way in which he could behave\nto his father was to make the painful communication as gravely and\nformally as possible.  Moreover, the decision would be more certainly\nunderstood to be final, if the interview took place in his father's\ngravest hours, which were always those spent in his private room at the\nwarehouse.\n\nFred entered on the subject directly, and declared briefly what he had\ndone and was resolved to do, expressing at the end his regret that he\nshould be the cause of disappointment to his father, and taking the\nblame on his own deficiencies.  The regret was genuine, and inspired\nFred with strong, simple words.\n\nMr. Vincy listened in profound surprise without uttering even an\nexclamation, a silence which in his impatient temperament was a sign of\nunusual emotion.  He had not been in good spirits about trade that\nmorning, and the slight bitterness in his lips grew intense as he\nlistened.  When Fred had ended, there was a pause of nearly a minute,\nduring which Mr. Vincy replaced a book in his desk and turned the key\nemphatically.  Then he looked at his son steadily, and said--\n\n\"So you've made up your mind at last, sir?\"\n\n\"Yes, father.\"\n\n\"Very well; stick to it.  I've no more to say.  You've thrown away your\neducation, and gone down a step in life, when I had given you the means\nof rising, that's all.\"\n\n\"I am very sorry that we differ, father.  I think I can be quite as\nmuch of a gentleman at the work I have undertaken, as if I had been a\ncurate.  But I am grateful to you for wishing to do the best for me.\"\n\n\"Very well; I have no more to say.  I wash my hands of you.  I only\nhope, when you have a son of your own he will make a better return for\nthe pains you spend on him.\"\n\nThis was very cutting to Fred.  His father was using that unfair\nadvantage possessed by us all when we are in a pathetic situation and\nsee our own past as if it were simply part of the pathos.  In reality,\nMr. Vincy's wishes about his son had had a great deal of pride,\ninconsiderateness, and egoistic folly in them.  But still the\ndisappointed father held a strong lever; and Fred felt as if he were\nbeing banished with a malediction.\n\n\"I hope you will not object to my remaining at home, sir?\" he said,\nafter rising to go; \"I shall have a sufficient salary to pay for my\nboard, as of course I should wish to do.\"\n\n\"Board be hanged!\" said Mr. Vincy, recovering himself in his disgust at\nthe notion that Fred's keep would be missed at his table.  \"Of course\nyour mother will want you to stay.  But I shall keep no horse for you,\nyou understand; and you will pay your own tailor.  You will do with a\nsuit or two less, I fancy, when you have to pay for 'em.\"\n\nFred lingered; there was still something to be said.  At last it came.\n\n\"I hope you will shake hands with me, father, and forgive me the\nvexation I have caused you.\"\n\nMr. Vincy from his chair threw a quick glance upward at his son, who\nhad advanced near to him, and then gave his hand, saying hurriedly,\n\"Yes, yes, let us say no more.\"\n\nFred went through much more narrative and explanation with his mother,\nbut she was inconsolable, having before her eyes what perhaps her\nhusband had never thought of, the certainty that Fred would marry Mary\nGarth, that her life would henceforth be spoiled by a perpetual\ninfusion of Garths and their ways, and that her darling boy, with his\nbeautiful face and stylish air \"beyond anybody else's son in\nMiddlemarch,\" would be sure to get like that family in plainness of\nappearance and carelessness about his clothes.  To her it seemed that\nthere was a Garth conspiracy to get possession of the desirable Fred,\nbut she dared not enlarge on this opinion, because a slight hint of it\nhad made him \"fly out\" at her as he had never done before.  Her temper\nwas too sweet for her to show any anger, but she felt that her\nhappiness had received a bruise, and for several days merely to look at\nFred made her cry a little as if he were the subject of some baleful\nprophecy.  Perhaps she was the slower to recover her usual cheerfulness\nbecause Fred had warned her that she must not reopen the sore question\nwith his father, who had accepted his decision and forgiven him.  If\nher husband had been vehement against Fred, she would have been urged\ninto defence of her darling.  It was the end of the fourth day when Mr.\nVincy said to her--\n\n\"Come, Lucy, my dear, don't be so down-hearted. You always have spoiled\nthe boy, and you must go on spoiling him.\"\n\n\"Nothing ever did cut me so before, Vincy,\" said the wife, her fair\nthroat and chin beginning to tremble again, \"only his illness.\"\n\n\"Pooh, pooh, never mind!  We must expect to have trouble with our\nchildren.  Don't make it worse by letting me see you out of spirits.\"\n\n\"Well, I won't,\" said Mrs. Vincy, roused by this appeal and adjusting\nherself with a little shake as of a bird which lays down its ruffled\nplumage.\n\n\"It won't do to begin making a fuss about one,\" said Mr. Vincy, wishing\nto combine a little grumbling with domestic cheerfulness.  \"There's\nRosamond as well as Fred.\"\n\n\"Yes, poor thing.  I'm sure I felt for her being disappointed of her\nbaby; but she got over it nicely.\"\n\n\"Baby, pooh!  I can see Lydgate is making a mess of his practice, and\ngetting into debt too, by what I hear.  I shall have Rosamond coming to\nme with a pretty tale one of these days.  But they'll get no money from\nme, I know.  Let _his_ family help him.  I never did like that\nmarriage.  But it's no use talking.  Ring the bell for lemons, and\ndon't look dull any more, Lucy.  I'll drive you and Louisa to Riverston\nto-morrow.\"\n\n\n\n    They numbered scarce eight summers when a name\n        Rose on their souls and stirred such motions there\n    As thrill the buds and shape their hidden frame\n        At penetration of the quickening air:\n    His name who told of loyal Evan Dhu,\n        Of quaint Bradwardine, and Vich Ian Vor,\n    Making the little world their childhood knew\n        Large with a land of mountain lake and scaur,\n    And larger yet with wonder love belief\n        Toward Walter Scott who living far away\n    Sent them this wealth of joy and noble grief.\n        The book and they must part, but day by day,\n            In lines that thwart like portly spiders ran\n            They wrote the tale, from Tully Veolan.\n\n\nThe evening that Fred Vincy walked to Lowick parsonage (he had begun to\nsee that this was a world in which even a spirited young man must\nsometimes walk for want of a horse to carry him) he set out at five\no'clock and called on Mrs. Garth by the way, wishing to assure himself\nthat she accepted their new relations willingly.\n\nHe found the family group, dogs and cats included, under the great\napple-tree in the orchard.  It was a festival with Mrs. Garth, for her\neldest son, Christy, her peculiar joy and pride, had come home for a\nshort holiday--Christy, who held it the most desirable thing in the\nworld to be a tutor, to study all literatures and be a regenerate\nPorson, and who was an incorporate criticism on poor Fred, a sort of\nobject-lesson given to him by the educational mother.  Christy himself,\na square-browed, broad-shouldered masculine edition of his mother not\nmuch higher than Fred's shoulder--which made it the harder that he\nshould be held superior--was always as simple as possible, and thought\nno more of Fred's disinclination to scholarship than of a giraffe's,\nwishing that he himself were more of the same height.  He was lying on\nthe ground now by his mother's chair, with his straw hat laid flat over\nhis eyes, while Jim on the other side was reading aloud from that\nbeloved writer who has made a chief part in the happiness of many young\nlives.  The volume was \"Ivanhoe,\" and Jim was in the great archery\nscene at the tournament, but suffered much interruption from Ben, who\nhad fetched his own old bow and arrows, and was making himself\ndreadfully disagreeable, Letty thought, by begging all present to\nobserve his random shots, which no one wished to do except Brownie, the\nactive-minded but probably shallow mongrel, while the grizzled\nNewfoundland lying in the sun looked on with the dull-eyed neutrality\nof extreme old age.  Letty herself, showing as to her mouth and\npinafore some slight signs that she had been assisting at the gathering\nof the cherries which stood in a coral-heap on the tea-table, was now\nseated on the grass, listening open-eyed to the reading.\n\nBut the centre of interest was changed for all by the arrival of Fred\nVincy.  When, seating himself on a garden-stool, he said that he was on\nhis way to Lowick Parsonage, Ben, who had thrown down his bow, and\nsnatched up a reluctant half-grown kitten instead, strode across Fred's\noutstretched leg, and said \"Take me!\"\n\n\"Oh, and me too,\" said Letty.\n\n\"You can't keep up with Fred and me,\" said Ben.\n\n\"Yes, I can.  Mother, please say that I am to go,\" urged Letty, whose\nlife was much checkered by resistance to her depreciation as a girl.\n\n\"I shall stay with Christy,\" observed Jim; as much as to say that he\nhad the advantage of those simpletons; whereupon Letty put her hand up\nto her head and looked with jealous indecision from the one to the\nother.\n\n\"Let us all go and see Mary,\" said Christy, opening his arms.\n\n\"No, my dear child, we must not go in a swarm to the parsonage.  And\nthat old Glasgow suit of yours would never do.  Besides, your father\nwill come home.  We must let Fred go alone.  He can tell Mary that you\nare here, and she will come back to-morrow.\"\n\nChristy glanced at his own threadbare knees, and then at Fred's\nbeautiful white trousers.  Certainly Fred's tailoring suggested the\nadvantages of an English university, and he had a graceful way even of\nlooking warm and of pushing his hair back with his handkerchief.\n\n\"Children, run away,\" said Mrs. Garth; \"it is too warm to hang about\nyour friends.  Take your brother and show him the rabbits.\"\n\nThe eldest understood, and led off the children immediately.  Fred felt\nthat Mrs. Garth wished to give him an opportunity of saying anything he\nhad to say, but he could only begin by observing--\n\n\"How glad you must be to have Christy here!\"\n\n\"Yes; he has come sooner than I expected.  He got down from the coach\nat nine o'clock, just after his father went out.  I am longing for\nCaleb to come and hear what wonderful progress Christy is making.  He\nhas paid his expenses for the last year by giving lessons, carrying on\nhard study at the same time.  He hopes soon to get a private tutorship\nand go abroad.\"\n\n\"He is a great fellow,\" said Fred, to whom these cheerful truths had a\nmedicinal taste, \"and no trouble to anybody.\" After a slight pause, he\nadded, \"But I fear you will think that I am going to be a great deal of\ntrouble to Mr. Garth.\"\n\n\"Caleb likes taking trouble: he is one of those men who always do more\nthan any one would have thought of asking them to do,\" answered Mrs.\nGarth.  She was knitting, and could either look at Fred or not, as she\nchose--always an advantage when one is bent on loading speech with\nsalutary meaning; and though Mrs. Garth intended to be duly reserved,\nshe did wish to say something that Fred might be the better for.\n\n\"I know you think me very undeserving, Mrs. Garth, and with good\nreason,\" said Fred, his spirit rising a little at the perception of\nsomething like a disposition to lecture him.  \"I happen to have behaved\njust the worst to the people I can't help wishing for the most from.\nBut while two men like Mr. Garth and Mr. Farebrother have not given me\nup, I don't see why I should give myself up.\"  Fred thought it might be\nwell to suggest these masculine examples to Mrs. Garth.\n\n\"Assuredly,\" said she, with gathering emphasis.  \"A young man for whom\ntwo such elders had devoted themselves would indeed be culpable if he\nthrew himself away and made their sacrifices vain.\"\n\nFred wondered a little at this strong language, but only said, \"I hope\nit will not be so with me, Mrs. Garth, since I have some encouragement\nto believe that I may win Mary.  Mr. Garth has told you about that?\nYou were not surprised, I dare say?\"  Fred ended, innocently referring\nonly to his own love as probably evident enough.\n\n\"Not surprised that Mary has given you encouragement?\" returned Mrs.\nGarth, who thought it would be well for Fred to be more alive to the\nfact that Mary's friends could not possibly have wished this\nbeforehand, whatever the Vincys might suppose.  \"Yes, I confess I was\nsurprised.\"\n\n\"She never did give me any--not the least in the world, when I talked\nto her myself,\" said Fred, eager to vindicate Mary.  \"But when I asked\nMr. Farebrother to speak for me, she allowed him to tell me there was a\nhope.\"\n\nThe power of admonition which had begun to stir in Mrs. Garth had not\nyet discharged itself.  It was a little too provoking even for _her_\nself-control that this blooming youngster should flourish on the\ndisappointments of sadder and wiser people--making a meal of a\nnightingale and never knowing it--and that all the while his family\nshould suppose that hers was in eager need of this sprig; and her\nvexation had fermented the more actively because of its total\nrepression towards her husband.  Exemplary wives will sometimes find\nscapegoats in this way.  She now said with energetic decision, \"You\nmade a great mistake, Fred, in asking Mr. Farebrother to speak for you.\"\n\n\"Did I?\" said Fred, reddening instantaneously.  He was alarmed, but at\na loss to know what Mrs. Garth meant, and added, in an apologetic tone,\n\"Mr. Farebrother has always been such a friend of ours; and Mary, I\nknew, would listen to him gravely; and he took it on himself quite\nreadily.\"\n\n\"Yes, young people are usually blind to everything but their own\nwishes, and seldom imagine how much those wishes cost others,\" said\nMrs. Garth. She did not mean to go beyond this salutary general\ndoctrine, and threw her indignation into a needless unwinding of her\nworsted, knitting her brow at it with a grand air.\n\n\"I cannot conceive how it could be any pain to Mr. Farebrother,\" said\nFred, who nevertheless felt that surprising conceptions were beginning\nto form themselves.\n\n\"Precisely; you cannot conceive,\" said Mrs. Garth, cutting her words as\nneatly as possible.\n\nFor a moment Fred looked at the horizon with a dismayed anxiety, and\nthen turning with a quick movement said almost sharply--\n\n\"Do you mean to say, Mrs. Garth, that Mr. Farebrother is in love with\nMary?\"\n\n\"And if it were so, Fred, I think you are the last person who ought to\nbe surprised,\" returned Mrs. Garth, laying her knitting down beside her\nand folding her arms.  It was an unwonted sign of emotion in her that\nshe should put her work out of her hands.  In fact her feelings were\ndivided between the satisfaction of giving Fred his discipline and the\nsense of having gone a little too far.  Fred took his hat and stick and\nrose quickly.\n\n\"Then you think I am standing in his way, and in Mary's too?\" he said,\nin a tone which seemed to demand an answer.\n\nMrs. Garth could not speak immediately.  She had brought herself into\nthe unpleasant position of being called on to say what she really felt,\nyet what she knew there were strong reasons for concealing.  And to her\nthe consciousness of having exceeded in words was peculiarly\nmortifying.  Besides, Fred had given out unexpected electricity, and he\nnow added, \"Mr. Garth seemed pleased that Mary should be attached to\nme.  He could not have known anything of this.\"\n\nMrs. Garth felt a severe twinge at this mention of her husband, the\nfear that Caleb might think her in the wrong not being easily\nendurable.  She answered, wanting to check unintended consequences--\n\n\"I spoke from inference only.  I am not aware that Mary knows anything\nof the matter.\"\n\nBut she hesitated to beg that he would keep entire silence on a subject\nwhich she had herself unnecessarily mentioned, not being used to stoop\nin that way; and while she was hesitating there was already a rush of\nunintended consequences under the apple-tree where the tea-things\nstood.  Ben, bouncing across the grass with Brownie at his heels, and\nseeing the kitten dragging the knitting by a lengthening line of wool,\nshouted and clapped his hands; Brownie barked, the kitten, desperate,\njumped on the tea-table and upset the milk, then jumped down again and\nswept half the cherries with it; and Ben, snatching up the half-knitted\nsock-top, fitted it over the kitten's head as a new source of madness,\nwhile Letty arriving cried out to her mother against this cruelty--it\nwas a history as full of sensation as \"This is the house that Jack\nbuilt.\" Mrs. Garth was obliged to interfere, the other young ones came\nup and the tete-a-tete with Fred was ended.  He got away as soon as he\ncould, and Mrs. Garth could only imply some retractation of her\nseverity by saying \"God bless you\" when she shook hands with him.\n\nShe was unpleasantly conscious that she had been on the verge of\nspeaking as \"one of the foolish women speaketh\"--telling first and\nentreating silence after.  But she had not entreated silence, and to\nprevent Caleb's blame she determined to blame herself and confess all\nto him that very night.  It was curious what an awful tribunal the mild\nCaleb's was to her, whenever he set it up.  But she meant to point out\nto him that the revelation might do Fred Vincy a great deal of good.\n\nNo doubt it was having a strong effect on him as he walked to Lowick.\nFred's light hopeful nature had perhaps never had so much of a bruise\nas from this suggestion that if he had been out of the way Mary might\nhave made a thoroughly good match.  Also he was piqued that he had been\nwhat he called such a stupid lout as to ask that intervention from Mr.\nFarebrother.  But it was not in a lover's nature--it was not in\nFred's, that the new anxiety raised about Mary's feeling should not\nsurmount every other.  Notwithstanding his trust in Mr. Farebrother's\ngenerosity, notwithstanding what Mary had said to him, Fred could not\nhelp feeling that he had a rival: it was a new consciousness, and he\nobjected to it extremely, not being in the least ready to give up Mary\nfor her good, being ready rather to fight for her with any man\nwhatsoever.\n\n### Summary:"}
{"original_length": 16803, "trunc_length": 16384, "text": "\n\nSummarize the following text into a summary of less than 800 words.\n### Text:\n\nFIRST PART To Romain Rolland, my dear friend THE SON OF THE BRAHMAN\n\nIn the shade of the house, in the sunshine of the riverbank near the\nboats, in the shade of the Sal-wood forest, in the shade of the fig tree\nis where Siddhartha grew up, the handsome son of the Brahman, the young\nfalcon, together with his friend Govinda, son of a Brahman.  The sun\ntanned his light shoulders by the banks of the river when bathing,\nperforming the sacred ablutions, the sacred offerings.  In the mango\ngrove, shade poured into his black eyes, when playing as a boy, when\nhis mother sang, when the sacred offerings were made, when his father,\nthe scholar, taught him, when the wise men talked.  For a long time,\nSiddhartha had been partaking in the discussions of the wise men,\npractising debate with Govinda, practising with Govinda the art of\nreflection, the service of meditation.  He already knew how to speak the\nOm silently, the word of words, to speak it silently into himself while\ninhaling, to speak it silently out of himself while exhaling, with all\nthe concentration of his soul, the forehead surrounded by the glow of\nthe clear-thinking spirit.  He already knew to feel Atman in the depths\nof his being, indestructible, one with the universe.\n\nJoy leapt in his father's heart for his son who was quick to learn,\nthirsty for knowledge; he saw him growing up to become great wise man\nand priest, a prince among the Brahmans.\n\nBliss leapt in his mother's breast when she saw him, when she saw him\nwalking, when she saw him sit down and get up, Siddhartha, strong,\nhandsome, he who was walking on slender legs, greeting her with perfect\nrespect.\n\nLove touched the hearts of the Brahmans' young daughters when\nSiddhartha walked through the lanes of the town with the luminous\nforehead, with the eye of a king, with his slim hips.\n\nBut more than all the others he was loved by Govinda, his friend, the\nson of a Brahman.  He loved Siddhartha's eye and sweet voice, he loved\nhis walk and the perfect decency of his movements, he loved everything\nSiddhartha did and said and what he loved most was his spirit, his\ntranscendent, fiery thoughts, his ardent will, his high calling.\nGovinda knew: he would not become a common Brahman, not a lazy official\nin charge of offerings; not a greedy merchant with magic spells; not a\nvain, vacuous speaker; not a mean, deceitful priest; and also not a\ndecent, stupid sheep in the herd of the many.  No, and he, Govinda, as\nwell did not want to become one of those, not one of those tens of\nthousands of Brahmans.  He wanted to follow Siddhartha, the beloved,\nthe splendid.  And in days to come, when Siddhartha would become a god,\nwhen he would join the glorious, then Govinda wanted to follow him as\nhis friend, his companion, his servant, his spear-carrier, his shadow.\n\nSiddhartha was thus loved by everyone.  He was a source of joy for\neverybody, he was a delight for them all.\n\nBut he, Siddhartha, was not a source of joy for himself, he found no\ndelight in himself.  Walking the rosy paths of the fig tree garden,\nsitting in the bluish shade of the grove of contemplation, washing his\nlimbs daily in the bath of repentance, sacrificing in the dim shade of\nthe mango forest, his gestures of perfect decency, everyone's love and\njoy, he still lacked all joy in his heart.  Dreams and restless thoughts\ncame into his mind, flowing from the water of the river, sparkling from\nthe stars of the night, melting from the beams of the sun, dreams came\nto him and a restlessness of the soul, fuming from the sacrifices,\nbreathing forth from the verses of the Rig-Veda, being infused into him,\ndrop by drop, from the teachings of the old Brahmans.\n\nSiddhartha had started to nurse discontent in himself, he had started\nto feel that the love of his father and the love of his mother, and also\nthe love of his friend, Govinda, would not bring him joy for ever and\never, would not nurse him, feed him, satisfy him.  He had started to\nsuspect that his venerable father and his other teachers, that the wise\nBrahmans had already revealed to him the most and best of their wisdom,\nthat they had already filled his expecting vessel with their richness,\nand the vessel was not full, the spirit was not content, the soul was\nnot calm, the heart was not satisfied.  The ablutions were good, but\nthey were water, they did not wash off the sin, they did not heal the\nspirit's thirst, they did not relieve the fear in his heart.  The\nsacrifices and the invocation of the gods were excellent--but was that\nall?  Did the sacrifices give a happy fortune?  And what about the gods?\nWas it really Prajapati who had created the world?  Was it not the\nAtman, He, the only one, the singular one?  Were the gods not creations,\ncreated like me and you, subject to time, mortal?  Was it therefore\ngood, was it right, was it meaningful and the highest occupation to make\nofferings to the gods?  For whom else were offerings to be made, who\nelse was to be worshipped but Him, the only one, the Atman?  And where\nwas Atman to be found, where did He reside, where did his eternal heart\nbeat, where else but in one's own self, in its innermost part, in its\nindestructible part, which everyone had in himself?  But where, where\nwas this self, this innermost part, this ultimate part?  It was not\nflesh and bone, it was neither thought nor consciousness, thus the\nwisest ones taught.  So, where, where was it?  To reach this place, the\nself, myself, the Atman, there was another way, which was worthwhile\nlooking for?  Alas, and nobody showed this way, nobody knew it, not the\nfather, and not the teachers and wise men, not the holy sacrificial\nsongs!  They knew everything, the Brahmans and their holy books, they\nknew everything, they had taken care of everything and of more than\neverything, the creation of the world, the origin of speech, of food, of\ninhaling, of exhaling, the arrangement of the senses, the acts of the\ngods, they knew infinitely much--but was it valuable to know all of\nthis, not knowing that one and only thing, the most important thing, the\nsolely important thing?\n\nSurely, many verses of the holy books, particularly in the Upanishades\nof Samaveda, spoke of this innermost and ultimate thing, wonderful\nverses.  \"Your soul is the whole world\", was written there, and it was\nwritten that man in his sleep, in his deep sleep, would meet with his\ninnermost part and would reside in the Atman.  Marvellous wisdom was in\nthese verses, all knowledge of the wisest ones had been collected here\nin magic words, pure as honey collected by bees.  No, not to be looked\ndown upon was the tremendous amount of enlightenment which lay here\ncollected and preserved by innumerable generations of wise Brahmans.--\nBut where were the Brahmans, where the priests, where the wise men or\npenitents, who had succeeded in not just knowing this deepest of all\nknowledge but also to live it?  Where was the knowledgeable one who wove\nhis spell to bring his familiarity with the Atman out of the sleep into\nthe state of being awake, into the life, into every step of the way,\ninto word and deed?  Siddhartha knew many venerable Brahmans, chiefly\nhis father, the pure one, the scholar, the most venerable one.  His\nfather was to be admired, quiet and noble were his manners, pure his\nlife, wise his words, delicate and noble thoughts lived behind its brow\n--but even he, who knew so much, did he live in blissfulness, did he\nhave peace, was he not also just a searching man, a thirsty man?  Did he\nnot, again and again, have to drink from holy sources, as a thirsty man,\nfrom the offerings, from the books, from the disputes of the Brahmans?\nWhy did he, the irreproachable one, have to wash off sins every day,\nstrive for a cleansing every day, over and over every day?  Was not\nAtman in him, did not the pristine source spring from his heart?  It had\nto be found, the pristine source in one's own self, it had to be\npossessed!  Everything else was searching, was a detour, was getting\nlost.\n\nThus were Siddhartha's thoughts, this was his thirst, this was his\nsuffering.\n\nOften he spoke to himself from a Chandogya-Upanishad the words:\n\"Truly, the name of the Brahman is satyam--verily, he who knows such a\nthing, will enter the heavenly world every day.\"  Often, it seemed near,\nthe heavenly world, but never he had reached it completely, never he had\nquenched the ultimate thirst.  And among all the wise and wisest men, he\nknew and whose instructions he had received, among all of them there was\nno one, who had reached it completely, the heavenly world, who had\nquenched it completely, the eternal thirst.\n\n\"Govinda,\" Siddhartha spoke to his friend, \"Govinda, my dear, come with\nme under the Banyan tree, let's practise meditation.\"\n\nThey went to the Banyan tree, they sat down, Siddhartha right here,\nGovinda twenty paces away.  While putting himself down, ready to speak\nthe Om, Siddhartha repeated murmuring the verse:\n\nOm is the bow, the arrow is soul,\nThe Brahman is the arrow's target,\nThat one should incessantly hit.\n\nAfter the usual time of the exercise in meditation had passed, Govinda\nrose.  The evening had come, it was time to perform the evening's ablution.\nHe called Siddhartha's name.  Siddhartha did not answer.  Siddhartha sat\nthere lost in thought, his eyes were rigidly focused towards a very\ndistant target, the tip of his tongue was protruding a little between\nthe teeth, he seemed not to breathe.  Thus sat he, wrapped up in\ncontemplation, thinking Om, his soul sent after the Brahman as an arrow.\n\nOnce, Samanas had travelled through Siddhartha's town, ascetics on a\npilgrimage, three skinny, withered men, neither old nor young, with\ndusty and bloody shoulders, almost naked, scorched by the sun,\nsurrounded by loneliness, strangers and enemies to the world, strangers\nand lank jackals in the realm of humans.  Behind them blew a hot scent\nof quiet passion, of destructive service, of merciless self-denial.\n\nIn the evening, after the hour of contemplation, Siddhartha spoke to\nGovinda:  \"Early tomorrow morning, my friend, Siddhartha will go to the\nSamanas.  He will become a Samana.\"\n\nGovinda turned pale, when he heard these words and read the decision in\nthe motionless face of his friend, unstoppable like the arrow shot from\nthe bow.  Soon and with the first glance, Govinda realized:  Now it is\nbeginning, now Siddhartha is taking his own way, now his fate is\nbeginning to sprout, and with his, my own.  And he turned pale like a\ndry banana-skin.\n\n\"O Siddhartha,\" he exclaimed, \"will your father permit you to do that?\"\n\nSiddhartha looked over as if he was just waking up.  Arrow-fast he read\nin Govinda's soul, read the fear, read the submission.\n\n\"O Govinda,\" he spoke quietly, \"let's not waste words.  Tomorrow, at\ndaybreak I will begin the life of the Samanas.  Speak no more of it.\"\n\nSiddhartha entered the chamber, where his father was sitting on a mat of\nbast, and stepped behind his father and remained standing there, until\nhis father felt that someone was standing behind him.  Quoth the\nBrahman:  \"Is that you, Siddhartha?  Then say what you came to say.\"\n\nQuoth Siddhartha: \"With your permission, my father.  I came to tell you\nthat it is my longing to leave your house tomorrow and go to the\nascetics.  My desire is to become a Samana.  May my father not oppose\nthis.\"\n\nThe Brahman fell silent, and remained silent for so long that the stars\nin the small window wandered and changed their relative positions, 'ere\nthe silence was broken.  Silent and motionless stood the son with his\narms folded, silent and motionless sat the father on the mat, and the\nstars traced their paths in the sky.  Then spoke the father:  \"Not\nproper it is for a Brahman to speak harsh and angry words.  But\nindignation is in my heart.  I wish not to hear this request for a\nsecond time from your mouth.\"\n\nSlowly, the Brahman rose; Siddhartha stood silently, his arms folded.\n\n\"What are you waiting for?\" asked the father.\n\nQuoth Siddhartha:  \"You know what.\"\n\nIndignant, the father left the chamber; indignant, he went to his bed\nand lay down.\n\nAfter an hour, since no sleep had come over his eyes, the Brahman stood\nup, paced to and fro, and left the house.  Through the small window of\nthe chamber he looked back inside, and there he saw Siddhartha standing,\nhis arms folded, not moving from his spot.  Pale shimmered his bright\nrobe.  With anxiety in his heart, the father returned to his bed.\n\nAfter another hour, since no sleep had come over his eyes, the Brahman\nstood up again, paced to and fro, walked out of the house and saw that\nthe moon had risen.  Through the window of the chamber he looked back\ninside; there stood Siddhartha, not moving from his spot, his arms\nfolded, moonlight reflecting from his bare shins.  With worry in his\nheart, the father went back to bed.\n\nAnd he came back after an hour, he came back after two hours, looked\nthrough the small window, saw Siddhartha standing, in the moon light,\nby the light of the stars, in the darkness.  And he came back hour after\nhour, silently, he looked into the chamber, saw him standing in the same\nplace, filled his heart with anger, filled his heart with unrest, filled\nhis heart with anguish, filled it with sadness.\n\nAnd in the night's last hour, before the day began, he returned, stepped\ninto the room, saw the young man standing there, who seemed tall and\nlike a stranger to him.\n\n\"Siddhartha,\" he spoke, \"what are you waiting for?\"\n\n\"You know what.\"\n\n\"Will you always stand that way and wait, until it'll becomes morning,\nnoon, and evening?\"\n\n\"I will stand and wait.\n\n\"You will become tired, Siddhartha.\"\n\n\"I will become tired.\"\n\n\"You will fall asleep, Siddhartha.\"\n\n\"I will not fall asleep.\"\n\n\"You will die, Siddhartha.\"\n\n\"I will die.\"\n\n\"And would you rather die, than obey your father?\"\n\n\"Siddhartha has always obeyed his father.\"\n\n\"So will you abandon your plan?\"\n\n\"Siddhartha will do what his father will tell him to do.\"\n\nThe first light of day shone into the room.  The Brahman saw that\nSiddhartha was trembling softly in his knees.  In Siddhartha's face he\nsaw no trembling, his eyes were fixed on a distant spot.  Then his\nfather realized that even now Siddhartha no longer dwelt with him in his\nhome, that he had already left him.\n\nThe Father touched Siddhartha's shoulder.\n\n\"You will,\" he spoke, \"go into the forest and be a Samana.  When\nyou'll have found blissfulness in the forest, then come back and teach\nme to be blissful.  If you'll find disappointment, then return and let\nus once again make offerings to the gods together.  Go now and kiss your\nmother, tell her where you are going to.  But for me it is time to go to\nthe river and to perform the first ablution.\"\n\nHe took his hand from the shoulder of his son and went outside.\nSiddhartha wavered to the side, as he tried to walk.  He put his limbs\nback under control, bowed to his father, and went to his mother to do as\nhis father had said.\n\nAs he slowly left on stiff legs in the first light of day the still\nquiet town, a shadow rose near the last hut, who had crouched there,\nand joined the pilgrim--Govinda.\n\n\"You have come,\" said Siddhartha and smiled.\n\n\"I have come,\" said Govinda.\n\n\n\n\n\nWITH THE SAMANAS\n\n\nIn the evening of this day they caught up with the ascetics, the skinny\nSamanas, and offered them their companionship and--obedience.  They\nwere accepted.\n\nSiddhartha gave his garments to a poor Brahman in the street.  He wore\nnothing more than the loincloth and the earth-coloured, unsown cloak.\nHe ate only once a day, and never something cooked.  He fasted for\nfifteen days.  He fasted for twenty-eight days.  The flesh waned from\nhis thighs and cheeks.  Feverish dreams flickered from his enlarged\neyes, long nails grew slowly on his parched fingers and a dry, shaggy\nbeard grew on his chin.  His glance turned to ice when he encountered\nwomen; his mouth twitched with contempt, when he walked through a city\nof nicely dressed people.  He saw merchants trading, princes hunting,\nmourners wailing for their dead, whores offering themselves, physicians\ntrying to help the sick, priests determining the most suitable day for\nseeding, lovers loving, mothers nursing their children--and all of this\nwas not worthy of one look from his eye, it all lied, it all stank,\nit all stank of lies, it all pretended to be meaningful and joyful and\nbeautiful, and it all was just concealed putrefaction.  The world tasted\nbitter.  Life was torture.\n\nA goal stood before Siddhartha, a single goal: to become empty, empty of\nthirst, empty of wishing, empty of dreams, empty of joy and sorrow.\nDead to himself, not to be a self any more, to find tranquility with an\nemptied heard, to be open to miracles in unselfish thoughts, that was\nhis goal.  Once all of my self was overcome and had died, once every\ndesire and every urge was silent in the heart, then the ultimate part\nof me had to awake, the innermost of my being, which is no longer my\nself, the great secret.\n\nSilently, Siddhartha exposed himself to burning rays of the sun directly\nabove, glowing with pain, glowing with thirst, and stood there, until he\nneither felt any pain nor thirst any more.  Silently, he stood there in\nthe rainy season, from his hair the water was dripping over freezing\nshoulders, over freezing hips and legs, and the penitent stood there,\nuntil he could not feel the cold in his shoulders and legs any more,\nuntil they were silent, until they were quiet.  Silently, he cowered in\nthe thorny bushes, blood dripped from the burning skin, from festering\nwounds dripped pus, and Siddhartha stayed rigidly, stayed motionless,\nuntil no blood flowed any more, until nothing stung any more, until\nnothing burned any more.\n\nSiddhartha sat upright and learned to breathe sparingly, learned to\nget along with only few breathes, learned to stop breathing.  He\nlearned, beginning with the breath, to calm the beat of his heart,\nleaned to reduce the beats of his heart, until they were only a few and\nalmost none.\n\nInstructed by the oldest of the Samanas, Siddhartha practised\nself-denial, practised meditation, according to a new Samana rules.\nA heron flew over the bamboo forest--and Siddhartha accepted the heron\ninto his soul, flew over forest and mountains, was a heron, ate fish,\nfelt the pangs of a heron's hunger, spoke the heron's croak, died a\nheron's death.  A dead jackal was lying on the sandy bank, and\nSiddhartha's soul slipped inside the body, was the dead jackal, lay on\nthe banks, got bloated, stank, decayed, was dismembered by hyaenas, was\nskinned by vultures, turned into a skeleton, turned to dust, was blown\nacross the fields.  And Siddhartha's soul returned, had died, had\ndecayed, was scattered as dust, had tasted the gloomy intoxication of\nthe cycle, awaited in new thirst like a hunter in the gap, where he\ncould escape from the cycle, where the end of the causes, where an\neternity without suffering began.  He killed his senses, he killed his\nmemory, he slipped out of his self into thousands of other forms, was an\nanimal, was carrion, was stone, was wood, was water, and awoke every\ntime to find his old self again, sun shone or moon, was his self again,\nturned round in the cycle, felt thirst, overcame the thirst, felt new\nthirst.\n\nSiddhartha learned a lot when he was with the Samanas, many ways leading\naway from the self he learned to go.  He went the way of self-denial\nby means of pain, through voluntarily suffering and overcoming pain,\nhunger, thirst, tiredness.  He went the way of self-denial by means of\nmeditation, through imagining the mind to be void of all conceptions.\nThese and other ways he learned to go, a thousand times he left his\nself, for hours and days he remained in the non-self.  But though the\nways led away from the self, their end nevertheless always led back to\nthe self.  Though Siddhartha fled from the self a thousand times, stayed\nin nothingness, stayed in the animal, in the stone, the return was\ninevitable, inescapable was the hour, when he found himself back in the\nsunshine or in the moonlight, in the shade or in the rain, and was once\nagain his self and Siddhartha, and again felt the agony of the cycle which\nhad been forced upon him.\n\nBy his side lived Govinda, his shadow, walked the same paths, undertook\nthe same efforts.  They rarely spoke to one another, than the service\nand the exercises required.  Occasionally the two of them went through\nthe villages, to beg for food for themselves and their teachers.\n\n\"How do you think, Govinda,\" Siddhartha spoke one day while begging\nthis way, \"how do you think did we progress?  Did we reach any goals?\"\n\nGovinda answered:  \"We have learned, and we'll continue learning.\nYou'll be a great Samana, Siddhartha.  Quickly, you've learned every\nexercise, often the old Samanas have admired you.  One day, you'll be\na holy man, oh Siddhartha.\"\n\nQuoth Siddhartha:  \"I can't help but feel that it is not like this, my\nfriend.  What I've learned, being among the Samanas, up to this day,\nthis, oh Govinda, I could have learned more quickly and by simpler\nmeans.  In every tavern of that part of a town where the whorehouses\nare, my friend, among carters and gamblers I could have learned it.\"\n\nQuoth Govinda:  \"Siddhartha is putting me on.  How could you have\nlearned meditation, holding your breath, insensitivity against hunger\nand pain there among these wretched people?\"\n\nAnd Siddhartha said quietly, as if he was talking to himself:  \"What is\nmeditation?  What is leaving one's body?  What is fasting?  What is\nholding one's breath?  It is fleeing from the self, it is a short\nescape of the agony of being a self, it is a short numbing of the\nsenses against the pain and the pointlessness of life.  The same escape,\nthe same short numbing is what the driver of an ox-cart finds in the\ninn, drinking a few bowls of rice-wine or fermented coconut-milk.  Then\nhe won't feel his self any more, then he won't feel the pains of life\nany more, then he finds a short numbing of the senses.  When he falls\nasleep over his bowl of rice-wine, he'll find the same what Siddhartha\nand Govinda find when they escape their bodies through long exercises,\nstaying in the non-self.  This is how it is, oh Govinda.\"\n\nQuoth Govinda:  \"You say so, oh friend, and yet you know that Siddhartha\nis no driver of an ox-cart and a Samana is no drunkard.  It's true that\na drinker numbs his senses, it's true that he briefly escapes and rests,\nbut he'll return from the delusion, finds everything to be unchanged, has\nnot become wiser, has gathered no enlightenment,--has not risen several\nsteps.\"\n\nAnd Siddhartha spoke with a smile:  \"I do not know, I've never been a\ndrunkard.  But that I, Siddhartha, find only a short numbing of the\nsenses in my exercises and meditations and that I am just as far removed\nfrom wisdom, from salvation, as a child in the mother's womb, this I\nknow, oh Govinda, this I know.\"\n\nAnd once again, another time, when Siddhartha left the forest together\nwith Govinda, to beg for some food in the village for their brothers and\nteachers, Siddhartha began to speak and said:  \"What now, oh Govinda,\nmight we be on the right path?  Might we get closer to enlightenment?\nMight we get closer to salvation?  Or do we perhaps live in a circle--\nwe, who have thought we were escaping the cycle?\"\n\nQuoth Govinda:  \"We have learned a lot, Siddhartha, there is still\nmuch to learn.  We are not going around in circles, we are moving up,\nthe circle is a spiral, we have already ascended many a level.\"\n\nSiddhartha answered:  \"How old, would you think, is our oldest Samana,\nour venerable teacher?\"\n\nQuoth Govinda:  \"Our oldest one might be about sixty years of age.\"\n\nAnd Siddhartha:  \"He has lived for sixty years and has not reached the\nnirvana.  He'll turn seventy and eighty, and you and me, we will grow\njust as old and will do our exercises, and will fast, and will meditate.\nBut we will not reach the nirvana, he won't and we won't.  Oh Govinda,\nI believe out of all the Samanas out there, perhaps not a single one,\nnot a single one, will reach the nirvana.  We find comfort, we find\nnumbness, we learn feats, to deceive others.  But the most important\nthing, the path of paths, we will not find.\"\n\n\"If you only,\" spoke Govinda, \"wouldn't speak such terrible words,\nSiddhartha!  How could it be that among so many learned men, among so\nmany Brahmans, among so many austere and venerable Samanas, among so\nmany who are searching, so many who are eagerly trying, so many holy\nmen, no one will find the path of paths?\"\n\nBut Siddhartha said in a voice which contained just as much sadness as\nmockery, with a quiet, a slightly sad, a slightly mocking voice:  \"Soon,\nGovinda, your friend will leave the path of the Samanas, he has walked\nalong your side for so long.  I'm suffering of thirst, oh Govinda, and\non this long path of a Samana, my thirst has remained as strong as ever.\nI always thirsted for knowledge, I have always been full of questions.\nI have asked the Brahmans, year after year, and I have asked the holy\nVedas, year after year, and I have asked the devote Samanas, year after\nyear.  Perhaps, oh Govinda, it had been just as well, had been just as\nsmart and just as profitable, if I had asked the hornbill-bird or the\nchimpanzee.  It took me a long time and am not finished learning this\nyet, oh Govinda: that there is nothing to be learned!  There is indeed\nno such thing, so I believe, as what we refer to as `learning'.  There\nis, oh my friend, just one knowledge, this is everywhere, this is Atman,\nthis is within me and within you and within every creature.  And so I'm\nstarting to believe that this knowledge has no worser enemy than the\ndesire to know it, than learning.\"\n\nAt this, Govinda stopped on the path, rose his hands, and spoke:  \"If\nyou, Siddhartha, only would not bother your friend with this kind of\ntalk!  Truly, you words stir up fear in my heart.  And just consider:\nwhat would become of the sanctity of prayer, what of the venerability of\nthe Brahmans' caste, what of the holiness of the Samanas, if it was as\nyou say, if there was no learning?!  What, oh Siddhartha, what would\nthen become of all of this what is holy, what is precious, what is\nvenerable on earth?!\"\n\nAnd Govinda mumbled a verse to himself, a verse from an Upanishad:\n\nHe who ponderingly, of a purified spirit, loses himself in the\nmeditation of Atman, unexpressable by words is his blissfulness of his\nheart.\n\nBut Siddhartha remained silent.  He thought about the words which\nGovinda had said to him and thought the words through to their end.\n\nYes, he thought, standing there with his head low, what would remain of\nall that which seemed to us to be holy?  What remains?  What can stand\nthe test?  And he shook his head.\n\nAt one time, when the two young men had lived among the Samanas for\nabout three years and had shared their exercises, some news, a rumour, a\nmyth reached them after being retold many times:  A man had appeared,\nGotama by name, the exalted one, the Buddha, he had overcome the\nsuffering of the world in himself and had halted the cycle of rebirths.\nHe was said to wander through the land, teaching, surrounded by\ndisciples, without possession, without home, without a wife, in the\nyellow cloak of an ascetic, but with a cheerful brow, a man of bliss,\nand Brahmans and princes would bow down before him and would become his\nstudents.\n\nThis myth, this rumour, this legend resounded, its fragrants rose up,\nhere and there; in the towns, the Brahmans spoke of it and in the\nforest, the Samanas; again and again, the name of Gotama, the Buddha\nreached the ears of the young men, with good and with bad talk, with\npraise and with defamation.\n\nIt was as if the plague had broken out in a country and news had been\nspreading around that in one or another place there was a man, a wise\nman, a knowledgeable one, whose word and breath was enough to heal\neveryone who had been infected with the pestilence, and as such news\nwould go through the land and everyone would talk about it, many would\nbelieve, many would doubt, but many would get on their way as soon as\npossible, to seek the wise man, the helper, just like this this myth\nran through the land, that fragrant myth of Gotama, the Buddha, the\nwise man of the family of Sakya.  He possessed, so the believers said,\nthe highest enlightenment, he remembered his previous lives, he had\nreached the nirvana and never returned into the cycle, was never again\nsubmerged in the murky river of physical forms.  Many wonderful and\nunbelievable things were reported of him, he had performed miracles,\nhad overcome the devil, had spoken to the gods.  But his enemies and\ndisbelievers said, this Gotama was a vain seducer, he would spent his\ndays in luxury, scorned the offerings, was without learning, and knew\nneither exercises nor self-castigation.\n\nThe myth of Buddha sounded sweet.  The scent of magic flowed from these\nreports.  After all, the world was sick, life was hard to bear--and\nbehold, here a source seemed to spring forth, here a messenger seemed\nto call out, comforting, mild, full of noble promises.  Everywhere\nwhere the rumour of Buddha was heard, everywhere in the lands of India,\nthe young men listened up, felt a longing, felt hope, and among the\nBrahmans' sons of the towns and villages every pilgrim and stranger was\nwelcome, when he brought news of him, the exalted one, the Sakyamuni.\n\nThe myth had also reached the Samanas in the forest, and also\nSiddhartha, and also Govinda, slowly, drop by drop, every drop laden\nwith hope, every drop laden with doubt.  They rarely talked about it,\nbecause the oldest one of the Samanas did not like this myth.  He had\nheard that this alleged Buddha used to be an ascetic before and had\nlived in the forest, but had then turned back to luxury and worldly\npleasures, and he had no high opinion of this Gotama.\n\n\"Oh Siddhartha,\" Govinda spoke one day to his friend.  \"Today, I was\nin the village, and a Brahman invited me into his house, and in his\nhouse, there was the son of a Brahman from Magadha, who has seen the\nBuddha with his own eyes and has heard him teach.  Verily, this made\nmy chest ache when I breathed, and thought to myself:  If only I would\ntoo, if only we both would too, Siddhartha and me, live to see the\nhour when we will hear the teachings from the mouth of this perfected\nman!  Speak, friend, wouldn't we want to go there too and listen to the\nteachings from the Buddha's mouth?\"\n\nQuoth Siddhartha:  \"Always, oh Govinda, I had thought, Govinda would\nstay with the Samanas, always I had believed his goal was to live to be\nsixty and seventy years of age and to keep on practising those feats and\nexercises, which are becoming a Samana.  But behold, I had not known\nGovinda well enough, I knew little of his heart.  So now you, my\nfaithful friend, want to take a new path and go there, where the Buddha\nspreads his teachings.\"\n\nQuoth Govinda:  \"You're mocking me.  Mock me if you like, Siddhartha!\nBut have you not also developed a desire, an eagerness, to hear these\nteachings?  And have you not at one time said to me, you would not walk\nthe path of the Samanas for much longer?\"\n\nAt this, Siddhartha laughed in his very own manner, in which his voice\nassumed a touch of sadness and a touch of mockery, and said:  \"Well,\nGovinda, you've spoken well, you've remembered correctly.  If you\nonly remembered the other thing as well, you've heard from me, which is\nthat I have grown distrustful and tired against teachings and learning,\nand that my faith in words, which are brought to us by teachers, is\nsmall.  But let's do it, my dear, I am willing to listen to these\nteachings--though in my heart I believe that we've already tasted the\nbest fruit of these teachings.\"\n\nQuoth Govinda:  \"Your willingness delights my heart.  But tell me, how\nshould this be possible?  How should the Gotama's teachings, even before\nwe have heard them, have already revealed their best fruit to us?\"\n\nQuoth Siddhartha:  \"Let us eat this fruit and wait for the rest, oh\nGovinda!  But this fruit, which we already now received thanks to the\nGotama, consisted in him calling us away from the Samanas!  Whether he\nhas also other and better things to give us, oh friend, let us await\nwith calm hearts.\"\n\nOn this very same day, Siddhartha informed the oldest one of the Samanas\nof his decision, that he wanted to leave him.  He informed the oldest\none with all the courtesy and modesty becoming to a younger one and a\nstudent.  But the Samana became angry, because the two young men wanted\nto leave him, and talked loudly and used crude swearwords.\n\nGovinda was startled and became embarrassed.  But Siddhartha put his\nmouth close to Govinda's ear and whispered to him:  \"Now, I want to show\nthe old man that I've learned something from him.\"\n\nPositioning himself closely in front of the Samana, with a concentrated\nsoul, he captured the old man's glance with his glances, deprived him of\nhis power, made him mute, took away his free will, subdued him under his\nown will, commanded him, to do silently, whatever he demanded him to do.\nThe old man became mute, his eyes became motionless, his will was\nparalysed, his arms were hanging down; without power, he had fallen\nvictim to Siddhartha's spell.  But Siddhartha's thoughts brought the\nSamana under their control, he had to carry out, what they commanded.\nAnd thus, the old man made several bows, performed gestures of blessing,\nspoke stammeringly a godly wish for a good journey.  And the young men\nreturned the bows with thanks, returned the wish, went on their way with\nsalutations.\n\nOn the way, Govinda said:  \"Oh Siddhartha, you have learned more from\nthe Samanas than I knew.  It is hard, it is very hard to cast a spell\non an old Samana.  Truly, if you had stayed there, you would soon have\nlearned to walk on water.\"\n\n\"I do not seek to walk on water,\" said Siddhartha.  \"Let old Samanas be\ncontent with such feats!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nGOTAMA\n\n\nIn the town of Savathi, every child knew the name of the exalted Buddha,\nand every house was prepared to fill the alms-dish of Gotama's\ndisciples, the silently begging ones.  Near the town was Gotama's\nfavourite place to stay, the grove of Jetavana, which the rich merchant\nAnathapindika, an obedient worshipper of the exalted one, had given him\nand his people for a gift.\n\nAll tales and answers, which the two young ascetics had received in\ntheir search for Gotama's abode, had pointed them towards this area.\nAnd arriving at Savathi, in the very first house, before the door of\nwhich they stopped to beg, food has been offered to them, and they\naccepted the food, and Siddhartha asked the woman, who handed them the\nfood:\n\n\"We would like to know, oh charitable one, where the Buddha dwells, the\nmost venerable one, for we are two Samanas from the forest and have\ncome, to see him, the perfected one, and to hear the teachings from his\nmouth.\"\n\nQuoth the woman:  \"Here, you have truly come to the right place, you\nSamanas from the forest.  You should know, in Jetavana, in the garden\nof Anathapindika is where the exalted one dwells.  There you pilgrims\nshall spent the night, for there is enough space for the innumerable,\nwho flock here, to hear the teachings from his mouth.\"\n\nThis made Govinda happy, and full of joy he exclaimed:  \"Well so, thus\nwe have reached our destination, and our path has come to an end!  But\ntell us, oh mother of the pilgrims, do you know him, the Buddha, have\nyou seen him with your own eyes?\"\n\nQuoth the woman:  \"Many times I have seen him, the exalted one.  On many\ndays, I have seen him, walking through the alleys in silence, wearing\nhis yellow cloak, presenting his alms-dish in silence at the doors of\nthe houses, leaving with a filled dish.\"\n\nDelightedly, Govinda listened and wanted to ask and hear much more.\nBut Siddhartha urged him to walk on.  They thanked and left and hardly\nhad to ask for directions, for rather many pilgrims and monks as well\nfrom Gotama's community were on their way to the Jetavana.  And since\nthey reached it at night, there were constant arrivals, shouts, and\ntalk of those who sought shelter and got it.  The two Samanas,\naccustomed to life in the forest, found quickly and without making any\nnoise a place to stay and rested there until the morning.\n\nAt sunrise, they saw with astonishment what a large crowd of believers\nand curious people had spent the night here.  On all paths of the\nmarvellous grove, monks walked in yellow robes, under the trees they\nsat here and there, in deep contemplation--or in a conversation about\nspiritual matters, the shady gardens looked like a city, full of people,\nbustling like bees.  The majority of the monks went out with their\nalms-dish, to collect food in town for their lunch, the only meal of the\nday.  The Buddha himself, the enlightened one, was also in the habit of\ntaking this walk to beg in the morning.\n\nSiddhartha saw him, and he instantly recognised him, as if a god had\npointed him out to him.  He saw him, a simple man in a yellow robe,\nbearing the alms-dish in his hand, walking silently.\n\n\"Look here!\" Siddhartha said quietly to Govinda.  \"This one is the\nBuddha.\"\n\nAttentively, Govinda looked at the monk in the yellow robe, who seemed\nto be in no way different from the hundreds of other monks.  And soon,\nGovinda also realized:  This is the one.  And they followed him and\nobserved him.\n\nThe Buddha went on his way, modestly and deep in his thoughts, his\ncalm face was neither happy nor sad, it seemed to smile quietly and\ninwardly.  With a hidden smile, quiet, calm, somewhat resembling a\nhealthy child, the Buddha walked, wore the robe and placed his feet\njust as all of his monks did, according to a precise rule.  But his\nface and his walk, his quietly lowered glance, his quietly dangling hand\nand even every finger of his quietly dangling hand expressed peace,\nexpressed perfection, did not search, did not imitate, breathed softly\nin an unwhithering calm, in an unwhithering light, an untouchable peace.\n\nThus Gotama walked towards the town, to collect alms, and the two\nSamanas recognised him solely by the perfection of his calm, by the\nquietness of his appearance, in which there was no searching, no desire,\nno imitation, no effort to be seen, only light and peace.\n\n\"Today, we'll hear the teachings from his mouth.\" said Govinda.\n\nSiddhartha did not answer.  He felt little curiosity for the teachings,\nhe did not believe that they would teach him anything new, but he had,\njust as Govinda had, heard the contents of this Buddha's teachings\nagain and again, though these reports only represented second- or\nthird-hand information.  But attentively he looked at Gotama's head,\nhis shoulders, his feet, his quietly dangling hand, and it seemed to\nhim as if every joint of every finger of this hand was of these\nteachings, spoke of, breathed of, exhaled the fragrant of, glistened of\ntruth.  This man, this Buddha was truthful down to the gesture of his\nlast finger.  This man was holy.  Never before, Siddhartha had venerated\na person so much, never before he had loved a person as much as this\none.\n\nThey both followed the Buddha until they reached the town and then\nreturned in silence, for they themselves intended to abstain from\non this day.  They saw Gotama returning--what he ate could not even have\nsatisfied a bird's appetite, and they saw him retiring into the shade\nof the mango-trees.\n\nBut in the evening, when the heat cooled down and everyone in the camp\nstarted to bustle about and gathered around, they heard the Buddha\nteaching.  They heard his voice, and it was also perfected, was of\nperfect calmness, was full of peace.  Gotama taught the teachings of\nsuffering, of the origin of suffering, of the way to relieve suffering.\nCalmly and clearly his quiet speech flowed on.  Suffering was life,\nfull of suffering was the world, but salvation from suffering had been\nfound:  salvation was obtained by him who would walk the path of the\nBuddha.  With a soft, yet firm voice the exalted one spoke, taught the\nfour main doctrines, taught the eightfold path, patiently he went the\nusual path of the teachings, of the examples, of the repetitions,\nbrightly and quietly his voice hovered over the listeners, like a light,\nlike a starry sky.\n\nWhen the Buddha--night had already fallen--ended his speech, many a\npilgrim stepped forward and asked to accepted into the community, sought\nrefuge in the teachings.  And Gotama accepted them by speaking:  \"You\nhave heard the teachings well, it has come to you well.  Thus join us\nand walk in holiness, to put an end to all suffering.\"\n\nBehold, then Govinda, the shy one, also stepped forward and spoke:  \"I\nalso take my refuge in the exalted one and his teachings,\" and he asked\nto accepted into the community of his disciples and was accepted.\n\nRight afterwards, when the Buddha had retired for the night, Govinda\nturned to Siddhartha and spoke eagerly:  \"Siddhartha, it is not my place\nto scold you.  We have both heard the exalted one, we have both\nperceived the teachings.  Govinda has heard the teachings, he has taken\nrefuge in it.  But you, my honoured friend, don't you also want to walk\nthe path of salvation?  Would you want to hesitate, do you want to wait\nany longer?\"\n\nSiddhartha awakened as if he had been asleep, when he heard Govinda's\nwords.  For a long time, he looked into Govinda's face.  Then he spoke\nquietly, in a voice without mockery:  \"Govinda, my friend, now you have\ntaken this step, now you have chosen this path.  Always, oh Govinda,\nyou've been my friend, you've always walked one step behind me.  Often I\nhave thought:  Won't Govinda for once also take a step by himself,\nwithout me, out of his own soul?  Behold, now you've turned into a man\nand are choosing your path for yourself.  I wish that you would go it up\nto its end, oh my friend, that you shall find salvation!\"\n\nGovinda, not completely understanding it yet, repeated his question in\nan impatient tone:  \"Speak up, I beg you, my dear!  Tell me, since it\ncould not be any other way, that you also, my learned friend, will take\nyour refuge with the exalted Buddha!\"\n\nSiddhartha placed his hand on Govinda's shoulder:  \"You failed to hear\nmy good wish for you, oh Govinda.  I'm repeating it:  I wish that you\nwould go this path up to its end, that you shall find salvation!\"\n\nIn this moment, Govinda realized that his friend had left him, and he\nstarted to weep.\n\n\"Siddhartha!\" he exclaimed lamentingly.\n\nSiddhartha kindly spoke to him:  \"Don't forget, Govinda, that you are\nnow one of the Samanas of the Buddha!  You have renounced your home\nand your parents, renounced your birth and possessions, renounced your\nfree will, renounced all friendship.  This is what the teachings\nrequire, this is what the exalted one wants.  This is what you wanted\nfor yourself.  Tomorrow, oh Govinda, I'll leave you.\"\n\nFor a long time, the friends continued walking in the grove; for a long\ntime, they lay there and found no sleep.  And over and over again,\nGovinda urged his friend, he should tell him why he would not want to\nseek refuge in Gotama's teachings, what fault he would find in these\nteachings.  But Siddhartha turned him away every time and said:  \"Be\ncontent, Govinda!  Very good are the teachings of the exalted one, how\ncould I find a fault in them?\"\n\nVery early in the morning, a follower of Buddha, one of his oldest\nmonks, went through the garden and called all those to him who had as\nnovices taken their refuge in the teachings, to dress them up in the\nyellow robe and to instruct them in the first teachings and duties of\ntheir position.  Then Govinda broke loose, embraced once again his\nchildhood friend and left with the novices.\n\nBut Siddhartha walked through the grove, lost in thought.\n\nThen he happened to meet Gotama, the exalted one, and when he greeted\nhim with respect and the Buddha's glance was so full of kindness and\ncalm, the young man summoned his courage and asked the venerable one for\nthe permission to talk to him.  Silently the exalted one nodded his\napproval.\n\nQuoth Siddhartha:  \"Yesterday, oh exalted one, I had been privileged to\nhear your wondrous teachings.  Together with my friend, I had come from\nafar, to hear your teachings.  And now my friend is going to stay with\nyour people, he has taken his refuge with you.  But I will again start\non my pilgrimage.\"\n\n\"As you please,\" the venerable one spoke politely.\n\n\"Too bold is my speech,\" Siddhartha continued, \"but I do not want to\nleave the exalted one without having honestly told him my thoughts.\nDoes it please the venerable one to listen to me for one moment longer?\"\n\nSilently, the Buddha nodded his approval.\n\nQuoth Siddhartha:  \"One thing, oh most venerable one, I have admired in\nyour teachings most of all.  Everything in your teachings is perfectly\nclear, is proven; you are presenting the world as a perfect chain, a\nchain which is never and nowhere broken, an eternal chain the links of\nwhich are causes and effects.  Never before, this has been seen so\nclearly; never before, this has been presented so irrefutably; truly,\nthe heart of every Brahman has to beat stronger with love, once he has\nseen the world through your teachings perfectly connected, without gaps,\nclear as a crystal, not depending on chance, not depending on gods.\nWhether it may be good or bad, whether living according to it would be\nsuffering or joy, I do not wish to discuss, possibly this is not\nessential--but the uniformity of the world, that everything which\nhappens is connected, that the great and the small things are all\nencompassed by the same forces of time, by the same law of causes, of\ncoming into being and of dying, this is what shines brightly out of your\nexalted teachings, oh perfected one.  But according to your very own\nteachings, this unity and necessary sequence of all things is\nnevertheless broken in one place, through a small gap, this world of\nunity is invaded by something alien, something new, something which had\nnot been there before, and which cannot be demonstrated and cannot be\nproven: these are your teachings of overcoming the world, of salvation.\nBut with this small gap, with this small breach, the entire eternal and\nuniform law of the world is breaking apart again and becomes void.\nPlease forgive me for expressing this objection.\"\n\nQuietly, Gotama had listened to him, unmoved.  Now he spoke, the\nperfected one, with his kind, with his polite and clear voice:  \"You've\nheard the teachings, oh son of a Brahman, and good for you that you've\nthought about it thus deeply.  You've found a gap in it, an error.  You\nshould think about this further.  But be warned, oh seeker of knowledge,\nof the thicket of opinions and of arguing about words.  There is nothing\nto opinions, they may be beautiful or ugly, smart or foolish, everyone\ncan support them or discard them.  But the teachings, you've heard from\nme, are no opinion, and their goal is not to explain the world to those\nwho seek knowledge.  They have a different goal; their goal is salvation\nfrom suffering.  This is what Gotama teaches, nothing else.\"\n\n\"I wish that you, oh exalted one, would not be angry with me,\" said the\nyoung man.  \"I have not spoken to you like this to argue with you, to\nargue about words.  You are truly right, there is little to opinions.\nBut let me say this one more thing:  I have not doubted in you for a\nsingle moment.  I have not doubted for a single moment that you are\nBuddha, that you have reached the goal, the highest goal towards which\nso many thousands of Brahmans and sons of Brahmans are on their way.\nYou have found salvation from death.  It has come to you in the course\nof your own search, on your own path, through thoughts, through\nmeditation, through realizations, through enlightenment.  It has not\ncome to you by means of teachings!  And--thus is my thought, oh exalted\none,--nobody will obtain salvation by means of teachings!  You will not\nbe able to convey and say to anybody, oh venerable one, in words and\nthrough teachings what has happened to you in the hour of enlightenment!\nThe teachings of the enlightened Buddha contain much, it teaches many to\nlive righteously, to avoid evil.  But there is one thing which these so\nclear, these so venerable teachings do not contain:  they do not contain\nthe mystery of what the exalted one has experienced for himself, he\nalone among hundreds of thousands.  This is what I have thought and\nrealized, when I have heard the teachings.  This is why I am continuing\nmy travels--not to seek other, better teachings, for I know there are\nnone, but to depart from all teachings and all teachers and to reach my\ngoal by myself or to die.  But often, I'll think of this day, oh exalted\none, and of this hour, when my eyes beheld a holy man.\"\n\nThe Buddha's eyes quietly looked to the ground; quietly, in perfect\nequanimity his inscrutable face was smiling.\n\n\"I wish,\" the venerable one spoke slowly, \"that your thoughts shall not\nbe in error, that you shall reach the goal!  But tell me:  Have you seen\nthe multitude of my Samanas, my many brothers, who have taken refuge in\nthe teachings?  And do you believe, oh stranger, oh Samana, do you\nbelieve that it would be better for them all the abandon the teachings\nand to return into the life the world and of desires?\"\n\n\"Far is such a thought from my mind,\" exclaimed Siddhartha.  \"I wish\nthat they shall all stay with the teachings, that they shall reach their\ngoal!  It is not my place to judge another person's life.  Only for\nmyself, for myself alone, I must decide, I must chose, I must refuse.\nSalvation from the self is what we Samanas search for, oh exalted one.\nIf I merely were one of your disciples, oh venerable one, I'd fear that\nit might happen to me that only seemingly, only deceptively my self\nwould be calm and be redeemed, but that in truth it would live on and\ngrow, for then I had replaced my self with the teachings, my duty to\nfollow you, my love for you, and the community of the monks!\"\n\nWith half of a smile, with an unwavering openness and kindness,\nGotama looked into the stranger's eyes and bid him to leave with a\nhardly noticeable gesture.\n\n\"You are wise, oh Samana.\", the venerable one spoke.\n\n\"You know how to talk wisely, my friend.  Be aware of too much wisdom!\"\n\nThe Buddha turned away, and his glance and half of a smile remained\nforever etched in Siddhartha's memory.\n\nI have never before seen a person glance and smile, sit and walk this\nway, he thought; truly, I wish to be able to glance and smile, sit and\nwalk this way, too, thus free, thus venerable, thus concealed, thus\nopen, thus child-like and mysterious.  Truly, only a person who has\nsucceeded in reaching the innermost part of his self would glance and\nwalk this way.  Well so, I also will seek to reach the innermost part\nof my self.\n\nI saw a man, Siddhartha thought, a single man, before whom I would have\nto lower my glance.  I do not want to lower my glance before any other,\nnot before any other.  No teachings will entice me any more, since this\nman's teachings have not enticed me.\n\nI am deprived by the Buddha, thought Siddhartha, I am deprived, and\neven more he has given to me.  He has deprived me of my friend, the one\nwho had believed in me and now believes in him, who had been my shadow\nand is now Gotama's shadow.  But he has given me Siddhartha, myself.\n\n\n\n\n\nAWAKENING\n\n\nWhen Siddhartha left the grove, where the Buddha, the perfected one,\nstayed behind, where Govinda stayed behind, then he felt that in this\ngrove his past life also stayed behind and parted from him.  He pondered\nabout this sensation, which filled him completely, as he was slowly\nwalking along.  He pondered deeply, like diving into a deep water he\nlet himself sink down to the ground of the sensation, down to the place\nwhere the causes lie, because to identify the causes, so it seemed to\nhim, is the very essence of thinking, and by this alone sensations turn\ninto realizations and are not lost, but become entities and start to\nemit like rays of light what is inside of them.\n\nSlowly walking along, Siddhartha pondered.  He realized that he was no\nyouth any more, but had turned into a man.  He realized that one thing\nhad left him, as a snake is left by its old skin, that one thing no\nlonger existed in him, which had accompanied him throughout his youth\nand used to be a part of him: the wish to have teachers and to listen to\nteachings.  He had also left the last teacher who had appeared on his\npath, even him, the highest and wisest teacher, the most holy one,\nBuddha, he had left him, had to part with him, was not able to accept\nhis teachings.\n\nSlower, he walked along in his thoughts and asked himself:  \"But what\nis this, what you have sought to learn from teachings and from teachers,\nand what they, who have taught you much, were still unable to teach\nyou?\"  And he found:  \"It was the self, the purpose and essence of which\nI sought to learn.  It was the self, I wanted to free myself from, which\nI sought to overcome.  But I was not able to overcome it, could only\ndeceive it, could only flee from it, only hide from it.  Truly, no\nthing in this world has kept my thoughts thus busy, as this my very own\nself, this mystery of me being alive, of me being one and being\nseparated and isolated from all others, of me being Siddhartha!  And\nthere is no thing in this world I know less about than about me, about\nSiddhartha!\"\n\nHaving been pondering while slowly walking along, he now stopped as\nthese thoughts caught hold of him, and right away another thought sprang\nforth from these, a new thought, which was:  \"That I know nothing about\nmyself, that Siddhartha has remained thus alien and unknown to me, stems\nfrom one cause, a single cause:  I was afraid of myself, I was fleeing\nfrom myself!  I searched Atman, I searched Brahman, I was willing to\ndissect my self and peel off all of its layers, to find the core of\nall peels in its unknown interior, the Atman, life, the divine part, the\nultimate part.  But I have lost myself in the process.\"\n\nSiddhartha opened his eyes and looked around, a smile filled his face\nand a feeling of awakening from long dreams flowed through him from his\nhead down to his toes.  And it was not long before he walked again,\nwalked quickly like a man who knows what he has got to do.\n\n### Summary:"}
{"original_length": 17269, "trunc_length": 16384, "text": "\n\nSummarize the following text into a summary of less than 800 words.\n### Text:\n\n\n     A Monk there was, a fayre for the maistrie,\n     An outrider that loved venerie;\n     A manly man, to be an Abbot able,\n     Full many a daintie horse had he in stable:\n     And whan he rode, men might his bridle hear\n     Gingeling in a whistling wind as clear,\n     And eke as loud, as doth the chapell bell,\n     There as this lord was keeper of the cell.\n     --Chaucer.\n\nNotwithstanding the occasional exhortation and chiding of his companion,\nthe noise of the horsemen's feet continuing to approach, Wamba could\nnot be prevented from lingering occasionally on the road, upon every\npretence which occurred; now catching from the hazel a cluster of\nhalf-ripe nuts, and now turning his head to leer after a cottage maiden\nwho crossed their path. The horsemen, therefore, soon overtook them on\nthe road.\n\nTheir numbers amounted to ten men, of whom the two who rode foremost\nseemed to be persons of considerable importance, and the others\ntheir attendants. It was not difficult to ascertain the condition and\ncharacter of one of these personages. He was obviously an ecclesiastic\nof high rank; his dress was that of a Cistercian Monk, but composed of\nmaterials much finer than those which the rule of that order admitted.\nHis mantle and hood were of the best Flanders cloth, and fell in ample,\nand not ungraceful folds, around a handsome, though somewhat corpulent\nperson. His countenance bore as little the marks of self-denial, as his\nhabit indicated contempt of worldly splendour. His features might have\nbeen called good, had there not lurked under the pent-house of his eye,\nthat sly epicurean twinkle which indicates the cautious voluptuary.\nIn other respects, his profession and situation had taught him a ready\ncommand over his countenance, which he could contract at pleasure into\nsolemnity, although its natural expression was that of good-humoured\nsocial indulgence. In defiance of conventual rules, and the edicts of\npopes and councils, the sleeves of this dignitary were lined and turned\nup with rich furs, his mantle secured at the throat with a golden\nclasp, and the whole dress proper to his order as much refined upon and\nornamented, as that of a quaker beauty of the present day, who, while\nshe retains the garb and costume of her sect continues to give to its\nsimplicity, by the choice of materials and the mode of disposing them,\na certain air of coquettish attraction, savouring but too much of the\nvanities of the world.\n\nThis worthy churchman rode upon a well-fed ambling mule, whose furniture\nwas highly decorated, and whose bridle, according to the fashion of the\nday, was ornamented with silver bells. In his seat he had nothing of the\nawkwardness of the convent, but displayed the easy and habitual grace of\na well-trained horseman. Indeed, it seemed that so humble a conveyance\nas a mule, in however good case, and however well broken to a pleasant\nand accommodating amble, was only used by the gallant monk for\ntravelling on the road. A lay brother, one of those who followed in the\ntrain, had, for his use on other occasions, one of the most handsome\nSpanish jennets ever bred at Andalusia, which merchants used at that\ntime to import, with great trouble and risk, for the use of persons of\nwealth and distinction. The saddle and housings of this superb palfrey\nwere covered by a long foot-cloth, which reached nearly to the ground,\nand on which were richly embroidered, mitres, crosses, and other\necclesiastical emblems. Another lay brother led a sumpter mule, loaded\nprobably with his superior's baggage; and two monks of his own order,\nof inferior station, rode together in the rear, laughing and conversing\nwith each other, without taking much notice of the other members of the\ncavalcade.\n\nThe companion of the church dignitary was a man past forty, thin,\nstrong, tall, and muscular; an athletic figure, which long fatigue and\nconstant exercise seemed to have left none of the softer part of the\nhuman form, having reduced the whole to brawn, bones, and sinews, which\nhad sustained a thousand toils, and were ready to dare a thousand more.\nHis head was covered with a scarlet cap, faced with fur--of that kind\nwhich the French call \"mortier\", from its resemblance to the shape of an\ninverted mortar. His countenance was therefore fully displayed, and its\nexpression was calculated to impress a degree of awe, if not of\nfear, upon strangers. High features, naturally strong and powerfully\nexpressive, had been burnt almost into Negro blackness by constant\nexposure to the tropical sun, and might, in their ordinary state, be\nsaid to slumber after the storm of passion had passed away; but the\nprojection of the veins of the forehead, the readiness with which the\nupper lip and its thick black moustaches quivered upon the slightest\nemotion, plainly intimated that the tempest might be again and easily\nawakened. His keen, piercing, dark eyes, told in every glance a history\nof difficulties subdued, and dangers dared, and seemed to challenge\nopposition to his wishes, for the pleasure of sweeping it from his road\nby a determined exertion of courage and of will; a deep scar on his brow\ngave additional sternness to his countenance, and a sinister expression\nto one of his eyes, which had been slightly injured on the same\noccasion, and of which the vision, though perfect, was in a slight and\npartial degree distorted.\n\nThe upper dress of this personage resembled that of his companion in\nshape, being a long monastic mantle; but the colour, being scarlet,\nshowed that he did not belong to any of the four regular orders of\nmonks. On the right shoulder of the mantle there was cut, in white\ncloth, a cross of a peculiar form. This upper robe concealed what at\nfirst view seemed rather inconsistent with its form, a shirt, namely, of\nlinked mail, with sleeves and gloves of the same, curiously plaited and\ninterwoven, as flexible to the body as those which are now wrought in\nthe stocking-loom, out of less obdurate materials. The fore-part of his\nthighs, where the folds of his mantle permitted them to be seen, were\nalso covered with linked mail; the knees and feet were defended by\nsplints, or thin plates of steel, ingeniously jointed upon each\nother; and mail hose, reaching from the ankle to the knee, effectually\nprotected the legs, and completed the rider's defensive armour. In\nhis girdle he wore a long and double-edged dagger, which was the only\noffensive weapon about his person.\n\nHe rode, not a mule, like his companion, but a strong hackney for the\nroad, to save his gallant war-horse, which a squire led behind, fully\naccoutred for battle, with a chamfron or plaited head-piece upon his\nhead, having a short spike projecting from the front. On one side of the\nsaddle hung a short battle-axe, richly inlaid with Damascene carving;\non the other the rider's plumed head-piece and hood of mail, with a long\ntwo-handed sword, used by the chivalry of the period. A second squire\nheld aloft his master's lance, from the extremity of which fluttered a\nsmall banderole, or streamer, bearing a cross of the same form with that\nembroidered upon his cloak. He also carried his small triangular\nshield, broad enough at the top to protect the breast, and from thence\ndiminishing to a point. It was covered with a scarlet cloth, which\nprevented the device from being seen.\n\nThese two squires were followed by two attendants, whose dark visages,\nwhite turbans, and the Oriental form of their garments, showed them to\nbe natives of some distant Eastern country. [9]\n\nThe whole appearance of this warrior and his retinue was wild and\noutlandish; the dress of his squires was gorgeous, and his Eastern\nattendants wore silver collars round their throats, and bracelets of the\nsame metal upon their swarthy arms and legs, of which the former were\nnaked from the elbow, and the latter from mid-leg to ankle. Silk and\nembroidery distinguished their dresses, and marked the wealth and\nimportance of their master; forming, at the same time, a striking\ncontrast with the martial simplicity of his own attire. They were armed\nwith crooked sabres, having the hilt and baldric inlaid with gold, and\nmatched with Turkish daggers of yet more costly workmanship. Each of\nthem bore at his saddle-bow a bundle of darts or javelins, about four\nfeet in length, having sharp steel heads, a weapon much in use among\nthe Saracens, and of which the memory is yet preserved in the martial\nexercise called \"El Jerrid\", still practised in the Eastern countries.\n\nThe steeds of these attendants were in appearance as foreign as their\nriders. They were of Saracen origin, and consequently of Arabian\ndescent; and their fine slender limbs, small fetlocks, thin manes, and\neasy springy motion, formed a marked contrast with the large-jointed,\nheavy horses, of which the race was cultivated in Flanders and in\nNormandy, for mounting the men-at-arms of the period in all the panoply\nof plate and mail; and which, placed by the side of those Eastern\ncoursers, might have passed for a personification of substance and of\nshadow.\n\nThe singular appearance of this cavalcade not only attracted the\ncuriosity of Wamba, but excited even that of his less volatile\ncompanion. The monk he instantly knew to be the Prior of Jorvaulx\nAbbey, well known for many miles around as a lover of the chase, of\nthe banquet, and, if fame did him not wrong, of other worldly pleasures\nstill more inconsistent with his monastic vows.\n\nYet so loose were the ideas of the times respecting the conduct of the\nclergy, whether secular or regular, that the Prior Aymer maintained a\nfair character in the neighbourhood of his abbey. His free and jovial\ntemper, and the readiness with which he granted absolution from all\nordinary delinquencies, rendered him a favourite among the nobility and\nprincipal gentry, to several of whom he was allied by birth, being of\na distinguished Norman family. The ladies, in particular, were not\ndisposed to scan too nicely the morals of a man who was a professed\nadmirer of their sex, and who possessed many means of dispelling the\nennui which was too apt to intrude upon the halls and bowers of an\nancient feudal castle. The Prior mingled in the sports of the field with\nmore than due eagerness, and was allowed to possess the best-trained\nhawks, and the fleetest greyhounds in the North Riding; circumstances\nwhich strongly recommended him to the youthful gentry. With the old,\nhe had another part to play, which, when needful, he could sustain\nwith great decorum. His knowledge of books, however superficial, was\nsufficient to impress upon their ignorance respect for his supposed\nlearning; and the gravity of his deportment and language, with the high\ntone which he exerted in setting forth the authority of the church\nand of the priesthood, impressed them no less with an opinion of his\nsanctity. Even the common people, the severest critics of the conduct of\ntheir betters, had commiseration with the follies of Prior Aymer. He\nwas generous; and charity, as it is well known, covereth a multitude\nof sins, in another sense than that in which it is said to do so in\nScripture. The revenues of the monastery, of which a large part was at\nhis disposal, while they gave him the means of supplying his own very\nconsiderable expenses, afforded also those largesses which he bestowed\namong the peasantry, and with which he frequently relieved the\ndistresses of the oppressed. If Prior Aymer rode hard in the chase, or\nremained long at the banquet,--if Prior Aymer was seen, at the early\npeep of dawn, to enter the postern of the abbey, as he glided home\nfrom some rendezvous which had occupied the hours of darkness, men\nonly shrugged up their shoulders, and reconciled themselves to his\nirregularities, by recollecting that the same were practised by many\nof his brethren who had no redeeming qualities whatsoever to atone for\nthem. Prior Aymer, therefore, and his character, were well known to\nour Saxon serfs, who made their rude obeisance, and received his\n\"benedicite, mes filz,\" in return.\n\nBut the singular appearance of his companion and his attendants,\narrested their attention and excited their wonder, and they could\nscarcely attend to the Prior of Jorvaulx' question, when he demanded if\nthey knew of any place of harbourage in the vicinity; so much were they\nsurprised at the half monastic, half military appearance of the swarthy\nstranger, and at the uncouth dress and arms of his Eastern attendants.\nIt is probable, too, that the language in which the benediction was\nconferred, and the information asked, sounded ungracious, though not\nprobably unintelligible, in the ears of the Saxon peasants.\n\n\"I asked you, my children,\" said the Prior, raising his voice, and using\nthe lingua Franca, or mixed language, in which the Norman and Saxon\nraces conversed with each other, \"if there be in this neighbourhood any\ngood man, who, for the love of God, and devotion to Mother Church,\nwill give two of her humblest servants, with their train, a night's\nhospitality and refreshment?\"\n\nThis he spoke with a tone of conscious importance, which formed a strong\ncontrast to the modest terms which he thought it proper to employ.\n\n\"Two of the humblest servants of Mother Church!\" repeated Wamba to\nhimself,--but, fool as he was, taking care not to make his observation\naudible; \"I should like to see her seneschals, her chief butlers, and\nother principal domestics!\"\n\nAfter this internal commentary on the Prior's speech, he raised his\neyes, and replied to the question which had been put.\n\n\"If the reverend fathers,\" he said, \"loved good cheer and soft lodging,\nfew miles of riding would carry them to the Priory of Brinxworth, where\ntheir quality could not but secure them the most honourable reception;\nor if they preferred spending a penitential evening, they might turn\ndown yonder wild glade, which would bring them to the hermitage of\nCopmanhurst, where a pious anchoret would make them sharers for the\nnight of the shelter of his roof and the benefit of his prayers.\"\n\nThe Prior shook his head at both proposals.\n\n\"Mine honest friend,\" said he, \"if the jangling of thy bells had not\ndizzied thine understanding, thou mightst know \"Clericus clericum non\ndecimat\"; that is to say, we churchmen do not exhaust each other's\nhospitality, but rather require that of the laity, giving them thus\nan opportunity to serve God in honouring and relieving his appointed\nservants.\"\n\n\"It is true,\" replied Wamba, \"that I, being but an ass, am,\nnevertheless, honoured to hear the bells as well as your reverence's\nmule; notwithstanding, I did conceive that the charity of Mother Church\nand her servants might be said, with other charity, to begin at home.\"\n\n\"A truce to thine insolence, fellow,\" said the armed rider, breaking in\non his prattle with a high and stern voice, \"and tell us, if thou canst,\nthe road to--How call'd you your Franklin, Prior Aymer?\"\n\n\"Cedric,\" answered the Prior; \"Cedric the Saxon.--Tell me, good fellow,\nare we near his dwelling, and can you show us the road?\"\n\n\"The road will be uneasy to find,\" answered Gurth, who broke silence for\nthe first time, \"and the family of Cedric retire early to rest.\"\n\n\"Tush, tell not me, fellow,\" said the military rider; \"'tis easy for\nthem to arise and supply the wants of travellers such as we are, who\nwill not stoop to beg the hospitality which we have a right to command.\"\n\n\"I know not,\" said Gurth, sullenly, \"if I should show the way to my\nmaster's house, to those who demand as a right, the shelter which most\nare fain to ask as a favour.\"\n\n\"Do you dispute with me, slave!\" said the soldier; and, setting spurs\nto his horse, he caused him make a demivolte across the path, raising at\nthe same time the riding rod which he held in his hand, with a purpose\nof chastising what he considered as the insolence of the peasant.\n\nGurth darted at him a savage and revengeful scowl, and with a fierce,\nyet hesitating motion, laid his hand on the haft of his knife; but the\ninterference of Prior Aymer, who pushed his mule betwixt his companion\nand the swineherd, prevented the meditated violence.\n\n\"Nay, by St Mary, brother Brian, you must not think you are now in\nPalestine, predominating over heathen Turks and infidel Saracens; we\nislanders love not blows, save those of holy Church, who chasteneth whom\nshe loveth.--Tell me, good fellow,\" said he to Wamba, and seconded his\nspeech by a small piece of silver coin, \"the way to Cedric the Saxon's;\nyou cannot be ignorant of it, and it is your duty to direct the wanderer\neven when his character is less sanctified than ours.\"\n\n\"In truth, venerable father,\" answered the Jester, \"the Saracen head of\nyour right reverend companion has frightened out of mine the way home--I\nam not sure I shall get there to-night myself.\"\n\n\"Tush,\" said the Abbot, \"thou canst tell us if thou wilt. This reverend\nbrother has been all his life engaged in fighting among the Saracens\nfor the recovery of the Holy Sepulchre; he is of the order of Knights\nTemplars, whom you may have heard of; he is half a monk, half a\nsoldier.\"\n\n\"If he is but half a monk,\" said the Jester, \"he should not be wholly\nunreasonable with those whom he meets upon the road, even if they should\nbe in no hurry to answer questions that no way concern them.\"\n\n\"I forgive thy wit,\" replied the Abbot, \"on condition thou wilt show me\nthe way to Cedric's mansion.\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" answered Wamba, \"your reverences must hold on this path\ntill you come to a sunken cross, of which scarce a cubit's length\nremains above ground; then take the path to the left, for there are\nfour which meet at Sunken Cross, and I trust your reverences will obtain\nshelter before the storm comes on.\"\n\nThe Abbot thanked his sage adviser; and the cavalcade, setting spurs to\ntheir horses, rode on as men do who wish to reach their inn before the\nbursting of a night-storm. As their horses' hoofs died away, Gurth\nsaid to his companion, \"If they follow thy wise direction, the reverend\nfathers will hardly reach Rotherwood this night.\"\n\n\"No,\" said the Jester, grinning, \"but they may reach Sheffield if they\nhave good luck, and that is as fit a place for them. I am not so bad a\nwoodsman as to show the dog where the deer lies, if I have no mind he\nshould chase him.\"\n\n\"Thou art right,\" said Gurth; \"it were ill that Aymer saw the Lady\nRowena; and it were worse, it may be, for Cedric to quarrel, as is most\nlikely he would, with this military monk. But, like good servants let us\nhear and see, and say nothing.\"\n\nWe return to the riders, who had soon left the bondsmen far behind\nthem, and who maintained the following conversation in the Norman-French\nlanguage, usually employed by the superior classes, with the exception\nof the few who were still inclined to boast their Saxon descent.\n\n\"What mean these fellows by their capricious insolence?\" said the\nTemplar to the Benedictine, \"and why did you prevent me from chastising\nit?\"\n\n\"Marry, brother Brian,\" replied the Prior, \"touching the one of them, it\nwere hard for me to render a reason for a fool speaking according to his\nfolly; and the other churl is of that savage, fierce, intractable race,\nsome of whom, as I have often told you, are still to be found among the\ndescendants of the conquered Saxons, and whose supreme pleasure it is\nto testify, by all means in their power, their aversion to their\nconquerors.\"\n\n\"I would soon have beat him into courtesy,\" observed Brian; \"I am\naccustomed to deal with such spirits: Our Turkish captives are as fierce\nand intractable as Odin himself could have been; yet two months in my\nhousehold, under the management of my master of the slaves, has made\nthem humble, submissive, serviceable, and observant of your will. Marry,\nsir, you must be aware of the poison and the dagger; for they use either\nwith free will when you give them the slightest opportunity.\"\n\n\"Ay, but,\" answered Prior Aymer, \"every land has its own manners and\nfashions; and, besides that beating this fellow could procure us no\ninformation respecting the road to Cedric's house, it would have been\nsure to have established a quarrel betwixt you and him had we found our\nway thither. Remember what I told you: this wealthy franklin is proud,\nfierce, jealous, and irritable, a withstander of the nobility, and even\nof his neighbors, Reginald Front-de-Boeuf and Philip Malvoisin, who are\nno babies to strive with. He stands up sternly for the privileges of\nhis race, and is so proud of his uninterrupted descend from Hereward, a\nrenowned champion of the Heptarchy, that he is universally called Cedric\nthe Saxon; and makes a boast of his belonging to a people from whom\nmany others endeaver to hide their descent, lest they should encounter a\nshare of the 'vae victis,' or severities imposed upon the vanquished.\"\n\n\"Prior Aymer,\" said the Templar, \"you are a man of gallantry, learned\nin the study of beauty, and as expert as a troubadour in all matters\nconcerning the 'arrets' of love; but I shall expect much beauty in this\ncelebrated Rowena to counterbalance the self-denial and forbearance\nwhich I must exert if I am to court the favor of such a seditious churl\nas you have described her father Cedric.\"\n\n\"Cedric is not her father,\" replied the Prior, \"and is but of remote\nrelation: she is descended from higher blood than even he pretends to,\nand is but distantly connected with him by birth. Her guardian, however,\nhe is, self-constituted as I believe; but his ward is as dear to him as\nif she were his own child. Of her beauty you shall soon be judge; and if\nthe purity of her complexion, and the majestic, yet soft expression of a\nmild blue eye, do not chase from your memory the black-tressed girls of\nPalestine, ay, or the houris of old Mahound's paradise, I am an infidel,\nand no true son of the church.\"\n\n\"Should your boasted beauty,\" said the Templar, \"be weighed in the\nbalance and found wanting, you know our wager?\"\n\n\"My gold collar,\" answered the Prior, \"against ten butts of Chian\nwine;--they are mine as securely as if they were already in the convent\nvaults, under the key of old Dennis the cellarer.\"\n\n\"And I am myself to be judge,\" said the Templar, \"and am only to be\nconvicted on my own admission, that I have seen no maiden so beautiful\nsince Pentecost was a twelvemonth. Ran it not so?--Prior, your collar\nis in danger; I will wear it over my gorget in the lists of\nAshby-de-la-Zouche.\"\n\n\"Win it fairly,\" said the Prior, \"and wear it as ye will; I will trust\nyour giving true response, on your word as a knight and as a churchman.\nYet, brother, take my advice, and file your tongue to a little more\ncourtesy than your habits of predominating over infidel captives\nand Eastern bondsmen have accustomed you. Cedric the Saxon, if\noffended,--and he is noway slack in taking offence,--is a man who,\nwithout respect to your knighthood, my high office, or the sanctity\nof either, would clear his house of us, and send us to lodge with the\nlarks, though the hour were midnight. And be careful how you look on\nRowena, whom he cherishes with the most jealous care; an he take the\nleast alarm in that quarter we are but lost men. It is said he banished\nhis only son from his family for lifting his eyes in the way of\naffection towards this beauty, who may be worshipped, it seems, at a\ndistance, but is not to be approached with other thoughts than such as\nwe bring to the shrine of the Blessed Virgin.\"\n\n\"Well, you have said enough,\" answered the Templar; \"I will for a night\nput on the needful restraint, and deport me as meekly as a maiden; but\nas for the fear of his expelling us by violence, myself and squires,\nwith Hamet and Abdalla, will warrant you against that disgrace. Doubt\nnot that we shall be strong enough to make good our quarters.\"\n\n\"We must not let it come so far,\" answered the Prior; \"but here is the\nclown's sunken cross, and the night is so dark that we can hardly see\nwhich of the roads we are to follow. He bid us turn, I think to the\nleft.\"\n\n\"To the right,\" said Brian, \"to the best of my remembrance.\"\n\n\"To the left, certainly, the left; I remember his pointing with his\nwooden sword.\"\n\n\"Ay, but he held his sword in his left hand, and so pointed across his\nbody with it,\" said the Templar.\n\nEach maintained his opinion with sufficient obstinacy, as is usual in\nall such cases; the attendants were appealed to, but they had not been\nnear enough to hear Wamba's directions. At length Brian remarked, what\nhad at first escaped him in the twilight; \"Here is some one either\nasleep, or lying dead at the foot of this cross--Hugo, stir him with the\nbutt-end of thy lance.\"\n\nThis was no sooner done than the figure arose, exclaiming in good\nFrench, \"Whosoever thou art, it is discourteous in you to disturb my\nthoughts.\"\n\n\"We did but wish to ask you,\" said the Prior, \"the road to Rotherwood,\nthe abode of Cedric the Saxon.\"\n\n\"I myself am bound thither,\" replied the stranger; \"and if I had a\nhorse, I would be your guide, for the way is somewhat intricate, though\nperfectly well known to me.\"\n\n\"Thou shalt have both thanks and reward, my friend,\" said the Prior, \"if\nthou wilt bring us to Cedric's in safety.\"\n\nAnd he caused one of his attendants to mount his own led horse, and give\nthat upon which he had hitherto ridden to the stranger, who was to serve\nfor a guide.\n\nTheir conductor pursued an opposite road from that which Wamba had\nrecommended, for the purpose of misleading them. The path soon led\ndeeper into the woodland, and crossed more than one brook, the approach\nto which was rendered perilous by the marshes through which it flowed;\nbut the stranger seemed to know, as if by instinct, the soundest ground\nand the safest points of passage; and by dint of caution and attention,\nbrought the party safely into a wilder avenue than any they had yet\nseen; and, pointing to a large low irregular building at the upper\nextremity, he said to the Prior, \"Yonder is Rotherwood, the dwelling of\nCedric the Saxon.\"\n\nThis was a joyful intimation to Aymer, whose nerves were none of the\nstrongest, and who had suffered such agitation and alarm in the course\nof passing through the dangerous bogs, that he had not yet had the\ncuriosity to ask his guide a single question. Finding himself now at his\nease and near shelter, his curiosity began to awake, and he demanded of\nthe guide who and what he was.\n\n\"A Palmer, just returned from the Holy Land,\" was the answer.\n\n\"You had better have tarried there to fight for the recovery of the Holy\nSepulchre,\" said the Templar.\n\n\"True, Reverend Sir Knight,\" answered the Palmer, to whom the appearance\nof the Templar seemed perfectly familiar; \"but when those who are under\noath to recover the holy city, are found travelling at such a distance\nfrom the scene of their duties, can you wonder that a peaceful peasant\nlike me should decline the task which they have abandoned?\"\n\nThe Templar would have made an angry reply, but was interrupted by the\nPrior, who again expressed his astonishment, that their guide, after\nsuch long absence, should be so perfectly acquainted with the passes of\nthe forest.\n\n\"I was born a native of these parts,\" answered their guide, and as he\nmade the reply they stood before the mansion of Cedric;--a low irregular\nbuilding, containing several court-yards or enclosures, extending over\na considerable space of ground, and which, though its size argued the\ninhabitant to be a person of wealth, differed entirely from the tall,\nturretted, and castellated buildings in which the Norman nobility\nresided, and which had become the universal style of architecture\nthroughout England.\n\nRotherwood was not, however, without defences; no habitation, in\nthat disturbed period, could have been so, without the risk of being\nplundered and burnt before the next morning. A deep fosse, or ditch,\nwas drawn round the whole building, and filled with water from a\nneighbouring stream. A double stockade, or palisade, composed of pointed\nbeams, which the adjacent forest supplied, defended the outer and inner\nbank of the trench. There was an entrance from the west through the\nouter stockade, which communicated by a drawbridge, with a similar\nopening in the interior defences. Some precautions had been taken to\nplace those entrances under the protection of projecting angles, by\nwhich they might be flanked in case of need by archers or slingers.\n\nBefore this entrance the Templar wound his horn loudly; for the rain,\nwhich had long threatened, began now to descend with great violence.\n\n\n\n\n     Then (sad relief!) from the bleak coast that hears\n     The German Ocean roar, deep-blooming, strong,\n     And yellow hair'd, the blue-eyed Saxon came.\n     Thomson's Liberty\n\nIn a hall, the height of which was greatly disproportioned to its\nextreme length and width, a long oaken table, formed of planks\nrough-hewn from the forest, and which had scarcely received any polish,\nstood ready prepared for the evening meal of Cedric the Saxon. The roof,\ncomposed of beams and rafters, had nothing to divide the apartment from\nthe sky excepting the planking and thatch; there was a huge fireplace at\neither end of the hall, but as the chimneys were constructed in a very\nclumsy manner, at least as much of the smoke found its way into the\napartment as escaped by the proper vent. The constant vapour which this\noccasioned, had polished the rafters and beams of the low-browed hall,\nby encrusting them with a black varnish of soot. On the sides of the\napartment hung implements of war and of the chase, and there were at\neach corner folding doors, which gave access to other parts of the\nextensive building.\n\nThe other appointments of the mansion partook of the rude simplicity\nof the Saxon period, which Cedric piqued himself upon maintaining.\nThe floor was composed of earth mixed with lime, trodden into a hard\nsubstance, such as is often employed in flooring our modern barns. For\nabout one quarter of the length of the apartment, the floor was raised\nby a step, and this space, which was called the dais, was occupied only\nby the principal members of the family, and visitors of distinction.\nFor this purpose, a table richly covered with scarlet cloth was placed\ntransversely across the platform, from the middle of which ran the\nlonger and lower board, at which the domestics and inferior persons fed,\ndown towards the bottom of the hall. The whole resembled the form of the\nletter T, or some of those ancient dinner-tables, which, arranged on the\nsame principles, may be still seen in the antique Colleges of Oxford or\nCambridge. Massive chairs and settles of carved oak were placed upon the\ndais, and over these seats and the more elevated table was fastened a\ncanopy of cloth, which served in some degree to protect the dignitaries\nwho occupied that distinguished station from the weather, and\nespecially from the rain, which in some places found its way through the\nill-constructed roof.\n\nThe walls of this upper end of the hall, as far as the dais extended,\nwere covered with hangings or curtains, and upon the floor there was a\ncarpet, both of which were adorned with some attempts at tapestry, or\nembroidery, executed with brilliant or rather gaudy colouring. Over the\nlower range of table, the roof, as we have noticed, had no covering;\nthe rough plastered walls were left bare, and the rude earthen floor was\nuncarpeted; the board was uncovered by a cloth, and rude massive benches\nsupplied the place of chairs.\n\nIn the centre of the upper table, were placed two chairs more elevated\nthan the rest, for the master and mistress of the family, who presided\nover the scene of hospitality, and from doing so derived their Saxon\ntitle of honour, which signifies \"the Dividers of Bread.\"\n\nTo each of these chairs was added a footstool, curiously carved and\ninlaid with ivory, which mark of distinction was peculiar to them. One\nof these seats was at present occupied by Cedric the Saxon, who, though\nbut in rank a thane, or, as the Normans called him, a Franklin, felt, at\nthe delay of his evening meal, an irritable impatience, which might have\nbecome an alderman, whether of ancient or of modern times.\n\nIt appeared, indeed, from the countenance of this proprietor, that he\nwas of a frank, but hasty and choleric temper. He was not above the\nmiddle stature, but broad-shouldered, long-armed, and powerfully made,\nlike one accustomed to endure the fatigue of war or of the chase; his\nface was broad, with large blue eyes, open and frank features, fine\nteeth, and a well formed head, altogether expressive of that sort of\ngood-humour which often lodges with a sudden and hasty temper. Pride and\njealousy there was in his eye, for his life had been spent in asserting\nrights which were constantly liable to invasion; and the prompt, fiery,\nand resolute disposition of the man, had been kept constantly upon the\nalert by the circumstances of his situation. His long yellow hair was\nequally divided on the top of his head and upon his brow, and combed\ndown on each side to the length of his shoulders; it had but little\ntendency to grey, although Cedric was approaching to his sixtieth year.\n\nHis dress was a tunic of forest green, furred at the throat and cuffs\nwith what was called minever; a kind of fur inferior in quality to\nermine, and formed, it is believed, of the skin of the grey squirrel.\nThis doublet hung unbuttoned over a close dress of scarlet which sat\ntight to his body; he had breeches of the same, but they did not reach\nbelow the lower part of the thigh, leaving the knee exposed. His\nfeet had sandals of the same fashion with the peasants, but of finer\nmaterials, and secured in the front with golden clasps. He had bracelets\nof gold upon his arms, and a broad collar of the same precious metal\naround his neck. About his waist he wore a richly-studded belt, in\nwhich was stuck a short straight two-edged sword, with a sharp point, so\ndisposed as to hang almost perpendicularly by his side. Behind his seat\nwas hung a scarlet cloth cloak lined with fur, and a cap of the same\nmaterials richly embroidered, which completed the dress of the opulent\nlandholder when he chose to go forth. A short boar-spear, with a broad\nand bright steel head, also reclined against the back of his chair,\nwhich served him, when he walked abroad, for the purposes of a staff or\nof a weapon, as chance might require.\n\nSeveral domestics, whose dress held various proportions betwixt the\nrichness of their master's, and the coarse and simple attire of Gurth\nthe swine-herd, watched the looks and waited the commands of the Saxon\ndignitary. Two or three servants of a superior order stood behind their\nmaster upon the dais; the rest occupied the lower part of the hall.\nOther attendants there were of a different description; two or three\nlarge and shaggy greyhounds, such as were then employed in hunting the\nstag and wolf; as many slow-hounds of a large bony breed, with thick\nnecks, large heads, and long ears; and one or two of the smaller dogs,\nnow called terriers, which waited with impatience the arrival of the\nsupper; but, with the sagacious knowledge of physiognomy peculiar to\ntheir race, forbore to intrude upon the moody silence of their master,\napprehensive probably of a small white truncheon which lay by Cedric's\ntrencher, for the purpose of repelling the advances of his four-legged\ndependants. One grisly old wolf-dog alone, with the liberty of an\nindulged favourite, had planted himself close by the chair of state, and\noccasionally ventured to solicit notice by putting his large hairy head\nupon his master's knee, or pushing his nose into his hand. Even he was\nrepelled by the stern command, \"Down, Balder, down! I am not in the\nhumour for foolery.\"\n\nIn fact, Cedric, as we have observed, was in no very placid state of\nmind. The Lady Rowena, who had been absent to attend an evening mass at\na distant church, had but just returned, and was changing her garments,\nwhich had been wetted by the storm. There were as yet no tidings of\nGurth and his charge, which should long since have been driven home from\nthe forest and such was the insecurity of the period, as to render it\nprobable that the delay might be explained by some depreciation of the\noutlaws, with whom the adjacent forest abounded, or by the violence\nof some neighbouring baron, whose consciousness of strength made\nhim equally negligent of the laws of property. The matter was of\nconsequence, for great part of the domestic wealth of the Saxon\nproprietors consisted in numerous herds of swine, especially in\nforest-land, where those animals easily found their food.\n\nBesides these subjects of anxiety, the Saxon thane was impatient for the\npresence of his favourite clown Wamba, whose jests, such as they were,\nserved for a sort of seasoning to his evening meal, and to the deep\ndraughts of ale and wine with which he was in the habit of accompanying\nit. Add to all this, Cedric had fasted since noon, and his usual supper\nhour was long past, a cause of irritation common to country squires,\nboth in ancient and modern times. His displeasure was expressed in\nbroken sentences, partly muttered to himself, partly addressed to the\ndomestics who stood around; and particularly to his cupbearer, who\noffered him from time to time, as a sedative, a silver goblet filled\nwith wine--\"Why tarries the Lady Rowena?\"\n\n\"She is but changing her head-gear,\" replied a female attendant, with as\nmuch confidence as the favourite lady's-maid usually answers the master\nof a modern family; \"you would not wish her to sit down to the banquet\nin her hood and kirtle? and no lady within the shire can be quicker in\narraying herself than my mistress.\"\n\nThis undeniable argument produced a sort of acquiescent umph! on the\npart of the Saxon, with the addition, \"I wish her devotion may choose\nfair weather for the next visit to St John's Kirk;--but what, in the\nname of ten devils,\" continued he, turning to the cupbearer, and raising\nhis voice as if happy to have found a channel into which he might divert\nhis indignation without fear or control--\"what, in the name of ten\ndevils, keeps Gurth so long afield? I suppose we shall have an evil\naccount of the herd; he was wont to be a faithful and cautious drudge,\nand I had destined him for something better; perchance I might even have\nmade him one of my warders.\" [11]\n\nOswald the cupbearer modestly suggested, \"that it was scarce an hour\nsince the tolling of the curfew;\" an ill-chosen apology, since it turned\nupon a topic so harsh to Saxon ears.\n\n\"The foul fiend,\" exclaimed Cedric, \"take the curfew-bell, and the\ntyrannical bastard by whom it was devised, and the heartless slave who\nnames it with a Saxon tongue to a Saxon ear! The curfew!\" he added,\npausing, \"ay, the curfew; which compels true men to extinguish their\nlights, that thieves and robbers may work their deeds in darkness!--Ay,\nthe curfew;--Reginald Front-de-Boeuf and Philip de Malvoisin know the\nuse of the curfew as well as William the Bastard himself, or e'er a\nNorman adventurer that fought at Hastings. I shall hear, I guess,\nthat my property has been swept off to save from starving the hungry\nbanditti, whom they cannot support but by theft and robbery. My faithful\nslave is murdered, and my goods are taken for a prey--and Wamba--where\nis Wamba? Said not some one he had gone forth with Gurth?\"\n\nOswald replied in the affirmative.\n\n\"Ay? why this is better and better! he is carried off too, the Saxon\nfool, to serve the Norman lord. Fools are we all indeed that serve them,\nand fitter subjects for their scorn and laughter, than if we were born\nwith but half our wits. But I will be avenged,\" he added, starting from\nhis chair in impatience at the supposed injury, and catching hold of his\nboar-spear; \"I will go with my complaint to the great council; I have\nfriends, I have followers--man to man will I appeal the Norman to the\nlists; let him come in his plate and his mail, and all that can render\ncowardice bold; I have sent such a javelin as this through a stronger\nfence than three of their war shields!--Haply they think me old; but\nthey shall find, alone and childless as I am, the blood of Hereward is\nin the veins of Cedric.--Ah, Wilfred, Wilfred!\" he exclaimed in a lower\ntone, \"couldst thou have ruled thine unreasonable passion, thy father\nhad not been left in his age like the solitary oak that throws out\nits shattered and unprotected branches against the full sweep of the\ntempest!\" The reflection seemed to conjure into sadness his irritated\nfeelings. Replacing his javelin, he resumed his seat, bent his looks\ndownward, and appeared to be absorbed in melancholy reflection.\n\nFrom his musing, Cedric was suddenly awakened by the blast of a horn,\nwhich was replied to by the clamorous yells and barking of all the dogs\nin the hall, and some twenty or thirty which were quartered in other\nparts of the building. It cost some exercise of the white truncheon,\nwell seconded by the exertions of the domestics, to silence this canine\nclamour.\n\n\"To the gate, knaves!\" said the Saxon, hastily, as soon as the tumult\nwas so much appeased that the dependants could hear his voice. \"See what\ntidings that horn tells us of--to announce, I ween, some hership [12]\nand robbery which has been done upon my lands.\"\n\nReturning in less than three minutes, a warder announced \"that the Prior\nAymer of Jorvaulx, and the good knight Brian de Bois-Guilbert, commander\nof the valiant and venerable order of Knights Templars, with a small\nretinue, requested hospitality and lodging for the night, being on\ntheir way to a tournament which was to be held not far from\nAshby-de-la-Zouche, on the second day from the present.\"\n\n\"Aymer, the Prior Aymer? Brian de Bois-Guilbert?\"--muttered Cedric;\n\"Normans both;--but Norman or Saxon, the hospitality of Rotherwood must\nnot be impeached; they are welcome, since they have chosen to halt--more\nwelcome would they have been to have ridden further on their way--But it\nwere unworthy to murmur for a night's lodging and a night's food; in\nthe quality of guests, at least, even Normans must suppress their\ninsolence.--Go, Hundebert,\" he added, to a sort of major-domo who stood\nbehind him with a white wand; \"take six of the attendants, and introduce\nthe strangers to the guests' lodging. Look after their horses and mules,\nand see their train lack nothing. Let them have change of vestments if\nthey require it, and fire, and water to wash, and wine and ale; and bid\nthe cooks add what they hastily can to our evening meal; and let it\nbe put on the board when those strangers are ready to share it. Say to\nthem, Hundebert, that Cedric would himself bid them welcome, but he is\nunder a vow never to step more than three steps from the dais of his own\nhall to meet any who shares not the blood of Saxon royalty. Begone! see\nthem carefully tended; let them not say in their pride, the Saxon churl\nhas shown at once his poverty and his avarice.\"\n\nThe major-domo departed with several attendants, to execute his master's\ncommands.\n\n\"The Prior Aymer!\" repeated Cedric, looking to Oswald, \"the brother, if\nI mistake not, of Giles de Mauleverer, now lord of Middleham?\"\n\nOswald made a respectful sign of assent. \"His brother sits in the\nseat, and usurps the patrimony, of a better race, the race of Ulfgar of\nMiddleham; but what Norman lord doth not the same? This Prior is, they\nsay, a free and jovial priest, who loves the wine-cup and the bugle-horn\nbetter than bell and book: Good; let him come, he shall be welcome. How\nnamed ye the Templar?\"\n\n\"Brian de Bois-Guilbert.\"\n\n\"Bois-Guilbert,\" said Cedric, still in the musing, half-arguing tone,\nwhich the habit of living among dependants had accustomed him to employ,\nand which resembled a man who talks to himself rather than to those\naround him--\"Bois-Guilbert? that name has been spread wide both for\ngood and evil. They say he is valiant as the bravest of his order;\nbut stained with their usual vices, pride, arrogance, cruelty, and\nvoluptuousness; a hard-hearted man, who knows neither fear of earth,\nnor awe of heaven. So say the few warriors who have returned from\nPalestine.--Well; it is but for one night; he shall be welcome\ntoo.--Oswald, broach the oldest wine-cask; place the best mead, the\nmightiest ale, the richest morat, the most sparkling cider, the most\nodoriferous pigments, upon the board; fill the largest horns [13]\n--Templars and Abbots love good wines and good measure.--Elgitha, let\nthy Lady Rowena, know we shall not this night expect her in the hall,\nunless such be her especial pleasure.\"\n\n\"But it will be her especial pleasure,\" answered Elgitha, with great\nreadiness, \"for she is ever desirous to hear the latest news from\nPalestine.\"\n\nCedric darted at the forward damsel a glance of hasty resentment; but\nRowena, and whatever belonged to her, were privileged and secure from\nhis anger. He only replied, \"Silence, maiden; thy tongue outruns thy\ndiscretion. Say my message to thy mistress, and let her do her pleasure.\nHere, at least, the descendant of Alfred still reigns a princess.\"\nElgitha left the apartment.\n\n\"Palestine!\" repeated the Saxon; \"Palestine! how many ears are turned\nto the tales which dissolute crusaders, or hypocritical pilgrims, bring\nfrom that fatal land! I too might ask--I too might enquire--I too might\nlisten with a beating heart to fables which the wily strollers devise\nto cheat us into hospitality--but no--The son who has disobeyed me is no\nlonger mine; nor will I concern myself more for his fate than for that\nof the most worthless among the millions that ever shaped the cross on\ntheir shoulder, rushed into excess and blood-guiltiness, and called it\nan accomplishment of the will of God.\"\n\nHe knit his brows, and fixed his eyes for an instant on the ground; as\nhe raised them, the folding doors at the bottom of the hall were cast\nwide, and, preceded by the major-domo with his wand, and four domestics\nbearing blazing torches, the guests of the evening entered the\napartment.\n\n\n\n\n     With sheep and shaggy goats the porkers bled,\n     And the proud steer was on the marble spread;\n     With fire prepared, they deal the morsels round,\n     Wine rosy bright the brimming goblets crown'd.\n     * * * * *\n     Disposed apart, Ulysses shares the treat;\n     A trivet table and ignobler seat,\n     The Prince assigns--\n     --Odyssey, Book XXI\n\nThe Prior Aymer had taken the opportunity afforded him, of changing his\nriding robe for one of yet more costly materials, over which he wore\na cope curiously embroidered. Besides the massive golden signet ring,\nwhich marked his ecclesiastical dignity, his fingers, though contrary\nto the canon, were loaded with precious gems; his sandals were of the\nfinest leather which was imported from Spain; his beard trimmed to as\nsmall dimensions as his order would possibly permit, and his shaven\ncrown concealed by a scarlet cap richly embroidered.\n\nThe appearance of the Knight Templar was also changed; and, though\nless studiously bedecked with ornament, his dress was as rich, and\nhis appearance far more commanding, than that of his companion. He had\nexchanged his shirt of mail for an under tunic of dark purple silk,\ngarnished with furs, over which flowed his long robe of spotless white,\nin ample folds. The eight-pointed cross of his order was cut on the\nshoulder of his mantle in black velvet. The high cap no longer invested\nhis brows, which were only shaded by short and thick curled hair of\na raven blackness, corresponding to his unusually swart complexion.\nNothing could be more gracefully majestic than his step and manner,\nhad they not been marked by a predominant air of haughtiness, easily\nacquired by the exercise of unresisted authority.\n\nThese two dignified persons were followed by their respective\nattendants, and at a more humble distance by their guide, whose figure\nhad nothing more remarkable than it derived from the usual weeds of a\npilgrim. A cloak or mantle of coarse black serge, enveloped his whole\nbody. It was in shape something like the cloak of a modern hussar,\nhaving similar flaps for covering the arms, and was called a \"Sclaveyn\",\nor \"Sclavonian\". Coarse sandals, bound with thongs, on his bare feet;\na broad and shadowy hat, with cockle-shells stitched on its brim, and\na long staff shod with iron, to the upper end of which was attached a\nbranch of palm, completed the palmer's attire. He followed modestly the\nlast of the train which entered the hall, and, observing that the lower\ntable scarce afforded room sufficient for the domestics of Cedric and\nthe retinue of his guests, he withdrew to a settle placed beside and\nalmost under one of the large chimneys, and seemed to employ himself in\ndrying his garments, until the retreat of some one should make room\nat the board, or the hospitality of the steward should supply him with\nrefreshments in the place he had chosen apart.\n\nCedric rose to receive his guests with an air of dignified hospitality,\nand, descending from the dais, or elevated part of his hall, made three\nsteps towards them, and then awaited their approach.\n\n\"I grieve,\" he said, \"reverend Prior, that my vow binds me to advance\nno farther upon this floor of my fathers, even to receive such guests\nas you, and this valiant Knight of the Holy Temple. But my steward has\nexpounded to you the cause of my seeming discourtesy. Let me also pray,\nthat you will excuse my speaking to you in my native language, and that\nyou will reply in the same if your knowledge of it permits; if not, I\nsufficiently understand Norman to follow your meaning.\"\n\n\"Vows,\" said the Abbot, \"must be unloosed, worthy Franklin, or permit\nme rather to say, worthy Thane, though the title is antiquated. Vows\nare the knots which tie us to Heaven--they are the cords which bind\nthe sacrifice to the horns of the altar,--and are therefore,--as I said\nbefore,--to be unloosened and discharged, unless our holy Mother Church\nshall pronounce the contrary. And respecting language, I willingly\nhold communication in that spoken by my respected grandmother, Hilda\nof Middleham, who died in odour of sanctity, little short, if we may\npresume to say so, of her glorious namesake, the blessed Saint Hilda of\nWhitby, God be gracious to her soul!\"\n\nWhen the Prior had ceased what he meant as a conciliatory harangue,\nhis companion said briefly and emphatically, \"I speak ever French,\nthe language of King Richard and his nobles; but I understand English\nsufficiently to communicate with the natives of the country.\"\n\nCedric darted at the speaker one of those hasty and impatient glances,\nwhich comparisons between the two rival nations seldom failed to call\nforth; but, recollecting the duties of hospitality, he suppressed\nfurther show of resentment, and, motioning with his hand, caused his\nguests to assume two seats a little lower than his own, but placed close\nbeside him, and gave a signal that the evening meal should be placed\nupon the board.\n\nWhile the attendants hastened to obey Cedric's commands, his eye\ndistinguished Gurth the swineherd, who, with his companion Wamba, had\njust entered the hall. \"Send these loitering knaves up hither,\" said the\nSaxon, impatiently. And when the culprits came before the dais,--\"How\ncomes it, villains! that you have loitered abroad so late as this? Hast\nthou brought home thy charge, sirrah Gurth, or hast thou left them to\nrobbers and marauders?\"\n\n\"The herd is safe, so please ye,\" said Gurth.\n\n\"But it does not please me, thou knave,\" said Cedric, \"that I should be\nmade to suppose otherwise for two hours, and sit here devising vengeance\nagainst my neighbours for wrongs they have not done me. I tell thee,\nshackles and the prison-house shall punish the next offence of this\nkind.\"\n\nGurth, knowing his master's irritable temper, attempted no exculpation;\nbut the Jester, who could presume upon Cedric's tolerance, by virtue\nof his privileges as a fool, replied for them both; \"In troth, uncle\nCedric, you are neither wise nor reasonable to-night.\"\n\n\"'How, sir?\" said his master; \"you shall to the porter's lodge, and\ntaste of the discipline there, if you give your foolery such license.\"\n\n\"First let your wisdom tell me,\" said Wamba, \"is it just and reasonable\nto punish one person for the fault of another?\"\n\n\"Certainly not, fool,\" answered Cedric.\n\n\"Then why should you shackle poor Gurth, uncle, for the fault of his dog\nFangs? for I dare be sworn we lost not a minute by the way, when we had\ngot our herd together, which Fangs did not manage until we heard the\nvesper-bell.\"\n\n\"Then hang up Fangs,\" said Cedric, turning hastily towards the\nswineherd, \"if the fault is his, and get thee another dog.\"\n\n\"Under favour, uncle,\" said the Jester, \"that were still somewhat on the\nbow-hand of fair justice; for it was no fault of Fangs that he was lame\nand could not gather the herd, but the fault of those that struck off\ntwo of his fore-claws, an operation for which, if the poor fellow had\nbeen consulted, he would scarce have given his voice.\"\n\n\"And who dared to lame an animal which belonged to my bondsman?\" said\nthe Saxon, kindling in wrath.\n\n\"Marry, that did old Hubert,\" said Wamba, \"Sir Philip de Malvoisin's\nkeeper of the chase. He caught Fangs strolling in the forest, and said\nhe chased the deer contrary to his master's right, as warden of the\nwalk.\"\n\n\"The foul fiend take Malvoisin,\" answered the Saxon, \"and his keeper\nboth! I will teach them that the wood was disforested in terms of\nthe great Forest Charter. But enough of this. Go to, knave, go to thy\nplace--and thou, Gurth, get thee another dog, and should the keeper dare\nto touch it, I will mar his archery; the curse of a coward on my head,\nif I strike not off the forefinger of his right hand!--he shall draw\nbowstring no more.--I crave your pardon, my worthy guests. I am beset\nhere with neighbours that match your infidels, Sir Knight, in Holy Land.\nBut your homely fare is before you; feed, and let welcome make amends\nfor hard fare.\"\n\nThe feast, however, which was spread upon the board, needed no apologies\nfrom the lord of the mansion. Swine's flesh, dressed in several modes,\nappeared on the lower part of the board, as also that of fowls, deer,\ngoats, and hares, and various kinds of fish, together with huge loaves\nand cakes of bread, and sundry confections made of fruits and honey.\nThe smaller sorts of wild-fowl, of which there was abundance, were\nnot served up in platters, but brought in upon small wooden spits or\nbroaches, and offered by the pages and domestics who bore them, to each\nguest in succession, who cut from them such a portion as he pleased.\nBeside each person of rank was placed a goblet of silver; the lower\nboard was accommodated with large drinking horns.\n\nWhen the repast was about to commence, the major-domo, or steward,\nsuddenly raising his wand, said aloud,--\"Forbear!--Place for the Lady\nRowena.\"\n\nA side-door at the upper end of the hall now opened behind the banquet\ntable, and Rowena, followed by four female attendants, entered the\napartment. Cedric, though surprised, and perhaps not altogether\nagreeably so, at his ward appearing in public on this occasion, hastened\nto meet her, and to conduct her, with respectful ceremony, to the\nelevated seat at his own right hand, appropriated to the lady of the\nmansion. All stood up to receive her; and, replying to their courtesy by\na mute gesture of salutation, she moved gracefully forward to assume her\nplace at the board. Ere she had time to do so, the Templar whispered to\nthe Prior, \"I shall wear no collar of gold of yours at the tournament.\nThe Chian wine is your own.\"\n\n\"Said I not so?\" answered the Prior; \"but check your raptures, the\nFranklin observes you.\"\n\nUnheeding this remonstrance, and accustomed only to act upon the\nimmediate impulse of his own wishes, Brian de Bois-Guilbert kept\nhis eyes riveted on the Saxon beauty, more striking perhaps to his\nimagination, because differing widely from those of the Eastern\nsultanas.\n\nFormed in the best proportions of her sex, Rowena was tall in stature,\nyet not so much so as to attract observation on account of superior\nheight. Her complexion was exquisitely fair, but the noble cast of her\nhead and features prevented the insipidity which sometimes attaches\nto fair beauties.\n\n### Summary:"}

The doctor had to go to\nLondon for a physician to take charge of his practice; the squire was\nhard at work at Bristol; and I lived on at the Hall under the charge of\nold Redruth, the gamekeeper, almost a prisoner, but full of sea-dreams\nand the most charming anticipations of strange islands and adventures. I\nbrooded by the hour together over the map, all the details of which I\nwell remembered. Sitting by the fire in the housekeeper's room, I\napproached that island, in my fancy, from every possible direction; I\nexplored every acre of its surface; I climbed a thousand times to that\ntall hill they call the Spy-glass, and from the top enjoyed the most\nwonderful and changing prospects. Sometimes the isle was thick with\nsavages, with whom we fought; sometimes full of dangerous animals that\nhunted us; but in all my fancies nothing occurred to me so strange and\ntragic as our actual adventures.\n\nSo the weeks passed on, till one fine day there came a letter addressed\nto Doctor Livesey, with this addition, \"To be opened in the case of his\nabsence, by Tom Redruth or Young Hawkins.\" Obeying this order, we found,\nor rather I found--for the gamekeeper was a poor hand at reading\nanything but print--the following important news:\n\n                              \"_Old Anchor Inn, Bristol, March 1, 17--._\n\n    \"DEAR LIVESEY: As I do not know whether you are at the Hall or still\n    in London, I send this in double to both places.\n\n    \"The ship is bought and fitted. She lies at anchor, ready for sea.\n    You never imagined a sweeter schooner--a child might sail her--two\n    hundred tons; name, _Hispaniola_.\n\n    \"I got her through my old friend, Blandly, who has proved himself\n    throughout the most surprising trump. The admirable fellow literally\n    slaved in my interest, and so, I may say, did every one in Bristol,\n    as soon as they got wind of the port we sailed for--treasure, I\n    mean.\"\n\n\"Redruth,\" said I, interrupting the letter, \"Doctor Livesey will not\nlike that. The squire has been talking, after all.\"\n\n\"Well, who's a better right?\" growled the gamekeeper. \"A pretty rum go\nif Squire ain't to talk for Doctor Livesey, I should think.\"\n\nAt that I gave up all attempt at commentary, and read straight on:\n\n    \"Blandly himself found the _Hispaniola_, and by the most admirable\n    management got her for the merest trifle. There is a class of men in\n    Bristol monstrously prejudiced against Blandly. They go the length\n    of declaring that this honest creature would do anything for money;\n    that the _Hispaniola_ belonged to him, and that he sold to me\n    absurdly high--the most transparent calumnies. None of them dare,\n    however, to deny the merits of the ship.\n\n    \"So far there was not a hitch. The workpeople, to be sure--riggers\n    and what not--were most annoyingly slow, but time cured that. It was\n    the crew that troubled me.\n\n    \"I wished a round score of men--in case of natives, buccaneers, or\n    the odious French--and I had the worry of the deuce itself to find\n    so much as half a dozen, till the most remarkable stroke of fortune\n    brought me the very man that I required.\n\n    \"I was standing on the dock, when, by the merest accident, I fell in\n    talk with him. I found he was an old sailor, kept a public house,\n    knew all the seafaring men in Bristol, had lost his health ashore,\n    and wanted a good berth as cook to get to sea again. He had hobbled\n    down there that morning, he said, to get a smell of the salt.\n\n    \"I was monstrously touched--so would you have been--and, out of pure\n    pity, I engaged him on the spot to be ship's cook. Long John Silver\n    he is called, and has lost a leg; but that I regarded as a\n    recommendation, since he lost it in his country's service, under the\n    immortal Hawke. He has no pension, Livesey. Imagine the abominable\n    age we live in!\n\n    \"Well, sir, I thought I had only found a cook, but it was a crew I\n    had discovered. Between Silver and myself we got together in a few\n    days a company of the toughest old salts imaginable--not pretty to\n    look at, but fellows, by their faces, of the most indomitable\n    spirit. I declare we could fight a frigate.\n\n    \"Long John even got rid of two out of the six or seven I had already\n    engaged. He showed me in a moment that they were just the sort of\n    fresh-water swabs we had to fear in an adventure of importance.\n\n    \"I am in the most magnificent health and spirits, eating like a\n    bull, sleeping like a tree, yet I shall not enjoy a moment till I\n    hear my old tarpaulins tramping round the capstan. Seaward ho! Hang\n    the treasure! It's the glory of the sea that has turned my head. So\n    now, Livesey, come post; do not lose an hour, if you respect me.\n\n    \"Let young Hawkins go at once to see his mother, with Redruth for a\n    guard, and then both come full speed to Bristol.\n\n                                                        \"JOHN TRELAWNEY.\n\n    \"P.S.--I did not tell you that Blandly, who, by the way, is to send\n    a consort after us if we don't turn up by the end of August, had\n    found an admirable fellow for sailing-master--a stiff man, which I\n    regret, but, in all other respects, a treasure. Long John Silver\n    unearthed a very competent man for a mate, a man named Arrow. I have\n    a boatswain who pipes, Livesey; so things shall go man-o'-war\n    fashion on board the good ship _Hispaniola_.\n\n    \"I forgot to tell you that Silver is a man of substance; I know of\n    my own knowledge that he has a banker's account, which has never\n    been overdrawn. He leaves his wife to manage the inn; and as she is\n    a woman of color, a pair of old bachelors like you and I may be\n    excused for guessing that it is the wife, quite as much as the\n    health, that sends him back to roving.\n\n                                                                  \"J. T.\n\n    \"P.P.S.--Hawkins may stay one night with his mother.\n\n                                                                 \"J. T.\"\n\nYou can fancy the excitement into which that letter put me. I was half\nbeside myself with glee, and if ever I despised a man, it was old Tom\nRedruth, who could do nothing but grumble and lament. Any of the\nunder-gamekeepers would gladly have changed places with him; but such\nwas not the squire's pleasure, and the squire's pleasure was like law\namong them all. Nobody but old Redruth would have dared so much as even\nto grumble.\n\nThe next morning he and I set out on foot for the \"Admiral Benbow,\" and\nthere I found my mother in good health and spirits. The captain, who had\nso long been a cause of so much discomfort, was gone where the wicked\ncease from troubling. The squire had had everything repaired, and the\npublic rooms and the sign repainted, and had added some furniture--above\nall a beautiful armchair for mother in the bar. He had found her a boy\nas an apprentice also, so that she should not want help while I was\ngone.\n\nIt was on seeing that boy that I understood, for the first time, my\nsituation. I had thought up to that moment of the adventures before me,\nnot at all of the home that I was leaving; and now at sight of this\nclumsy stranger, who was to stay here in my place beside my mother, I\nhad my first attack of tears. I am afraid I led that boy a dog's life;\nfor as he was new to the work, I had a hundred opportunities of setting\nhim right and putting him down, and I was not slow to profit by them.\n\nThe night passed, and the next day, after dinner, Redruth and I were\nafoot again and on the road. I said good-by to mother and the cove where\nI had lived since I was born, and the dear old \"Admiral Benbow\"--since\nhe was repainted, no longer quite so dear. One of my last thoughts was\nof the captain, who had so often strode along the beach with his cocked\nhat, his saber-cut cheek, and his old brass telescope. Next moment we\nhad turned the corner, and my home was out of sight.\n\nThe mail picked us up about dusk at the \"Royal George\" on the heath. I\nwas wedged in between Redruth and a stout old gentleman, and in spite of\nthe swift motion and the cold night air, I must have dozed a great deal\nfrom the very first, and then slept like a log up hill and down dale,\nthrough stage after stage; for when I was awakened at last, it was by a\npunch in the ribs, and I opened my eyes to find that we were standing\nstill before a large building in a city street, and that the day had\nalready broken a long time.\n\n\"Where are we?\" I asked.\n\n\"Bristol,\" said Tom. \"Get down.\"\n\nMr. Trelawney had taken up his residence at an inn far down the docks,\nto superintend the work upon the schooner. Thither we had now to walk,\nand our way, to my great delight, lay along the quays and beside the\ngreat multitude of ships of all sizes and rigs and nations. In one,\nsailors were singing at their work; in another, there were men aloft,\nhigh over my head, hanging to threads that seemed no thicker than a\nspider's. Though I had lived by the shore all my life, I seemed never to\nhave been near the sea till then. The smell of tar and salt was\nsomething new. I saw the most wonderful figureheads, that had all been\nfar over the ocean. I saw, besides, many old sailors, with rings in\ntheir ears, and whiskers curled in ringlets, and tarry pig-tails, and\ntheir swaggering, clumsy sea-walk; and if I had seen as many kings or\narchbishops I could not have been more delighted.\n\nAnd I was going to sea myself; to sea in a schooner, with a piping\nboatswain, and pig-tailed singing seamen; to sea, bound for an unknown\nisland, and to seek for buried treasure.\n\nWhile I was still in this delightful dream, we came suddenly in front of\na large inn, and met Squire Trelawney, all dressed out like a sea\nofficer, in stout blue cloth, coming out of the door with a smile on his\nface, and a capital imitation of a sailor's walk.\n\n\"Here you are!\" he cried; \"and the doctor came last night from London.\nBravo!--the ship's company complete.\"\n\n\"Oh, sir,\" cried I, \"when do we sail?\"\n\n\"Sail!\" says he. \"We sail to-morrow.\"\n\n\n\n\nAT THE SIGN OF THE \"SPY-GLASS\"\n\n\nWhen I had done breakfasting, the squire gave me a note addressed to\nJohn Silver, at the sign of the \"Spy-glass,\" and told me I should easily\nfind the place by following the line of the docks, and keeping a bright\nlookout for a little tavern with a large brass telescope for a sign. I\nset off, overjoyed at this opportunity to see some more of the ships and\nseamen, and picked my way among a great crowd of people and carts and\nbales, for the dock was now at its busiest, until I found the tavern in\nquestion.\n\nIt was a bright enough little place of entertainment. The sign was newly\npainted; the windows had neat red curtains; the floor was cleanly\nsanded. There was a street on each side, and an open door on both, which\nmade the large, low room pretty clear to see in, in spite of clouds of\ntobacco smoke.\n\nThe customers were mostly seafaring men, and they talked so loudly that\nI hung at the door, almost afraid to enter.\n\nAs I was waiting, a man came out of a side room, and at a glance I was\nsure he must be Long John. His left leg was cut off close by the hip,\nand under the left shoulder he carried a crutch, which he managed with\nwonderful dexterity, hopping about upon it like a bird. He was very tall\nand strong, with a face as big as a ham--plain and pale, but\nintelligent and smiling. Indeed, he seemed in the most cheerful spirits,\nwhistling as he moved about among the tables, with a merry word or a\nslap on the shoulder for the more favored of his guests.\n\nNow, to tell you the truth, from the very first mention of Long John in\nSquire Trelawney's letter, I had taken a fear in my mind that he might\nprove to be the very one-legged sailor whom I had watched for so long at\nthe old \"Benbow.\" But one look at the man before me was enough. I had\nseen the captain, and Black Dog, and the blind man Pew, and I thought I\nknew what a buccaneer was like--a very different creature, according to\nme, from this clean and pleasant-tempered landlord.\n\nI plucked up courage at once, crossed the threshold, and walked right up\nto the man where he stood, propped on his crutch, talking to a customer.\n\n\"Mr. Silver, sir?\" I asked, holding out the note.\n\n\"Yes, my lad,\" said he; \"such is my name, to be sure. And who may you\nbe?\" And when he saw the squire's letter he seemed to me to give\nsomething almost like a start.\n\n\"Oh!\" said he, quite aloud, and offering his hand, \"I see. You are our\nnew cabin-boy; pleased I am to see you.\"\n\nAnd he took my hand in his large firm grasp.\n\nJust then one of the customers at the far side rose suddenly and made\nfor the door. It was close by him, and he was out in the street in a\nmoment. But his hurry had attracted my notice, and I recognized him at a\nglance. It was the tallow-faced man, wanting two fingers, who had come\nfirst to the \"Admiral Benbow.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" I cried, \"stop him! it's Black Dog!\"\n\n\"I don't care two coppers who he is,\" cried Silver, \"but he hasn't paid\nhis score. Harry, run and catch him.\"\n\nOne of the others who was nearest the door leaped up and started in\npursuit.\n\n\"If he were Admiral Hawke he shall pay his score,\" cried Silver; and\nthen, relinquishing my hand, \"Who did you say he was?\" he asked. \"Black\nwhat?\"\n\n\"Dog, sir,\" said I. \"Has Mr. Trelawney not told you of the buccaneers?\nHe was one of them.\"\n\n\"So?\" cried Silver. \"In my house! Ben, run and help Harry. One of those\nswabs, was he? Was that you drinking with him, Morgan? Step up here.\"\n\nThe man whom he called Morgan--an old, gray-haired, mahogany-faced\nsailor--came forward pretty sheepishly, rolling his quid.\n\n[Illustration: _\"Now, Morgan,\" said Long John, very sternly, \"you never\nclapped your eyes on that Black Dog before, did you, now?\"_ (Page 57)]\n\n\"Now, Morgan,\" said Long John, very sternly, \"you never clapped your\neyes on that Black--Black Dog before, did you, now?\"\n\n\"Not I, sir,\" said Morgan, with a salute.\n\n\"You didn't know his name, did you?\"\n\n\"No, sir.\"\n\n\"By the powers, Tom Morgan, it's as good for you!\" exclaimed the\nlandlord. \"If you had been mixed up with the like of that, you would\nnever have put another foot in my house, you may lay to that. And what\nwas he saying to you?\"\n\n\"I don't rightly know, sir,\" answered Morgan.\n\n\"Do you call that a head on your shoulders, or a blessed dead-eye?\"\ncried Long John. \"Don't rightly know, don't you? Perhaps you don't\nhappen to rightly know who you was speaking to, perhaps? Come, now,\nwhat was he jawing--v'yages, cap'ns, ships? Pipe up! What was it?\"\n\n\"We was a-talkin' of keel-hauling,\" answered Morgan.\n\n\"Keel-hauling, was you? and a mighty suitable thing, too, and you may\nlay to that. Get back to your place for a lubber, Tom.\"\n\nAnd then, as Morgan rolled back to his seat, Silver added to me, in a\nconfidential whisper, that was very flattering, as I thought:\n\n\"He's quite an honest man, Tom Morgan, on'y stupid. And now,\" he ran on\nagain, aloud, \"let's see--Black Dog? No, I don't know the name, not I.\nYet I kind of think I've--yes, I've seen the swab. He used to come here\nwith a blind beggar, he used.\"\n\n\"That he did, you may be sure,\" said I. \"I knew that blind man, too. His\nname was Pew.\"\n\n\"It was!\" cried Silver, now quite excited. \"Pew! That were his name for\ncertain. Ah, he looked a shark, he did! If we run down this Black Dog\nnow, there'll be news for Cap'n Trelawney! Ben's a good runner; few\nseamen run better than Ben. He should run him down, hand over hand, by\nthe powers! He talked o' keel-hauling, did he? _I'll_ keel-haul him!\"\n\nAll the time he was jerking out these phrases he was stumping up and\ndown the tavern on his crutch, slapping tables with his hand, and giving\nsuch a show of excitement as would have convinced an Old Bailey judge or\na Bow Street runner. My suspicions had been thoroughly reawakened on\nfinding Black Dog at the \"Spy-glass,\" and I watched the cook narrowly.\nBut he was too deep, and too ready, and too clever for me, and by the\ntime the two men had come back out of breath, and confessed that they\nhad lost the track in a crowd, and been scolded like thieves, I would\nhave gone bail for the innocence of Long John Silver.\n\n\"See here, now, Hawkins,\" said he, \"here's a blessed hard thing on a man\nlike me, now, ain't it? There's Cap'n Trelawney--what's he to think?\nHere I have this confounded son of a Dutchman sitting in my own house,\ndrinking of my own rum! Here you comes and tells me of it plain; and\nhere I let him give us all the slip before my blessed deadlights! Now,\nHawkins, you do me justice with the cap'n. You're a lad, you are, but\nyou're as smart as paint. I see that when you first came in. Now, here\nit is: What could I do, with this old timber I hobble on? When I was an\nA B master mariner I'd have come up alongside of him, hand over hand,\nand broached him to in a brace of old shakes, I would; and now--\"\n\nAnd then, all of a sudden, he stopped, and his jaw dropped as though he\nhad remembered something.\n\n\"The score!\" he burst out. \"Three goes o' rum! Why, shiver my timbers,\nif I hadn't forgotten my score!\"\n\nAnd, falling on a bench, he laughed until the tears ran down his cheeks.\nI could not help joining, and we laughed together, peal after peal,\nuntil the tavern rang again.\n\n\"Why, what a precious old sea-calf I am!\" he said, at last, wiping his\ncheeks. \"You and me should get on well, Hawkins, for I'll take my davy I\nshould be rated ship's boy. But, come, now, stand by to go about. This\nwon't do. Dooty is dooty, messmates. I'll put on my old cocked hat and\nstep along of you to Cap'n Trelawney, and report this here affair. For,\nmind you, it's serious, young Hawkins; and neither you nor me's come out\nof it with what I should make so bold as to call credit. Nor you\nneither, says you; not smart--none of the pair of us smart. But dash my\nbuttons! that was a good 'un about my score.\"\n\nAnd he began to laugh again, and that so heartily, that though I did not\nsee the joke as he did, I was again obliged to join him in his mirth.\n\nOn our little walk along the quays he made himself the most interesting\ncompanion, telling me about the different ships that we passed by, their\nrig, tonnage, and nationality, explaining the work that was going\nforward--how one was discharging, another taking in cargo, and a third\nmaking ready for sea; and every now and then telling me some little\nanecdote of ships or seamen, or repeating a nautical phrase till I had\nlearned it perfectly. I began to see that here was one of the best of\npossible shipmates.\n\nWhen we got to the inn, the squire and Doctor Livesey were seated\ntogether, finishing a quart of ale with a toast in it, before they\nshould go aboard the schooner on a visit of inspection.\n\nLong John told the story from first to last, with a great deal of spirit\nand the most perfect truth. \"That was how it were, now, weren't it,\nHawkins?\" he would say, now and again, and I could always bear him\nentirely out.\n\nThe two gentlemen regretted that Black Dog had got away, but we all\nagreed there was nothing to be done, and after he had been complimented,\nLong John took up his crutch and departed.\n\n\"All hands aboard by four this afternoon!\" shouted the squire after him.\n\n\"Ay, ay, sir,\" cried the cook, in the passage.\n\n\"Well, squire,\" said Doctor Livesey, \"I don't put much faith in your\ndiscoveries, as a general thing, but I will say this--John Silver suits\nme.\"\n\n\"That man's a perfect trump,\" declared the squire.\n\n\"And now,\" added the doctor, \"Jim may come on board with us, may he\nnot?\"\n\n\"To be sure he may,\" said the squire. \"Take your hat, Hawkins, and we'll\nsee the ship.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nPOWDER AND ARMS\n\n\nThe _Hispaniola_ lay some way out, and we went under the figureheads and\naround the sterns of many other ships, and their cables sometimes grated\nbeneath our keel, and sometimes swung above us. At last, however, we\nswung alongside, and were met and saluted as we stepped aboard by the\nmate, Mr. Arrow, a brown old sailor, with earrings in his ears and a\nsquint. He and the squire were very thick and friendly, but I soon\nobserved that things were not the same between Mr. Trelawney and the\ncaptain.\n\nThis last was a sharp-looking man, who seemed angry with everything on\nboard, and was soon to tell us why, for we had hardly got down into the\ncabin when a sailor followed us.\n\n\"Captain Smollett, sir, axing to speak with you,\" said he.\n\n\"I am always at the captain's orders. Show him in,\" said the squire.\n\nThe captain, who was close behind his messenger, entered at once, and\nshut the door behind him.\n\n\"Well, Captain Smollett, what have you to say? All well, I hope; all\nshipshape and seaworthy?\"\n\n\"Well, sir,\" said the captain, \"better speak plain, I believe, at the\nrisk of offense. I don't like this cruise; I don't like the men; and I\ndon't like my officer. That's short and sweet.\"\n\n\"Perhaps, sir, you don't like the ship?\" inquired the squire, very\nangry, as I could see.\n\n\"I can't speak as to that, sir, not having seen her tried,\" said the\ncaptain. \"She seems a clever craft; more I can't say.\"\n\n\"Possibly, sir, you may not like your employer, either?\" said the\nsquire.\n\nBut here Doctor Livesey cut in.\n\n\"Stay a bit,\" said he, \"stay a bit. No use of such questions as that but\nto produce ill-feeling. The captain has said too much or he has said too\nlittle, and I'm bound to say that I require an explanation of his words.\nYou don't, you say, like this cruise. Now, why?\"\n\n\"I was engaged, sir, on what we call sealed orders, to sail this ship\nfor that gentleman where he should bid me,\" said the captain. \"So far so\ngood. But now I find that every man before the mast knows more than I\ndo. I don't call that fair, now, do you?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Doctor Livesey, \"I don't.\"\n\n\"Next,\" said the captain, \"I learn we are going after treasure--hear it\nfrom my own hands, mind you. Now, treasure is ticklish work; I don't\nlike treasure voyages on any account; and I don't like them, above all,\nwhen they are secret, and when (begging your pardon, Mr. Trelawney) the\nsecret has been told to the parrot.\"\n\n\"Silver's parrot?\" asked the squire.\n\n\"It's a way of speaking,\" said the captain. \"Blabbed, I mean. It's my\nbelief neither of you gentlemen know what you are about; but I'll tell\nyou my way of it--life or death, and a close run.\"\n\n\"That is all clear, and, I dare say, true enough,\" replied Doctor\nLivesey. \"We take the risk, but we are not so ignorant as you believe\nus. Next, you say you don't like the crew. Are they not good seamen?\"\n\n\"I don't like them, sir,\" returned Captain Smollett. \"And I think I\nshould have had the choosing of my own hands, if you go to that.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you should,\" replied the doctor. \"My friend should, perhaps,\nhave taken you along with him; but the slight, if there be one, was\nunintentional. And you don't like Mr. Arrow?\"\n\n\"I don't, sir. I believe he's a good seaman, but he's too free with\nthe crew to be a good officer. A mate should keep himself to\nhimself--shouldn't drink with the men before the mast.\"\n\n\"Do you mean he drinks?\" cried the squire.\n\n\"No, sir,\" replied the captain; \"only that he's too familiar.\"\n\n\"Well, now, and the short and long of it, captain?\" asked the doctor.\n\"Tell us what you want.\"\n\n\"Well, gentlemen, are you determined to go on this cruise?\"\n\n\"Like iron,\" answered the squire.\n\n\"Very good,\" said the captain. \"Then, as you've heard me very patiently,\nsaying things that I could not prove, hear me a few words more. They are\nputting the powder and the arms in the fore hold. Now, you have a good\nplace under the cabin; why not put them there?--first point. Then you\nare bringing four of your own people with you, and they tell me some of\nthem are to be berthed forward. Why not give them the berths here beside\nthe cabin?--second point.\"\n\n\"Any more?\" asked Mr. Trelawney.\n\n\"One more,\" said the captain. \"There's been too much blabbing already.\"\n\n\"Far too much,\" agreed the doctor.\n\n\"I'll tell you what I've heard myself,\" continued Captain Smollett;\n\"that you have a map of an island; that there's crosses on the map to\nshow where treasure is; and that the island lies--\" And then he named\nthe latitude and longitude exactly.\n\n\"I never told that,\" cried the squire, \"to a soul.\"\n\n\"The hands know it, sir,\" returned the captain.\n\n\"Livesey, that must have been you or Hawkins,\" cried the squire.\n\n\"It doesn't much matter who it was,\" replied the doctor. And I could see\nthat neither he nor the captain paid much regard to Mr. Trelawney's\nprotestations. Neither did I, to be sure, he was so loose a talker; yet\nin this case I believe he was really right, and that nobody had told the\nsituation of the island.\n\n\"Well, gentlemen,\" continued the captain, \"I don't know who has this\nmap, but I make it a point it shall be kept secret even from me and Mr.\nArrow. Otherwise I would ask you to let me resign.\"\n\n\"I see,\" said the doctor. \"You wish us to keep this matter dark, and to\nmake a garrison of the stern part of the ship, manned with my friend's\nown people, and provided with all the arms and powder on board. In other\nwords, you fear a mutiny.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said Captain Smollett, \"with no intention to take offense, I deny\nyour right to put words into my mouth. No captain, sir, would be\njustified in going to sea at all if he had ground enough to say that. As\nfor Mr. Arrow, I believe him thoroughly honest; some of the men are the\nsame; all may be for what I know. But I am responsible for the ship's\nsafety and the life of every man Jack aboard of her. I see things going,\nas I think, not quite right; and I ask you to take certain precautions,\nor let me resign my berth. And that's all.\"\n\n\"Captain Smollett,\" began the doctor, with a smile, \"did ever you hear\nthe fable of the mountain and the mouse? You'll excuse me, I dare say,\nbut you remind me of that fable. When you came in here I'll stake my wig\nyou meant more than this.\"\n\n\"Doctor,\" said the captain, \"you are smart. When I came in here I meant\nto get discharged. I had no thought that Mr. Trelawney would hear a\nword.\"\n\n\"No more I would,\" cried the squire. \"Had Livesey not been here I should\nhave seen you to the deuce. As it is, I have heard you. I will do as you\ndesire, but I think the worse of you.\"\n\n\"That's as you please, sir,\" said the captain. \"You'll find I do my\nduty.\"\n\nAnd with that he took his leave.\n\n\"Trelawney,\" said the doctor, \"contrary to all my notions, I believe you\nhave managed to get two honest men on board with you--that man and John\nSilver.\"\n\n\"Silver, if you like,\" cried the squire, \"but as for that intolerable\nhumbug, I declare I think his conduct unmanly, unsailorly, and downright\nun-English.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the doctor, \"we shall see.\"\n\nWhen we came on deck the men had begun already to take out the arms and\npowder, yo-ho-ing at their work, while the captain and Mr. Arrow stood\nby superintending.\n\nThe new arrangement was quite to my liking. The whole schooner had been\noverhauled; six berths had been made astern, out of what had been the\nafter-part of the main hold, and this set of cabins was only joined to\nthe galley and forecastle by a sparred passage on the port side. It had\nbeen originally meant that the captain, Mr. Arrow, Hunter, Joyce, the\ndoctor, and the squire were to occupy these six berths. Now Redruth and\nI were to get two of them, and Mr. Arrow and the captain were to sleep\non deck in the companion, which had been enlarged on each side till you\nmight almost have called it a round-house. Very low it was still, of\ncourse, but there was room to swing two hammocks, and even the mate\nseemed pleased with the arrangement. Even he, perhaps, had been doubtful\nas to the crew, but that is only guess, for, as you shall hear, we had\nnot long the benefit of his opinion.\n\nWe were all hard at work changing the powder and the berths, when the\nlast man or two, and Long John along with them, came off in a\nshore-boat.\n\nThe cook came up the side like a monkey for cleverness, and, as soon as\nhe saw what was doing, \"So ho, mates!\" said he, \"what's this!\"\n\n\"We're a-changing the powder, Jack,\" answers one.\n\n\"Why, by the powers,\" cried Long John, \"if we do, we'll miss the morning\ntide!\"\n\n\"My orders!\" said the captain, shortly. \"You may go below, my man. Hands\nwill want supper.\"\n\n\"Ay, ay, sir,\" answered the cook; and, touching his forelock, he\ndisappeared at once in the direction of his galley.\n\n\"That's a good man, captain,\" said the doctor.\n\n\"Very likely, sir,\" replied Captain Smollett. \"Easy with that,\nmen--easy,\" he ran on, to the fellows who were shifting the powder; and\nthen suddenly observing me examining the swivel we carried amidships, a\nlong brass nine--\"Here, you ship's boy,\" he cried, \"out o' that! Off\nwith you to the cook and get some work.\"\n\nAnd then as I was hurrying off I heard him say, quite loudly, to the\ndoctor:\n\n\"I'll have no favorites on my ship.\"\n\nI assure you I was quite of the squire's way of thinking, and hated the\ncaptain deeply.\n\n\n\n\nTHE VOYAGE\n\n\nAll that night we were in a great bustle getting things stowed in their\nplace, and boatfuls of the squire's friends, Mr. Blandly and the like,\ncoming off to wish him a good voyage and a safe return. We never had a\nnight at the \"Admiral Benbow\" when I had half the work; and I was\ndog-tired when, a little before dawn, the boatswain sounded his pipe,\nand the crew began to man the capstan bars. I might have been twice as\nweary, yet I would not have left the deck, all was so new and\ninteresting to me--the brief commands, the shrill notes of the whistle,\nthe men bustling to their places in the glimmer of the ship's lanterns.\n\n\"Now, Barbecue, tip us a stave,\" cried one voice.\n\n\"The old one,\" cried another.\n\n\"Ay, ay, mates,\" said Long John, who was standing by, with his crutch\nunder his arm, and at once broke out in the air and words I knew so\nwell:\n\n    \"Fifteen men on the dead man's chest\"--\n\nAnd then the whole crew bore chorus:\n\n    \"Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum!\"\n\nAnd at the third \"ho!\" drove the bars before them with a will.\n\nEven at that exciting moment it carried me back to the old \"Admiral\nBenbow\" in a second, and I seemed to hear the voice of the captain\npiping in the chorus. But soon the anchor was short up; soon it was\nhanging dripping at the bows; soon the sails began to draw, and the land\nand shipping to flit by on either side, and before I could lie down to\nsnatch an hour of slumber the _Hispaniola_ had begun her voyage to the\nIsle of Treasure.\n\nI am not going to relate the voyage in detail. It was fairly prosperous.\nThe ship proved to be a good ship, the crew were capable seamen, and the\ncaptain thoroughly understood his business. But before we came the\nlength of Treasure Island, two or three things had happened which\nrequire to be known.\n\nMr. Arrow, first of all, turned out even worse than the captain had\nfeared. He had no command among the men, and people did what they\npleased with him. But that was by no means the worst of it; for after a\nday or two at sea he began to appear on deck with hazy eye, red cheeks,\nstuttering tongue, and other marks of drunkenness. Time after time he\nwas ordered below in disgrace. Sometimes he fell and cut himself;\nsometimes he lay all day long in his little bunk at one side of the\ncompanion; sometimes for a day or two he would be almost sober and\nattend to his work at least passably.\n\nIn the meantime we could never make out where he got the drink. That was\nthe ship's mystery. Watch him as we pleased, we could do nothing to\nsolve it, and when we asked him to his face, he would only laugh, if he\nwere drunk, and if he were sober, deny solemnly that he ever tasted\nanything but water.\n\nHe was not only useless as an officer, and a bad influence among the\nmen, but it was plain that at this rate he must soon kill himself\noutright, so nobody was much surprised, nor very sorry, when one dark\nnight, with a head sea, he disappeared entirely and was seen no more.\n\n\"Overboard!\" said the captain. \"Well, gentlemen, that saves the trouble\nof putting him in irons.\"\n\nBut there we were, without a mate, and it was necessary, of course, to\nadvance one of the men. The boatswain, Job Anderson, was the likeliest\nman aboard, and though he kept his old title, he served in a way as\nmate. Mr. Trelawney had followed the sea, and his knowledge made him\nvery useful, for he often took a watch himself in easy weather. And the\ncoxswain, Israel Hands, was a careful, wily, old, experienced seaman,\nwho could be trusted at a pinch with almost anything.\n\nHe was a great confidant of Long John Silver, and so the mention of his\nname leads me on to speak of our ship's cook, Barbecue, as the men\ncalled him.\n\n[Illustration: _It was something to see him get on with his cooking like\nsomeone safe ashore_ (Page 71)]\n\nAboard ship he carried his crutch by a lanyard round his neck, to have\nboth hands as free as possible. It was something to see him wedge the\nfoot of the crutch against a bulkhead, and, propped against it, yielding\nto every movement of the ship, get on with his cooking like someone safe\nashore. Still more strange was it to see him in the heaviest of weather\ncross the deck. He had a line or two rigged up to help him across the\nwidest spaces--Long John's earrings, they were called--and he would hand\nhimself from one place to another, now using the crutch, now trailing it\nalongside by the lanyard, as quickly as another man could walk. Yet some\nof the men who had sailed with him before expressed their pity to see\nhim so reduced.\n\n\"He's no common man, Barbecue,\" said the coxswain to me. \"He had good\nschooling in his young days, and can speak like a book when so minded;\nand brave--a lion's nothing alongside of Long John! I seen him grapple\nfour and knock their heads together--him unarmed.\"\n\nAll the crew respected and even obeyed him. He had a way of talking to\neach, and doing everybody some particular service. To me he was\nunweariedly kind, and always glad to see me in the galley, which he kept\nas clean as a new pin; the dishes hanging up burnished, and his parrot\nin a cage in the corner.\n\n\"Come away, Hawkins,\" he would say; \"come and have a yarn with John.\nNobody more welcome than yourself, my son. Sit you down and hear the\nnews. Here's Cap'n Flint--I calls my parrot Cap'n Flint, after the\nfamous buccaneer--here's Cap'n Flint predicting success to our v'yage.\nWasn't you, Cap'n?\"\n\nAnd the parrot would say, with great rapidity: \"Pieces of eight! pieces\nof eight! pieces of eight!\" till you wondered that it was not out of\nbreath or till John threw his handkerchief over the cage.\n\n\"Now, that bird,\" he would say, \"is, may be, two hundred years old,\nHawkins--they live forever mostly, and if anybody's seen more wickedness\nit must be the devil himself. She's sailed with England--the great Cap'n\nEngland, the pirate. She's been at Madagascar, and at Malabar, and\nSurinam, and Providence, and Portobello. She was at the fishing up of\nthe wrecked plate ships. It's there she learned 'Pieces of eight,' and\nlittle wonder; three hundred and fifty thousand of 'em, Hawkins! She was\nat the boarding of the _Viceroy of the Indies_ out of Goa, she was, and\nto look at her you would think she was a babby. But you smelt\npowder--didn't you, cap'n?\"\n\n\"Stand by to go about,\" the parrot would scream.\n\n\"Ah, she's a handsome craft, she is,\" the cook would say, and give her\nsugar from his pocket, and then the bird would peck at the bars and\nswear straight on, passing belief for wickedness. \"There,\" John would\nadd, \"you can't touch pitch and not be mucked, lad. Here's this poor old\ninnocent bird of mine swearing blue fire and none the wiser, you may lay\nto that. She would swear the same, in a manner of speaking, before the\nchaplain.\" And John would touch his forelock with a solemn way he had,\nthat made me think he was the best of men.\n\nIn the meantime the squire and Captain Smollett were still on pretty\ndistant terms with one another. The squire made no bones about the\nmatter; he despised the captain. The captain, on his part, never spoke\nbut when he was spoken to, and then sharp and short and dry, and not a\nword wasted. He owned, when driven into a corner, that he seemed to have\nbeen wrong about the crew; that some of them were as brisk as he wanted\nto see, and all had behaved fairly well. As for the ship, he had taken a\ndownright fancy to her. \"She'll lie a point nearer the wind than a man\nhas a right to expect of his own married wife, sir. But,\" he would add,\n\"all I say is, we're not home again, and I don't like the cruise.\"\n\nThe squire, at this, would turn away and march up and down the deck,\nchin in air.\n\n\"A trifle more of that man,\" he would say, \"and I should explode.\"\n\nWe had some heavy weather, which only proved the qualities of the\n_Hispaniola_. Every man on board seemed well content, and they must have\nbeen hard to please if they had been otherwise, for it is my belief\nthere was never a ship's company so spoiled since Noah put to sea.\nDouble grog was going on the least excuse; there was duff on odd days,\nas, for instance, if the squire heard it was any man's birthday; and\nalways a barrel of apples standing broached in the waist, for anyone to\nhelp himself that had a fancy.\n\n\"Never knew good to come of it yet,\" the captain said to Doctor Livesey.\n\"Spoil foc's'le hands, make devils. That's my belief.\"\n\nBut good did come of the apple barrel, as you shall hear, for if it had\nnot been for that we should have had no note of warning and might all\nhave perished by the hand of treachery.\n\nThis is how it came about.\n\nWe had run up the trades to get the wind of the island we were after--I\nam not allowed to be more plain--and now we were running down for it\nwith a bright lookout day and night. It was about the last day of our\noutward voyage, by the largest computation; some time that night, or, at\nlatest, before noon of the morrow, we should sight the Treasure Island.\nWe were heading south-southwest, and had a steady breeze abeam and a\nquiet sea. The _Hispaniola_ rolled steadily, dipping her bowsprit now\nand then with a whiff of spray. All was drawing alow and aloft; everyone\nwas in the bravest spirits, because we were now so near an end of the\nfirst part of our adventure.\n\nNow, just after sundown, when all my work was over and I was on my way\nto my berth, it occurred to me that I should like an apple. I ran on\ndeck. The watch was all forward looking out for the island. The man at\nthe helm was watching the luff of the sail and whistling away gently to\nhimself, and that was the only sound excepting the swish of the sea\nagainst the bows and around the sides of the ship.\n\nIn I got bodily into the apple barrel, and found there was scarce an\napple left; but, sitting down there in the dark, what with the sound of\nthe waters and the rocking movement of the ship, I had either fallen\nasleep, or was on the point of doing so, when a heavy man sat down with\nrather a clash close by. The barrel shook as he leaned his shoulders\nagainst it, and I was just about to jump up when the man began to speak.\nIt was Silver's voice, and, before I had heard a dozen words, I would\nnot have shown myself for all the world, but lay there, trembling and\nlistening, in the extreme of fear and curiosity; for from these dozen\nwords I understood that the lives of all the honest men aboard depended\nupon me alone.\n\n\n\n\nWHAT I HEARD IN THE APPLE BARREL\n\n\n\"No, not I,\" said Silver. \"Flint was cap'n; I was quartermaster, along\nof my timber leg. The same broadside I lost my leg, old Pew lost his\ndeadlights. It was a master surgeon, him that ampytated me--out of\ncollege and all--Latin by the bucket, and what not; but he was hanged\nlike a dog, and sun-dried like the rest, at Corso Castle. That was\nRoberts' men, that was, and comed of changing names to their\nships--_Royal Fortune_ and so on. Now, what a ship was christened, so\nlet her stay, I says. So it was with the _Cassandra_, as brought us all\nsafe home from Malabar, after England took the _Viceroy of the Indies_;\nso it was with the old _Walrus_, Flint's old ship, as I've seen a-muck\nwith the red blood and fit to sink with gold.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" cried another voice, that of the youngest hand on board, and\nevidently full of admiration, \"he was the flower of the flock, was\nFlint!\"\n\n\"Davis was a man, too, by all accounts,\" said Silver. \"I never sailed\nalong of him; first with England, then with Flint, that's my story; and\nnow here on my own account, in a manner of speaking. I laid by nine\nhundred safe, from England, and two thousand after Flint. That ain't bad\nfor a man before the mast--all safe in bank. 'Tain't earning now, it's\nsaving does it, you may lay to that. Where's all England's men now? I\ndunno. Where's Flint's? Why, most of 'em aboard here, and glad to get\nthe duff--been begging before that, some of 'em. Old Pew, as had lost\nhis sight, and might have thought shame, spends twelve hundred pounds in\na year, like a lord in Parliament. Where is he now? Well, he's dead now\nand under hatches; but for two years before that, shiver my timbers! the\nman was starving. He begged, and he stole, and he cut throats, and\nstarved at that, by the powers!\"\n\n\"Well, it ain't much use, after all,\" said the young seaman.\n\n\"'Tain't much use for fools, you may lay to it--that, nor nothing,\"\ncried Silver. \"But now, you look here; you're young, you are, but you're\nas smart as paint. I see that when I set my eyes on you, and I'll talk\nto you like a man.\"\n\nYou can imagine how I felt when I heard this abominable old rogue\naddressing another in the very same words of flattery as he had used to\nmyself. I think, if I had been able, that I would have killed him\nthrough the barrel. Meantime he ran on, little supposing he was\noverheard.\n\n\"Here it is about gentlemen of fortune. They lives rough, and they risk\nswinging, but they eat and drink like fighting-cocks, and when a cruise\nis done, why it's hundreds of pounds instead of hundreds of farthings in\ntheir pockets. Now, the most goes for rum and a good fling, and to sea\nagain in their shirts. But that's not the course I lay. I puts it all\naway, some here, some there, and none too much anywheres, by reason of\nsuspicion. I'm fifty, mark you; once back from this cruise I set up\ngentleman in earnest. Time enough, too, says you. Ah, but I've lived\neasy in the meantime; never denied myself o' nothing heart desires, and\nslept soft and ate dainty all my days, but when at sea. And how did I\nbegin? Before the mast, like you!\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the other, \"but all the other money's gone now, ain't it?\nYou daren't show face in Bristol after this.\"\n\n\"Why, where might you suppose it was?\" asked Silver, derisively.\n\n\"At Bristol, in banks and places,\" answered his companion.\n\n\"It were,\" said the cook; \"it were when we weighed anchor. But my old\nmissis has it all by now. And the 'Spy-glass' is sold, lease and good\nwill and rigging; and the old girl's off to meet me. I would tell you\nwhere, for I trust you; but it 'ud make jealousy among the mates.\"\n\n\"And you can trust your missis?\" asked the other.\n\n\"Gentlemen of fortune,\" returned the cook, \"usually trust little among\nthemselves, and right they are, you may lay to it. But I have a way with\nme, I have. When a mate brings a slip on his cable--one as knows me, I\nmean--it won't be in the same world with old John. There was some that\nwas feared of Pew, and some that was feared of Flint; but Flint his own\nself was feared of me. Feared he was, and proud. They was the roughest\ncrew afloat, was Flint's; the devil himself would have been feared to go\nto sea with them. Well, now, I tell you, I'm not a boasting man, and you\nseen yourself how easy I keep company; but when I was quartermaster,\n_lambs_ wasn't the word for Flint's old buccaneers. Ah, you may be sure\nof yourself in old John's ship.\"\n\n\"Well, I tell you now,\" replied the lad, \"I didn't half a quarter like\nthe job till I had this talk with you, John, but there's my hand on it\nnow.\"\n\n\"And a brave lad you were, and smart, too,\" answered Silver, shaking\nhands so heartily that all the barrel shook, \"and a finer figurehead for\na gentleman of fortune I never clapped my eyes on.\"\n\nBy this time I had begun to understand the meaning of their terms. By a\n\"gentleman of fortune\" they plainly meant neither more nor less than a\ncommon pirate, and the little scene that I had overheard was the last\nact in the corruption of one of the honest hands--perhaps of the last\none left aboard. But on this point I was soon to be relieved, for,\nSilver giving a little whistle, a third man strolled up and sat down by\nthe party.\n\n\"Dick's square,\" said Silver.\n\n\"Oh, I know'd Dick was square,\" returned the voice of the coxswain,\nIsrael Hands. \"He's no fool, is Dick.\" And he turned his quid and spat.\n\"But, look here,\" he went on, \"here's what I want to know, Barbecue--how\nlong are we a-going to stand off and on like a blessed bumboat? I've had\na'most enough o' Cap'n Smollett; he's hazed me long enough, by thunder!\nI want to go into that cabin, I do. I want their pickles and wines, and\nthat.\"\n\n\"Israel,\" said Silver, \"your head ain't much account, nor never was. But\nyou're able to hear, I reckon; leastways your ears is big enough. Now,\nhere's what I say--you'll berth forward, and you'll live hard, and\nyou'll speak soft, and you'll keep sober, till I give the word; and you\nmay lay to that, my son.\"\n\n\"Well, I don't say no, do I?\" growled the coxswain. \"What I say is,\nwhen? That's what I say.\"\n\n\"When! by the powers!\" cried Silver. \"Well, now, if you want to know,\nI'll tell you when. The last moment I can manage; and that's when.\nHere's a first-rate seaman, Cap'n Smollett, sails the blessed ship for\nus. Here's this squire and doctor with a map and such--I don't know\nwhere it is, do I? No more do you, says you. Well, then, I mean this\nsquire and doctor shall find the stuff, and help us to get it aboard, by\nthe powers! Then we'll see. If I was sure of you all, sons of double\nDutchmen, I'd have Cap'n Smollett navigate us halfway back again before\nI struck.\"\n\n\"Why, we're all seamen aboard here, I should think,\" said the lad Dick.\n\n\"We're all foc's'le hands, you mean,\" snapped Silver. \"We can steer a\ncourse, but who's to set one? That's what all you gentlemen split on,\nfirst and last. If I had my way, I'd have Cap'n Smollett work us back\ninto the trades at least; then we'd have no blessed miscalculations and\na spoonful of water a day. But I know the sort you are. I'll finish with\n'em at the island, as soon's the blunt's on board, and a pity it is. But\nyou're never happy till you're drunk. Split my sides, I've a sick heart\nto sail with the likes of you!\"\n\n\"Easy all, Long John,\" cried Israel. \"Who's a-crossin' of you?\"\n\n\"Why, how many tall ships, think ye, now, have I seen laid aboard? and\nhow many brisk lads drying in the sun at Execution Dock?\" cried Silver;\n\"and all for this same hurry and hurry and hurry. You hear me? I seen a\nthing or two at sea, I have. If you would on'y lay your course, and a\np'int to windward, you would ride in carriages, you would. But not you!\nI know you. You'll have your mouthful of rum to-morrow, and go hang.\"\n\n\"Everybody know'd you was a kind of a chapling, John; but there's others\nas could hand and steer as well as you,\" said Israel. \"They liked a bit\no' fun, they did. They wasn't so high and dry, nohow, but took their\nfling, like jolly companions, everyone.\"\n\n\"So?\" said Silver. \"Well, and where are they now? Pew was that sort, and\nhe died a beggar-man. Flint was, and he died of rum at Savannah. Ah,\nthey was a sweet crew, they was! on'y, where are they?\"\n\n\"But,\" asked Dick, \"when we do lay 'em athwart, what are we to do with\n'em, anyhow?\"\n\n\"There's the man for me!\" cried the cook, admiringly. \"That's what I\ncall business. Well, what would you think? Put 'em ashore like maroons?\nThat would have been England's way. Or cut 'em down like that much pork?\nThat would have been Flint's or Billy Bones's.\"\n\n\"Billy was the man for that,\" said Israel. \"'Dead men don't bite,' says\nhe. Well, he's dead now, hisself; he knows the long and short on it now;\nand if ever a rough hand come to port, it was Billy.\"\n\n\"Right you are,\" said Silver, \"rough and ready. But mark you here: I'm\nan easy man--I'm quite the gentleman, says you; but this time it's\nserious. Dooty is dooty, mates. I give my vote--death. When I'm in\nParlyment, and riding in my coach, I don't want none of these\nsea-lawyers in the cabin a-coming home, unlooked for, like the devil at\nprayers. Wait is what I say; but when the time comes, why let her rip!\"\n\n\"John,\" cried the coxswain, \"you're a man!\"\n\n\"You'll say so, Israel, when you see,\" said Silver. \"Only one thing I\nclaim--I claim Trelawney. I'll wring his calf's head off his body with\nthese hands. Dick!\" he added, breaking off, \"you must jump up, like a\nsweet lad, and get me an apple, to wet my pipe like.\"\n\nYou may fancy the terror I was in! I should have leaped out and run for\nit, if I had found the strength; but my limbs and heart alike misgave\nme. I heard Dick begin to rise, and then some one seemingly stopped him,\nand the voice of Hands exclaimed:\n\n\"Oh, stow that! Don't you get sucking of that bilge, John. Let's have a\ngo of the rum.\"\n\n\"Dick,\" said Silver, \"I trust you. I've a gauge on the keg, mind.\nThere's the key; you fill a pannikin and bring it up.\"\n\nTerrified as I was, I could not help thinking to myself that this must\nhave been how Mr. Arrow got the strong waters that destroyed him.\n\nDick was gone but a little while, and during his absence Israel spoke\nstraight on in the cook's ear. It was but a word or two that I could\ncatch, and yet I gathered some important news; for, besides other scraps\nthat tended to the same purpose, this whole clause was audible: \"Not\nanother man of them'll jine.\" Hence there were still faithful men on\nboard.\n\nWhen Dick returned, one after another of the trio took the pannikin and\ndrank--one \"To luck\"; another with a \"Here's to old Flint,\" and Silver\nhimself saying, in a kind of song, \"Here's to ourselves, and hold your\nluff, plenty of prizes and plenty of duff.\"\n\nJust then a sort of brightness fell upon me in the barrel, and, looking\nup, I found the moon had risen, and was silvering the mizzen-top and\nshining white on the luff of the foresail, and almost at the same time\nthe voice on the lookout shouted, \"Land ho!\"\n\n\n\n\nCOUNCIL OF WAR\n\n\nThere was a great rush of feet across the deck. I could hear people\ntumbling up from the cabin and the foc's'le; and slipping in an instant\noutside my barrel, I dived behind the foresail, made a double towards\nthe stern, and came out upon the open deck in time to join Hunter and\nDoctor Livesey in the rush for the weather bow.\n\nThere all hands were already congregated. A belt of fog had lifted\nalmost simultaneously with the appearance of the moon. Away to the\nsouthwest of us we saw two low hills, about a couple of miles apart, and\nrising behind one of them a third and higher hill, whose peak was still\nburied in the fog. All three seemed sharp and conical in figure.\n\nSo much I saw almost in a dream, for I had not yet recovered from my\nhorrid fear of a minute or two before. And then I heard the voice of\nCaptain Smollett issuing orders. The _Hispaniola_ was laid a couple of\npoints nearer the wind, and now sailed a course that would just clear\nthe island on the east.\n\n\"And now, men,\" said the captain, when all was sheeted home, \"has any\none of you ever seen that land ahead?\"\n\n\"I have, sir,\" said Silver. \"I've watered there with a trader I was cook\nin.\"\n\n\"The anchorage is on the south, behind an islet, I fancy?\" asked the\ncaptain.\n\n\"Yes, sir, Skeleton Island they calls it. It were a main place for\npirates once, and a hand we had on board knowed all their names for it.\nThat hill to the nor'ard they calls the Foremast Hill; there are three\nhills in a row running south'ard--fore, main, and mizzen, sir.\n\n### Summary:"}

The captain, the squire, and I\nwere talking matters over in the cabin. Had there been a breath of wind,\nwe should have fallen on the six mutineers who were left aboard with us,\nslipped our cable, and away to sea. But the wind was wanting; and, to\ncomplete our helplessness, down came Hunter with the news that Jim\nHawkins had slipped into a boat and was gone ashore with the rest.\n\nIt had never occurred to us to doubt Jim Hawkins, but we were alarmed\nfor his safety. With the men in the temper they were in, it seemed an\neven chance if we should see the lad again. We ran on deck. The pitch\nwas bubbling in the seams; the nasty stench of the place turned me sick;\nif ever a man smelled fever and dysentery it was in that abominable\nanchorage. The six scoundrels were sitting grumbling under a sail in the\nforecastle; ashore we could see the gigs made fast, and a man sitting in\neach, hard by where the river runs in. One of them was whistling\n\"Lillibullero.\"\n\nWaiting was a strain, and it was decided that Hunter and I should go\nashore with the jolly-boat, in quest of information.\n\nThe gigs had leaned to their right, but Hunter and I pulled straight in,\nin the direction of the stockade upon the chart. The two who were left\nguarding their boats seemed in a bustle at our appearance;\n\"Lillibullero\" stopped off, and I could see the pair discussing what\nthey ought to do. Had they gone and told Silver, all might have turned\nout differently; but they had their orders, I suppose, and decided to\nsit quietly where they were and hark back again to \"Lillibullero.\"\n\nThere was a slight bend in the coast, and I steered so as to put it\nbetween us. Even before we landed we had thus lost sight of the gigs; I\njumped out and came as near running as I durst, with a big silk\nhandkerchief under my hat for coolness' sake, and a brace of pistols\nready primed for safety.\n\nI had not gone a hundred yards when I came on the stockade.\n\nThis was how it was: A spring of clear water arose at the top of a\nknoll. Well, on the knoll, and inclosing the spring, they had clapped a\nstout log house, fit to hold two-score people on a pinch, and loopholed\nfor musketry on every side. All around this they had cleared a wide\nspace, and then the thing was completed by a paling six feet high,\nwithout door or opening, too strong to pull down without time and labor,\nand too open to shelter the besiegers. The people in the log house had\nthem in every way; they stood quiet in the shelter and shot the others\nlike partridges. All they wanted was a good watch and food; for, short\nof a complete surprise, they might have held the place against a\nregiment.\n\nWhat particularly took my fancy was the spring. For, though we had a\ngood place of it in the cabin of the _Hispaniola_, with plenty of arms\nand ammunition, and things to eat, and excellent wines, there had been\none thing overlooked--we had no water. I was thinking this over, when\nthere came ringing over the island the cry of a man at the point of\ndeath. I was not new to violent death--I have served his Royal Highness\nthe Duke of Cumberland, and got a wound myself at Fontenoy--but I know\nmy pulse went dot and carry one. \"Jim Hawkins is gone,\" was my first\nthought.\n\nIt is something to have been an old soldier, but more still to have been\na doctor. There is no time to dilly-dally in our work. And so now I made\nup my mind instantly, and with no time lost returned to the shore and\njumped on board the jolly-boat.\n\nBy good fortune Hunter pulled a good oar. We made the water fly, and the\nboat was soon alongside and I aboard the schooner.\n\nI found them all shaken, as was natural. The squire was sitting down, as\nwhite as a sheet, thinking of the harm he had led us to, the good soul!\nand one of the six forecastle hands was little better.\n\n\"There's a man,\" said Captain Smollett, nodding toward him, \"new to this\nwork. He came nigh-hand fainting, doctor, when he heard the cry. Another\ntouch of the rudder and that man would join us.\"\n\nI told my plan to the captain, and between us we settled on the details\nof its accomplishment.\n\nWe put old Redruth in the gallery between the cabin and the forecastle,\nwith three or four loaded muskets and a mattress for protection. Hunter\nbrought the boat round under the stern port, and Joyce and I set to work\nloading her with powder, tins, muskets, bags of biscuits, kegs of pork,\na cask of cognac, and my invaluable medicine chest.\n\nIn the meantime the squire and the captain stayed on deck, and the\nlatter hailed the coxswain, who was the principal man aboard.\n\n\"Mr. Hands,\" he said, \"here are two of us with a brace of pistols each.\nIf any one of you six make a signal of any description, that man's\ndead.\"\n\nThey were a good deal taken aback; and, after a little consultation, one\nand all tumbled down the fore companion, thinking, no doubt, to take us\non the rear. But when they saw Redruth waiting for them in the sparred\ngallery, they went about ship at once, and a head popped out again on\ndeck.\n\n\"Down, dog!\" cried the captain.\n\nAnd the head popped back again, and we heard no more for the time of\nthese six very faint-hearted seamen.\n\nBy this time, tumbling things in as they came, we had the jolly-boat\nloaded as much as we dared. Joyce and I got out through the stern port,\nand we made for shore again, as fast as oars could take us.\n\nThis second trip fairly aroused the watchers along shore. \"Lillibullero\"\nwas dropped again, and just before we lost sight of them behind the\nlittle point, one of them whipped ashore and disappeared. I had half a\nmind to change my plan and destroy their boats, but I feared that Silver\nand the others might be close at hand, and all might very well be lost\nby trying for too much.\n\nWe had soon touched land in the same place as before and set to work to\nprovision the blockhouse. All three made the first journey, heavily\nladen, and tossed our stores over the palisade. Then, leaving Joyce to\nguard them--one man, to be sure, but with half a dozen muskets--Hunter\nand I returned to the jolly-boat, and loaded ourselves once more. So we\nproceeded, without pausing to take breath, till the whole cargo was\nbestowed, when the two servants took up their position in the\nblockhouse, and I, with all my power, sculled back to the _Hispaniola_.\n\nThat we should have risked a second boat load seems more daring than it\nreally was. They had the advantage of numbers, of course, but we had the\nadvantage of arms. Not one of the men ashore had a musket, and before\nthey could get within range for pistol shooting, we flattered ourselves\nwe should be able to give a good account of a half dozen at least.\n\nThe squire was waiting for me at the stern window, all his faintness\ngone from him. He caught the painter and made it fast, and we fell to\nloading the boat for our very lives. Pork, powder, and biscuit was the\ncargo, with only a musket and a cutlass apiece for squire and me and\nRedruth and the captain. The rest of the arms and powder we dropped\noverboard in two fathoms and a half of water, so that we could see the\nbright steel shining far below us in the sun on the clean, sandy bottom.\n\nBy this time the tide was beginning to ebb, and the ship was swinging\nround to her anchor. Voices were heard faintly halloaing in the\ndirection of the two gigs; and though this reassured us for Joyce and\nHunter, who were well to the eastward, it warned our party to be off.\n\nRedruth retreated from his place in the gallery and dropped into the\nboat, which we then brought round to the ship's counter, to be handier\nfor Captain Smollett.\n\n\"Now, men,\" said he, \"do you hear me?\"\n\nThere was no answer from the forecastle.\n\n\"It's to you, Abraham Gray--it's to you I am speaking.\"\n\nStill no reply.\n\n\"Gray,\" resumed Mr. Smollett, a little louder, \"I am leaving this ship,\nand I order you to follow your captain. I know you are a good man at\nbottom, and I dare say not one of the lot of you's as bad as he makes\nout. I have my watch here in my hand; I give you thirty seconds to join\nme in.\"\n\nThere was a pause.\n\n\"Come, my fine fellow,\" continued the captain, \"don't hang so long in\nstays. I'm risking my life and the lives of these good gentlemen every\nsecond.\"\n\nThere was a sudden scuffle, a sound of blows, and out burst Abraham Gray\nwith a knife-cut on the side of the cheek, and came running to the\ncaptain, like a dog to the whistle.\n\n\"I'm with you, sir,\" said he.\n\nAnd the next moment he and the captain had dropped aboard of us, and we\nhad shoved off and given way.\n\nWe were clear out of the ship, but not yet ashore in our stockade.\n\n\n\n\nNARRATIVE CONTINUED BY THE DOCTOR--THE JOLLY-BOAT'S LAST TRIP\n\n\nThis fifth trip was quite different from any of the others. In the first\nplace, the little gallipot of a boat that we were in was gravely\noverloaded. Five grown men, and three of them--Trelawney, Redruth, and\nthe captain--over six feet high, was already more than she was meant to\ncarry. Add to that the powder, pork, and the bread-bags. The gunwale was\nlipping astern. Several times we shipped a little water, and my breeches\nand the tails of my coat were all soaking wet before we had gone a\nhundred yards.\n\nThe captain made us trim the boat, and we got her to lie a little more\nevenly. All the same, we were afraid to breathe.\n\nIn the second place, the ebb was now making--a strong, rippling current\nrunning westward through the basin, and then south'ard and seaward down\nthe straits by which we had entered in the morning. Even the ripples\nwere a danger to our overloaded craft, but the worst of it was that we\nwere swept out of our true course, and away from our proper\nlanding-place behind the point. If we let the current have its way we\nshould come ashore beside the gigs, where the pirates might appear at\nany moment.\n\n\"I cannot keep her head for the stockade, sir,\" said I to the captain. I\nwas steering, while he and Redruth, two fresh men, were at the oars.\n\"The tide keeps washing her down. Could you pull a little stronger?\"\n\n\"Not without swamping the boat,\" said he. \"You must bear up, sir, if you\nplease--bear up until you see you're gaining.\"\n\nI tried, and found by experiment that the tide kept sweeping us westward\nuntil I had laid her head due east, or just about right angles to the\nway we ought to go.\n\n\"We'll never get ashore at this rate,\" said I.\n\n\"If it's the only course that we can lie, sir, we must even lie it,\"\nreturned the captain. \"We must keep upstream. You see, sir,\" he went on,\n\"if once we dropped to leeward of the landing-place, it's hard to say\nwhere we should get ashore, besides the chance of being boarded by the\ngigs; whereas, the way we go the current must slacken, and then we can\ndodge back along the shore.\"\n\n\"The current's less a'ready, sir,\" said the man Gray, who was sitting in\nthe foresheets; \"you can ease her off a bit.\"\n\n\"Thank you, my man,\" said I, quite as if nothing had happened, for we\nhad all quietly made up our minds to treat him like one of ourselves.\n\nSuddenly the captain spoke up again, and I thought his voice was a\nlittle changed.\n\n\"The gun!\" said he.\n\n\"I have thought of that,\" said I, for I made sure he was thinking of a\nbombardment of the fort. \"They could never get the gun ashore, and if\nthey did, they could never haul it through the woods.\"\n\n\"Look astern, doctor,\" replied the captain.\n\nWe had entirely forgotten the long nine; and there, to our horror, were\nthe five rogues busy about her, getting off her jacket, as they called\nthe stout tarpaulin cover under which she sailed. Not only that, but it\nflashed into my mind at the same moment that the round shot and the\npowder for the gun had been left behind, and a stroke with an ax would\nput it all into the possession of the evil ones aboard.\n\n\"Israel was Flint's gunner,\" said Gray, hoarsely.\n\nAt any risk, we put the boat's head direct for the landing-place. By\nthis time we had got so far out of the run of the current that we kept\nsteerage way even at our necessarily gentle rate of rowing, and I could\nkeep her steady for the goal. But the worst of it was, that with the\ncourse I now held, we turned our broadside instead of our stern to the\n_Hispaniola_, and offered a target like a barn door.\n\nI could hear, as well as see, that brandy-faced rascal, Israel Hands,\nplumping down a round shot on the deck.\n\n\"Who's the best shot?\" asked the captain.\n\n\"Mr. Trelawney, out and away,\" said I.\n\n\"Mr. Trelawney, will you please pick me off one of those men, sir?\nHands, if possible,\" said the captain.\n\nTrelawney was as cold as steel. He looked to the priming of his gun.\n\n\"Now,\" cried the captain, \"easy with that gun, sir, or you'll swamp the\nboat. All hands stand by to trim her when he aims.\"\n\nThe squire raised his gun, the rowing ceased, and we leaned over to the\nother side to keep the balance, and all was so nicely contrived that we\ndid not ship a drop.\n\n[Illustration: _They had the gun, by this time, slewed around upon the\nswivel_ (Page 125)]\n\nThey had the gun, by this time, slewed around upon the swivel, and\nHands, who was at the muzzle, with the rammer, was, in consequence, the\nmost exposed. However, we had no luck; for just as Trelawney fired,\ndown he stooped, the ball whistling over him, and it was one of the\nother four who fell.\n\nThe cry he gave was echoed, not only by his companions on board, but by\na great number of voices from the shore, and looking in that direction I\nsaw the other pirates trooping out from among the trees and tumbling\ninto their places in the boats.\n\n\"Here come the gigs, sir,\" said I.\n\n\"Give way, then,\" said the captain. \"We mustn't mind if we swamp her\nnow. If we can't get ashore, all's up.\"\n\n\"Only one of the gigs is being manned, sir,\" I added; \"the crew of the\nother is most likely going around by shore to cut us off.\"\n\n\"They'll have a hot run, sir,\" returned the captain. \"Jack ashore, you\nknow. It's not them I mind; it's the round shot. Carpet bowls! My lady's\nmaid couldn't miss. Tell us, squire, when you see the match, and we'll\nhold water.\"\n\nIn the meantime we had been making headway at a good pace for a boat so\noverloaded, and we had shipped but little water in the process. We were\nnow close in; thirty or forty strokes and we should beach her, for the\nebb had already disclosed a narrow belt of sand below the clustering\ntrees. The gig was no longer to be feared; the little point had already\nconcealed it from our eyes. The ebb-tide, which had so cruelly delayed\nus, was now making reparation, and delaying our assailants. The one\nsource of danger was the gun.\n\n\"If I durst,\" said the captain, \"I'd stop and pick off another man.\"\n\nBut it was plain that they meant nothing should delay their shot. They\nhad never so much as looked at their fallen comrade, though he was not\ndead, and I could see him trying to crawl away.\n\n\"Ready!\" cried the squire.\n\n\"Hold!\" cried the captain, quick as an echo.\n\nAnd he and Redruth backed with a great heave that sent her astern bodily\nunder water. The report fell in at the same instant of time. This was\nthe first that Jim heard, the sound of the squire's shot not having\nreached him. When the ball passed, not one of us precisely knew, but I\nfancy it must have been over our heads, and that the wind of it may have\ncontributed to our disaster.\n\nAt any rate the boat sunk by the stern, quite gently, in three feet of\nwater, leaving the captain and myself, facing each other, on our feet.\nThe other three took complete headers, and came up again, drenched and\nbubbling.\n\nSo far there was no great harm. No lives were lost, and we could wade\nashore in safety. But there were all our stores at the bottom, and, to\nmake things worse, only two guns out of five remained in a state for\nservice. Mine I had snatched from my knees, and held over my head, by a\nsort of instinct. As for the captain, he had carried his over his\nshoulder by a bandoleer, and, like a wise man, lock uppermost. The other\nthree had gone down with the boat. To add to our concern, we heard\nvoices already drawing near us in the woods along the shore; and we had\nnot only the danger of being cut off from the stockade in our\nhalf-crippled state, but the fear before us whether, if Hunter and Joyce\nwere attacked by half a dozen, they would have the sense and conduct to\nstand firm. Hunter was steady, that we knew; Joyce was a doubtful\ncase--a pleasant, polite man for a valet, and to brush one's clothes,\nbut not entirely fitted for a man-of-war.\n\nWith all this in our minds, we waded ashore as fast as we could, leaving\nbehind us the poor jolly-boat, and a good half of all our powder and\nprovisions.\n\n\n\n\nNARRATIVE CONTINUED BY THE DOCTOR--END OF THE FIRST DAY'S FIGHTING\n\n\nWe made our best speed across the strip of wood that now divided us from\nthe stockade, and at every step we took the voices of the buccaneers\nrang nearer. Soon we could hear their footfalls as they ran, and the\ncracking of the branches as they breasted across a bit of thicket.\n\nI began to see we should have a brush for it in earnest, and looked to\nmy priming.\n\n\"Captain,\" said I, \"Trelawney is the dead shot. Give him your gun; his\nown is useless.\"\n\nThey exchanged guns, and Trelawney, silent and cool, as he had been\nsince the beginning of the bustle, hung a moment on his heel to see that\nall was fit for service. At the same time, observing Gray to be unarmed,\nI handed him my cutlass. It did all our hearts good to see him spit in\nhis hand, knit his brows, and make the blade sing through the air. It\nwas plain from every line of his body that our new hand was worth his\nsalt.\n\nForty paces farther we came to the edge of the wood and saw the stockade\nin front of us. We struck the inclosure about the middle of the south\nside, and, almost at the same time, seven mutineers--Job Anderson, the\nboatswain, at their head--appeared in full cry at the southwestern\ncorner.\n\nThey paused, as if taken aback, and before they recovered, not only the\nsquire and I, but Hunter and Joyce from the blockhouse, had time to\nfire.\n\nThe four shots came in rather a scattering volley, but they did the\nbusiness; one of the enemy actually fell, and the rest, without\nhesitation, turned and plunged into the trees.\n\nAfter reloading we walked down the outside of the palisade to see to the\nfallen enemy. He was stone dead--shot through the heart.\n\nWe began to rejoice over our good success, when just at that moment a\npistol cracked in the bush, a ball whistled close past my ear and poor\nTom Redruth stumbled and fell his length on the ground. Both the squire\nand I returned the shot, but as we had nothing to aim at, it is probable\nwe only wasted powder. Then we reloaded and turned our attention to poor\nTom.\n\nThe captain and Gray were already examining him, and I saw with half an\neye that all was over.\n\nI believe the readiness of our return volley had scattered the mutineers\nonce more, for we were suffered without further molestation to get the\npoor old gamekeeper hoisted over the stockade, and carried, groaning and\nbleeding, into the log-house.\n\nPoor old fellow, he had not uttered one word of surprise, complaint,\nfear, or even acquiescence, from the very beginning of our troubles till\nnow, when we had laid him down in the log-house to die! He had lain like\na Trojan behind his mattress in the gallery; he had followed every order\nsilently, doggedly, and well; he was the oldest of our party by a score\nof years; and now, sullen, old, serviceable servant, it was he that was\nto die.\n\nThe squire dropped down beside him on his knees and kissed his hand,\ncrying like a child.\n\n\"Be I going, doctor?\" he asked.\n\n\"Tom, my man,\" said I, \"you're going home.\"\n\n\"I wish I had had a lick at them with the gun first,\" he replied.\n\n\"Tom,\" said the squire, \"say you forgive me, won't you?\"\n\n\"Would that be respectful like, from me to you, squire?\" was the answer.\n\"Howsoever, so be it, amen!\"\n\nAfter a little while of silence he said he thought somebody might read a\nprayer. \"It's the custom, sir,\" he added, apologetically. And not long\nafter, without another word, he passed away.\n\nIn the meantime the captain, whom I had observed to be wonderfully\nswollen about the chest and pockets, had turned out a great many various\nstores--the British colors, a Bible, a coil of stoutish rope, pen, ink,\nthe log-book, and pounds of tobacco. He had found a longish fir tree\nlying felled and cleared in the inclosure, and, with the help of Hunter,\nhe had set it up at the corner of the log-house, where the trunks\ncrossed and made an angle. Then, climbing on the roof, he had with his\nown hand bent and run up the colors.\n\nThis seemed mightily to relieve him. He re-entered the log-house and set\nabout counting up the stores, as if nothing else existed. But he had an\neye on Tom's passage for all that, and as soon as all was over came\nforward with another flag and reverently spread it on the body.\n\n\"Don't you take on, sir,\" he said, shaking the squire's hand. \"All's\nwell with him; no fear for a hand that's been shot down in his duty to\ncaptain and owner. It mayn't be good divinity, but it's a fact.\"\n\nThen he pulled me aside.\n\n\"Doctor Livesey,\" he said, \"in how many weeks do you and squire expect\nthe consort?\"\n\nI told him it was a question, not of weeks, but of months; that if we\nwere not back by the end of August Blandly was to send to find us, but\nneither sooner nor later. \"You can calculate for yourself,\" I said.\n\n\"Why, yes,\" returned the captain, scratching his head, \"and making a\nlarge allowance, sir, for all the gifts of Providence, I should say we\nwere pretty close hauled.\"\n\n\"How do you mean?\" I asked.\n\n\"It's a pity, sir, we lost that second load. That's what I mean,\"\nreplied the captain. \"As for powder and shot, we'll do. But the rations\nare short, very short--so short, Doctor Livesey, that we're perhaps as\nwell without that extra mouth.\"\n\nAnd he pointed to the dead body under the flag.\n\nJust then, with a roar and a whistle, a round shot passed high above the\nroof of the log-house and plumped far beyond us in the wood.\n\n\"Oho!\" said the captain. \"Blaze away! You've little enough powder\nalready, my lads.\"\n\nAt the second trial the aim was better and the ball descended inside the\nstockade, scattering a cloud of sand, but doing no further damage.\n\n\"Captain,\" said the squire, \"the house is quite invisible from the ship.\nIt must be the flag they are aiming at. Would it not be wiser to take it\nin?\"\n\n\"Strike my colors!\" cried the captain. \"No, sir, not I,\" and as soon as\nhe had said the words I think we all agreed with him. For it was not\nonly a piece of stout, seamanly good feeling; it was good policy\nbesides, and showed our enemies that we despised their cannonade.\n\nAll through the evening they kept thundering away. Ball after ball flew\nover or fell short, or kicked up the sand in the inclosure; but they had\nto fire so high that the shot fell dead and buried itself in the soft\nsand. We had no ricochet to fear; and though one popped in through the\nroof of the log-house and out again through the floor, we soon got used\nto that sort of horse-play and minded it no more than cricket.\n\n\"There is one thing good about all this,\" observed the captain; \"the\nwood in front of us is likely clear. The ebb has made a good while; our\nstores should be uncovered. Volunteers to go and bring in pork.\"\n\nGray and Hunter were the first to come forward. Well armed, they stole\nout of the stockade, but it proved a useless mission. The mutineers were\nbolder than we fancied, or they put more trust in Israel's gunnery, for\nfour or five of them were busy carrying off our stores and wading out\nwith them to one of the gigs that lay close by, pulling an oar or so to\nhold her steady against the current. Silver was in the stern-sheets in\ncommand, and every man of them was now provided with a musket from some\nsecret magazine of their own.\n\nThe captain sat down to his log, and here is the beginning of the entry:\n\n    \"Alexander Smollett, master; David Livesey, ship's doctor; Abraham\n    Gray, carpenter's mate; John Trelawney, owner; John Hunter and\n    Richard Joyce, owner's servants, landsmen--being all that is left\n    faithful of the ship's company--with stores for ten days at short\n    rations, came ashore this day and flew British colors on the\n    log-house in Treasure Island. Thomas Redruth, owner's servant,\n    landsman, shot by the mutineers; James Hawkins, cabin-boy--\"\n\nAnd at the same time I was wondering over poor Jim Hawkins' fate.\n\nA hail on the land side.\n\n\"Somebody hailing us,\" said Hunter, who was on guard.\n\n\"Doctor! squire! captain! Hallo, Hunter, is that you?\" came the cries.\n\nAnd I ran to the door in time to see Jim Hawkins, safe and sound, come\nclimbing over the stockade.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nNARRATIVE RESUMED BY JIM HAWKINS--THE GARRISON IN THE STOCKADE\n\n\nAs soon as Ben Gunn saw the colors he came to a halt, stopped me by the\narm and sat down.\n\n\"Now,\" said he, \"there's your friends, sure enough.\"\n\n\"Far more likely it's the mutineers,\" I answered.\n\n\"That!\" he cried. \"Why, in a place like this, where nobody puts in but\ngen'lemen of fortune, Silver would fly the Jolly Roger, you don't make\nno doubt of that. No, that's your friends. There's been blows, too, and\nI reckon your friends has had the best of it; and here they are ashore\nin the old stockade, as was made years and years ago by Flint. Ah, he\nwas the man to have a headpiece, was Flint! Barring rum, his match was\nnever seen. He were afraid of none, not he; on'y Silver--Silver was that\ngenteel.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said I, \"that may be so, and so be it; all the more reason that\nI should hurry on and join my friends.\"\n\n\"Nay, mate,\" returned Ben, \"not you. You're a good boy, or I'm mistook;\nbut you're on'y a boy, all told. Now Ben Gunn is fly. Rum wouldn't bring\nme there, where you're going--not rum wouldn't, till I see your born\ngen'leman, and gets it on his word of honor. And you won't forget my\nwords: 'A precious sight' (that's what you'll say), 'a precious sight\nmore confidence'--and then nips him.\"\n\nAnd he pinched me the third time with the same air of cleverness.\n\n\"And when Ben Gunn is wanted you know where to find him, Jim. Just where\nyou found him to-day. And him that comes is to have a white thing in his\nhand; and he's to come alone. Oh! and you'll say this: 'Ben Gunn,' says\nyou, 'has reasons of his own.'\"\n\n\"Well,\" said I, \"I believe I understand. You have something to propose,\nand you wish to see the squire or the doctor, and you're to be found\nwhere I found you. Is that all?\"\n\n\"And when? says you,\" he added. \"Why, from about noon observation to\nabout six bells.\"\n\n\"Good,\" says I, \"and now may I go?\"\n\n\"You won't forget?\" he inquired, anxiously. \"Precious sight, and reasons\nof his own, says you. Reasons of his own; that's the mainstay; as\nbetween man and man. Well, then\"--still holding me--\"I reckon you can\ngo, Jim. And, Jim, if you was to see Silver, you wouldn't go for to sell\nBen Gunn? wild horses wouldn't draw it from you? No, says you. And if\nthem pirates came ashore, Jim, what would you say but there'd be widders\nin the morning?\"\n\nHere he was interrupted by a loud report, and a cannon ball came tearing\nthrough the trees and pitched in the sand, not a hundred yards from\nwhere we two were talking. The next moment each of us had taken to our\nheels in a different direction.\n\nFor a good hour to come frequent reports shook the island, and balls\nkept crashing through the woods. I moved from hiding-place to\nhiding-place, always pursued, or so it seemed to me, by these terrifying\nmissiles. But toward the end of the bombardment, though still I durst\nnot venture in the direction of the stockade, where the balls fell\noftenest, I had begun, in a manner, to pluck up my heart again; and\nafter a long detour to the east, crept down among the shore-side trees.\n\nThe sun had just set, the sea breeze was rustling and tumbling in the\nwoods, and ruffling the gray surface of the anchorage; the tide, too,\nwas far out, and great tracts of sand lay uncovered; the air, after the\nheat of the day, chilled me through my jacket.\n\nThe _Hispaniola_ still lay where she had anchored; but, sure enough,\nthere was the Jolly Roger--the black flag of piracy--flying from her\npeak. Even as I looked there came another red flash and another report,\nthat sent the echoes clattering, and one more round shot whistled\nthrough the air. It was the last of the cannonade.\n\nI lay for some time, watching the bustle which succeeded the attack. Men\nwere demolishing something with axes on the beach near the stockade--the\npoor jolly-boat, I afterwards discovered. Away, near the mouth of the\nriver, a great fire was glowing among the trees, and between that point\nand the ship one of the gigs kept coming and going, the men, whom I had\nseen so gloomy, shouting at the oars like children. But there was a\nsound in their voices which suggested rum.\n\nAt length I thought I might return towards the stockade. I was pretty\nfar down on the low, sandy spit that incloses the anchorage to the east,\nand is joined at half-water to Skeleton Island; and now, as I rose to my\nfeet, I saw, some distance farther down the spit, and rising from among\nlow bushes, an isolated rock, pretty high, and peculiarly white in\ncolor. It occurred to me that this might be the white rock of which Ben\nGunn had spoken, and that some day or other a boat might be wanted, and\nI should know where to look for one.\n\nThen I skirted among the woods until I had regained the rear, or\nshoreward side, of the stockade, and was soon warmly welcomed by the\nfaithful party.\n\nI had soon told my story, and began to look about me. The log-house was\nmade of unsquared trunks of pine--roof, walls, and floor. The latter\nstood in several places as much as a foot or a foot and a half above the\nsurface of the sand. There was a porch at the door, and under this porch\nthe little spring welled up into an artificial basin of a rather odd\nkind--no other than a great ship's kettle of iron, with the bottom\nknocked out, and sunk \"to her bearings,\" as the captain said, among the\nsand.\n\nLittle had been left beside the framework of the house, but in one\ncorner there was a stone slab laid down by way of hearth, and an old\nrusty iron basket to contain the fire.\n\nThe slopes of the knoll and all the inside of the stockade had been\ncleared of timber to build the house, and we could see by the stumps\nwhat a fine and lofty grove had been destroyed. Most of the soil had\nbeen washed away or buried in drift after the removal of the trees; only\nwhere the streamlet ran down from the kettle a thick bed of moss and\nsome ferns and little creeping bushes were still green among the sand.\nVery close around the stockade--too close for defense, they said--the\nwood still flourished high and dense, all of fir on the land side, but\ntoward the sea with a large admixture of live-oaks.\n\nThe cold evening breeze, of which I have spoken, whistled through every\nchink of the rude building, and sprinkled the floor with a continual\nrain of fine sand. There was sand in our eyes, sand in our teeth, sand\nin our suppers, sand dancing in the spring at the bottom of the kettle,\nfor all the world like porridge beginning to boil. Our chimney was a\nsquare hole in the roof; it was but a little part of the smoke that\nfound its way out, and the rest eddied about the house, and kept us\ncoughing and piping the eye.\n\nAdd to this that Gray, the new man, had his face tied up in a bandage\nfor a cut he had got in breaking away from the mutineers; and that poor\nold Tom Redruth, still unburied, lay along the wall, stiff and stark,\nunder the Union Jack.\n\nIf we had been allowed to sit idle, we should all have fallen in the\nblues, but Captain Smollett was never the man for that. All hands were\ncalled up before him, and he divided us into watches. The doctor, and\nGray, and I, for one; the squire, Hunter, and Joyce upon the other.\nTired as we all were, two were sent out for firewood, two more were sent\nto dig a grave for Redruth, the doctor was named cook, I was put sentry\nat the door, and the captain himself went from one to another, keeping\nup our spirits and lending a hand wherever it was wanted.\n\nFrom time to time the doctor came to the door for a little air and to\nrest his eyes, which were almost smoked out of his head, and whenever he\ndid so, he had a word for me.\n\n\"That man Smollett,\" he said once, \"is a better man than I am. And when\nI say that it means a deal, Jim.\"\n\nAnother time he came and was silent for a while. Then he put his head on\none side, and looked at me.\n\n\"Is this Ben Gunn a man?\" he asked.\n\n\"I do not know, sir,\" said I. \"I am not very sure whether he's sane.\"\n\n\"If there's any doubt about the matter, he is,\" returned the doctor. \"A\nman who has been three years biting his nails on a desert island, Jim,\ncan't expect to appear as sane as you or me. It doesn't lie in human\nnature. Was it cheese you said he had a fancy for?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, cheese,\" I answered.\n\n\"Well, Jim,\" says he, \"just see the good that comes of being dainty in\nyour food. You've seen my snuff-box, haven't you? And you never saw me\ntake snuff; the reason being that in my snuff-box I carry a piece of\nParmesan cheese--a cheese made in Italy, very nutritious. Well, that's\nfor Ben Gunn!\"\n\nBefore supper was eaten we buried old Tom in the sand, and stood round\nhim for a while bare-headed in the breeze. A good deal of firewood had\nbeen got in, but not enough for the captain's fancy, and he shook his\nhead over it, and told us we \"must get back to this to-morrow rather\nlivelier.\" Then, when we had eaten our pork, and each had a good stiff\nglass of brandy grog, the three chiefs got together in a corner to\ndiscuss our prospects.\n\nIt appears they were at their wits' end what to do, the stores being so\nlow that we must have been starved into surrender long before help came.\nBut our best hope, it was decided, was to kill off the buccaneers until\nthey either hauled down their flag or ran away with the _Hispaniola_.\nFrom nineteen they were already reduced to fifteen, two others were\nwounded, and one, at least--the man shot beside the gun--severely\nwounded, if he were not dead. Every time we had a crack at them, we were\nto take it, saving our own lives, with the extremest care. And, beside\nthat, we had two able allies--rum and the climate.\n\nAs for the first, though we were about half a mile away, we could hear\nthem roaring and singing late into the night; and as for the second, the\ndoctor staked his wig, that camped where they were in the marsh, and\nunprovided with remedies, the half of them would be on their backs\nbefore a week.\n\n\"So,\" he added, \"if we are not all shot down first, they'll be glad to\nbe packing in the schooner. It's always a ship, and they can get to\nbuccaneering again, I suppose.\"\n\n\"First ship that I ever lost,\" said Captain Smollett.\n\nI was dead tired, as you may fancy, and when I got to sleep, which was\nnot till after a great deal of tossing, I slept like a log of wood.\n\nThe rest had long been up, and had already breakfasted and increased the\npile of firewood by about half as much again, when I was awakened by a\nbustle and the sound of voices.\n\n\"Flag of truce!\" I heard someone say, and then, immediately after, with\na cry of surprise, \"Silver himself!\"\n\nAnd, at that, up I jumped, and, rubbing my eyes, ran to a loophole in\nthe wall.\n\n\n\n\nSILVER'S EMBASSY\n\n\nSure enough, there were two men just outside the stockade, one of them\nwaving a white cloth; the other, no less a person than Silver himself,\nstanding placidly by.\n\nIt was still quite early, and the coldest morning that I think I ever\nwas abroad in; a chill that pierced into the marrow. The sky was bright\nand cloudless overhead, and the tops of the trees shone rosily in the\nsun. But where Silver stood with his lieutenant all was still in shadow,\nand they waded knee-deep in a low, white vapor that had crawled during\nthe night out of the morass. The chill and the vapor taken together told\na poor tale of the island. It was plainly a damp, feverish, unhealthy\nspot.\n\n\"Keep indoors, men,\" said the captain. \"Ten to one this is a trick.\"\n\nThen he hailed the buccaneer.\n\n\"Who goes? Stand, or we fire.\"\n\n\"Flag of truce!\" cried Silver.\n\nThe captain was in the porch, keeping himself carefully out of the way\nof a treacherous shot, should any be intended. He turned and spoke to\nus.\n\n\"Doctor's watch on the lookout. Doctor Livesey, take the north side, if\nyou please; Jim the east; Gray, west. The watch below, all hands to load\nmuskets. Lively, men, and careful.\"\n\nAnd then he turned again to the mutineers.\n\n\"And what do you want with your flag of truce?\" he cried.\n\nThis time it was the other man who replied.\n\n\"Cap'n Silver, sir, to come on board and make terms,\" he shouted.\n\n\"Cap'n Silver! Don't know him. Who's he?\" cried the captain. And we\ncould hear him adding to himself: \"Cap'n, is it? My heart, and here's\npromotion!\"\n\nLong John answered for himself.\n\n\"Me, sir. These poor lads have chosen me cap'n, after your desertion,\nsir\"--laying a particular emphasis upon the word \"desertion.\" \"We're\nwilling to submit, if we can come to terms, and no bones about it. All I\nask is your word, Cap'n Smollett, to let me safe and sound out of this\nhere stockade, and one minute to get out o' shot before a gun is fired.\"\n\n\"My man,\" said Captain Smollett, \"I have not the slightest desire to\ntalk to you. If you wish to talk to me, you can come, that's all. If\nthere's any treachery, it'll be on your side, and the Lord help you.\"\n\n\"That's enough, cap'n,\" shouted Long John cheerily. \"A word from you's\nenough. I know a gentleman, and you may lay to that.\"\n\nWe could see the man who carried the flag of truce attempting to hold\nSilver back. Nor was that wonderful, seeing how cavalier had been the\ncaptain's answer. But Silver laughed at him aloud, and slapped him on\nthe back, as if the idea of alarm had been absurd. Then he advanced to\nthe stockade, threw over his crutch, got a leg up, and with great vigor\nand skill succeeded in surmounting the fence and dropping safely to the\nother side.\n\nI will confess that I was far too much taken up with what was going on\nto be of the slightest use as sentry; indeed, I had already deserted my\neastern loophole and crept up behind the captain, who had now seated\nhimself on the threshold, with his elbows on his knees, his head in his\nhands, and his eyes fixed on the water as it bubbled out of the old iron\nkettle in the sand. He was whistling to himself, \"Come, Lasses and\nLads.\"\n\nSilver had terrible hard work getting up the knoll. What with the\nsteepness of the incline, the thick tree-stumps, and the soft sand, he\nand his crutch were as helpless as a ship in stays. But he stuck to it\nlike a man, in silence, and at last arrived before the captain, whom he\nsaluted in the handsomest style. He was tricked out in his best; an\nimmense blue coat, thick with brass buttons, hung as low as to his\nknees, and a fine laced hat was set on the back of his head.\n\n\"Here you are, my man,\" said the captain, raising his head. \"You had\nbetter sit down.\"\n\n\"You ain't a-going to let me inside, cap'n?\" complained Long John. \"It's\na main cold morning, to be sure, sir, to sit outside upon the sand.\"\n\n\"Why, Silver,\" said the captain, \"if you had pleased to be an honest man\nyou might have been sitting in your galley. It's your own doing. You're\neither my ship's cook--and then you were treated handsome--or Cap'n\nSilver, a common mutineer and pirate, and then you can go hang!\"\n\n\"Well, well, cap'n,\" returned the sea-cook, sitting down as he was\nbidden on the sand, \"you'll have to give me a hand up again, that's all.\nA sweet, pretty place you have of it here. Ah, there's Jim! The top of\nthe morning to you, Jim. Doctor, here's my service. Why, there you all\nare together like a happy family, in a manner of speaking.\"\n\n\"If you have anything to say, my man, better say it,\" said the captain.\n\n\"Right you are, Cap'n Smollett,\" replied Silver. \"Dooty is dooty, to be\nsure. Well, now, you look here, that was a good lay of yours last night.\nI don't deny it was a good lay. Some of you pretty handy with a\nhandspike-end. And I'll not deny neither but what some of my people was\nshook--maybe all was shook; maybe I was shook myself; maybe that's why\nI'm here for terms. But you mark me, cap'n, it won't do twice, by\nthunder! We'll have to do sentry-go, and ease off a point or so on the\nrum. Maybe you think we were all a sheet in the wind's eye. But I'll\ntell you I was sober; I was on'y dog tired; and if I'd awoke a second\nsooner I'd 'a' caught you at the act, I would. He wasn't dead when I got\nround to him, not he.\"\n\n\"Well?\" says Captain Smollett, as cool as can be.\n\nAll that Silver said was a riddle to him, but you would never have\nguessed it from his tone. As for me, I began to have an inkling. Ben\nGunn's last words came back to my mind. I began to suppose that he had\npaid the buccaneers a visit while they all lay drunk together round\ntheir fire, and I reckoned up with glee that we had only fourteen\nenemies to deal with.\n\n\"Well, here it is,\" said Silver. \"We want that treasure, and we'll have\nit--that's our point! You would just as soon save your lives, I reckon;\nand that's yours. You have a chart, haven't you?\"\n\n\"That's as may be,\" replied the captain.\n\n\"Oh, well, you have, I know that,\" returned Long John. \"You needn't be\nso husky with a man; there ain't a particle of service in that, and you\nmay lay to it. What I mean is, we want your chart. Now, I never meant\nyou no harm, myself.\"\n\n\"That won't do with me, my man,\" interrupted the captain. \"We know\nexactly what you meant to do, and we don't care; for now, you see, you\ncan't do it.\"\n\nAnd the captain looked at him calmly, and proceeded to fill a pipe.\n\n\"If Abe Gray--\" Silver broke out.\n\n\"Avast there!\" cried Mr. Smollett. \"Gray told me nothing, and I asked\nhim nothing; and what's more, I would see you and him and this whole\nisland blown clean out of the water into blazes first. So there's my\nmind for you, my man, on that.\"\n\nThis little whiff of temper seemed to cool Silver down. He had been\ngrowing nettled before, but now he pulled himself together.\n\n\"Like enough,\" said he. \"I would set no limits to what gentlemen might\nconsider shipshape, or might not, as the case were. And, seein' as how\nyou are about to take a pipe, cap'n, I'll make so free as do likewise.\"\n\nAnd he filled a pipe and lighted it; and the two men sat silently\nsmoking for quite a while, now looking each other in the face, now\nstopping their tobacco, now leaning forward to spit. It was as good as\nthe play to see them.\n\n\"Now,\" resumed Silver, \"here it is. You give us the chart to get the\ntreasure by, and drop shooting poor seamen, and stoving of their heads\nin while asleep. You do that and we'll offer you a choice. Either you\ncome aboard along of us, once the treasure shipped, and then I'll give\nyou my affy-davy, upon my word of honor, to clap you somewhere safe\nashore. Or, if that ain't to your fancy, some of my hands being rough,\nand having old scores, on account of hazing, then you can stay here, you\ncan. We'll divide stores with you, man for man; and I'll give my\naffy-davy, as before, to speak the first ship I sight, and send 'em here\nto pick you up. Now you'll own that's talking. Handsomer you couldn't\nlook to get, not you. And I hope\"--raising his voice--\"that all hands in\nthis here blockhouse will overhaul my words, for what is spoke to one is\nspoke to all.\"\n\nCaptain Smollett rose from his seat and knocked out the ashes of his\npipe in the palm of his left hand.\n\n\"Is that all?\" he asked.\n\n\"Every last word, by thunder!\" answered John. \"Refuse that and you've\nseen the last of me but musket-balls.\"\n\n\"Very good,\" said the captain. \"Now you'll hear me. If you'll come up\none by one, unarmed, I'll engage to clap you all in irons, and to take\nyou home to a fair trial in England. If you won't, my name is Alexander\nSmollett, I've flown my sovereign's colors, and I'll see you all to Davy\nJones. You can't find the treasure. You can't sail the ship--there's not\na man among you fit to sail the ship. You can't fight us--Gray, there,\ngot away from five of you. Your ship's in irons, Master Silver; you're\non a lee shore, and so you'll find. I stand here and tell you so, and\nthey're the last good words you'll get from me; for, in the name of\nheaven, I'll put a bullet in your back when next I meet you. Tramp, my\nlad. Bundle out of this, please, hand over hand, and double quick.\"\n\nSilver's face was a picture; his eyes started in his head with wrath. He\nshook the fire out of his pipe.\n\n\"Give me a hand up!\" he cried.\n\n\"Not I,\" returned the captain.\n\n\"Who'll give me a hand up?\" he roared.\n\nNot a man among us moved. Growling the foulest imprecations, he crawled\nalong the sand till he got hold of the porch and could hoist himself\nagain upon his crutch. Then he spat into the spring.\n\n\"There!\" he cried, \"that's what I think of ye. Before an hour's out,\nI'll stove in your old blockhouse like a rum puncheon. Laugh, by\nthunder, laugh! Before an hour's out, ye'll laugh upon the other side.\nThem that die'll be the lucky ones.\"\n\nAnd with a dreadful oath he stumbled off, plowed down the sand, was\nhelped across the stockade, after four or five failures, by the man with\nthe flag of truce, and disappeared in an instant afterward among the\ntrees.\n\n\n\n\nTHE ATTACK\n\n\nAs soon as Silver disappeared, the captain, who had been closely\nwatching him, turned toward the interior of the house, and found not a\nman of us at his post but Gray. It was the first time we had ever seen\nhim angry.\n\n\"Quarters!\" he roared. And then, as we slunk back to our places, \"Gray,\"\nhe said, \"I'll put your name in the log; you've stood by your duty like\na seaman. Mr. Trelawney, I'm surprised at you, sir. Doctor, I thought\nyou had worn the king's coat! If that was how you served at Fontenoy,\nsir, you'd have been better in your berth.\"\n\nThe doctor's watch were all back at their loopholes, the rest were busy\nloading the spare muskets, and everyone with a red face, you may be\ncertain, and a flea in his ear, as the saying is.\n\nThe captain looked on for a while in silence. Then he spoke.\n\n\"My lads,\" he said, \"I've given Silver a broadside. I pitched it in\nred-hot on purpose; and before the hour's out, as he said, we shall be\nboarded. We're outnumbered, I needn't tell you that, but we fight in\nshelter; and, a minute ago, I should have said we fought with\ndiscipline. I've no manner of doubt that we can drub them, if you\nchoose.\"\n\nThen he went the rounds, and saw, as he said, that all was clear.\n\nOn the two short sides of the house, east and west, there were only two\nloopholes; on the south side where the porch was, two again; and on the\nnorth side, five. There was a round score of muskets for the seven of\nus; the firewood had been built into four piles--tables, you might\nsay--one about the middle of each side, and on each of these tables some\nammunition and four loaded muskets were laid ready to the hand of the\ndefenders. In the middle, the cutlasses lay ranged.\n\n\"Toss out the fire,\" said the captain; \"the chill is past, and we\nmustn't have smoke in our eyes.\"\n\nThe iron fire basket was carried bodily out by Mr. Trelawney, and the\nembers smothered among sand.\n\n\"Hawkins hasn't had his breakfast. Hawkins, help yourself, and back to\nyour post to eat it,\" continued Captain Smollett. \"Lively, now, my lad;\nyou'll want it before you've done. Hunter, serve out a round of brandy\nto all hands.\"\n\nAnd while this was going on the captain completed, in his own mind, the\nplan of the defense.\n\n\"Doctor, you will take the door,\" he resumed. \"See and don't expose\nyourself; keep within, and fire through the porch. Hunter, take the east\nside, there. Joyce, you stand by the west, my man. Mr. Trelawney, you\nare the best shot--you and Gray will take this long north side, with the\nfive loopholes; it's there the danger is. If they can get up to it, and\nfire in upon us through our own ports, things would begin to look dirty.\nHawkins, neither you nor I are much account at the shooting; we'll stand\nby to load and bear a hand.\"\n\nAs the captain had said, the chill was past. As soon as the sun had\nclimbed above our girdle of trees, it fell with all its force upon the\nclearing, and drank up the vapors at a draught. Soon the sand was\nbaking, and the resin melting in the logs of the blockhouse. Jackets and\ncoats were flung aside; shirts were thrown open at the neck, and rolled\nup to the shoulders; and we stood there, each at his post, in a fever of\nheat and anxiety.\n\nAn hour passed away.\n\n\"Hang them!\" said the captain. \"This is as dull as the doldrums. Gray,\nwhistle for a wind.\"\n\nAnd just at that moment came the first news of the attack.\n\n\"If you please, sir,\" said Joyce, \"if I see anyone, am I to fire?\"\n\n\"I told you so!\" cried the captain.\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" returned Joyce, with the same quiet civility.\n\nNothing followed for a time, but the remark had set us all on the alert,\nstraining ears and eyes--the musketeers with their pieces balanced in\ntheir hands, the captain out in the middle of the blockhouse, with his\nmouth very tight and a frown on his face.\n\nSo some seconds passed, till suddenly Joyce whipped up his musket and\nfired. The report had scarcely died away ere it was repeated and\nrepeated from without in a scattering volley, shot behind shot, like a\nstring of geese, from every side of the inclosure. Several bullets\nstruck the log-house, but not one entered; and, as the smoke cleared\naway and vanished, the stockade and the woods around it looked as quiet\nand empty as before. Not a bough waved, not the gleam of a musket-barrel\nbetrayed the presence of our foes.\n\n\"Did you hit your man?\" asked the captain.\n\n\"No, sir,\" replied Joyce. \"I believe not, sir.\"\n\n\"Next best thing to tell the truth,\" muttered Captain Smollett. \"Load\nhis gun, Hawkins. How many should you say there were on your side,\ndoctor?\"\n\n\"I know precisely,\" said Doctor Livesey. \"Three shots were fired on this\nside. I saw the three flashes--two close together--one farther to the\nwest.\"\n\n\"Three!\" repeated the captain. \"And how many on yours, Mr. Trelawney?\"\n\nBut this was not so easily answered. There had come many from the\nnorth--seven, by the squire's computation; eight or nine, according to\nGray. From the east and west only a single shot had been fired. It was\nplain, therefore, that the attack would be developed from the north, and\nthat on the other three sides we were only to be annoyed by a show of\nhostilities. But Captain Smollett made no change in his arrangements. If\nthe mutineers succeeded in crossing the stockade, he argued, they would\ntake possession of any unprotected loophole, and shoot us down like rats\nin our own stronghold.\n\nNor had we much time left to us for thought. Suddenly, with a loud\nhuzza, a little cloud of pirates leaped from the woods on the north\nside, and ran straight on the stockade. At the same moment, the fire was\nonce more opened from the woods, and a rifle-ball sang through the\ndoorway, and knocked the doctor's musket into bits.\n\nThe boarders swarmed over the fence, like monkeys. Squire and Gray fired\nagain and yet again; three men fell, one forward into the inclosure, two\nback on the outside. But of these, one was evidently more frightened\nthan hurt, for he was on his feet again in a crack, and instantly\ndisappeared among the trees.\n\nTwo had bit the dust, one had fled, four had made good their footing\ninside our defenses; while from the shelter of the woods seven or eight\nmen, each evidently supplied with several muskets, kept up a hot though\nuseless fire on the log-house.\n\n[Illustration: _In a moment the four pirates had swarmed up the mound\nand were upon us_ (Page 153)]\n\nThe four who had boarded made straight before them for the building,\nshouting as they ran, and the men among the trees shouted back to\nencourage them. Several shots were fired, but such was the hurry of the\nmarksmen, that not one appeared to have taken effect. In a moment the\nfour pirates had swarmed up the mound and were upon us.\n\nThe head of Job Anderson, the boatswain, appeared at the middle\nloophole.\n\n\"At 'em, all hands--all hands!\" he roared, in a voice of thunder.\n\nAt the same moment another pirate grasped Hunter's musket by the muzzle,\nwrenched it from his hands, plucked it through the loophole, and, with\none stunning blow, laid the poor fellow senseless on the floor.\nMeanwhile a third, running unharmed all round the house, appeared\nsuddenly in the doorway, and fell with his cutlass on the doctor.\n\nOur position was utterly reversed. A moment since we were firing, under\ncover, at an exposed enemy; now it was we who lay uncovered, and could\nnot return a blow.\n\nThe log-house was full of smoke, to which we owed our comparative\nsafety.\n\n### Summary:"}
{"original_length": 16445, "trunc_length": 16384, "text": "\n\nSummarize the following text into a summary of less than 800 words.\n### Text:\n\n\n\n\nWhether I shall turn out to be the hero of my own life, or whether that\nstation will be held by anybody else, these pages must show. To begin my\nlife with the beginning of my life, I record that I was born (as I have\nbeen informed and believe) on a Friday, at twelve o'clock at night.\nIt was remarked that the clock began to strike, and I began to cry,\nsimultaneously.\n\nIn consideration of the day and hour of my birth, it was declared by\nthe nurse, and by some sage women in the neighbourhood who had taken a\nlively interest in me several months before there was any possibility\nof our becoming personally acquainted, first, that I was destined to be\nunlucky in life; and secondly, that I was privileged to see ghosts and\nspirits; both these gifts inevitably attaching, as they believed, to\nall unlucky infants of either gender, born towards the small hours on a\nFriday night.\n\nI need say nothing here, on the first head, because nothing can show\nbetter than my history whether that prediction was verified or falsified\nby the result. On the second branch of the question, I will only remark,\nthat unless I ran through that part of my inheritance while I was still\na baby, I have not come into it yet. But I do not at all complain of\nhaving been kept out of this property; and if anybody else should be in\nthe present enjoyment of it, he is heartily welcome to keep it.\n\nI was born with a caul, which was advertised for sale, in the\nnewspapers, at the low price of fifteen guineas. Whether sea-going\npeople were short of money about that time, or were short of faith and\npreferred cork jackets, I don't know; all I know is, that there was but\none solitary bidding, and that was from an attorney connected with the\nbill-broking business, who offered two pounds in cash, and the balance\nin sherry, but declined to be guaranteed from drowning on any higher\nbargain. Consequently the advertisement was withdrawn at a dead\nloss--for as to sherry, my poor dear mother's own sherry was in the\nmarket then--and ten years afterwards, the caul was put up in a raffle\ndown in our part of the country, to fifty members at half-a-crown a\nhead, the winner to spend five shillings. I was present myself, and I\nremember to have felt quite uncomfortable and confused, at a part of\nmyself being disposed of in that way. The caul was won, I recollect, by\nan old lady with a hand-basket, who, very reluctantly, produced from it\nthe stipulated five shillings, all in halfpence, and twopence halfpenny\nshort--as it took an immense time and a great waste of arithmetic, to\nendeavour without any effect to prove to her. It is a fact which will\nbe long remembered as remarkable down there, that she was never drowned,\nbut died triumphantly in bed, at ninety-two. I have understood that it\nwas, to the last, her proudest boast, that she never had been on the\nwater in her life, except upon a bridge; and that over her tea (to which\nshe was extremely partial) she, to the last, expressed her indignation\nat the impiety of mariners and others, who had the presumption to go\n'meandering' about the world. It was in vain to represent to her\nthat some conveniences, tea perhaps included, resulted from this\nobjectionable practice. She always returned, with greater emphasis and\nwith an instinctive knowledge of the strength of her objection, 'Let us\nhave no meandering.'\n\nNot to meander myself, at present, I will go back to my birth.\n\nI was born at Blunderstone, in Suffolk, or 'there by', as they say in\nScotland. I was a posthumous child. My father's eyes had closed upon\nthe light of this world six months, when mine opened on it. There is\nsomething strange to me, even now, in the reflection that he never saw\nme; and something stranger yet in the shadowy remembrance that I have\nof my first childish associations with his white grave-stone in the\nchurchyard, and of the indefinable compassion I used to feel for it\nlying out alone there in the dark night, when our little parlour\nwas warm and bright with fire and candle, and the doors of our house\nwere--almost cruelly, it seemed to me sometimes--bolted and locked\nagainst it.\n\nAn aunt of my father's, and consequently a great-aunt of mine, of whom\nI shall have more to relate by and by, was the principal magnate of our\nfamily. Miss Trotwood, or Miss Betsey, as my poor mother always called\nher, when she sufficiently overcame her dread of this formidable\npersonage to mention her at all (which was seldom), had been married\nto a husband younger than herself, who was very handsome, except in the\nsense of the homely adage, 'handsome is, that handsome does'--for he\nwas strongly suspected of having beaten Miss Betsey, and even of having\nonce, on a disputed question of supplies, made some hasty but determined\narrangements to throw her out of a two pair of stairs' window. These\nevidences of an incompatibility of temper induced Miss Betsey to pay him\noff, and effect a separation by mutual consent. He went to India with\nhis capital, and there, according to a wild legend in our family, he was\nonce seen riding on an elephant, in company with a Baboon; but I think\nit must have been a Baboo--or a Begum. Anyhow, from India tidings of his\ndeath reached home, within ten years. How they affected my aunt, nobody\nknew; for immediately upon the separation, she took her maiden name\nagain, bought a cottage in a hamlet on the sea-coast a long way off,\nestablished herself there as a single woman with one servant, and\nwas understood to live secluded, ever afterwards, in an inflexible\nretirement.\n\nMy father had once been a favourite of hers, I believe; but she was\nmortally affronted by his marriage, on the ground that my mother was 'a\nwax doll'. She had never seen my mother, but she knew her to be not\nyet twenty. My father and Miss Betsey never met again. He was double\nmy mother's age when he married, and of but a delicate constitution. He\ndied a year afterwards, and, as I have said, six months before I came\ninto the world.\n\nThis was the state of matters, on the afternoon of, what I may be\nexcused for calling, that eventful and important Friday. I can make no\nclaim therefore to have known, at that time, how matters stood; or to\nhave any remembrance, founded on the evidence of my own senses, of what\nfollows.\n\nMy mother was sitting by the fire, but poorly in health, and very low in\nspirits, looking at it through her tears, and desponding heavily about\nherself and the fatherless little stranger, who was already welcomed by\nsome grosses of prophetic pins, in a drawer upstairs, to a world not at\nall excited on the subject of his arrival; my mother, I say, was sitting\nby the fire, that bright, windy March afternoon, very timid and sad, and\nvery doubtful of ever coming alive out of the trial that was before her,\nwhen, lifting her eyes as she dried them, to the window opposite, she\nsaw a strange lady coming up the garden.\n\nMy mother had a sure foreboding at the second glance, that it was\nMiss Betsey. The setting sun was glowing on the strange lady, over the\ngarden-fence, and she came walking up to the door with a fell rigidity\nof figure and composure of countenance that could have belonged to\nnobody else.\n\nWhen she reached the house, she gave another proof of her identity.\nMy father had often hinted that she seldom conducted herself like any\nordinary Christian; and now, instead of ringing the bell, she came and\nlooked in at that identical window, pressing the end of her nose against\nthe glass to that extent, that my poor dear mother used to say it became\nperfectly flat and white in a moment.\n\nShe gave my mother such a turn, that I have always been convinced I am\nindebted to Miss Betsey for having been born on a Friday.\n\nMy mother had left her chair in her agitation, and gone behind it in\nthe corner. Miss Betsey, looking round the room, slowly and inquiringly,\nbegan on the other side, and carried her eyes on, like a Saracen's Head\nin a Dutch clock, until they reached my mother. Then she made a frown\nand a gesture to my mother, like one who was accustomed to be obeyed, to\ncome and open the door. My mother went.\n\n'Mrs. David Copperfield, I think,' said Miss Betsey; the emphasis\nreferring, perhaps, to my mother's mourning weeds, and her condition.\n\n'Yes,' said my mother, faintly.\n\n'Miss Trotwood,' said the visitor. 'You have heard of her, I dare say?'\n\nMy mother answered she had had that pleasure. And she had a disagreeable\nconsciousness of not appearing to imply that it had been an overpowering\npleasure.\n\n'Now you see her,' said Miss Betsey. My mother bent her head, and begged\nher to walk in.\n\nThey went into the parlour my mother had come from, the fire in the best\nroom on the other side of the passage not being lighted--not having\nbeen lighted, indeed, since my father's funeral; and when they were both\nseated, and Miss Betsey said nothing, my mother, after vainly trying to\nrestrain herself, began to cry. 'Oh tut, tut, tut!' said Miss Betsey, in\na hurry. 'Don't do that! Come, come!'\n\nMy mother couldn't help it notwithstanding, so she cried until she had\nhad her cry out.\n\n'Take off your cap, child,' said Miss Betsey, 'and let me see you.'\n\nMy mother was too much afraid of her to refuse compliance with this odd\nrequest, if she had any disposition to do so. Therefore she did as she\nwas told, and did it with such nervous hands that her hair (which was\nluxuriant and beautiful) fell all about her face.\n\n'Why, bless my heart!' exclaimed Miss Betsey. 'You are a very Baby!'\n\nMy mother was, no doubt, unusually youthful in appearance even for her\nyears; she hung her head, as if it were her fault, poor thing, and said,\nsobbing, that indeed she was afraid she was but a childish widow, and\nwould be but a childish mother if she lived. In a short pause which\nensued, she had a fancy that she felt Miss Betsey touch her hair, and\nthat with no ungentle hand; but, looking at her, in her timid hope, she\nfound that lady sitting with the skirt of her dress tucked up, her hands\nfolded on one knee, and her feet upon the fender, frowning at the fire.\n\n'In the name of Heaven,' said Miss Betsey, suddenly, 'why Rookery?'\n\n'Do you mean the house, ma'am?' asked my mother.\n\n'Why Rookery?' said Miss Betsey. 'Cookery would have been more to the\npurpose, if you had had any practical ideas of life, either of you.'\n\n'The name was Mr. Copperfield's choice,' returned my mother. 'When he\nbought the house, he liked to think that there were rooks about it.'\n\nThe evening wind made such a disturbance just now, among some tall old\nelm-trees at the bottom of the garden, that neither my mother nor Miss\nBetsey could forbear glancing that way. As the elms bent to one another,\nlike giants who were whispering secrets, and after a few seconds of such\nrepose, fell into a violent flurry, tossing their wild arms about, as if\ntheir late confidences were really too wicked for their peace of mind,\nsome weatherbeaten ragged old rooks'-nests, burdening their higher\nbranches, swung like wrecks upon a stormy sea.\n\n'Where are the birds?' asked Miss Betsey.\n\n'The--?' My mother had been thinking of something else.\n\n'The rooks--what has become of them?' asked Miss Betsey.\n\n'There have not been any since we have lived here,' said my mother. 'We\nthought--Mr. Copperfield thought--it was quite a large rookery; but\nthe nests were very old ones, and the birds have deserted them a long\nwhile.'\n\n'David Copperfield all over!' cried Miss Betsey. 'David Copperfield from\nhead to foot! Calls a house a rookery when there's not a rook near it,\nand takes the birds on trust, because he sees the nests!'\n\n'Mr. Copperfield,' returned my mother, 'is dead, and if you dare to\nspeak unkindly of him to me--'\n\nMy poor dear mother, I suppose, had some momentary intention of\ncommitting an assault and battery upon my aunt, who could easily have\nsettled her with one hand, even if my mother had been in far better\ntraining for such an encounter than she was that evening. But it passed\nwith the action of rising from her chair; and she sat down again very\nmeekly, and fainted.\n\nWhen she came to herself, or when Miss Betsey had restored her,\nwhichever it was, she found the latter standing at the window. The\ntwilight was by this time shading down into darkness; and dimly as they\nsaw each other, they could not have done that without the aid of the\nfire.\n\n'Well?' said Miss Betsey, coming back to her chair, as if she had only\nbeen taking a casual look at the prospect; 'and when do you expect--'\n\n'I am all in a tremble,' faltered my mother. 'I don't know what's the\nmatter. I shall die, I am sure!'\n\n'No, no, no,' said Miss Betsey. 'Have some tea.'\n\n'Oh dear me, dear me, do you think it will do me any good?' cried my\nmother in a helpless manner.\n\n'Of course it will,' said Miss Betsey. 'It's nothing but fancy. What do\nyou call your girl?'\n\n'I don't know that it will be a girl, yet, ma'am,' said my mother\ninnocently.\n\n'Bless the Baby!' exclaimed Miss Betsey, unconsciously quoting the\nsecond sentiment of the pincushion in the drawer upstairs, but\napplying it to my mother instead of me, 'I don't mean that. I mean your\nservant-girl.'\n\n'Peggotty,' said my mother.\n\n'Peggotty!' repeated Miss Betsey, with some indignation. 'Do you mean to\nsay, child, that any human being has gone into a Christian church,\nand got herself named Peggotty?' 'It's her surname,' said my mother,\nfaintly. 'Mr. Copperfield called her by it, because her Christian name\nwas the same as mine.'\n\n'Here! Peggotty!' cried Miss Betsey, opening the parlour door. 'Tea.\nYour mistress is a little unwell. Don't dawdle.'\n\nHaving issued this mandate with as much potentiality as if she had been\na recognized authority in the house ever since it had been a house,\nand having looked out to confront the amazed Peggotty coming along the\npassage with a candle at the sound of a strange voice, Miss Betsey shut\nthe door again, and sat down as before: with her feet on the fender, the\nskirt of her dress tucked up, and her hands folded on one knee.\n\n'You were speaking about its being a girl,' said Miss Betsey. 'I have no\ndoubt it will be a girl. I have a presentiment that it must be a girl.\nNow child, from the moment of the birth of this girl--'\n\n'Perhaps boy,' my mother took the liberty of putting in.\n\n'I tell you I have a presentiment that it must be a girl,' returned Miss\nBetsey. 'Don't contradict. From the moment of this girl's birth, child,\nI intend to be her friend. I intend to be her godmother, and I beg\nyou'll call her Betsey Trotwood Copperfield. There must be no mistakes\nin life with THIS Betsey Trotwood. There must be no trifling with HER\naffections, poor dear. She must be well brought up, and well guarded\nfrom reposing any foolish confidences where they are not deserved. I\nmust make that MY care.'\n\nThere was a twitch of Miss Betsey's head, after each of these sentences,\nas if her own old wrongs were working within her, and she repressed any\nplainer reference to them by strong constraint. So my mother suspected,\nat least, as she observed her by the low glimmer of the fire: too\nmuch scared by Miss Betsey, too uneasy in herself, and too subdued and\nbewildered altogether, to observe anything very clearly, or to know what\nto say.\n\n'And was David good to you, child?' asked Miss Betsey, when she had been\nsilent for a little while, and these motions of her head had gradually\nceased. 'Were you comfortable together?'\n\n'We were very happy,' said my mother. 'Mr. Copperfield was only too good\nto me.'\n\n'What, he spoilt you, I suppose?' returned Miss Betsey.\n\n'For being quite alone and dependent on myself in this rough world\nagain, yes, I fear he did indeed,' sobbed my mother.\n\n'Well! Don't cry!' said Miss Betsey. 'You were not equally matched,\nchild--if any two people can be equally matched--and so I asked the\nquestion. You were an orphan, weren't you?' 'Yes.'\n\n'And a governess?'\n\n'I was nursery-governess in a family where Mr. Copperfield came to\nvisit. Mr. Copperfield was very kind to me, and took a great deal of\nnotice of me, and paid me a good deal of attention, and at last proposed\nto me. And I accepted him. And so we were married,' said my mother\nsimply.\n\n'Ha! Poor Baby!' mused Miss Betsey, with her frown still bent upon the\nfire. 'Do you know anything?'\n\n'I beg your pardon, ma'am,' faltered my mother.\n\n'About keeping house, for instance,' said Miss Betsey.\n\n'Not much, I fear,' returned my mother. 'Not so much as I could wish.\nBut Mr. Copperfield was teaching me--'\n\n('Much he knew about it himself!') said Miss Betsey in a parenthesis.\n--'And I hope I should have improved, being very anxious to learn, and\nhe very patient to teach me, if the great misfortune of his death'--my\nmother broke down again here, and could get no farther.\n\n'Well, well!' said Miss Betsey. --'I kept my housekeeping-book\nregularly, and balanced it with Mr. Copperfield every night,' cried my\nmother in another burst of distress, and breaking down again.\n\n'Well, well!' said Miss Betsey. 'Don't cry any more.' --'And I am\nsure we never had a word of difference respecting it, except when Mr.\nCopperfield objected to my threes and fives being too much like each\nother, or to my putting curly tails to my sevens and nines,' resumed my\nmother in another burst, and breaking down again.\n\n'You'll make yourself ill,' said Miss Betsey, 'and you know that will\nnot be good either for you or for my god-daughter. Come! You mustn't do\nit!'\n\nThis argument had some share in quieting my mother, though her\nincreasing indisposition had a larger one. There was an interval of\nsilence, only broken by Miss Betsey's occasionally ejaculating 'Ha!' as\nshe sat with her feet upon the fender.\n\n'David had bought an annuity for himself with his money, I know,' said\nshe, by and by. 'What did he do for you?'\n\n'Mr. Copperfield,' said my mother, answering with some difficulty, 'was\nso considerate and good as to secure the reversion of a part of it to\nme.'\n\n'How much?' asked Miss Betsey.\n\n'A hundred and five pounds a year,' said my mother.\n\n'He might have done worse,' said my aunt.\n\nThe word was appropriate to the moment. My mother was so much worse\nthat Peggotty, coming in with the teaboard and candles, and seeing at a\nglance how ill she was,--as Miss Betsey might have done sooner if there\nhad been light enough,--conveyed her upstairs to her own room with all\nspeed; and immediately dispatched Ham Peggotty, her nephew, who had been\nfor some days past secreted in the house, unknown to my mother, as a\nspecial messenger in case of emergency, to fetch the nurse and doctor.\n\nThose allied powers were considerably astonished, when they arrived\nwithin a few minutes of each other, to find an unknown lady of\nportentous appearance, sitting before the fire, with her bonnet tied\nover her left arm, stopping her ears with jewellers' cotton. Peggotty\nknowing nothing about her, and my mother saying nothing about her,\nshe was quite a mystery in the parlour; and the fact of her having a\nmagazine of jewellers' cotton in her pocket, and sticking the article\nin her ears in that way, did not detract from the solemnity of her\npresence.\n\nThe doctor having been upstairs and come down again, and having\nsatisfied himself, I suppose, that there was a probability of this\nunknown lady and himself having to sit there, face to face, for some\nhours, laid himself out to be polite and social. He was the meekest of\nhis sex, the mildest of little men. He sidled in and out of a room, to\ntake up the less space. He walked as softly as the Ghost in Hamlet,\nand more slowly. He carried his head on one side, partly in modest\ndepreciation of himself, partly in modest propitiation of everybody\nelse. It is nothing to say that he hadn't a word to throw at a dog. He\ncouldn't have thrown a word at a mad dog. He might have offered him one\ngently, or half a one, or a fragment of one; for he spoke as slowly as\nhe walked; but he wouldn't have been rude to him, and he couldn't have\nbeen quick with him, for any earthly consideration.\n\nMr. Chillip, looking mildly at my aunt with his head on one side, and\nmaking her a little bow, said, in allusion to the jewellers' cotton, as\nhe softly touched his left ear:\n\n'Some local irritation, ma'am?'\n\n'What!' replied my aunt, pulling the cotton out of one ear like a cork.\n\nMr. Chillip was so alarmed by her abruptness--as he told my mother\nafterwards--that it was a mercy he didn't lose his presence of mind. But\nhe repeated sweetly:\n\n'Some local irritation, ma'am?'\n\n'Nonsense!' replied my aunt, and corked herself again, at one blow.\n\nMr. Chillip could do nothing after this, but sit and look at her feebly,\nas she sat and looked at the fire, until he was called upstairs again.\nAfter some quarter of an hour's absence, he returned.\n\n'Well?' said my aunt, taking the cotton out of the ear nearest to him.\n\n'Well, ma'am,' returned Mr. Chillip, 'we are--we are progressing slowly,\nma'am.'\n\n'Ba--a--ah!' said my aunt, with a perfect shake on the contemptuous\ninterjection. And corked herself as before.\n\nReally--really--as Mr. Chillip told my mother, he was almost shocked;\nspeaking in a professional point of view alone, he was almost shocked.\nBut he sat and looked at her, notwithstanding, for nearly two hours,\nas she sat looking at the fire, until he was again called out. After\nanother absence, he again returned.\n\n'Well?' said my aunt, taking out the cotton on that side again.\n\n'Well, ma'am,' returned Mr. Chillip, 'we are--we are progressing slowly,\nma'am.'\n\n'Ya--a--ah!' said my aunt. With such a snarl at him, that Mr. Chillip\nabsolutely could not bear it. It was really calculated to break his\nspirit, he said afterwards. He preferred to go and sit upon the stairs,\nin the dark and a strong draught, until he was again sent for.\n\nHam Peggotty, who went to the national school, and was a very dragon at\nhis catechism, and who may therefore be regarded as a credible witness,\nreported next day, that happening to peep in at the parlour-door an hour\nafter this, he was instantly descried by Miss Betsey, then walking to\nand fro in a state of agitation, and pounced upon before he could make\nhis escape. That there were now occasional sounds of feet and voices\noverhead which he inferred the cotton did not exclude, from the\ncircumstance of his evidently being clutched by the lady as a victim on\nwhom to expend her superabundant agitation when the sounds were loudest.\nThat, marching him constantly up and down by the collar (as if he had\nbeen taking too much laudanum), she, at those times, shook him, rumpled\nhis hair, made light of his linen, stopped his ears as if she confounded\nthem with her own, and otherwise tousled and maltreated him. This was\nin part confirmed by his aunt, who saw him at half past twelve o'clock,\nsoon after his release, and affirmed that he was then as red as I was.\n\nThe mild Mr. Chillip could not possibly bear malice at such a time, if\nat any time. He sidled into the parlour as soon as he was at liberty,\nand said to my aunt in his meekest manner:\n\n'Well, ma'am, I am happy to congratulate you.'\n\n'What upon?' said my aunt, sharply.\n\nMr. Chillip was fluttered again, by the extreme severity of my aunt's\nmanner; so he made her a little bow and gave her a little smile, to\nmollify her.\n\n'Mercy on the man, what's he doing!' cried my aunt, impatiently. 'Can't\nhe speak?'\n\n'Be calm, my dear ma'am,' said Mr. Chillip, in his softest accents.\n\n'There is no longer any occasion for uneasiness, ma'am. Be calm.'\n\nIt has since been considered almost a miracle that my aunt didn't shake\nhim, and shake what he had to say, out of him. She only shook her own\nhead at him, but in a way that made him quail.\n\n'Well, ma'am,' resumed Mr. Chillip, as soon as he had courage, 'I am\nhappy to congratulate you. All is now over, ma'am, and well over.'\n\nDuring the five minutes or so that Mr. Chillip devoted to the delivery\nof this oration, my aunt eyed him narrowly.\n\n'How is she?' said my aunt, folding her arms with her bonnet still tied\non one of them.\n\n'Well, ma'am, she will soon be quite comfortable, I hope,' returned Mr.\nChillip. 'Quite as comfortable as we can expect a young mother to be,\nunder these melancholy domestic circumstances. There cannot be any\nobjection to your seeing her presently, ma'am. It may do her good.'\n\n'And SHE. How is SHE?' said my aunt, sharply.\n\nMr. Chillip laid his head a little more on one side, and looked at my\naunt like an amiable bird.\n\n'The baby,' said my aunt. 'How is she?'\n\n'Ma'am,' returned Mr. Chillip, 'I apprehended you had known. It's a\nboy.'\n\nMy aunt said never a word, but took her bonnet by the strings, in the\nmanner of a sling, aimed a blow at Mr. Chillip's head with it, put it on\nbent, walked out, and never came back. She vanished like a discontented\nfairy; or like one of those supernatural beings, whom it was popularly\nsupposed I was entitled to see; and never came back any more.\n\nNo. I lay in my basket, and my mother lay in her bed; but Betsey\nTrotwood Copperfield was for ever in the land of dreams and shadows, the\ntremendous region whence I had so lately travelled; and the light upon\nthe window of our room shone out upon the earthly bourne of all such\ntravellers, and the mound above the ashes and the dust that once was he,\nwithout whom I had never been.\n\n\n\n\nThe first objects that assume a distinct presence before me, as I look\nfar back, into the blank of my infancy, are my mother with her pretty\nhair and youthful shape, and Peggotty with no shape at all, and eyes so\ndark that they seemed to darken their whole neighbourhood in her face,\nand cheeks and arms so hard and red that I wondered the birds didn't\npeck her in preference to apples.\n\nI believe I can remember these two at a little distance apart, dwarfed\nto my sight by stooping down or kneeling on the floor, and I going\nunsteadily from the one to the other. I have an impression on my mind\nwhich I cannot distinguish from actual remembrance, of the touch of\nPeggotty's forefinger as she used to hold it out to me, and of its being\nroughened by needlework, like a pocket nutmeg-grater.\n\nThis may be fancy, though I think the memory of most of us can go\nfarther back into such times than many of us suppose; just as I believe\nthe power of observation in numbers of very young children to be quite\nwonderful for its closeness and accuracy. Indeed, I think that most\ngrown men who are remarkable in this respect, may with greater propriety\nbe said not to have lost the faculty, than to have acquired it; the\nrather, as I generally observe such men to retain a certain freshness,\nand gentleness, and capacity of being pleased, which are also an\ninheritance they have preserved from their childhood.\n\nI might have a misgiving that I am'meandering' in stopping to say this,\nbut that it brings me to remark that I build these conclusions, in part\nupon my own experience of myself; and if it should appear from\nanything I may set down in this narrative that I was a child of close\nobservation, or that as a man I have a strong memory of my childhood, I\nundoubtedly lay claim to both of these characteristics.\n\nLooking back, as I was saying, into the blank of my infancy, the first\nobjects I can remember as standing out by themselves from a confusion of\nthings, are my mother and Peggotty. What else do I remember? Let me see.\n\n\nThere comes out of the cloud, our house--not new to me, but quite\nfamiliar, in its earliest remembrance. On the ground-floor is Peggotty's\nkitchen, opening into a back yard; with a pigeon-house on a pole, in\nthe centre, without any pigeons in it; a great dog-kennel in a corner,\nwithout any dog; and a quantity of fowls that look terribly tall to me,\nwalking about, in a menacing and ferocious manner. There is one cock who\ngets upon a post to crow, and seems to take particular notice of me as\nI look at him through the kitchen window, who makes me shiver, he is so\nfierce. Of the geese outside the side-gate who come waddling after\nme with their long necks stretched out when I go that way, I dream at\nnight: as a man environed by wild beasts might dream of lions.\n\nHere is a long passage--what an enormous perspective I make of\nit!--leading from Peggotty's kitchen to the front door. A dark\nstore-room opens out of it, and that is a place to be run past at\nnight; for I don't know what may be among those tubs and jars and old\ntea-chests, when there is nobody in there with a dimly-burning light,\nletting a mouldy air come out of the door, in which there is the smell\nof soap, pickles, pepper, candles, and coffee, all at one whiff. Then\nthere are the two parlours: the parlour in which we sit of an evening,\nmy mother and I and Peggotty--for Peggotty is quite our companion, when\nher work is done and we are alone--and the best parlour where we sit\non a Sunday; grandly, but not so comfortably. There is something of a\ndoleful air about that room to me, for Peggotty has told me--I don't\nknow when, but apparently ages ago--about my father's funeral, and the\ncompany having their black cloaks put on. One Sunday night my mother\nreads to Peggotty and me in there, how Lazarus was raised up from the\ndead. And I am so frightened that they are afterwards obliged to take me\nout of bed, and show me the quiet churchyard out of the bedroom window,\nwith the dead all lying in their graves at rest, below the solemn moon.\n\nThere is nothing half so green that I know anywhere, as the grass of\nthat churchyard; nothing half so shady as its trees; nothing half so\nquiet as its tombstones. The sheep are feeding there, when I kneel up,\nearly in the morning, in my little bed in a closet within my mother's\nroom, to look out at it; and I see the red light shining on the\nsun-dial, and think within myself, 'Is the sun-dial glad, I wonder, that\nit can tell the time again?'\n\nHere is our pew in the church. What a high-backed pew! With a window\nnear it, out of which our house can be seen, and IS seen many times\nduring the morning's service, by Peggotty, who likes to make herself\nas sure as she can that it's not being robbed, or is not in flames. But\nthough Peggotty's eye wanders, she is much offended if mine does,\nand frowns to me, as I stand upon the seat, that I am to look at the\nclergyman. But I can't always look at him--I know him without that white\nthing on, and I am afraid of his wondering why I stare so, and perhaps\nstopping the service to inquire--and what am I to do? It's a dreadful\nthing to gape, but I must do something. I look at my mother, but she\npretends not to see me. I look at a boy in the aisle, and he makes faces\nat me. I look at the sunlight coming in at the open door through\nthe porch, and there I see a stray sheep--I don't mean a sinner, but\nmutton--half making up his mind to come into the church. I feel that\nif I looked at him any longer, I might be tempted to say something out\nloud; and what would become of me then! I look up at the monumental\ntablets on the wall, and try to think of Mr. Bodgers late of this\nparish, and what the feelings of Mrs. Bodgers must have been, when\naffliction sore, long time Mr. Bodgers bore, and physicians were in\nvain. I wonder whether they called in Mr. Chillip, and he was in vain;\nand if so, how he likes to be reminded of it once a week. I look from\nMr. Chillip, in his Sunday neckcloth, to the pulpit; and think what a\ngood place it would be to play in, and what a castle it would make, with\nanother boy coming up the stairs to attack it, and having the velvet\ncushion with the tassels thrown down on his head. In time my eyes\ngradually shut up; and, from seeming to hear the clergyman singing a\ndrowsy song in the heat, I hear nothing, until I fall off the seat with\na crash, and am taken out, more dead than alive, by Peggotty.\n\nAnd now I see the outside of our house, with the latticed\nbedroom-windows standing open to let in the sweet-smelling air, and the\nragged old rooks'-nests still dangling in the elm-trees at the bottom\nof the front garden. Now I am in the garden at the back, beyond the\nyard where the empty pigeon-house and dog-kennel are--a very preserve\nof butterflies, as I remember it, with a high fence, and a gate and\npadlock; where the fruit clusters on the trees, riper and richer than\nfruit has ever been since, in any other garden, and where my\nmother gathers some in a basket, while I stand by, bolting furtive\ngooseberries, and trying to look unmoved. A great wind rises, and the\nsummer is gone in a moment. We are playing in the winter twilight,\ndancing about the parlour. When my mother is out of breath and rests\nherself in an elbow-chair, I watch her winding her bright curls round\nher fingers, and straitening her waist, and nobody knows better than I\ndo that she likes to look so well, and is proud of being so pretty.\n\nThat is among my very earliest impressions. That, and a sense that we\nwere both a little afraid of Peggotty, and submitted ourselves in most\nthings to her direction, were among the first opinions--if they may be\nso called--that I ever derived from what I saw.\n\nPeggotty and I were sitting one night by the parlour fire, alone. I\nhad been reading to Peggotty about crocodiles. I must have read very\nperspicuously, or the poor soul must have been deeply interested, for I\nremember she had a cloudy impression, after I had done, that they were\na sort of vegetable. I was tired of reading, and dead sleepy; but\nhaving leave, as a high treat, to sit up until my mother came home from\nspending the evening at a neighbour's, I would rather have died upon\nmy post (of course) than have gone to bed. I had reached that stage of\nsleepiness when Peggotty seemed to swell and grow immensely large.\nI propped my eyelids open with my two forefingers, and looked\nperseveringly at her as she sat at work; at the little bit of wax-candle\nshe kept for her thread--how old it looked, being so wrinkled in\nall directions!--at the little house with a thatched roof, where the\nyard-measure lived; at her work-box with a sliding lid, with a view of\nSt. Paul's Cathedral (with a pink dome) painted on the top; at the brass\nthimble on her finger; at herself, whom I thought lovely. I felt so\nsleepy, that I knew if I lost sight of anything for a moment, I was\ngone.\n\n'Peggotty,' says I, suddenly, 'were you ever married?'\n\n'Lord, Master Davy,' replied Peggotty. 'What's put marriage in your\nhead?'\n\nShe answered with such a start, that it quite awoke me. And then she\nstopped in her work, and looked at me, with her needle drawn out to its\nthread's length.\n\n'But WERE you ever married, Peggotty?' says I. 'You are a very handsome\nwoman, an't you?'\n\nI thought her in a different style from my mother, certainly; but of\nanother school of beauty, I considered her a perfect example. There\nwas a red velvet footstool in the best parlour, on which my mother\nhad painted a nosegay. The ground-work of that stool, and Peggotty's\ncomplexion appeared to me to be one and the same thing. The stool was\nsmooth, and Peggotty was rough, but that made no difference.\n\n'Me handsome, Davy!' said Peggotty. 'Lawk, no, my dear! But what put\nmarriage in your head?'\n\n'I don't know!--You mustn't marry more than one person at a time, may\nyou, Peggotty?'\n\n'Certainly not,' says Peggotty, with the promptest decision.\n\n'But if you marry a person, and the person dies, why then you may marry\nanother person, mayn't you, Peggotty?'\n\n'YOU MAY,' says Peggotty, 'if you choose, my dear. That's a matter of\nopinion.'\n\n'But what is your opinion, Peggotty?' said I.\n\nI asked her, and looked curiously at her, because she looked so\ncuriously at me.\n\n'My opinion is,' said Peggotty, taking her eyes from me, after a little\nindecision and going on with her work, 'that I never was married myself,\nMaster Davy, and that I don't expect to be. That's all I know about the\nsubject.'\n\n'You an't cross, I suppose, Peggotty, are you?' said I, after sitting\nquiet for a minute.\n\nI really thought she was, she had been so short with me; but I was quite\nmistaken: for she laid aside her work (which was a stocking of her own),\nand opening her arms wide, took my curly head within them, and gave it\na good squeeze. I know it was a good squeeze, because, being very plump,\nwhenever she made any little exertion after she was dressed, some of the\nbuttons on the back of her gown flew off. And I recollect two bursting\nto the opposite side of the parlour, while she was hugging me.\n\n'Now let me hear some more about the Crorkindills,' said Peggotty, who\nwas not quite right in the name yet, 'for I an't heard half enough.'\n\nI couldn't quite understand why Peggotty looked so queer, or why she\nwas so ready to go back to the crocodiles. However, we returned to those\nmonsters, with fresh wakefulness on my part, and we left their eggs in\nthe sand for the sun to hatch; and we ran away from them, and baffled\nthem by constantly turning, which they were unable to do quickly, on\naccount of their unwieldy make; and we went into the water after them,\nas natives, and put sharp pieces of timber down their throats; and in\nshort we ran the whole crocodile gauntlet. I did, at least; but I had\nmy doubts of Peggotty, who was thoughtfully sticking her needle into\nvarious parts of her face and arms, all the time.\n\nWe had exhausted the crocodiles, and begun with the alligators, when\nthe garden-bell rang. We went out to the door; and there was my mother,\nlooking unusually pretty, I thought, and with her a gentleman with\nbeautiful black hair and whiskers, who had walked home with us from\nchurch last Sunday.\n\nAs my mother stooped down on the threshold to take me in her arms and\nkiss me, the gentleman said I was a more highly privileged little fellow\nthan a monarch--or something like that; for my later understanding\ncomes, I am sensible, to my aid here.\n\n'What does that mean?' I asked him, over her shoulder.\n\nHe patted me on the head; but somehow, I didn't like him or his deep\nvoice, and I was jealous that his hand should touch my mother's in\ntouching me--which it did. I put it away, as well as I could.\n\n'Oh, Davy!' remonstrated my mother.\n\n'Dear boy!' said the gentleman. 'I cannot wonder at his devotion!'\n\nI never saw such a beautiful colour on my mother's face before. She\ngently chid me for being rude; and, keeping me close to her shawl,\nturned to thank the gentleman for taking so much trouble as to bring her\nhome. She put out her hand to him as she spoke, and, as he met it with\nhis own, she glanced, I thought, at me.\n\n'Let us say \"good night\", my fine boy,' said the gentleman, when he had\nbent his head--I saw him!--over my mother's little glove.\n\n'Good night!' said I.\n\n'Come! Let us be the best friends in the world!' said the gentleman,\nlaughing. 'Shake hands!'\n\nMy right hand was in my mother's left, so I gave him the other.\n\n'Why, that's the Wrong hand, Davy!' laughed the gentleman.\n\nMy mother drew my right hand forward, but I was resolved, for my former\nreason, not to give it him, and I did not. I gave him the other, and he\nshook it heartily, and said I was a brave fellow, and went away.\n\nAt this minute I see him turn round in the garden, and give us a last\nlook with his ill-omened black eyes, before the door was shut.\n\nPeggotty, who had not said a word or moved a finger, secured the\nfastenings instantly, and we all went into the parlour. My mother,\ncontrary to her usual habit, instead of coming to the elbow-chair by the\nfire, remained at the other end of the room, and sat singing to herself.\n--'Hope you have had a pleasant evening, ma'am,' said Peggotty, standing\nas stiff as a barrel in the centre of the room, with a candlestick in\nher hand.\n\n'Much obliged to you, Peggotty,' returned my mother, in a cheerful\nvoice, 'I have had a VERY pleasant evening.'\n\n'A stranger or so makes an agreeable change,' suggested Peggotty.\n\n'A very agreeable change, indeed,' returned my mother.\n\nPeggotty continuing to stand motionless in the middle of the room, and\nmy mother resuming her singing, I fell asleep, though I was not so sound\nasleep but that I could hear voices, without hearing what they said.\nWhen I half awoke from this uncomfortable doze, I found Peggotty and my\nmother both in tears, and both talking.\n\n'Not such a one as this, Mr. Copperfield wouldn't have liked,' said\nPeggotty. 'That I say, and that I swear!'\n\n'Good Heavens!' cried my mother, 'you'll drive me mad! Was ever any\npoor girl so ill-used by her servants as I am! Why do I do myself\nthe injustice of calling myself a girl? Have I never been married,\nPeggotty?'\n\n'God knows you have, ma'am,' returned Peggotty. 'Then, how can you\ndare,' said my mother--'you know I don't mean how can you dare,\nPeggotty, but how can you have the heart--to make me so uncomfortable\nand say such bitter things to me, when you are well aware that I\nhaven't, out of this place, a single friend to turn to?'\n\n'The more's the reason,' returned Peggotty, 'for saying that it won't\ndo. No! That it won't do. No! No price could make it do. No!'--I thought\nPeggotty would have thrown the candlestick away, she was so emphatic\nwith it.\n\n'How can you be so aggravating,' said my mother, shedding more tears\nthan before, 'as to talk in such an unjust manner! How can you go on as\nif it was all settled and arranged, Peggotty, when I tell you over\nand over again, you cruel thing, that beyond the commonest civilities\nnothing has passed! You talk of admiration. What am I to do? If people\nare so silly as to indulge the sentiment, is it my fault? What am I to\ndo, I ask you? Would you wish me to shave my head and black my face, or\ndisfigure myself with a burn, or a scald, or something of that sort? I\ndare say you would, Peggotty. I dare say you'd quite enjoy it.'\n\nPeggotty seemed to take this aspersion very much to heart, I thought.\n\n'And my dear boy,' cried my mother, coming to the elbow-chair in which\nI was, and caressing me,'my own little Davy! Is it to be hinted to me\nthat I am wanting in affection for my precious treasure, the dearest\nlittle fellow that ever was!'\n\n'Nobody never went and hinted no such a thing,' said Peggotty.\n\n'You did, Peggotty!' returned my mother. 'You know you did. What else\nwas it possible to infer from what you said, you unkind creature,\nwhen you know as well as I do, that on his account only last quarter I\nwouldn't buy myself a new parasol, though that old green one is frayed\nthe whole way up, and the fringe is perfectly mangy? You know it is,\nPeggotty. You can't deny it.' Then, turning affectionately to me, with\nher cheek against mine, 'Am I a naughty mama to you, Davy? Am I a nasty,\ncruel, selfish, bad mama? Say I am, my child; say \"yes\", dear boy, and\nPeggotty will love you; and Peggotty's love is a great deal better than\nmine, Davy. I don't love you at all, do I?'\n\nAt this, we all fell a-crying together. I think I was the loudest of\nthe party, but I am sure we were all sincere about it. I was quite\nheart-broken myself, and am afraid that in the first transports of\nwounded tenderness I called Peggotty a 'Beast'. That honest creature was\nin deep affliction, I remember, and must have become quite buttonless\non the occasion; for a little volley of those explosives went off,\nwhen, after having made it up with my mother, she kneeled down by the\nelbow-chair, and made it up with me.\n\nWe went to bed greatly dejected. My sobs kept waking me, for a long\ntime; and when one very strong sob quite hoisted me up in bed, I found\nmy mother sitting on the coverlet, and leaning over me. I fell asleep in\nher arms, after that, and slept soundly.\n\nWhether it was the following Sunday when I saw the gentleman again,\nor whether there was any greater lapse of time before he reappeared,\nI cannot recall. I don't profess to be clear about dates. But there he\nwas, in church, and he walked home with us afterwards. He came in, too,\nto look at a famous geranium we had, in the parlour-window. It did not\nappear to me that he took much notice of it, but before he went he asked\nmy mother to give him a bit of the blossom. She begged him to choose it\nfor himself, but he refused to do that--I could not understand why--so\nshe plucked it for him, and gave it into his hand. He said he would\nnever, never part with it any more; and I thought he must be quite a\nfool not to know that it would fall to pieces in a day or two.\n\nPeggotty began to be less with us, of an evening, than she had always\nbeen. My mother deferred to her very much--more than usual, it occurred\nto me--and we were all three excellent friends; still we were different\nfrom what we used to be, and were not so comfortable among ourselves.\nSometimes I fancied that Peggotty perhaps objected to my mother's\nwearing all the pretty dresses she had in her drawers, or to her\ngoing so often to visit at that neighbour's; but I couldn't, to my\nsatisfaction, make out how it was.\n\nGradually, I became used to seeing the gentleman with the black\nwhiskers. I liked him no better than at first, and had the same uneasy\njealousy of him; but if I had any reason for it beyond a child's\ninstinctive dislike, and a general idea that Peggotty and I could make\nmuch of my mother without any help, it certainly was not THE reason that\nI might have found if I had been older. No such thing came into my mind,\nor near it. I could observe, in little pieces, as it were; but as to\nmaking a net of a number of these pieces, and catching anybody in it,\nthat was, as yet, beyond me.\n\nOne autumn morning I was with my mother in the front garden, when Mr.\nMurdstone--I knew him by that name now--came by, on horseback. He reined\nup his horse to salute my mother, and said he was going to Lowestoft to\nsee some friends who were there with a yacht, and merrily proposed to\ntake me on the saddle before him if I would like the ride.\n\nThe air was so clear and pleasant, and the horse seemed to like the\nidea of the ride so much himself, as he stood snorting and pawing at the\ngarden-gate, that I had a great desire to go. So I was sent upstairs\nto Peggotty to be made spruce; and in the meantime Mr. Murdstone\ndismounted, and, with his horse's bridle drawn over his arm, walked\nslowly up and down on the outer side of the sweetbriar fence, while my\nmother walked slowly up and down on the inner to keep him company. I\nrecollect Peggotty and I peeping out at them from my little window; I\nrecollect how closely they seemed to be examining the sweetbriar between\nthem, as they strolled along; and how, from being in a perfectly angelic\ntemper, Peggotty turned cross in a moment, and brushed my hair the wrong\nway, excessively hard.\n\nMr. Murdstone and I were soon off, and trotting along on the green turf\nby the side of the road. He held me quite easily with one arm, and I\ndon't think I was restless usually; but I could not make up my mind to\nsit in front of him without turning my head sometimes, and looking up in\nhis face. He had that kind of shallow black eye--I want a better word to\nexpress an eye that has no depth in it to be looked into--which, when\nit is abstracted, seems from some peculiarity of light to be disfigured,\nfor a moment at a time, by a cast. Several times when I glanced at him,\nI observed that appearance with a sort of awe, and wondered what he\nwas thinking about so closely. His hair and whiskers were blacker and\nthicker, looked at so near, than even I had given them credit for being.\nA squareness about the lower part of his face, and the dotted indication\nof the strong black beard he shaved close every day, reminded me of\nthe wax-work that had travelled into our neighbourhood some half-a-year\nbefore. This, his regular eyebrows, and the rich white, and black, and\nbrown, of his complexion--confound his complexion, and his memory!--made\nme think him, in spite of my misgivings, a very handsome man. I have no\ndoubt that my poor dear mother thought him so too.\n\nWe went to an hotel by the sea, where two gentlemen were smoking cigars\nin a room by themselves. Each of them was lying on at least four chairs,\nand had a large rough jacket on. In a corner was a heap of coats and\nboat-cloaks, and a flag, all bundled up together.\n\nThey both rolled on to their feet in an untidy sort of manner, when we\ncame in, and said, 'Halloa, Murdstone! We thought you were dead!'\n\n'Not yet,' said Mr. Murdstone.\n\n'And who's this shaver?' said one of the gentlemen, taking hold of me.\n\n'That's Davy,' returned Mr. Murdstone.\n\n'Davy who?' said the gentleman. 'Jones?'\n\n'Copperfield,' said Mr. Murdstone.\n\n'What! Bewitching Mrs. Copperfield's encumbrance?' cried the gentleman.\n'The pretty little widow?'\n\n'Quinion,' said Mr. Murdstone, 'take care, if you please. Somebody's\nsharp.'\n\n'Who is?' asked the gentleman, laughing. I looked up, quickly; being\ncurious to know.\n\n'Only Brooks of Sheffield,' said Mr. Murdstone.\n\nI was quite relieved to find that it was only Brooks of Sheffield; for,\nat first, I really thought it was I.\n\nThere seemed to be something very comical in the reputation of Mr.\nBrooks of Sheffield, for both the gentlemen laughed heartily when he\nwas mentioned, and Mr. Murdstone was a good deal amused also. After some\nlaughing, the gentleman whom he had called Quinion, said:\n\n'And what is the opinion of Brooks of Sheffield, in reference to the\nprojected business?'\n\n'Why, I don't know that Brooks understands much about it at present,'\nreplied Mr. Murdstone; 'but he is not generally favourable, I believe.'\n\nThere was more laughter at this, and Mr. Quinion said he would ring the\nbell for some sherry in which to drink to Brooks. This he did; and when\nthe wine came, he made me have a little, with a biscuit, and, before\nI drank it, stand up and say, 'Confusion to Brooks of Sheffield!' The\ntoast was received with great applause, and such hearty laughter that\nit made me laugh too; at which they laughed the more. In short, we quite\nenjoyed ourselves.\n\nWe walked about on the cliff after that, and sat on the grass, and\nlooked at things through a telescope--I could make out nothing myself\nwhen it was put to my eye, but I pretended I could--and then we came\nback to the hotel to an early dinner. All the time we were out, the two\ngentlemen smoked incessantly--which, I thought, if I might judge from\nthe smell of their rough coats, they must have been doing, ever since\nthe coats had first come home from the tailor's. I must not forget that\nwe went on board the yacht, where they all three descended into the\ncabin, and were busy with some papers. I saw them quite hard at work,\nwhen I looked down through the open skylight. They left me, during this\ntime, with a very nice man with a very large head of red hair and a very\nsmall shiny hat upon it, who had got a cross-barred shirt or waistcoat\non, with 'Skylark' in capital letters across the chest. I thought it was\nhis name; and that as he lived on board ship and hadn't a street door\nto put his name on, he put it there instead; but when I called him Mr.\nSkylark, he said it meant the vessel.\n\nI observed all day that Mr. Murdstone was graver and steadier than the\ntwo gentlemen. They were very gay and careless. They joked freely with\none another, but seldom with him. It appeared to me that he was\nmore clever and cold than they were, and that they regarded him with\nsomething of my own feeling. I remarked that, once or twice when Mr.\nQuinion was talking, he looked at Mr. Murdstone sideways, as if to make\nsure of his not being displeased; and that once when Mr. Passnidge (the\nother gentleman) was in high spirits, he trod upon his foot, and gave\nhim a secret caution with his eyes, to observe Mr. Murdstone, who was\nsitting stern and silent. Nor do I recollect that Mr. Murdstone laughed\nat all that day, except at the Sheffield joke--and that, by the by, was\nhis own.\n\nWe went home early in the evening. It was a very fine evening, and my\nmother and he had another stroll by the sweetbriar, while I was sent in\nto get my tea. When he was gone, my mother asked me all about the day I\nhad had, and what they had said and done. I mentioned what they had said\nabout her, and she laughed, and told me they were impudent fellows who\ntalked nonsense--but I knew it pleased her. I knew it quite as well as\nI know it now. I took the opportunity of asking if she was at all\nacquainted with Mr. Brooks of Sheffield, but she answered No, only she\nsupposed he must be a manufacturer in the knife and fork way.\n\nCan I say of her face--altered as I have reason to remember it, perished\nas I know it is--that it is gone, when here it comes before me at this\ninstant, as distinct as any face that I may choose to look on in a\ncrowded street? Can I say of her innocent and girlish beauty, that it\nfaded, and was no more, when its breath falls on my cheek now, as it\nfell that night? Can I say she ever changed, when my remembrance brings\nher back to life, thus only; and, truer to its loving youth than I have\nbeen, or man ever is, still holds fast what it cherished then?\n\nI write of her just as she was when I had gone to bed after this talk,\nand she came to bid me good night. She kneeled down playfully by the\nside of the bed, and laying her chin upon her hands, and laughing, said:\n\n'What was it they said, Davy? Tell me again. I can't believe it.'\n\n'\"Bewitching--\"' I began.\n\nMy mother put her hands upon my lips to stop me.\n\n'It was never bewitching,' she said, laughing. 'It never could have been\nbewitching, Davy. Now I know it wasn't!'\n\n'Yes, it was. \"Bewitching Mrs. Copperfield\",' I repeated stoutly. 'And,\n\"pretty.\"'\n\n'No, no, it was never pretty. Not pretty,' interposed my mother, laying\nher fingers on my lips again.\n\n'Yes it was. \"Pretty little widow.\"'\n\n'What foolish, impudent creatures!' cried my mother, laughing and\ncovering her face. 'What ridiculous men! An't they? Davy dear--'\n\n'Well, Ma.'\n\n'Don't tell Peggotty; she might be angry with them. I am dreadfully\nangry with them myself; but I would rather Peggotty didn't know.'\n\nI promised, of course; and we kissed one another over and over again,\nand I soon fell fast asleep.\n\nIt seems to me, at this distance of time, as if it were the next day\nwhen Peggotty broached the striking and adventurous proposition I am\nabout to mention; but it was probably about two months afterwards.\n\nWe were sitting as before, one evening (when my mother was out as\nbefore), in company with the stocking and the yard-measure, and the bit\nof wax, and the box with St.\n\n### Summary:"}
