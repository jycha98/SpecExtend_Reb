Benefits under TAA include training subsidies and income support for workers who have exhausted their unemployment insurance (UI). TAA-eligible workers who are age 50 and over and obtain reemployment at a lower wage may be eligible for a wage insurance program. To be eligible for TAA benefits, separated workers must petition the Department of Labor (DOL) to establish that foreign trade contributed importantly to their job loss. TAA benefits are funded through federal appropriations and administered through state workforce systems and state unemployment insurance agencies. TAA for Workers is authorized under Title II of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended. It was last reauthorized by the Trade Adjustment Assistance Extension Act of 2011 (TAAEA; Title II of P.L. 112-40 ). TAAEA specified that TAA would operate under one set of eligibility and benefit provisions through December 31, 2013, and then revert to more restrictive eligibility and benefit provisions beginning January 1, 2014. This report will refer to the expired expanded provisions as \"the 2011 provisions\" and the current reduced provisions as \" the 2014 provisions.\" Changes in TAA eligibility and benefits are not retroactive. For example, workers who are covered under a petition filed under the 2011 provisions may continue to receive benefits under those provisions, even after the provisions have changed for new beneficiaries. This means that state grantee agencies operate multiple versions of the TAA program simultaneously, providing benefits based on the timing of the petition under which each participant is covered. Under TAAEA, the TAA for workers program was set to be phased out after December 31, 2014. However, the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 ( P.L. 113-235 ) appropriated funds for the program with the intent of continuing full operation of the TAA for Workers program through FY2015, including the certification of new workers. In FY2015, the program will continue to operate under the 2014 provisions. Division G of the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 ( P.L. 113-235 ) appropriated $710.6 million for the TAA for workers program. The appropriations bill's explanatory note specified that the funding level would \"allow for the full operation of the program throughout fiscal year 2015, including the provision of benefits to groups of workers certified after December 31, 2014.\" In FY2015, TAA will continue to operate under the 2014 provisions of the law. TAA is a direct spending (also referred to as \"mandatory\") program and subject to sequestration under the Budget Control Act of 2011, as amended. For FY2015, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has announced that the reduction for non-exempt, nondefense spending will be 7.3%. As such, TAA funding will be reduced to approximately $659 million. Obtaining TAA benefits is a two-stage process. First, a group of workers must petition DOL to establish that foreign trade \"contributed importantly\" to their job losses and become TAA certified. Once a group has been certified, individual workers covered by the group's petition apply for state-administered benefits at local American Job Centers (also known as One-Stop Career Centers). TAA is available to workers in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. This section describes TAA eligibility criteria under the current law 2014 provisions. Table 1 compares the current 2014 provisions to the now-expired 2011 provisions. To be eligible for TAA group certification, a group of workers from a firm (or a subdivision of a firm) must have become totally or partially separated from their employment or have been threatened with becoming totally or partially separated. Under current law, only production workers (i.e., workers that produce an \"article\") are eligible to be certified. Workers who produce a service are not eligible to be certified under the current provisions. The petitioning workers must establish that foreign trade contributed importantly to their separation. The role of foreign trade can be established in one of several ways: An increase in competitive imports . The sales or production of the petitioning firm have decreased and imports of articles like or directly competitive with those produced by the petitioning firm have increased. A shift in production to an eligible country . The workers' firm has moved production of the goods that the petitioning workers produced to a foreign county with which the United States has a free trade agreement (FTA). Adversely affected secondary workers . The petitioning firm is a supplier or a downstream producer to a TAA-certified firm and either (1) the sales or production for the TAA-certified firm accounted for at least 20% of the sales or production of the petitioning firm or (2) a loss of business with a TAA-certified firm contributed importantly to the workers' job losses. As noted previously, the certification criteria under the current 2014 provisions are narrower than the criteria under the 2011 provisions. A comparison of these two sets of provisions is in Table 1 . The change in eligibility criteria is not retroactive. As such, workers certified under the expanded 2011 provisions may continue to receive benefits after the enactment of the 2014 provisions. To establish TAA eligibility, a group of workers (or its union, firm, or state) must complete a two-page petition and submit it, along with any supporting documentation, to DOL. An additional copy of the TAA petition must also be filed with the governor of the state in which the affected firm is located. After receiving the petition, DOL investigates to determine if the petition meets any of the criteria outlined in the previous subsection of this report. Determinations of TAA petitions are published in the Federal Register and on the DOL website. If a petition is certified, DOL will also determine an impact date on which trade-related layoffs began or threatened to begin. This date can be as early as one year prior to the petition. A certified petition will cover all workers laid off between the impact date and two years after the certification of the petition. For example, if a petition was certified on June 1, 2010, and the impact date was found to be March 1, 2010, all members of the certified group laid off between March 1, 2010, and June 1, 2012, would be eligible for TAA benefits. If a petition is denied, the group who was denied certification may request administrative reconsideration by DOL. Reconsideration requests must be mailed within 30 days of the publication of the initial denial in the Federal Register . Workers who are denied certification may seek judicial review of DOL's initial petition denial or denial following administrative reconsideration. Appeals for judicial review must be filed with the U.S. Court of International Trade within 60 days of Federal Register publication of the initial denial or the administrative reconsideration denial. After DOL certifies a group of workers as eligible, the individual workers then apply to their local American Job Centers (also known as One Stop Career Centers) for individual benefits. To be covered under a certified petition, a worker must meet all of the following conditions: (1) separation from the firm on or after the impact date specified in the certification but within two years of DOL certification, (2) employment with the affected firm in at least 26 of the 52 weeks preceding layoff, (3) entitlement to state UI benefits, and (4) no disqualification for extended unemployment benefits. Additionally, to receive the Trade Readjustment Allowance (TRA) benefit, workers must also be enrolled in an approved training program or have received a waiver from training. Group-certified workers who are denied individual benefits can appeal the decision. The determination notice that individual workers receive after filing their applications for each benefit explains their appeal rights and time limits for filing appeals. Alternative Trade Adjustment Assistance (ATAA) is a wage insurance program that provides a cash payment to qualified TAA-certified workers age 50 and over who obtain new employment at a lower wage. ATAA is authorized by the 2014 provisions. A similar program called Reemployment Trade Adjustment Assistance (RTAA) was authorized by the 2011 provisions. ATAA is designed as a program for older trade-affected workers who likely have limited time remaining in the labor force and for whom comprehensive retraining may not be a cost-effective option. To be eligible for ATAA wage supplements, the worker's new annual wage must be lower than his or her certified job and less than $50,000. Under the 2014 provisions, a group of workers must request consideration for ATAA in addition to eligibility for regular TAA benefits. The age requirements are the same under the 2011 RTAA and 2014 ATAA provisions. Several other eligibility criteria are different. Under ATAA, a worker must secure reemployment within 26 weeks of separation from the worker's TAA-certified job. Under RTAA, there was no time limit for securing reemployment. To be eligible for ATAA benefits, a worker must be reemployed on a full-time basis and may not receive TAA-funded training. Under RTAA, an eligible worker had the additional option of receiving wage insurance benefits while being reemployed on a part-time basis and being enrolled in a TAA-approved training program. TAA benefits include training subsidies and income support for workers who have exhausted their UI benefits and are enrolled in training. Workers age 50 and over may participate in a wage insurance program. As noted previously, changes in TAA provisions are not typically retroactive. Therefore, workers are entitled to a set of benefits and services based on the effective provisions under which the petition that covers them was certified. For example, a worker who is covered by a petition that was certified under the 2011 provisions would still be able to receive the benefits specified in the 2011 provisions even if the worker did not receive benefits until after the 2014 provisions had taken effect. Table 2 at the end of this section compares benefits and services available to workers who are covered by petitions certified under the 2011 and 2014 provisions. Due to the two-year period that a certification remains active and the length of the time that a worker may receive TAA benefits and services, workers certified under pre-2011 provisions may currently be eligible for other sets of benefits authorized by previous TAA provisions. TAA-certified workers may receive several types of benefits and services to aid them in preparing for and obtaining new employment. The largest benefit is training assistance, though workers may also receive employment services (such as case management and job search assistance) as well as reimbursements for job search and relocation expenses. Eligible workers request training assistance through their local American Job Centers (also known as One-Stop Career Centers). Once approved, training can be paid on the worker's behalf directly to the service provider or through a voucher system. To receive funding, the worker must be qualified to undertake the requested training, the training must be available at a reasonable cost, and there must be a reasonable expectation of employment following the completion of training. The range of approved training includes a variety of governmental and private programs. There is no federal limit on the amount of training funding an individual can receive, though some states have a cap. Due to the range of acceptable activities and the decentralized nature of job training, a concise summation of TAA training programs is difficult. Data from DOL and partner researchers, however, offer some insight into the nature and duration of TAA-sponsored training programs. In FY2013, approximately 90% of TAA training participants received what DOL describes as occupational skills training: training in a specific occupation, typically provided in a classroom setting. The remainder of training was classified as remedial, prerequisite, on-the-job, or other customized training. Among the training participants who completed a program in FY2013, the average duration of enrollment in the program was 554 days. DOL does not require the states to track the type of institutions that provide training to TAA participants. Some data exist on this topic, however, from a 2012 DOL-commissioned report by Mathematica Policy Research. The study found that, among participants who enrolled in occupational skills programs, training was provided by a community or two-year college in 55% of cases and a vocational training center in 23% of cases. Other providers included private companies and four-year colleges or universities. The same study found that the average cost of TAA-sponsored occupational training was approximately $8,500, though programs varied considerably, with 41% of programs costing less than $5,000 and 31% costing more than $10,000. TAA does not require training programs to lead to a degree or other credential. In its FY2013 annual report, DOL reported that 76% of workers who completed training earned an industry-recognized credential, or a secondary school diploma or equivalent. The 2011 and 2014 provisions are similar in the types of training they approve. The funding of training under each set of provisions is somewhat different. Under the 2014 provisions, training subsidies receive a dedicated appropriation that only supports training activities. Under the 2011 provisions, training was funded out of a reemployment services fund that also funded employment services and job search and relocation assistance (discussed below). The 2014 provisions specify DOL should \"make every reasonable effort\" to provide counseling, placement, and other services to TAA-certified workers. The 2014 provisions do not, however, provide funding for these services, noting that states may use other federal workforce funding. The 2011 provisions specify a series of case management and employment services to which all TAA-certified workers are entitled. These services include a comprehensive assessment of the worker's skills and needs, assistance in developing an individual employment objective and identifying the training and services necessary to achieve that goal, and guidance on training and other services for which the worker may be eligible. Under the 2011 provisions, states were required to use at least 5% of their reemployment services allotments for case management and employment services. Both the 2011 and 2014 provisions authorize funding for job search and relocation allowances. This program targets workers who are unable to obtain suitable employment within their commuting areas. Certified workers can receive an allowance equal to 90% of each of their job search and relocation expenses, up to a maximum of $1,250 for each benefit. A Job Search Allowance may be available to subsidize transportation and subsistence costs related to job search activities outside an eligible worker's local commuting area. Subsistence payments may not exceed 50% of the federal per diem rate and travel payments may not exceed the prevailing mileage rate authorized under federal travel regulations. A Relocation Allowance may be available to workers who have secured permanent employment outside their local commuting area . The benefit covers 90% of the reasonable and necessary expenses of moving the workers, their families, and their household items. Relocating workers may also be eligible for a lump sum payment of up to three times their weekly wage, though the total relocation benefit may not exceed $1,250. Trade Readjustment Allowance (TRA) is an entitlement that provides income support to certified workers who are in approved training and whose UI benefits have been exhausted. It is funded by the federal government and administered by the states through their unemployment insurance systems. TRA benefit levels are equal to the worker's final UI benefit. UI benefit levels are based on earnings during a base period of employment (typically, the first four of the last five completed calendar quarters). UI benefits typically replace a portion of worker's wages up to a statewide maximum. Since states each administer their own UI programs, there is some variation in calculations in benefit levels. In January 2014, the highest maximum weekly UI benefit for a worker with no dependents was $679 in Massachusetts and the lowest was $240 in Arizona. There are three stages of TRA: Basic TRA. The weekly basic TRA payment begins the week after a worker's UI eligibility expires. To receive the basic TRA benefit, workers must be enrolled or participating in TAA-approved training, have completed such training, or have obtained a waiver from the training requirement. The total amount of basic TRA benefits available to a worker is equal to 52 times the weekly TRA benefit minus the total amount of UI benefits. For example, assuming a constant benefit level, a worker who received 39 weeks of UI benefits would be eligible for 13 weeks of basic TRA. In cases where a worker is entitled to UI for 52 or more weeks, UI benefits may offset the entirety of basic TRA. Additional TRA. After basic TRA has been exhausted, workers who are enrolled in a TAA-approved training program are eligible for an additional 65 weeks of income support for a total of 117 weeks of benefits. As is the case with basic TRA, UI benefits (including any benefit extensions) also offset additional TRA. Additional TRA is limited to workers who are enrolled in a training program; workers who have received a training waiver are not eligible for additional TRA. Completion TRA. In cases where a worker has collected 117 weeks of combined TRA and UI and is still enrolled in a training program that leads to a degree or industry-recognized credential, the worker may collect TRA for up to 13 additional weeks (130 weeks total), if the worker will complete the training program during that time. TAA participants may only collect additional TRA as long as they remain enrolled in a qualified training program. In cases where a worker's training program is shorter than the maximum TRA duration, the worker is not entitled to the maximum number of TRA weeks. The 2011 and 2014 provisions of TAA provide the same level and duration of TRA benefits. The timeline for enrolling in training, however, is narrower under the 2014 provisions. To be eligible for TRA under the 2014 provisions, a worker must enroll in training within 8 weeks of certification or within 16 weeks of layoff, whichever is later. Under the 2011 provisions, a worker must have enrolled in training within 26 weeks of either certification or layoff, whichever is later. Alternative Trade Adjustment Assistance (ATAA) is an entitlement that provides a wage supplement for workers age 50 and over who are certified for TAA benefits and pursue reemployment at a lower wage. The program provides a cash payment to an eligible worker equal to 50% of the difference between the worker's old wage and new wage. The maximum benefit is $10,000 over a two-year period. The age requirement, benefit calculation, and maximum benefit are the same under the 2011 and 2014 provisions. Under the 2011 provisions, the wage insurance program is known as Reemployment Trade Adjustment Assistance (RTAA) and there are several differences between the ATAA and RTAA programs. Under ATAA, workers must secure full-time reemployment within 26 weeks of separation from their TAA-certified job. Under RTAA, workers who are reemployed at least 20 hours per week are eligible for the program and there is no time limit on securing reemployment. Under ATAA, workers who receive ATAA payments may not participate in TAA-funded training. Under RTAA, workers who are reemployed on a part-time basis may participate in TAA-funded training while receiving RTAA payments. TAA for Workers is funded by the federal government and administered jointly by the federal government and cooperating state agencies. Group eligibility is determined by DOL and individual benefits are administered by cooperating state agencies. Funds for training and other reemployment services are allotted to the states by formula. The allotment formula considers the weighted average of certified workers in the state during the past four quarters, with the greatest weight on the most recent quarter; the weighted average of workers participating in training during the previous four quarters, with the greatest weight on the most recent quarter; the number of workers estimated to be participating in training during the forthcoming fiscal year as determined by the previous factor and DOL estimates; and the amount of funding estimated to be necessary to provide approved training as determined by per-trainee expenditures in the past four quarters. At the beginning of the fiscal year, 65% of the year's reemployment service funds are distributed to the states using the formula. The remaining 35% is held in a reserve fund. States with emergencies or unforeseen training burdens may apply for these reserve funds. Any reserve funds that are not allocated through the emergency funding process are allocated to the states using the original formula throughout the fiscal year. Regulations specify that no state's initial allocation may be less than 25% of its allocation in the preceding fiscal year. The TRA income support and ATAA wage insurance program are uncapped entitlements that are funded by the federal government and administered by state unemployment agencies. Annual congressional appropriations for these programs typically reflect the request in the President's budget. Any funds from these allocations that are unobligated at the end of the fiscal year expire and are returned to the Treasury. This section presents certification and participation data for TAA through FY2013. When interpreting these data, it is important to note that the eligibility and benefit provisions of TAA varied throughout the period listed. Since data only go through FY2013, they do not include any workers who were certified under the 2014 provisions of the program. Eligibility requirements and benefit levels are determined by the TAA provisions in effect on the date on which the petition that covers the individual was filed. A summary of dates and corresponding provisions that determine benefits is in Table 3 . Since a worker's benefits are determined by the provisions that were in place when the petition covering the worker was filed and not when the worker actually receives the benefits, workers participating in TAA at the same time may be covered by different provisions. For example, in its FY2013 annual report, DOL noted that program participants in that year included individuals covered under the TAAEA as well as individuals covered under prior versions of TAA that had been enacted in 2009 and 2002. As such, while variations in policy should be considered when interpreting the data, it is not possible to easily identify which program provisions align with program data from recent years. Table 4 presents data on TAA petitions and certifications from FY2003 to FY2013. In some cases, a petition may be filed in one year and be determined in the subsequent year. For example, the large increase in petitions filed in FY2009 created a backlog and many of the petitions were not determined until FY2010. The reduction of the backlog in FY2010 explains why the number of petitions certified in FY2010 exceeds the number of petitions filed. The filing and determination of petitions in different years also means that it is not possible to calculate the certification rate in a fiscal year by dividing the number of certified petitions by the number of filed petitions. Petitions certified in FY2013 (the most recent year for which data are available) covered approximately 104,000 workers. This represented an increase above the number of workers certified in FY2012, but was still below the approximately 287,000 workers who were certified in FY2010. In FY2013, the TAA program was operating under the 2011 provisions, which meant that both production and services workers were eligible to be certified for benefits. Among the 1,025 certified petitions, approximately 58% were on behalf of production workers. The remaining 42% of certified petitions were from service workers. Not all workers who are covered by a certified TAA petition choose to pursue benefits under the program. Certified workers may seek reemployment without assistance from the program, retire, or simply not pursue benefits. Table 5 presents data on the number of workers who enrolled in training or received an initial TRA payment by fiscal year. Since workers can be enrolled in training and receive TRA for more than one year, the number of workers receiving benefits in a year may be greater than the number of new participants listed in the table. Benefit usage in a particular fiscal year can be influenced by a number of factors. TAA policy varied throughout the period covered in Table 5 . Varied eligibility and benefit provisions likely impacted certifications and subsequent benefit usage. For example, the year with the highest number of new training participants is FY2009, which coincides with the expanded eligibility and benefits under the 2009 provisions of TAA. Non-TAA policy provisions may influence the use of TAA benefits. For example, during the FY2009-FY2012 period, Congress had enacted unemployment insurance extensions. Since TRA benefits are offset by UI, demand for TRA was reduced during this period. Economic conditions may affect certified workers' decisions to pursue training and other benefits. For example, during a period of low unemployment, a worker covered by a certified TAA petition may forego training benefits and pursue immediate reemployment. Table 5 does not provide data on the number of TAA-certified workers who received non-training employment services such as case management and career counseling. Under the 2009 and 2011 provisions, these services were an entitlement for certified workers and funding for these services was included in states' allotments for reemployment services. Under the 2002 and 2014 provisions, states must make every reasonable effort to provide these services, but did not receive dedicated funding to provide them. Table 6 presents data on post-TAA outcomes for program exiters using DOL's Common Measures, a metric that DOL uses across its workforce programs. In the table, entered employment rate (EER) refers to the percentage of workers who were employed in the quarter after program exit. The employment retention rate (ERR) is the share of these employed workers who were also employed in the second and third quarters after exit. Average earnings (AE) are recorded in the second and third quarters after exit among workers who were employed in the first quarter after exit. EER data are for all exiting workers. TAA classifies a program participant as an exiter once 90 days have passed since the worker received services or case management. DOL does not disaggregate its outcome data by which provisions of TAA an exiter received benefits under. As such, it is not possible to compare the employment outcomes of beneficiaries under different provisions (e.g., 2002 provisions vs. 2011 provisions). When interpreting outcome data, it may be useful to consider the broader labor market. For example, the increase in EER between FY2010 and FY2012 may have been influenced by broader labor market trends (e.g., reduction in employment rate) as well as factors related to the TAA program and program participants. While outcome data can offer some insights on participants' post-participation activities, such data offer a limited perspective on the impact of TAA benefits and services. For example, while the data in the previous section shows that 71% of program exiters in FY2013 met the \"entered employment\" criteria, we do not know how many of the same workers would have entered employment if TAA were not available and the workers either (1) simply sought reemployment with no government intervention or (2) utilized other employment and training programs that are available to all unemployed workers. As such, it is not possible to use outcome data to easily estimate the impact of or value added by TAA participation. To estimate the impact of TAA, DOL commissioned a series of studies to estimate the short and medium-term impact of the TAA for Workers program. These studies were released throughout 2012 and considered a cohort of TAA-eligible workers who were laid off between November 1, 2005, and October 31, 2006. Since TAA is an entitlement program for certified workers, the studies were not able to use a random assignment methodology in which some TAA-eligible workers received services while others did not. Instead, the studies compared TAA participants to a comparison group of UI claimants with similar observable characteristics such as age, race, education, employment history, and prior earnings. The study compared the employment status and earnings of TAA participants and the comparison group for 16 quarters (48 months) after initial job loss. It found that early in the reference period, TAA participants were more likely to participate in training, less likely to be employed, and had lower earnings than the comparison group. This is an expected finding since TAA generally emphasizes training over immediate reemployment. In the 16 th quarter, the study found that TAA participants' employment rate and earnings were both statistically significantly lower than the constructed comparison group. The study offered a number of caveats with regard to these findings and their generalizability. Among these were that a four-year follow up period may be insufficient to fully evaluate the returns to TAA-funded training and that, while the study compared TAA participants to UI claimants with similar observable characteristics, it is possible that there were unobservable differences between the groups that influenced employment and earnings outcomes. The analysis also noted that, due to the timing of the study, many TAA participants who participated in training returned to the labor market during an economic recession, whereas many members of the comparison group (which spent less time in training) returned to the labor market before the recession. When considering the generalizability of the study, it is also worthwhile to note that the populations considered in the studies were eligible under and received benefits according to the 2002 provisions of TAA. These provisions, while similar to current law, were decidedly different from the eligibility and benefit provisions that were in place under 2009 and 2011 versions of the program. TAA was formally established by the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (P.L. 87-794) but was little used until the Trade Act of 1974 ( P.L. 93-618 ) expanded benefits and eligibility. Except for a lapse between December 1985 and March 1986, a variety of legislative vehicles kept TAA authorized through the end of FY2001. Authorization then lapsed for 11 months, but the program remained funded through appropriations. The Trade Act of 2002 ( P.L. 107-210 ) reauthorized TAA, expanded benefits, and established a wage insurance program for older workers. Authorization expired on December 31, 2007, but the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2008 ( P.L. 110-161 ) funded TAA for FY2008. The Consolidated Security, Disaster Assistance, and Continuing Appropriations Act, 2009 ( P.L. 110-329 ) funded TAA through March 6, 2009, and specified that the programs would continue through that date. The Trade and Globalization Adjustment Assistance Act of 2009 (TGAAA), part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA, P.L. 111-5 ), was signed on February 17, 2009. TGAAA reauthorized TAA and temporarily expanded both eligibility and benefit levels. Authorization for the TGAAA changes was set to expire on December 31, 2010, but the Omnibus Trade Act of 2010 ( P.L. 111-344 ) extended them through February 12, 2011. After that date, TAA reverted back to the pre-expansion provisions that were in place prior to TGAAA and defined by the Trade Act of 2002. 2011 Reauthorization TAA operated under the pre-expansion provisions until October 21, 2011, when the Trade Adjustment Assistance Extension Act of 2011 (TAAEA; Title II of P.L. 112-40 ) was signed into law. TAAEA reauthorized TAA through December 31, 2014, and expanded eligibility and benefits to near-TGAAA levels through December 31, 2013. The law was retroactive and groups who were denied certification under the prior provisions were automatically reconsidered under the provisions enacted by TAAEA. Groups who were certified under the prior provisions were eligible to reapply under the new expanded benefit provisions. The expanded provisions of the TAAEA expired after December 31, 2013, and eligibility criteria and benefit levels largely reverted to the levels set by the Trade Act of 2002. These provisions were set to remain in place for one year until the program was scheduled to begin to be phased out after December 31, 2014. However, the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 ( P.L. 113-235 ) appropriated funds for the program for FY2015 with the intent of continuing full operation.\n\n### Summary:\n\n", "answer": "Trade Adjustment Assistance for Workers (TAA) provides federal assistance to workers who have been adversely affected by foreign trade. It was most recently authorized by the Trade Adjustment Assistance Extension Act of 2011 (TAAEA; Title II of P.L. 112-40). Under TAAEA, the program operated under one set of eligibility and benefit provisions through December 31, 2013, and then reverted to a more restrictive set of provisions on January 1, 2014. The TAA program was scheduled to be phased out beginning January 1, 2015, but the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 (P.L. 113-235) provided funding for the program and allowed it to continue full operation through FY2015. To be eligible for TAA, a group of workers must establish that they were separated from their employment either because their jobs moved outside the United States or because of an increase in directly competitive imports. Workers at firms that are suppliers to or downstream producers of TAA-certified firms may also be eligible for TAA benefits. Under current law, only production workers are eligible. Under the TAAEA provisions that were in place through December 31, 2013, both production and service workers were eligible. Service workers who were certified prior to the change in eligibility may continue to receive benefits. To establish eligibility for TAA benefits, a group of affected workers must petition the Department of Labor (DOL) and a DOL investigation must verify the role of foreign trade in the workers' job loss. Once a petition is certified by DOL, covered workers may apply for individual benefits. These benefits are funded by the federal government and administered by the states through their workforce systems. The specific group of benefits and services to which a worker is entitled is determined by the date of the petition that covers the worker. Benefits include a group of benefits and services to assist workers in returning to work. Training subsidies are available if no suitable employment is available and a certified worker meets other criteria. Eligible training options include a variety of public and private programs. Employment services are provided to TAA-certified workers through state workforce agencies. These can include case management, career counseling, job search assistance, and other non-training services. Job search and relocation allowances are available to workers who seek employment outside of their commuting area. Trade Readjustment Allowance (TRA) is an income support for TAA-certified workers who have exhausted their unemployment insurance (UI) and are enrolled in an eligible training program. TRA payments are equal to the workers' final UI benefit. Wage insurance is available to certified workers age 50 and over who obtain reemployment at a lower wage.

One part of the ONDCP strategy to disrupt the illicit drug market focuses interdiction efforts on seizing cocaine and other illicit drugs in the transit zone that are bound for the United States (arrival zone) from South America (source zone). Virtually all of the cocaine shipped to the United States travels through the transit zone from South America—entering Central America, Mexico, and the Caribbean en route to the United States. The transit zone is a 6 million square mile area that encompasses Central America, Mexico, the eastern Pacific Ocean, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Caribbean Sea. The transit zone is divided into four maritime trafficking routes: Eastern Pacific, Western Caribbean, Central Caribbean, and Eastern Caribbean. Drug traffickers use go-fast boats, fishing vessels, submersible vessels, noncommercial aircraft, and other types of conveyances to smuggle cocaine from the source zone to Central America, Mexico, and the Caribbean en route to the United States. ONDCP’s strategy for drug interdiction in the transit zone is focused on cocaine because ONDCP has identified cocaine as a leading drug threat to the United States. According to Coast Guard officials, the largest estimated share of cocaine has been smuggled through the Eastern Pacific and Western Caribbean routes of the transit zone for nearly two decades. For example, the principal source of information about cocaine flow in the transit zone is the CCDB. According to the CCDB, in fiscal year 2013, approximately 84 percent of the estimated cocaine flow, as measured in metric tons, was by noncommercial maritime means through these two routes. Figure 1 shows a map indicating the source, transit, and arrival zones—with the fiscal year 2013 estimated noncommercial maritime cocaine flow through the four smuggling routes and the locations of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands within the transit zone. As the southernmost points of entry into the United States and the only U.S. territories within the transit zone, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands are key entry points for illicit drugs being smuggled into the United States. Like the continental United States, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands are considered part of the arrival zone, yet they are located geographically within the Eastern Caribbean route of the transit zone. According to a 2011 Department of Justice National Drug Intelligence Center report, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands are attractive targets for illicit drug smuggling because of their proximity to the source zone and Puerto Rico’s location within the United States’ Customs zone. According to Coast Guard officials, the illicit drug flow through the Central and Eastern Caribbean routes generally consists of maritime smuggling from South America to the Dominican Republic and eventual transshipment to Puerto Rico (secondary flow) and, to a lesser extent, maritime smuggling directly from South America to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands (primary flow). CCDB drug flow estimates show that in fiscal year 2013, about 3 percent of the cocaine flow in the transit zone was smuggled toward Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The Department of Justice has reported that most of this flow is destined for the continental United States—with the rest remaining on the islands for local consumption. However, estimates indicate that illicit cocaine smuggling toward Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands has increased each year since fiscal year 2009. For example, according to CCDB estimates, cocaine flow toward Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands has more than doubled in recent years, from 6.4 metric tons in fiscal year 2009 to 17.3 metric tons in fiscal year 2013. Federal and local government officials in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands have raised concerns about the illicit drug flow and have identified it as a key contributor to the high levels of murder and other violent crime on the islands. In particular, homicide rates in the two territories have risen in recent years, and federal and local officials have linked the rise of the homicide rates, in part, to illicit cocaine trafficking on the Island. According to a 2014 study by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, the 2010 homicide rate in Puerto Rico was about 27 per 100,000 persons and in the U.S. Virgin Islands it was about 53 per 100,000 persons—more than 5 times (Puerto Rico) and 11 times (U.S. Virgin Islands) the U.S. national rate. According to a 2011 report issued by the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area office that oversees the territories, most of this violence is associated with turf wars for control over the local drug market. JIATF-S relies on DHS (Coast Guard and CBP) and the Department of Defense (Navy) to provide vessels and aircraft for conducting drug interdiction operations in the transit zone. JIATF-S also receives operational resources from allied countries, with Canada, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom providing maritime detection and monitoring assistance. According to JIATF-S and Coast Guard officials, the JIATF-S strategy is to use its available vessel and aircraft resources to patrol the transit zone far from U.S. shores and close to the source zone countries in South America in order to increase chances the interdictions are of larger load sizes and higher purity than would otherwise be the case and to cause greater disruption to illicit drug- smuggling organizations. JIATF-S officials reported deploying the majority of available vessels and aircraft to patrol the Eastern Pacific and Western Caribbean routes of the transit zone because the routes have accounted for the largest drug flow—and therefore deploying resources to these routes will have the greatest impact on efforts to disrupt cocaine flow. The Coast Guard is the lead federal agency for maritime drug interdiction in the transit zone, and its operations with JIATF-S are a key element of the Coast Guard’s counter-drug efforts. Overall, the Coast Guard is a major contributor of JIATF-S vessel and aircraft resources. The resources the Coast Guard provides to JIATF-S generally include major cutters, maritime patrol aircraft (planes), and helicopters capable of deploying airborne use of force (AUF). In addition, the Coast Guard provides JIATF-S with deployable specialized forces—specifically Law Enforcement Detachments (LEDET)—embarked on U.S. naval and allied vessels. We discuss AUF and LEDETs in more detail later in this report. The Coast Guard’s process for allocating drug interdiction resources is focused on meeting commitments for strategic priorities, such as JIATF-S transit zone operations, first, before dividing up its remaining resources between its Atlantic and Pacific Area Commands. According to Coast Guard guidance and discussions with DHS officials, the Coast Guard determines the amount of resource levels—targets for the amount of time selected vessels, aircraft, and LEDETs are provided to JIATF-S—through an annual operational planning process that considers factors, including resource requirements for strategic priorities, evolving maritime risks, and the availability of the Coast Guard’s fleet of vessels and aircraft. JIATF-S requests for resource requirements specify the capabilities (types of vessels or aircraft) and corresponding capacities (number of days for vessels or resource hours for aircraft) for the Coast Guard, CBP, and the Department of Defense. The Coast Guard reviews JIATF-S resource requirement requests, sets resource deployment targets for JIATF-S, and communicates these targets to DHS for inclusion in a DHS-wide Statement of Intent of planned deployments to JIATF-S. The Coast Guard then allocates its remaining available resources to the Atlantic and Pacific Area Commands, which further allocate the resources for implementing the Coast Guard’s 11 missions, including drug interdiction. See appendix I for more details on the Coast Guard’s drug interdiction mission resource allocation process. Unlike with overall transit zone operations, JIATF-S does not oversee detection and monitoring efforts for drug smuggling in the U.S. territories.and coordinating operations to interdict the maritime flow of illicit drugs in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands because they are U.S. territories and part of the arrival zone. In addition to the Coast Guard, CBP’s Puerto Rico-based Caribbean Air and Marine Branch conducts marine interdiction and patrol operations using a mix of planes, helicopters, and Rather, DHS has the lead federal responsibility for planning small boats for coastal drug interdiction operations, generally within U.S. territorial waters. The Puerto Rico Police Department also deploys small boats for drug interdiction operations. Overall, from fiscal years 2009 through 2013, the amount of resources the Coast Guard provided to JIATF-S—including vessels, aircraft, and LEDETs—varied. During this period, the Coast Guard generally did not meet annual targets for its primary drug interdiction mission performance measure. Coast Guard officials cited the declining readiness of the Coast Guard’s aging major cutter fleet; delays in the delivery of new, more capable replacement cutters; and budget constraints, including sequestration, as key factors affecting the Coast Guard’s ability to meet its resource deployment and drug interdiction mission performance targets. Figure 2 shows the key resources the Coast Guard uses to support drug interdiction operations. The Coast Guard’s deployment of vessels to JIATF-S to carry out drug interdiction operations in the transit zone varied during fiscal years 2009 through 2012, and then sharply declined in 2013. Specifically, the Coast Guard’s coverage targets—the planned number of days major cutters (national security cutters, high endurance cutters, and medium endurance cutters) are to operate under JIATF-S tactical control throughout the year—have varied since fiscal year 2009, and the Coast Guard has not fully met them. For example, according to Coast Guard documents, in fiscal year 2009, the Coast Guard’s cutter coverage target was 2,555 days (the equivalent of 7 major cutters under JIATF-S tactical control throughout the year) and the Coast Guard provided 2,036 days—about 80 percent of its target. In fiscal year 2013, the cutter coverage target was 2,008 days (or 5.5 major cutters) and the Coast Guard provided 1,346 days—about 67 percent of its target. Overall, the Coast Guard met an average of 76 percent of its annual JIATF-S cutter coverage targets Figure 3 compares the Coast during fiscal years 2009 through 2013.Guard’s cutter coverage targets with the actual cutter days provided to JIATF-S for fiscal years 2009 through 2013. The Coast Guard’s primary aircraft deployments to JIATF-S are long- range maritime patrol aircraft—generally the HC-130—to detect and monitor drug smuggling activity in the transit zone. The Coast Guard also deploys helicopters—generally modified MH-65s—with marksmen on board in what is known as airborne use of force. AUF-capable helicopters are deployed aboard major cutters and allied vessels to conduct short-range patrols and pursuit actions in the transit zone using marksmen who are trained to shoot out and disable the engines of fleeing drug-smuggling vessels—a capability JIATF-S and Coast Guard officials cite as being critical to drug interdiction success. Maritime patrol aircraft: According to Coast Guard data, the number of maritime patrol aircraft hours the Coast Guard provided to JIATF-S varied during fiscal years 2009 through 2012, ending with an overall decline in 2013, although the numbers remained below target levels. As can be seen in figure 4, since fiscal year 2009, the Coast Guard’s annual maritime patrol aircraft hour allocation target (the number of hours the aircraft are to be under JIATF-S tactical control) has been 4,700 hours. According to Coast Guard data, the Coast Guard approached the target in fiscal year 2011, when the Coast Guard provided 4,416 resource hours—or about 94 percent of its target. Since 2011, though, the Coast Guard has reduced the number of maritime patrol aircraft hours that it has provided to JIATF-S. Coast Guard officials attributed this reduction to a smaller HC-130 fleet size and maintenance needs, including modifications to extend the HC-130s’ airframe life. In fiscal year 2013, the Coast Guard provided 3,506 maritime patrol aircraft resource hours— roughly 75 percent of its targeted level. Airborne use of force: The Coast Guard measures its deployment of AUF to JIATF-S in the number of days AUF-capable helicopters are deployed under JIATF-S tactical control. Coast Guard data show the Coast Guard increased its AUF deployments to JIATF-S during fiscal years 2009 through 2012, before declining in 2013, while remaining below target levels. Specifically, the Coast Guard’s AUF deployments increased from 1,030 days in 2009 to 1,232 days in fiscal years 2012, before declining to 1,169 days in fiscal year 2013. According to Coast Guard data, in fiscal year 2013, the Coast Guard’s AUF deployment target was 1,460 days and the Coast Guard provided 1,169 days—approximately 80 percent of its AUF days target goal. Figure 5 shows the AUF deployment day targets compared with actual AUF days provided to JIATF-S during fiscal years 2009 through 2013. Beyond vessels and aircraft, the Coast Guard provides JIATF-S with LEDETs—specially trained personnel who deploy primarily aboard U.S. Navy and allied vessels to conduct maritime law enforcement operations such as boarding suspect vessels and taking custody of suspected drug smugglers in the transit zone. The Coast Guard is the only JIATF-S resource provider that has law enforcement authority and LEDET personnel deployed in maritime areas far from U.S. waters. By deploying LEDETs on Navy and allied vessels, JIATF-S increases the resources it has available for apprehending suspected drug smugglers, their contraband, and their vessels. According to Coast Guard data, and as shown in figure 6, the Coast Guard’s deployment of LEDETs to JIATF-S (as measured in days) varied from fiscal years 2009 through 2013, but experienced an overall decline during this time period. The Coast Guard has not met its LEDET allocation target levels to JIATF-S since establishing targets in fiscal year 2010. The Coast Guard provided its lowest LEDET allocation to JIATF-S in fiscal year 2013, when it provided 895 days, or just under half of its targeted level of 1,825 days. According to Coast Guard officials, the Coast Guard’s ability to deploy LEDETs to JIATF-S is largely dependent on the availability of Navy and allied vessels, as discussed later in this report. The Coast Guard has generally not met targets for its primary drug interdiction performance measure—removal rate for cocaine from noncommercial vessels in the maritime transit zone. According to Coast Guard officials, this measure focuses on transit zone drug operations because the Coast Guard’s drug interdiction mission priority is removing illicit drugs as close to their origins in South America and as far from U.S. shores as possible, where drug shipments are in their most concentrated bulk form. The measure assesses the percentage of cocaine directly seized or observed being jettisoned, scuttled, or destroyed as a result of Coast Guard actions relative to the total known flow of cocaine through the transit zone using noncommercial maritime vessels, as estimated in the CCDB. According to Coast Guard data, since establishing performance targets for this measure in fiscal year 2009, the Coast Guard met its target in 1 year—fiscal year 2013.Coast Guard reported a cocaine removal rate of 15.3 percent in the transit zone, exceeding its performance target rate of 14.1 percent. Figure 7 shows the Coast Guard’s performance in meeting this primary drug interdiction performance measure from fiscal years 2009 through 2013. The Coast Guard is supporting a DHS-wide effort to combat the growing level of violence associated with drug trafficking in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Specifically, in September 2012, DHS implemented Operation Caribbean Guard to address violence and drug trafficking into The Coast Guard’s and within Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.role in this DHS-wide effort has been to increase vessel and aircraft operations to interdict the flow of drugs being trafficked by noncommercial maritime vessels toward the islands. Since September 2012, the Coast Guard’s Seventh District has implemented a surge operation, known as Operation Unified Resolve, which has provided Sector San Juan—the Coast Guard field unit whose area of responsibility includes Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands—with additional vessels and aircraft to regularly patrol Puerto Rico and the eastern approaches of the U.S. Virgin Islands. Operation Unified Resolve initially began as a surge operation, but in October 2013, the Coast Guard made the surge operation a standing operation—and, according to Coast Guard officials, established a new baseline for drug interdiction operations in support of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Under Operation Unified Resolve, the Coast Guard has placed special emphasis on targeting the primary and secondary flow of illicit drugs from South America to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. According to Sector San Juan officials, a key challenge for the Coast Guard is the relatively short distance between the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico. For example, officials noted that it would take approximately 4 hours for a go-fast vessel to transit the 70 to 80 miles between the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico. Coast Guard officials reported that this places a premium on the need for good intelligence on potential drug-smuggling vessels and the effective placement of assets to interdict them. According to Coast Guard officials, the Coast Guard’s decision to provide additional resources to Sector San Juan resulted from Coast Guard analyses that found Sector San Juan lacked sufficient vessels and aircraft to reduce maritime drug smuggling into Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. For example, according to an August 2012 Coast Guard memorandum, Sector San Juan’s fleet of vessels faced readiness concerns and lacked the capability to effectively conduct operations against the primary drug flow of go-fast boats smuggling illicit drugs from South America into Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Further, the memorandum notes that the Coast Guard did not have maritime patrol aircraft permanently assigned to the territories. According to the memorandum, the only permanently assigned Coast Guard aircraft in Puerto Rico were helicopters based in the northwest corner of the island and their endurance and position made them impractical for patrolling the eastern approaches to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Coast Guard officials reported that the Coast Guard has not received additional resources to support Operation Unified Resolve. Rather, to implement the operation, the Coast Guard reported that it supplemented its annual allocation of vessels and aircraft to Sector San Juan by reallocating medium endurance cutters and maritime patrol aircraft to Puerto Rico from other locations within the Coast Guard—largely from the Coast Guard’s Seventh District. According to Coast Guard officials, these vessels and aircraft, in general, had previously been allocated for alien migrant interdiction operations. As noted earlier and as further described in appendix I, the Coast Guard’s process for allocating drug interdiction resources is focused on meeting commitments for strategic priorities, such as JIATF-S transit zone operations, first, before dividing up its remaining resources among its field locations such as Sector San Juan. In this way, the Coast Guard reported that the additional resources provided for Operation Unified Resolve did not come at the expense of its JIATF-S deployments. Beyond Operation Unified Resolve, the Coast Guard is scheduled to modernize Sector San Juan’s vessel fleet. According to Coast Guard officials, during fiscal years 2015 and 2016, the Coast Guard plans to replace Sector San Juan’s six 110-foot patrol boats with six new 154-foot fast response cutters (FRC). According to Coast Guard officials, the FRCs’ impact on the drug interdiction mission will be significant, as the FRC is expected to provide (1) increased interdiction capabilities; (2) improved sea keeping; (3) greater endurance; (4) the ability to deploy a pursuit-capable small boat; (5) improved weapons systems; and (6) improved command, control, and communications systems. Coast Guard officials reported that Sector San Juan would accommodate a mix of the new FRCs and 110-foot patrol boats until the 110-foot patrol boats are phased out by the end of fiscal year 2016. According to senior officials from Sector San Juan, the additional resources Sector San Juan is utilizing for Operation Unified Resolve, along with the scheduled arrival of the six FRCs by the end of 2016, will put Sector San Juan in a better position to meet its mission needs. According to Coast Guard data, the total amount of vessel hours in support of drug interdiction operations in the Sector San Juan area of responsibility more than tripled in recent years—from 2,051 hours in fiscal year 2009 to 6,839 hours in fiscal year 2013. According to the data, much of the increase in vessel drug interdiction operational hours occurred from fiscal years 2012 through 2013, when the Coast Guard was implementing Operation Unified Resolve. Coast Guard data show that medium endurance cutters accounted for a rising share of the drug interdiction vessel operational hours, increasing from 3 percent in fiscal year 2011 to 28 percent in fiscal year 2013. In fiscal year 2013, drug interdiction operations accounted for 40 percent of reported medium endurance cutter and patrol boat hours in the Sector San Juan area of responsibility.operational hours in support of the drug interdiction mission has risen since 2009 in response to increased drug-smuggling events and the additional resources provided for Operation Unified Resolve beginning in late fiscal year 2012. According to Coast Guard officials, the number of vessel Figure 8 shows the total vessel hours (major cutter and patrol boat hours) the Coast Guard reported for conducting drug interdiction operations in the Sector San Juan area of responsibility during fiscal years 2009 through 2013, as well as, the relative share of the vessel hours provided by Sector San Juan and other Coast Guard locations. According to Coast Guard data, maritime patrol aircraft resource hours reported for drug interdiction operations in the Sector San Juan area of responsibility declined during fiscal years 2009 through 2011, before increasing considerably in fiscal years 2012 and 2013. For example, in fiscal year 2011, the Coast Guard reported conducting 148 flight hours patrolling Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and this number more than tripled to 502 hours in fiscal year 2012 before doubling to 1,000 hours in fiscal year 2013. The Coast Guard attributes this considerable increase of flight hours in recent years to increased aircraft provided in support of Operation Unified Resolve. Since implementing Operation Unified Resolve in September 2012, the Coast Guard has conducted surveillance patrols of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands using maritime patrol aircraft and crews forward deployed from Coast Guard field locations in the continental United States. Figure 9 shows the Coast Guard’s maritime patrol aircraft hours in support of drug interdiction operations in the Sector San Juan area of responsibility during fiscal years 2009 through 2013. Coast Guard officials reported that the additional resources the Coast Guard provided for Operation Unified Resolve have led to increasing interdictions of illicit drugs being smuggled in and around Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. According to Coast Guard officials, as of March 25, 2014, Operation Unified Resolve had led to the removal of 32,669 kilograms of cocaine and roughly 11,000 pounds of marijuana. Further, Coast Guard officials reported that since deploying additional vessels and aircraft for Operation Unified Resolve in September 2012, the Coast Guard found the estimated primary flow of cocaine into Puerto Rico to be considerably higher than previously thought. For example, according to CCDB data provided by the Coast Guard, the estimated noncommercial maritime primary flow of cocaine toward Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands more than doubled, from 7.1 metric tons in fiscal year 2012 to 14.9 metric tons in fiscal year 2013.and secondary noncommercial maritime drug flow toward Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands during fiscal years 2009 through 2013.

Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. Staff acknowledgments are provided in appendix III. This appendix provides a summary of the Coast Guard’s process for allocating vessels, aircraft, and other resources for its drug interdiction mission. The Coast Guard’s process for allocating drug interdiction resources is focused on meeting commitments for strategic priorities, including for the Joint Interagency Task Force South (JIATF-S)—a reporting unit of the Department of Defense’s Southern Command that oversees detection and monitoring operations of drug-smuggling events in the transit zone. The Coast Guard allocates drug interdiction resources for these strategic priorities, first, before dividing up its remaining resources among its Atlantic and Pacific Area Commands for further allocation to Coast Guard districts and sectors across the United States. The Coast Guard determines the targets for the amount of time selected vessels, aircraft, and law enforcement detachments (LEDET) are provided to JIATF-S for transit zone operations—through an annual operational planning process that considers factors including resource requirements for strategic priorities, evolving maritime risks, and the availability of vessels and aircraft. Through this process, the Coast Guard reviews JIATF-S resource requests and sets resource targets. The Coast Guard then allocates the remaining resources among its field locations across the United States for implementing 11 missions, including drug interdiction. In general, the Coast Guard’s annual drug interdiction resource allocation planning process includes four steps. First, JIATF-S submits its resource allocation requirements for meeting National Drug Control Strategy targets to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of Defense as directed by the National Interdiction Command and Control Plan. These requirements specify the capabilities (types of vessels or aircraft) and corresponding capacities (number of days for vessels or resource hours for aircraft). The DHS Office of Policy’s Counter Illicit Trafficking Section communicates the resource requests to the Coast Guard with resource hour requests for Coast Guard cutters, boats, aircraft, and LEDETs. Second, Coast Guard planners determine the amount of resources that the Coast Guard intends to provide in the upcoming fiscal year. The Coast Guard considers its support for JIATF-S drug interdiction operations as one of three strategic commitment priorities. In this way, Coast Guard planners determine the number of vessel days and aircraft hours to provide to JIATF-S before allocating remaining vessels and aircraft to its field locations across the United States for other missions (as described in more detail below). The Coast Guard determines its JIATF-S resource targets based on various factors, including strategic priority and resource availability. Third, the Coast Guard provides its JIATF-S resource target—or Statement of Intent—to the DHS Office of Counter Illicit Trafficking, which liaises with JIATF-S and the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP). The Statement of Intent details target levels of resources the Coast Guard intends to provide to JIATF-S for the next fiscal year. The Statement of Intent outlines asset availability level targets for major cutters, maritime patrol aircraft, and other resources, such as deployable forces. DHS then combines the Coast Guard Statement of Intent with those of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and submits an overall DHS Statement of Intent to ONDCP and JIATF-S. Fourth, after allocating resources for JIATF-S and other strategic commitments, the Coast Guard divides its remaining resource hours for vessels and aircraft between its Pacific and Atlantic Area Commands. Coast Guard officials reported that the Coast Guard’s field units use a greater variety of vessels for coastal drug interdiction operations than provided to JIATF-S. These generally include the 110-foot patrol boats in addition to a variety of smaller boats. For example, whereas the Coast Guard generally provides major cutters to JIATF-S, field units rely on a greater variety of smaller vessels to conduct coastal drug interdiction operations because the missions are conducted much closer to shore than are JIATF-S operations. Outside of JIATF-S, the Coast Guard’s Seventh District (headquartered in Miami, Florida, and having responsibility for the Caribbean area including Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands) and Eleventh District (headquartered in Alameda, California, and having responsibility for the Eastern Pacific area, including coastal areas from the U.S.-Mexico border to South America) have accounted for the largest shares of the Coast Guard’s drug interdiction resource hours. According to Coast Guard officials, these districts’ areas of responsibility include high drug-trafficking areas, and therefore drug interdiction accounts for a larger mission focus than at other Coast Guard districts. From fiscal years 2009 through 2013, the Coast Guard’s budget included about $1.2 billion per year for its drug interdiction mission. This mission accounted for between 10 and 12 percent of the Coast Guard’s budget during this time. The Coast Guard reported, based on the enacted fiscal year 2014 budget, that its fiscal year 2014 estimate to perform the drug interdiction mission is $1,305,271,000. Figure 10 shows the flow of the Coast Guard drug interdiction resource allocation process. This appendix identifies and describes the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) component agencies involved in Operation Caribbean Guard. In September 2012, DHS implemented Operation Caribbean Guard to intercept illegal weapons, drugs, and money flowing to and from Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Operation Caribbean Guard is a DHS-wide surge effort involving multiple component agencies. Table 2 identifies DHS component agencies involved in Operation Caribbean Guard and reported examples of actions they have taken. In addition to the contact named above, Christopher Conrad (Assistant Director), Jason Berman, Michele Fejfar, Eric Hauswirth, Susan Hsu, Tracey King, and Lerone Reid made key contributions to this report.

Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, the only U.S. territories located geographically within the transit zone, have served as entry points for cocaine destined for the continental United States. In recent years, federal and local government agencies have cited growing levels of violent crime in these territories and attribute this violence to illicit drug trafficking. Within DHS, the U.S. Coast Guard is the lead federal agency for maritime drug interdiction and a key provider of resources to support drug interdiction operations in the transit zone and the two territories. GAO was asked to examine the Coast Guard's drug interdiction efforts in the transit zone, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. This report addresses (1) trends in the Coast Guard's deployment of resources in the transit zone and the extent to which the Coast Guard met its performance targets; and (2) actions taken by the Coast Guard to combat drug smuggling into Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and trends in vessel and aircraft deployments. GAO analyzed Coast Guard data for fiscal years 2009 through 2013 on drug interdiction resource deployments and mission performance, and interviewed Coast Guard and DHS officials involved in drug interdiction operations. The Coast Guard provided varying levels of resources for drug interdiction operations in the “transit zone”—the area from South America through the Caribbean Sea and the eastern Pacific Ocean that is used to transport illicit drugs to the United States—during fiscal years 2009 through 2013, and generally did not meet its performance targets for several reasons. As the figure shows, Coast Guard resources included vessels (cutters), aircraft, and law enforcement detachments. The number of cutter days, aircraft hours, and law enforcement detachment days the Coast Guard provided for drug interdiction operations in the transit zone varied during fiscal years 2009 through 2012, and then sharply declined in fiscal year 2013. For example, in fiscal year 2012, the Coast Guard provided 1,947 cutter days for transit zone operations and in fiscal year 2013 the Coast Guard provided 1,346 days—a 30 percent decline. During fiscal years 2009 through 2013, the Coast Guard met targets for its primary drug interdiction mission performance measure—the removal rate of cocaine from noncommercial vessels in the transit zone—once, in fiscal year 2013. Coast Guard officials cited the declining readiness of its aging vessels, delays in the delivery of replacement vessels, and sequestration as factors affecting Coast Guard resource deployments and the ability to meet its drug interdiction mission performance targets. In support of a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) effort to address the increased violent crime associated with illicit drug smuggling into Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, the Coast Guard has increased vessel and aircraft operations for drug interdiction efforts in these territories by reallocating resources from elsewhere in the Coast Guard. According to Coast Guard officials, these additional resources are drawn from other missions, such as alien migrant interdiction. Beginning in September 2012, the Coast Guard implemented a surge operation to provide additional vessels and aircraft to regularly patrol Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. According to Coast Guard officials, the increased vessel and aircraft deployments have since become the new baseline level of resources to be provided for drug interdiction operations there. According to Coast Guard data, the number of vessel hours spent conducting drug interdiction operations in these territories more than tripled from fiscal years 2009 through 2013. Similarly, the number of maritime patrol aircraft hours spent conducting drug interdiction operations in the territories increased—from about 150 flight hours in fiscal year 2011 to about 1,000 hours in fiscal year 2013. GAO is not making recommendations in this report. DHS provided technical comments on a draft of this report, which were incorporated, as appropriate."}

Our review of IRS tax records showed that over 1.6 million businesses owed over $58 billion in unpaid payroll taxes to the federal government as of September 30, 2007, and over 100,000 businesses currently owe for more than 2 years (8 quarters) of payroll taxes. This total includes amounts earned by employees that were withheld from their salaries to satisfy their tax obligations, as well as the employer’s matching amounts, but which the business diverted for other purposes. Many of these businesses repeatedly failed to remit amounts withheld from employees’ salaries. For example, 70 percent of all unpaid payroll taxes are owed by businesses with more than a year (4 tax quarters) of unpaid payroll taxes, and over a quarter of unpaid payroll taxes are owed by businesses that have tax debt for more than 3 years (12 tax quarters). Figure 1 shows the total dollar amount of payroll tax debt summarized by the number of unpaid payroll tax quarters outstanding. Using IRS’s database of unpaid taxes, we were able to identify many of the industry types associated with businesses owing payroll taxes. The top industries with unpaid payroll tax debt included construction ($8.6 billion), professional services ($4.4 billion), and healthcare ($4 billion). When businesses fail to remit taxes withheld from employees’ salaries, the payroll tax receipts are less than the payroll taxes due, and the Social Security and Hospital Insurance Trust Funds have fewer financial resources available to cover current and future benefit payments. However, the trust funds are funded based on wage estimates and not actual payroll tax collections. Therefore, the General Fund transfers to the trust funds amounts that should be collected but are not necessarily collected, resulting in the General Fund subsidizing the trust funds for amounts IRS is unable to collect in payroll taxes from employers. As of November 1, 2007, IRS estimated that the amount of unpaid taxes and interest attributable to Social Security and Hospital Insurance taxes in IRS’s $282 billion unpaid assessments balance was approximately $44 billion. This estimate represents a snapshot of the amount that needed to be provided to the Social Security and Hospital Insurance Trust Funds based on the outstanding payroll tax debt on IRS’s books at the time. It does not include an estimate for tax debts that have been written off of IRS’s tax records in previous years because of the expiration of the statutory collection period. Recent IRS data indicate that the cumulative shortfall increases by an additional $2 billion to $4 billion annually because of uncollected payroll taxes. Although IRS has taken a number of steps to improve collections by prioritizing cases with better potential for collectibility, the collection of payroll taxes remains a significant problem for IRS. From 1998, when we performed our last in-depth review of payroll taxes, to September 2007, we found that while the number of businesses with payroll tax debt decreased from 1.8 million to 1.6 million, the balance of outstanding payroll taxes in IRS’s inventory of tax debt increased from about $49 billion to $58 billion. Our analysis of the unpaid payroll tax inventory shows that the number of businesses with more than 20 quarters of tax debt (5 years of unpaid payroll tax debt) almost doubled between 1998 and 2007. The number of businesses that had not paid payroll taxes for over 40 quarters (10 years or more) also almost doubled, from 86 businesses to 169 businesses. These figures are shown in table 1. Of the $58 billion in unpaid payroll taxes as of September 30, 2007, IRS categorized about $4 billion (7 percent) as going through IRS’s initial notification process. Because IRS has made the collection of payroll taxes one of its highest priorities, once a case completes the notification process, it is generally sent to IRS’s field collections staff for face-to-face collection action. However, IRS does not have sufficient resources to immediately begin collection actions against all of its high-priority cases. As a result, IRS holds a large number of cases in a queue awaiting assignment to a revenue officer in the field. About $7 billion (12 percent) of the unpaid payroll tax amount was being worked on by IRS revenue officers for collection, and about $9 billion (16 percent) was in a queue awaiting assignment for collection action. Most of the unpaid payroll tax inventory—$30 billion (52 percent)—was classified as currently uncollectible by IRS. IRS classifies tax debt cases as currently not collectible for several reasons, including (1) the business owing the taxes is defunct, (2) the business is insolvent after bankruptcy, or (3) the business is experiencing financial hardship. Of those unpaid payroll tax cases IRS has classified as currently not collectible, almost 70 percent were as a result of a business being defunct. Much of the unpaid payroll tax debt has been outstanding for several years. As reflected in figure 2, our analysis of IRS records shows that over 60 percent of the unpaid payroll taxes was owed for tax periods from 2002 and prior years. Prompt collection action is vital because, as our previous work has shown, as unpaid taxes age, the likelihood of collecting all or a portion of the amount owed decreases. Further, the continued accrual of interest and penalties on the outstanding federal taxes can, over time, eclipse the original tax obligation. Additionally, as discussed previously, IRS is statutorily limited in the length of time it has to collect unpaid taxes— generally 10 years from the date the tax debt is assessed. Once that statutory period expires, IRS can no longer attempt to collect the tax. IRS records indicate that over $4 billion of unpaid payroll taxes will expire in each of the next several years because of the expiration of their statutory collection period. Our audit of payroll tax cases identified several issues that adversely affect IRS’s ability to prevent the accumulation of unpaid payroll taxes and to collect these taxes. Foremost is that IRS’s approach focuses on getting businesses—even those with dozens of quarters of payroll tax debt—to voluntarily comply. We found that IRS often either did not use certain collection tools, such as liens or TFRPs, or did not use them timely, and that IRS’s approach does not treat the business’s unpaid payroll taxes and responsible party’s penalty assessments as a single collection effort. Additionally, although unpaid payroll taxes is one of its top collection priorities, IRS did not have performance measures to evaluate the collection of unpaid payroll taxes or the related TFRP assessments. Finally, we found some state revenue agencies are using tools to collect or prevent the further accumulation of unpaid taxes that IRS is either legally precluded from using or that it has not yet developed. We have previously reported that IRS subordinates the use of some of its collection tools in order to seek voluntary compliance and that IRS’s repeated attempts to gain voluntary compliance often results in minimal or no actual collections. Our audit of businesses with payroll tax debt and our analysis of businesses with multiple quarters of unpaid payroll taxes again found revenue officers continuing to work with a business to gain voluntary compliance while the business continued to accumulate unpaid payroll taxes. For example, our analysis of IRS’s inventory of unpaid payroll taxes found that over 10,000 businesses owed payroll taxes for 20 or more quarters—5 years or more. Failing to take more aggressive collection actions against businesses that repeatedly fail to remit payroll taxes has a broader impact than on just a single business. If left to accumulate unpaid payroll taxes, businesses can gain an unfair business advantage over their competitors at the expense of the government. As we have found previously, in at least one of our case study businesses, IRS determined that the non-compliant business obtained contracts through its ability to undercut competitors in part because the business’s reduced costs associated with its non-payment of payroll taxes. Similarly, in another case the revenue officer noted that the business was underbidding on contracts and was using unpaid payroll taxes to offset the business’s losses. Failure to take prompt actions to prevent the further accumulation of unpaid payroll taxes can also have a detrimental impact on the business and the associated owners/officers. As we have reported in the past, non- compliant businesses can accumulate substantial unpaid taxes as well as associated interest and penalties. Over time, these unpaid balances may compound beyond the business’s ability to pay—ultimately placing the business and responsible officers in greater financial jeopardy. IRS is legally precluded from taking collection actions during certain periods, such as when a tax debtor is involved in bankruptcy proceedings. During those periods, even though IRS may not be able to take collection actions, tax debtors may continue to accumulate additional tax debt. However, IRS’s focus on voluntary compliance has negatively affected IRS’s collection efforts for years. Our current findings on IRS’s focus on voluntary compliance are similar to those of a study performed by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) 8 years ago. In that study, TIGTA found that revenue officers were focused on IRS’s customer service goals and therefore were reluctant to take enforcement actions. In another study performed 3 years ago, TIGTA reported that IRS allowed tax debtors to continue to delay taking action on their tax debt by failing to take aggressive collection actions. TIGTA found that IRS did not take timely follow-up action in half of the cases for which tax debtors missed specific deadlines. One official from a state taxing authority told us that the state benefited from IRS’s approach because it allowed the state to collect its unpaid taxes from business tax debtors before IRS. In one of our case study businesses, although IRS successfully levied some financial assets, a mortgage holder and state and local officials seized the business’s assets to satisfy the business’s debts. IRS has recently strengthened its procedures to include some specific steps for dealing with businesses that repeatedly fail to remit payroll taxes and to stress the importance of preventing the further accumulation of such payroll taxes. We found that for payroll tax debt, one of IRS’s highest collection priorities, IRS does not always file tax liens to protect the government’s interest in property, and when IRS does so, it does not always do so timely. Our analysis of IRS’s inventory of unpaid payroll taxes as of September 30, 2007, found that IRS had not filed liens on over one-third of all businesses with payroll tax debt cases assigned to the field for collection efforts—over 140,000 businesses. IRS guidance states that filing a lien is extremely important to protect the interests of the federal government, creditors, and taxpayers in general, and that the failure to file and properly record a federal tax lien may jeopardize the federal government’s priority right against other creditors. A 2005 IRS study of TFRP cases found that cases where a lien had been filed had more average payments—about a third more—than where a lien had not been filed. Failure to file a lien can have a negative impact on tax collections. For example, IRS assessed the business owner in one of our case studies a TFRP to hold the owner personally liable for the withheld payroll taxes owed by the business. However, IRS did not assign the assessment to a revenue officer for collection and thus did not file a lien on the owner’s property. Because there was no lien filed, the owner was able to sell a vacation home in Florida, and IRS did not collect any of the unpaid taxes from the proceeds of the sale. As in the case above, IRS’s case assignment policy can delay the filing of liens for payroll tax cases. Because payroll tax cases are one of IRS’s top collection priorities, once the notification process is complete, IRS routes these cases to revenue officers for face-to-face collection action instead of being routed to the Automated Collection System (ACS) for telephone contact. However, IRS generally places cases in a queue of cases awaiting assignment until a revenue officer is available to work the cases. Cases can be in the queue for extended periods of time awaiting assignment to a revenue officer. For the period that a case is in the queue, revenue officers are not assigned to file liens and take other collection actions. Our analysis found that for all payroll tax cases in the queue awaiting assignment as of September 30, 2007, over 80 percent did not have a lien filed. As a result, lower priority tax cases that go through the ACS process may have liens filed faster than the higher priority payroll tax cases. IRS has a powerful tool to hold responsible owners and officers personally liable for unpaid payroll taxes through assessing a TFRP. However, we found that IRS often takes a long time to determine whether to hold the owners/officers of businesses personally liable and, once the decision is made, to actually assess penalties against them for the taxes. In reviewing a sample of TFRP assessments selected as part of our audit of IRS’s fiscal year 2007 financial statements, we found that from the time the tax debt was assessed against the business, IRS took over 2 years, on average, to assess a TFRP against the business owners/officers. We found that revenue officers, once assigned to a payroll tax case, took an average of over 40 weeks to decide whether to pursue a TFRP against business owners/officers and an additional 40 weeks on average to formally assess the TFRP. For 5 of the 76 sampled cases, we found that IRS took over 4 years to assess the TFRP. We did not attempt to identify how frequently IRS assesses a TFRP against responsible owners/officers. However, in TIGTA’s 2005 report on its review of IRS’s collection field function, it noted that revenue officers did not begin the TFRP process in over a quarter of the cases it reviewed. The timely assessment of TFRPs is an important tool in IRS’s ability to prevent the continued accumulation of unpaid payroll taxes and to collect these taxes. Once a TFRP is assessed, IRS can take action against both the owners/officers and the business to collect the withheld taxes. For egregious cases, such as some of those in our case studies, taking strong collection actions against the owners’ personal assets may be the best way to either get the business to become tax compliant or to convince the owners to close the non-compliant business, thus preventing the further accumulation of unpaid taxes. Failure to timely assess a TFRP can result in businesses continuing to accumulate unpaid payroll taxes and lost opportunities to collect these taxes from the owners/officers of the businesses. For example, one business we reviewed had tax debt from 2000, but IRS did not assess a TFRP against the business’s owner until the end of 2004. In the meantime, the owner was drawing an annual salary of about $300,000 and had sold property valued at over $800,000. Within 1 month of IRS’s assessing the TFRP, the owner closed the business, which by then had accumulated about $3 million in unpaid taxes. In September 2007, IRS implemented new requirements to address the timeliness of TFRP assessments. Under the new policy, IRS is now requiring revenue officers to make the determination on whether to pursue a TFRP within 120 days of the case’s being assigned and to complete the assessment within 120 days of the determination. However, the revised policy maintains a provision that allows the revenue officer to delay the TFRP determination. Additionally, the policy does not include a requirement for IRS to monitor the new standards for assessing TFRPs. IRS assigns a higher priority to collection efforts against the business with unpaid payroll taxes than against the business’s responsible owners/officers. Further, it treats the TFRP assessments as a separate collection effort unrelated to the business tax debt, even though the business payroll tax liabilities and the TFRP assessments are essentially the same tax debt. As a result, once the revenue officer assigned to the business payroll tax case decides to pursue a TFRP against the responsible owners/officers, the TFRP case does not automatically remain with this revenue officer. Accordingly, IRS often does not assign the TFRP assessment to a revenue officer for collection, and when it does, it may not assign it to the same revenue officer who is responsible for collecting unpaid taxes from the business. In reviewing the sample of TFRP assessments selected as part of our audit of IRS’s fiscal year 2007 financial statements, we found that half of the TFRP assessments had not been assigned to a revenue officer by the time of our audit. Of those that had been assigned, over half of the TFRP assessments had not been assigned to the same revenue officer who was working the related business case. Assigning the collection efforts against the business and the TFRP assessments to different revenue officers can result in the responsible owners/officers being able to continue to use the business to fund a personal lifestyle while not remitting payroll taxes. For example, in one of our case studies the owner was assessed a TFRP, but continued to draw a six-figure income while not remitting amounts withheld from the salaries of the business’s employees. For egregious cases, taking strong collection actions against the owner’s personal assets may be a more effective means of either getting the business to be compliant or convincing the owner to close the non-compliant business to prevent the further accumulation of unpaid payroll taxes. IRS collection officials stated that attempting to assign the same revenue officer both the TFRP assessments and the business payroll tax case for collection would overload the revenue officers with work and result in fewer high-priority payroll tax cases being worked. This view, however, stems from separating the collection efforts of the business and the individual and not considering the business’s unpaid payroll taxes and the TFRP assessment as a single case. In essence, the TFRP assessment is the same tax debt as the business’s payroll tax debt; the assessment is merely another means through which IRS can attempt to collect the monies withheld from a business’s employees for income, Social Security, and Hospital Insurance taxes that were not remitted to the government. This view that the payroll tax debt and the TFRP assessment are essentially the same tax debt is reinforced by IRS’s practice of crediting all related parties’ accounts whenever a collection is made against either assessment. Prior studies have found that IRS’s practice of assigning TFRP assessments a lower priority than business cases has not been very successful for collecting the unpaid taxes. In its own 2005 study of TFRP cases, IRS reported that it had assessed over $11.9 billion in TFRP assessments (including interest) between 1996 and 2004, yet had collected only 8 percent of those assessments. IRS policies have not resulted in effective steps being taken against egregious businesses to prevent the further accumulation of unpaid payroll taxes. Our audit found thousands of businesses that had accumulated more than a dozen tax quarters of unpaid payroll tax debt. IRS policies state that revenue officers must stop businesses from accumulating payroll tax debt and instructs revenue officers to use all appropriate remedies to bring the tax debtor into compliance and to immediately stop any further accumulation of unpaid taxes. IRS policies further state that if routine case actions have not stopped the continued accumulation of unpaid payroll taxes, revenue officers should consider seizing the business’s assets or pursuing a TFRP against the responsible parties. However, IRS successfully pursued fewer than 700 seizure actions in fiscal year 2007. We were unable to determine how many of those seizure actions were taken against payroll tax debtors. Regarding TFRPs, as discussed previously, IRS does not always assess the TFRPs timely, and IRS does not prioritize the TFRP assessment against the owner as highly as it does the unpaid payroll taxes of the business. This can result in little collection action being taken against the parties responsible for the failure to remit the withheld payroll taxes. When a business repeatedly fails to comply after attempts to collect, IRS policies state that the business should be considered an egregious offender and IRS should take aggressive collection actions, including threats of legal action that can culminate in court-ordered injunctions for the business to stop accumulating unpaid payroll taxes or face closure. However, IRS obtained less than 10 injunctions in fiscal year 2007 to stop businesses from accumulating additional payroll taxes. Revenue officers we spoke to believe the injunctive relief process to be too cumbersome to use effectively in its present form. One revenue officer stated that because of the difficulty in carrying out the administrative and judicial process to close a business through injunctive relief, he had not attempted to take such action in over a decade. IRS is taking some action to attempt to address this issue by piloting a Streamline Injunctive Relief Team to identify cases and develop procedures to quickly move a case from administrative procedures to judicial actions. These procedures will be used for the most egregious taxpayers when the revenue officer can establish that additional administrative procedures would be futile. Similar to IRS, all of the state tax collection officials we contacted told us that their revenue department’s primary goal was to prevent businesses from continuing to flaunt tax laws and to stop them from accumulating additional tax debt. These officials said that after a business had been given a period of time to comply with its current tax obligations and begin paying past taxes, state tax collection officials changed their focus to one of “stopping the bleeding.” As such, some have made the policy decision to seek to close non-compliant businesses. To the extent IRS is not taking effective steps to deal with egregious payroll tax offenders that repeatedly fail to comply with the tax laws, businesses may continue to withhold taxes from employees’ salaries but divert the funds for other purposes. Although IRS has made the collection of unpaid payroll taxes one of its top priorities, IRS has not established goals or measures to assess its progress in collecting or preventing the accumulation of payroll tax debt. Performance measurement and monitoring, however, support resource allocation and other policy decisions to improve an agency’s operations and the effectiveness of its approach. Performance monitoring can also help an agency by measuring the level of activity (process), the number of actions taken (outputs), or the results of the actions taken (outcomes). Although IRS does have a broad array of operational management information available to it, we did not identify any specific performance measures associated with payroll taxes or TFRP assessments. While IRS has caseload and other workload reports for local managers (to measure process and outputs), these localized reports are not rolled up to a national level to allow IRS managers to monitor the effectiveness or efficiency of its collection and enforcement efforts. These operational reports do contain information about unpaid payroll and TFRP case assignments, but they are used primarily to monitor workload issues, not program effectiveness. For example, IRS has developed some reports that identify “over-aged” cases (those that have not been resolved within a certain length of time) and that identify businesses that continue to accrue additional payroll tax debt, but these reports are designed for workload management. To report on its outcomes or the effectiveness of its operations, IRS reports on overall collection statistics and presents that information in the Management Discussion and Analysis section of its annual financial statement and in its IRS Data Book. However, IRS does not specifically address unpaid payroll taxes as a part of this reporting. IRS officials stated that they do not have specific lower-level performance measures that target collection actions or collection results for unpaid payroll taxes or TFRP assessments. Such performance measures could be useful to serve as an early warning system to management or as a vehicle for improving IRS’s approach or actions. In our discussions with IRS revenue officers concerning some of the egregious payroll tax offenders included in our case studies, the officers noted that having certain additional tools available to them could allow them to more effectively deal with recalcitrant businesses. In discussions with a number of state tax collection officials, we found that several states had already developed and were effectively using the types of tools IRS revenue officers said would be beneficial to them. For example, while the Internal Revenue Code prohibits IRS from publicly disclosing federal tax information without taxpayer consent,an increasing number of states—at least 19, including New Jersey, Connecticut, Indiana, Louisiana, and California—are seeking to increase tax collections by publicizing the names of those with delinquent tax bills. In California, a recent law mandates the state to annually publish the names of the top 250 personal and corporate state tax debtors with at least $100,000 in state tax debt. Public disclosure of tax debtors can be very effective. Just threatening to publish the names of tax offenders can bring some into compliance, while actually appearing on a tax offender list can bring about societal pressure to comply. In California, 26 tax debtors threatened with public disclosure stepped forward to settle their tax debts and thus avoided appearing on the list; in Connecticut, the state claims the public disclosure of tax debtors has resulted in over $100 million in collections from the first 4 years of the program. The potential public disclosure of tax debtors may also encourage greater tax compliance among the general population of taxpayers to avoid potentially being on the list. As another example, while IRS has the authority to levy a tax debtor’s income and assets when there is a demand for payment and there has been a refusal or an inability to pay by the taxpayer subject to the levy, IRS officials stated that they often have difficulty using levies to collect unpaid payroll taxes. They noted that the levy may be made against funds in a bank account at a certain point in time when little or no funds are available. They also noted, and in our case studies we found, that IRS sometimes has difficulty identifying which banks or financial institutions a tax debtor is using. This is the case because tax debtors will often change financial institutions to avoid IRS levies. However, several states use legal authorities to assist in identifying levy sources. States such as Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Indiana, and New Jersey have enacted legislation for matching programs or entered into agreements with financial institutions to participate in matching bank account information against state tax debts. This matching allows states to more easily identify potential levy sources and simplifies the financial institution’s obligations to respond to multiple levies. IRS is working with at least one state to investigate the potential for this matching, but in our discussions with IRS collection officials they stated that IRS has not sought legislation or agreements with financial institutions. Our analysis of unpaid payroll tax debt found substantial evidence of abusive and potentially criminal activity related to the federal tax system by businesses and their owners or officers. We identified tens of thousands of businesses that filed 10 or more tax returns acknowledging that the business owed payroll taxes, yet failed to remit those taxes to the government. While much of the tax debt may be owed by those with little ability to pay, some abuse the tax system, willfully diverting amounts withheld from their employees’ salaries to fund their business operations or their own personal lifestyle. In addition to owing payroll taxes for multiple tax periods and accumulating tax debt for years, many of the owners and officers of these businesses are repeat offenders. We identified owners who were involved in multiple businesses, all of which failed to remit payroll taxes as required. In total, IRS records indicate that over 1,500 owners/officers had been found by IRS to be responsible for non-payment of payroll taxes at 3 or more businesses and that 18 business owners/officers were found by IRS to be responsible for not paying the payroll taxes for over 12 separate businesses. It should be noted that these numbers represent only those responsible individuals who IRS found acted willfully in the non-payment of the businesses’ payroll taxes and who were assessed TFRPs—these figures do not represent the total number of repeat offenders with respect to non-payment of payroll taxes. Table 2 shows the number of individuals with TFRPs for two or more businesses. Our audits and investigations of 50 case study businesses with tax debt found substantial evidence of abuse and potential criminal activity related to the tax system. All of the case studies involved businesses that had withheld taxes from their employees’ paychecks and diverted the money to fund business operations or for personal gain. Table 3 shows the results of 12 of the case studies we performed. Businesses that withhold money from their employees’ salaries are required to hold those funds in trust for the federal government. Willful failure to remit these funds is a breach of that fiduciary responsibility and is a felony offense. A business’s repeated failure to remit payroll taxes to the government over long periods of time affects far more than the collection of the unpaid taxes. First, allowing businesses to continue to not remit payroll taxes affects the general public’s perception regarding the fairness of the tax system, a perception that may result in lower overall compliance. Second, because of failure of businesses to remit payroll taxes, the burden of funding the nation’s commitments, including Social Security and Hospital Insurance Trust Fund payments, falls more heavily on taxpayers who willingly and fully pay their taxes. Third, the failure to remit payroll taxes can give the non-compliant business an unfair competitive advantage because that business can use those funds that should have been remitted for taxes to either lower overall business costs or increase profits. Businesses that fail to remit payroll taxes may also under bid tax-compliant businesses, causing them to lose business and encouraging them to also become non-compliant. Fourth, allowing businesses to continue accumulating unpaid payroll taxes has the effect of subsidizing their business operations, thus enriching tax abusers or prolonging the demise of a failing business. Fifth and last, in an era of growing federal deficits and amidst reports of an increasingly gloomy fiscal outlook, the federal government cannot afford to allow businesses to continue to accumulate unpaid payroll tax debt with little consequence. For these reasons, it is vital that IRS use the full range of its collection tools against businesses with significant payroll tax debt and have performance measures in place to monitor the effectiveness of IRS’s actions to collect and prevent the further accumulation of unpaid payroll taxes. Businesses that continue to accumulate unpaid payroll tax debt despite efforts by IRS to work with them are demonstrating that they are either unwilling or unable to comply with the tax laws. In such cases, because the decision to not file or remit payroll taxes is made by the owners or responsible officers of a business, IRS should consider strong collection action against both the business and the responsible owners or officers to prevent the further accumulation of unpaid payroll taxes and to collect those taxes for which the business and owners have a legal and fiduciary obligation to pay. IRS faces difficult challenges in balancing the use of aggressive collection actions against taxpayer rights and individuals’ livelihoods. However, to the extent IRS does not pursue aggressive collection actions against businesses with multiple quarters of unpaid payroll taxes, there is a significant concern as to whether IRS is acting in the best interests of the federal government, the employees of the businesses involved, the perceived fairness of the tax system, or overall compliance with the tax laws. Therefore, it is incumbent upon IRS to revise its approach and develop performance measures that include the appropriate use of the full range of available enforcement tools against egregious offenders to prevent their businesses from accumulating tax debt. It is also incumbent upon IRS to proactively seek out and appropriately implement other tools (particularly those with demonstrated success at the state level) to enhance IRS’s ability to prevent the further accumulation of unpaid payroll taxes and to collect those taxes that are owed. Although IRS does need to work with businesses to try to gain voluntary tax compliance, for businesses with demonstrated histories of egregious abuse of the tax system, IRS needs to alter its approach to include focusing on stopping the accumulation of additional unpaid payroll tax debt by egregious businesses. Our companion report being released today contains six recommendations to IRS to address issues regarding its ability to prevent the further accumulation of unpaid payroll taxes and collect such taxes. The recommendations include (1) developing a process and performance measures to monitor collection actions taken by revenue officers against egregious payroll tax offenders and (2) developing procedures to more timely file notice of federal tax liens against egregious businesses and assess penalties to hold responsible parties personally liable for not remitting withheld payroll taxes. Mr. Chairmen and Members of the Subcommittee, this concludes my statement. I would be pleased to answer any questions that you or other members of the committee and subcommittee have at this time.

While performing those audits, GAO noted that much of the tax abuse involved contractors not remitting to the government payroll taxes that were withheld from salaries. As a result, GAO was asked to review the Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) processes and procedures to prevent and collect unpaid payroll taxes and determine (1) the magnitude of unpaid federal payroll tax debt, (2) the factors affecting IRS's ability to enforce compliance or pursue collections, and (3) whether some businesses with unpaid payroll taxes are engaged in abusive or potentially criminal activities with regard to the federal tax system. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed IRS's tax database, performed case study analyses of payroll tax offenders, and interviewed collection officials from IRS and several states. IRS records show that, as of September 30, 2007, over 1.6 million businesses owed over $58 billion in unpaid federal payroll taxes, including interest and penalties. Some of these businesses took advantage of the existing tax enforcement and administration system to avoid fulfilling or paying federal tax obligations--thus abusing the federal tax system. Over a quarter of payroll taxes are owed by businesses with more than 3 years (12 tax quarters) of unpaid payroll taxes. Some of these business owners repeatedly accumulated tax debt from multiple businesses. For example, IRS found over 1,500 individuals to be responsible for non-payment of payroll taxes at three or more businesses, and 18 were responsible for not remitting payroll taxes for a dozen different businesses. Although IRS has powerful tools at its disposal to prevent the further accumulation of unpaid payroll taxes and to collect the taxes that are owed, IRS's current approach does not provide for their full, effective use. IRS's overall approach to collection focuses primarily on gaining voluntary compliance--even for egregious payroll tax offenders--a practice that can result in minimal or no actual collections for these offenders. Additionally, IRS has not always promptly filed liens against businesses to protect the government's interests and has not always taken timely action to hold responsible parties personally liable for unpaid payroll taxes. GAO selected 50 businesses with payroll tax debt as case studies and found extensive evidence of abuse and potential criminal activity in relation to the federal tax system.

An exception, however, is provided by Section 7652 of the Internal Revenue Code, which applies a special excise tax to items produced in PR or the USVI and shipped to the United States. The tax is equal to any excise tax that would apply to an identical item produced in one of the 50 states or the District of Columbia. The tax was first imposed to ensure that producers in the possessions would not have a tax advantage over goods produced in the United States that are subject to excise taxes. For example, rum that is produced in either the USVI or PR and that is sold in the states is subject to the same tax as rum produced in the states. Most of the revenue from the so-called equalization tax, however, is returned (\"covered over\") by the federal government to the treasuries of PR and the USVI. In addition, the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act of 1983 ( P.L. 98-67 ) provides that all revenue from federal excise taxes on rum imported into the United States from any source—including any foreign country—is remitted to the treasuries of PR and the USVI. The cover-over provisions for rum extend as far back as 1917 for PR and 1954 for the USVI. The covered-over revenue has never been designated for particular purposes by Congress. The territories have tended to dedicate some portion to fund marketing campaigns for the rum industry and general economic development. Annual cover-over revenues in FY2011 were $449.0 million for PR and $133.5 million for the USVI. In the 112 th Congress, legislation has been introduced to expand federal control over the use of covered-over revenue. Passage of H.R. 1883 (or similar legislation, S. 986 ) would result in limits on Puerto Rico's and the USVI's ability to finance economic development projects with this revenue source. The legislation is likely in response to recent economic development initiatives in the USVI financed in part by rum cover-over revenue. The congressional debate on this legislation could also lead to debate on the broader issue of the cover-over program more generally. In contrast, S. 3521 would simply extend the $13.25 cover-over through 2013. Congress initiated the principles behind the rum cover-over program for Puerto Rico under the Jones Act of 1917, even though, ironically, the same legislation prohibited the production and sale of alcohol. The act stipulated, \"providing that hereafter all taxes collected under the internal revenue laws of the United States on articles produced in Porto Rico [sic] and transported to the United States, or consumed in the island shall be covered over into the treasury of Porto Rico [sic].\" The House and Senate report language accompanying the Jones Act of 1917 both stated \"it is believed to be just and fair that it [Puerto Rico] should receive the internal-revenue taxes collected upon its products, whether those products are used in Porto Rico [sic] or produced in Porto Rico [sic] and transported to and used in the United States.\" Importantly, there is no mention of congressional intent with regard to spending of such covered-over revenue. The Revised Organic Act of 1954 (P.L. 83-517) extended the rum cover-over program to the USVI; following is the relevant legislative language: There shall be transferred and paid over to the government of the Virgin Islands from the amounts so determined a sum equal to the total amount of revenue collected by the government of the Virgin Islands during the fiscal year, as certified by the Government Comptroller of the Virgin Islands. The money so transferred and paid over shall constitute a separate fund in the treasury of the Virgin Islands and may be expended as the legislature may determine.... The next clause in the legislative language does provide that the President of the United States or his designated representative must approve of such expenditures before the cover-over revenue is obligated. In the Senate report language accompanying the Revised Organic Act of 1954, Congress expressed a desire that the USVI use the covered-over revenue to loosen the dependence of the USVI on periodic appropriations from the U.S. government. According to the report language, under a cover-over system, \"the people of the Virgin Islands would have a far greater degree of control over their finances than under the present system.\" The report continues, recommending that \"the people of the Virgin Islands bend their efforts to stimulating and increasing business in every way possible.\" Again, Congress does not outline specific uses for the covered-over revenue. That same year, two rum manufacturers began production in the USVI, Cruzan VIRAL Ltd., and Brugal. As noted earlier, the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act of 1983 ( P.L. 98-67 ) provides that all revenue from federal excise taxes on rum imported into the United States from any source—including any other foreign country—is to be remitted to the treasuries of PR and the USVI. This provision increased the amount covered over to PR by 17.0% in FY2009 and to the USVI by 7.8% in FY2011. The formula for dividing the \"other\" revenue between the USVI and PR is complicated but is roughly based on the relative market share of rum each possession produces. In the report language accompanying the act, Congress clarified that \"the bill does not impose restrictions on the uses to which the Government of the Virgin Islands or the Government of Puerto Rico may put the revenues they receive under this provision.\" The law also stipulates that the PR share of excise tax on other rum shall not exceed 87.626889% and not fall below 51%. Accordingly, the USVI share cannot drop below 12.373111% or exceed 49%. The floors are important because even if all rum production were to leave Puerto Rico or the USVI for another country, the possessions would still receive a significant share of cover-over revenue from \"other\" revenue as under the formula in P.L. 98-67 . However, if production shifts between the two possessions, the \"losing\" possession would lose all of the revenue generated by the relocated rum production. Thus, the possession losing the rum producer would be better off if the rum producer relocated outside of PR, USVI, or the United States. The Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 ( P.L. 98-369 ) placed a cap on the rebate of excise taxes on rum and other distilled spirits. The 1984 act increased the federal tax rate on spirits from $10.50 per proof-gallon to $12.50; subsequent legislation increased the rate to $13.50 per proof-gallon. The 1984 act also provided, however, that the rebate to PR and the USVI would be calculated based on prior law's $10.50 rate. In imposing the cap, Congress stated that it did not wish to expand the rebate (as would have occurred automatically with the tax-rate increase) until it had addressed the question of whether the rebates were proper, given that similar cover-overs were not made to the 50 states. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA93; P.L. 103-66 ) temporarily increased the cap to $11.30 per proof-gallon, effective for shipments of rum and distilled spirits brought into the United States during the five-year period October 1, 1993, through September 30, 1998. The increase was enacted in the context of a scaling-back by the act of the possessions tax credit. With the expiration of OBRA93's temporary increase in the rebate's cap, the limitation returned to its previous $10.50 level. The Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 ( P.L. 106-170 ) and the Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act of 2002 ( P.L. 107-147 ), however, provided temporary increases in the cap to $13.25 per proof-gallon through December 31, 2003. In conjunction with the extension of a number of other tax provisions not related to the possessions, the Working Families Tax Relief Act of 2004 ( P.L. 108-311 ) extended the $13.25 amount through 2005. The Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 ( P.L. 109-432 ) extended the $13.25 amount through 2007. On October 3, 2008, the Tax Extenders and Alternative Minimum Tax Relief Act of 2008 ( P.L. 110-343 ) extended the cover-over through the 2008 and 2009 tax years. In the 111 th Congress, the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 ( P.L. 111-312 ) extended the cover-over at $13.25 through 2011. The legislation was signed by the President on December 17, 2010, thus, the additional covered-over revenue will be remitted retroactively at the higher rate. In the 112 th Congress, legislation has been introduced to expand federal control over the use of covered-over revenue. Passage of H.R. 1883 (or similar legislation, S. 986 ) would result in limits on Puerto Rico's and the USVI's ability to use covered-over revenue to subsidize the rum industry in the islands. The legislation is likely in response to the recent economic development initiatives in the USVI financed in part by rum cover-over revenue. The President's FY2013 budget proposal includes an extension of the $13.25 cover-over, as does S. 3521 . The U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) collects federal excise tax revenue on rum exported to the United States from PR and the USVI and submits monthly reports of the amount collected to the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI). In September, PR and the USVI request prepayment from the DOI based on revenue projections by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for the upcoming fiscal year. The DOI then requests that the Treasury deposit the funds by September 30 into a designated escrow account for PR and the USVI. In FY2011, PR received $449.1 million in covered-over revenue from domestic production and other country imports into the United States, combined. The USVI received $123.9 million from domestic production and $9.6 million from other country imports. The \"other country\" import is the amount that is split between the USVI and PR based on market share. The FY2010 split was roughly 13% to the USVI and 87% to PR. Table 1 reports the amount covered over to PR and USVI for each fiscal year since 1994. Since 1994, PR has received $5.8 billion and the USVI $1.3 billion. The U.S. Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) remits the entire cover-over to PR, which includes the tax collected on PR-sourced production and the PR share of the \"other\" revenue from U.S. imports from non-PR and non-USVI sources. In contrast, the cover-over for taxes collected on U.S. imports from the USVI is remitted by the DOI based on data provided by the TTB. The share of \"other\" revenue is remitted by the TTB. Puerto Rico uses cover-over revenue to finance marketing and promotional activities for the rum industries. The exact amounts and extent of these activities is unclear as there is not separate publicly available budget accounting. However, a letter from Puerto Rico Resident Commissioner Pierluisi (and three other Members of Congress) states, \"Puerto Rico currently uses a small fraction of its annual federal excise tax revenue—about 6%—to promote Puerto Rican rums in general.\" The remaining 94% would be available for general expenditures in Puerto Rico, perhaps some of which could benefit the rum industry. The USVI uses several tools to subsidize the production of rum in the USVI. The Virgin Islands Public Finance Authority (VIPFA) issues tax-exempt bonds whose proceeds are used to finance public infrastructure spending, such as schools and roads, and infrastructure used almost exclusively by the rum industry. The size of the subsidy for the rum industry through state-sponsored debt finance is not transparent or easily measured. Debt for public infrastructure indirectly helps the rum industry and is not typically considered an industrial subsidy. The debt used for rum manufacturing infrastructure is direct, though measuring the subsidy is still problematic. Quantifying the subsidy requires establishing what costs, including taxes and fees, the industry would have incurred without the public assistance through tax favored debt. Recently, the VIPFA has issued a series of bonds backed by the rum tax. These bonds are often referred to as \"rum-tax bonds.\" In July 2008, according to a press report, the legislature of the USVI voted 10-5 in favor of a 30-year contractual agreement with Diageo, the maker of the Captain Morgan® brand rum among other beverages, to begin operations in the USVI (Diageo had contracted with a Puerto Rican based distiller to produce Captain Morgan®) and remain there for at least 30 years. Since that agreement, the VIPFA has moved forward issuing so-called \"rum-tax bonds\" that are secured by cover-over revenues. There were three bond issues from the VIPFA backed by rum-tax revenues in 2009. On July 9, 2009, the VIPFA offered $250 million of rum-tax bonds that would be subordinate to the agency's outstanding $477.8 million of senior rum-tax bonds. The new issue will be used to \"make a loan to the Government to provide a grant to Diageo USVI to finance the acquisition, design, construction, development and equipping of a rum production and maturation warehouse facility, and any improvements thereto, to be located on St. Croix.\" According to the bond offering statement, these new bonds will create $12.2 million in annual debt service costs in 2010, $16.7 million from 2011 to 2013, and $20.6 million from 2014 through 2038. On October 1, 2009, the VIPFA offered another $458,849,000 in bonds of which $363,840,000 was for the refunding of outstanding debt (rum-tax bonds that had been issued in 1998) and the remaining $95 million was for new money. The rum-tax bond new money ($95 million) was for capital projects including \"school construction, water and sewer upgrades, building and road renovations, open space initiatives, and land acquisitions for affordable housing programs among other projects.\" On October 8, 2009, the VIPFA was reported to have plans to issue $105 million of rum bonds for a second rum maker, Cruzan. In return, Cruzan would agree to remain in the USVI for 30 years. The report indicates that $30 million of the bond issue would finance a new wastewater treatment facility and $75 million would help expand the Cruzan distillery. On December 8, 2009, the VIPFA offered $39.2 million in bond finance for the Cruzan project. On July 8, 2010, the VIPFA offered $399,050,000 of bonds to then loan to the USVI government. The USVI government planned to use the loan proceeds to finance the capital reserve accounts needed for the various capital projects in process on the island. There will be two principal rum producers operating in the USVI by 2012 and both will be receiving subsidies from the USVI government. Cruzan, which is already producing rum, and Diageo, which is scheduled to begin production in 2012. In FY2009, Cruzan produced approximately 9.6 million proof gallons of Cruzan rum, of which 8 million proof gallons were sold in the United States. The Diageo production targets are included in the Diageo Agreement along with the USVI subsidy structure. The legislation signed by USVI Governor deJongh formalizing the agreement with Diageo USVI, Inc., included the following list of statutory incentives the government of the USVI is already providing to support rum production and has expanded to attract Diageo USVI, Inc.: a. A Molasses Subsidy Fund to assist distillers engaged in the processing of molasses into rum within the Virgin Islands (33 V.I.C. §3036); b. Statutorily provided marketing support payments designed to support the long-term growth of branded rum products to build a stable long-term rum industry; c. Statutory exemptions on property, excise, gross receipts and income taxes and other local tax incentives; and d. Environmental mitigation support. In the documents accompanying the December 8, 2009, bond issue, the VIPFA listed three sources of subsidy and support for Cruzan rum production: (1) a molasses subsidy payment; (2) a marketing support agreement with a termination of November 21, 2011; and (3) a professional services agreement with Cruzan entered into on June 23, 2006, extended annually and was set to expire on December 31, 2009 (as of this writing, the status of this agreement is uncertain). Table 2 lists the support of Cruzan rum from fiscal years 2003 through 2009. In the most recent year listed, the USVI provided direct support of $21.3 million for Cruzan rum. This represents roughly 18.5% of the amount received in covered-over revenue from the excise tax on rum imported from the USVI. The most recent bond offering statement included estimates for FY2010 for the Cruzan rum promotion and marketing support payments in the amount of $22,709,948 and $12,913,059. On May 12, 2011, Resident Commissioner Pedro Pierluisi introduced H.R. 1883 , the Investing in U.S. Territories, Not Corporations Act of 2011, legislation that would limit the amount of the subsidy to rum companies that is paid with covered-over revenue. In addition, the legislation would restrict the allocation of the covered-over revenue. The subsidy limit would prevent any possession from offering more than 15% of their covered-over revenue as an industrial subsidy for the rum industry. The restriction seems intended to make it more costly for the USVI to provide incentives to rum producers that have relocated from Puerto Rico to the USVI. Resident Commissioner Pierluisi, in a news item that appeared on his congressional website, states that Using funds provided under the federal cover-over program to give excessive subsidies to companies is completely indefensible. It destroys the purpose and integrity of this important program, which was intended to help the territories provide essential government services, like health care, infrastructure development, education, and land conservation.… The legislation would allow the possessions to offer debt financed grants to rum producers in excess of the 15% limit as long as the debt were not repaid with cover-over revenues. Thus, any amount of cover-over revenue used to repay debt that was issued to subsidize rum producers would be included in the 15% limit. The amount above the 15% limit would be subtracted from the cover-over payment for the next two years. In the Senate, S. 986 , introduced by Senator Menendez, includes the same provisions. A second provision in the proposed bills would restrict the allocations of rum cover-over revenue to the USVI and Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico's share of the cover-over revenue could never fall below 65% or rise above 70%. The USVI share would then be bound between 30% and 35%. Under current law, there is no limit on the cover-over revenue generated by own-source rum exports. In 2009, roughly 88% of all cover-over revenue was returned to Puerto Rico as Diageo produced Captain Morgan® rum in Puerto Rico. The recent relocation of Diageo operations from Puerto Rico to the USVI is anticipated to shift the relative market share significantly. The 35% cap on USVI remittances, as proposed, would likely be significantly lower than actual market share. A recent bond offering statement included an estimate that total cover-over revenues to the USVI would increase from to $278.8 million in 2013. The increase, due largely from new Diageo rum shipments, would likely mirror a decrease in Puerto Rican shipments. S. 3521 would extend the higher cover-over amount of $13.25 without any modifications to the allocation or restrictions on use of revenues. H.R. 1883 and S. 986 would make the direct subsidy to rum producers with rum excise tax cover-over payments more difficult and preclude the USVI from using general revenue to subsidize rum producers. As identified earlier, the subsidy the USVI is offering would include the continuation of (1) rum promotion, (2) marketing support, and (3) a molasses subsidy. In addition, news reports have also suggested that the USVI would provide income tax breaks and a complete exemption from property taxes. The news report also claims that the sum of these subsidies approaches 46% of the total amount covered over to the USVI and is not directly linked to the rum cover-over. All of these benefits accompany the debt finance support outlined earlier. The so-called rum-tax bonds are clearly linked to the rum tax as they are secured by the revenue generated by the production and export of Captain Morgan® by Diageo. The mix of marketing subsidies and tax incentives used to attract Diageo to the USVI already exceeds the limits proposed in the legislation. What is unclear is how the legislation would affect the Diageo agreement, enacted in July 2008, to manufacture rum in the USVI. Section 6.2.1(b) on page 23 of the Diageo agreement stipulates that Diageo will produce rum in the USVI as long as \"the Economic Development incentives granted by the Government to Diageo have not been materially reduced or made unavailable to Diageo.\" The restrictions that would be imposed on the cover-over revenues would likely reduce the subsidies provided by the USVI to Diageo. It is unclear how Diageo would respond to enactment of the legislation. Supporters of the restrictions claim that the tax incentives and subsidies offered by the USVI to large profitable corporations, such as Diageo, are a misuse of taxpayer dollars. Others make the same argument against many government-funded sub-federal economic development incentives. Some researchers \"have begun to write off economic development incentives as ineffective or inefficient for a host of reasons.\" Nevertheless, the justification for using tax incentives and subsidies to attract industry has long been a part of non-federal economic development strategies. There are numerous examples of states offering manufacturing firms reduced property taxes, access to tax-exempt financing, and favorable corporate income tax policies. The success of these programs to retain or lure new firms has been mixed and in many cases critics assert that the programs unnecessarily sacrifice tax revenues to influence a location decision that has already been made. From the federal government's perspective, state and local incentives for industrial development are a redistribution of tax dollars from state and local governments to manufacturing firms without a net gain in national GDP. From this perspective, the incentives shift economic activity from one location in the United States to another. The intended improvement of social welfare (i.e., helping economically disadvantaged areas) is usually the justification for such policies in light of what many economists identify as the \"zero-sum\" nature of the incentives. The size and scope of the USVI agreement with Diageo (and, to a lesser degree, Cruzan) is unique in that it involves the cover-over of rum excise tax revenues from the U.S. Departments of the Treasury and the Interior to the USVI and PR to directly and indirectly support the rum industry. The legislation would not prohibit tax incentives and direct subsidies; just limit them to a seemingly arbitrary level. The proposed limit could also be seen as inconsistent with the intent of the cover-over as expressed in the legislation and report language cited earlier. As noted in the legislative history in this report, Congress explicitly stated that the government receiving the covered-over revenue was charged with its disposition, not the U.S. Congress. In the case of Diageo, news reports indicate that Diageo had already decided to leave Puerto Rico and the USVI presented the most attractive option. While other Caribbean countries were said to be in the competition for the Diageo facility, Diageo's decision to produce rum in the USVI presents the worst case scenario for PR because PR loses not only Diageo but also future excise tax revenue from USVI production. As mentioned previously, a portion of rum-tax revenue collected from other countries' imports to the United States is paid to PR, but not on imports from the USVI. The recent recession and related budget situation have elevated the interest in the rum cover-over program. From the perspective of U.S. taxpayers, some may question the efficacy of the rum cover-over, regardless of the historical precedent. Further, proponents of restrictions on the use of covered-over revenue have alluded to the possibility that Congress may reconsider the cover-over principle generally, possibly ending the program, if the USVI uses the revenue for \"unreasonable\" subsidies.

U.S. Congress, House Committee on Ways and Means, Subcommittee on Internal Revenue Taxation, Appropriation of Certain Taxes to Virgin Islands , 7\n\n### Summary:\n\n", "answer": "Under current law, the excise tax on rum is $13.50 per proof gallon and is collected on rum produced in or imported into the United States. Through 2011, $13.25 per proof gallon of imported rum is transferred or \"covered over\" to the Treasuries of Puerto Rico (PR) and the United States Virgin Islands (USVI). In FY2011, PR received over $449.0 million in revenue and the USVI received over $133.5 million. The law does not impose any restrictions on how PR and USVI can use the transferred revenues. Both territories use some portion of the revenue to promote and assist the rum industry. The cover-over provisions for rum extend as far back as 1917 for PR and 1954 for USVI. Recently, the United States Virgin Islands has dedicated a larger share of current and future covered-over revenue to help finance public and private infrastructure that would directly benefit the rum industry. In the 112th Congress, legislation has been introduced to expand federal control over the use of covered-over revenue. Passage of H.R. 1883 (or similar legislation, S. 986) would result in limits on Puerto Rico's and the USVI's ability to use covered-over revenue to subsidize the rum industry in the islands. The legislation is likely in response to the recent economic development initiatives in the USVI financed in part by rum cover-over revenue. The President's FY2013 budget proposal includes an extension of the $13.25 cover-over, as does S. 3521. This report provides a history and analysis of the rum cover-over program and current legislative efforts to modify the program. The congressional debate on this legislation could also lead to debate on the broader issue of the cover-over program more generally. This report will be updated as legislative events warrant."}

In the last 5 years, the number of nurses providing care to veterans has increased, and VHA expects it will continue to increase because of the expected increased demand for services. In FY 2014, VHA employed more than 85,000 nurses who provided both direct and indirect care to patients through its health care system. The number of nurses providing direct patient care has increased from about 72,000 to about 82,000— approximately a 14 percent increase—from FY 2010 through FY 2014, while the number of unique patients served increased from about 6.0 million to about 6.6 million—approximately a 10 percent increase—during this same time period. VHA projects that approximately 40,000 new RNs will be needed through FY 2018 to maintain adequate staffing levels, including replacing retired nurses, to meet veterans’ needs. (See app. I for the number of nurses providing direct and indirect care at VA medical centers from FY 2010 through FY 2014.) In addition to the need for more nurses due to an increasing number of veterans, VHA anticipates that changes in veteran demographics, including an aging population, will increase the need for nurses to provide more complex types of services to care for veterans. In its 2014 Interim Workforce and Succession Strategic Plan, VHA reported that after 2015, the largest segment of the veteran population will be between 65 and 84 years of age. Also, the number of women veterans receiving care through VHA has nearly doubled since 2004, requiring changes to the type of care provided and corresponding skills needed. VHA estimates that veteran usage of primary care, surgical specialty care, and mental health care will each increase by more than 20 percent over the next 10 years. The nurse skill mix—the proportion of each type of nurse (NPs, RNs, LPNs, and NAs) of the total nursing staff in a particular unit or medical center—is an important component of VHA nurse staffing, as the level of education and training for each nurse position determines the types of services that can be provided. (See table 1 for VHA nurse positions, responsibilities, and educational requirements.) For example, intensive care units require higher intensity nursing, and may have a skill mix that is primarily composed of RNs compared to other types of units that may provide less complex care, such as outpatient clinics. In the last 5 fiscal years, RNs comprised the largest percentage of nurses within VHA, and were approximately 64 percent of the nurse workforce in FY 2014. NPs comprised the smallest percentage over the same period. (See fig. 1.) For the first time, in FY 2015, VA began collecting data on the number of nurse hires and vacancies at each of its medical centers. For FY 2015, as of June, VA medical centers hired approximately 8,600 nurses; approximately 5,100 (59 percent) were RNs, and approximately 430 were NPs (5 percent), reflecting VHA’s need for nurses with advanced skills and education. Despite these new hires, VHA estimated that there were about 17,000 vacancies across VA medical centers as of June 2015, with about 12,100 (71 percent) for RN positions. (See app. I for the number of nurse hires and losses at VA medical centers for FY 2015, as of June.) The average national nurse turnover rate for VHA from FY 2010 through FY 2014 was 7.6 percent. The turnover rates for NPs and RNs increased over this same period, and in FY 2014, were 9.1 percent and 7.8 percent, respectively. VHA reported high projected losses for nurses, such as from retirement, in the next few fiscal years. In 2014, for example, VHA reported that by FY 2019, approximately 20 percent of its nurses will be eligible for retirement. Retirement and career advancement through opportunities elsewhere were the top two reasons why nurses reportedly left VHA. In addition, according to findings from VHA’s 2015 Workforce Planning Report, approximately 12 percent of all nurses that left VHA in FY 2012 did so in their first year of employment. (See app I. for annual nurse turnover rates by position type for FY 2010 through FY 2014.) VA medical centers are responsible for recruiting and retaining nurses in their respective facilities, with VHA providing support to assist them. Specifically, VHA has developed initiatives that medical centers may offer to help with the recruitment and retention of nurses. VHA also provides guidance and policies to its medical centers on the process of recruiting and hiring nurses and on the initiatives medical centers may use to help with recruitment and retention. Additionally, VHA provides marketing services and tools to medical centers, including marketing campaigns that advertise the benefits of working at VHA and recruitment brochures that medical centers can use at local career fairs. Nurse recruitment begins with advertising and publicizing available positions to encourage potential candidates to apply, through various channels, including through local publications, job fairs, and USAjobs.gov. Once medical centers recruit, interview, and select a nursing candidate, that nursing candidate goes through a process known as onboarding and credentialing. Most medical centers employ nurse recruiters, who are responsible for managing the administrative components of the hiring process, as well as various aspects of nurse recruitment and retention. The nurse recruiter position varies among medical centers. Some medical centers assign the nurse recruiter to the medical center’s clinical nursing services office, and these nurse recruiters are typically RNs. Other medical centers assign nurse recruiters to the medical center’s human resources office, and these nurse recruiters may not have clinical backgrounds. VHA has multiple system-wide initiatives to recruit and retain its nurse workforce, but some VA medical centers face challenges in offering them to nurses and with recruitment and retention more broadly. We found that VHA has eight key initiatives that medical centers may offer to help them recruit and retain nurses. (See table 2.) VHA’s initiatives focus primarily on providing (1) education and training, and (2) financial benefits and incentives. (See app. II for VHA expenditures for and nurse participation in key recruitment and retention initiatives from FY 2010 through FY 2014.) With the exception of the mandatory RN Transition to Practice initiative, VA medical centers generally have discretion to offer any of VHA’s initiatives to nurses, including the discretion to submit requests for proposals for any of the initiatives that require them. The four VA medical centers in our review varied in the number of initiatives they offered from FY 2010 through FY 2014. (See table 3.) For example, one of the medical centers in our review offered three of the four education and training initiatives—RN Transition to Practice, VA Nursing Academic Partnerships, and VA Learning Opportunities Residency. This medical center also offered the Post-Baccalaureate Nurse Residency—which, beginning in FY 2015, is part of the VA Nursing Academic Partnerships—and developed curricula to move participants through the initiatives. This medical center also offered all four of the financial initiatives—recruitment, retention, and relocation incentives; the Education Debt Reduction Program; the Employee Incentive Scholarship Program; and flexible work schedules. The medical center ceased offering recruitment, retention, and relocation incentives in 2013; according to medical center officials, VHA introduced new employee performance criteria that medical center officials felt were too difficult for employees to achieve or for medical centers to provide justification for retention incentives. Officials from all four medical centers reported offering flexible work schedules to provide nurses with options when trying to maintain work life balance, such as offering nurses compressed schedules (e.g., 10-hour shifts, 4 days a week). While VA medical centers generally have discretion to offer any of VHA’s initiatives, all medical centers that employed RNs with less than 1 year of nursing experience were required to offer the RN Transition to Practice initiative. However, officials from two medical centers in our review reported not offering the initiative at all or not offering it across all 5 fiscal years. Officials from one medical center offered the RN Transition to Practice initiative for 1 year, beginning in 2012, but subsequently decided not to hire newly graduated nurses because of the extensive orientation and training they required. According to officials, after one of its current LPNs returned to school to become an RN, this medical center coordinated with another VA medical center in the region for this new RN to participate in that medical center’s RN Transition to Practice curriculum. Officials from the second medical center told us that it offered a 16-week program designed to help new nurses acclimate to VA but did not offer VHA’s 12-month RN Transition to Practice initiative because they did not believe it was required. In addition to offering VHA’s initiatives, three of the four medical centers in our review developed local recruitment and retention initiatives. Two medical centers developed initiatives to provide employment to train student nurses; the medical centers’ initiatives were similar to the VA Learning Opportunities Residency. Officials from one of these medical centers told us that the medical center developed a local initiative because the nursing schools in the region offered associate degrees only; whereas, VHA’s initiative requires medical centers to partner with schools of nursing with baccalaureate degree programs. The other medical center offered the VA Learning Opportunities Residency, as well as its own student nurse employment and training initiative. Officials from a third medical center in our review told us that the medical center offered a 16- week RN Transition to Practice initiative to train new RN graduates; these RNs are hired on a temporary basis and are hired as full-time employees when RN vacancies open. Officials from three of the four medical centers in our review reported that VHA’s initiatives helped improve their ability to recruit and retain nurses, as shown in the following examples: Officials from one medical center reported that they hired 9 of the 10 nurses who participated in the VHA Post-Baccalaureate Nurse Residency as full-time nurses in academic year 2012-2013, the first year the medical center offered the initiative. The medical center retained 7 of these 9 nurses as of the end of the following academic year 2013-2014. Officials from another medical center that offered the Education Debt Reduction Program reported that, of the six nurses that began the program since 2010, five completed the 5-year service agreement and, as of April 2015, remained employees of the medical center. Officials from one medical center that offered the Employee Incentive Scholarship Program reported that 23 nurses completed the program over the past 10 years, and, as of February 2015, 21 of those nurses have remained employees of the medical center. Despite these successes, however, officials from three of the four medical centers in our review reported challenges with offering VHA’s initiatives specifically, and recruiting and retaining nurses more broadly, both of which limited the initiatives’ usefulness. These challenges—lack of sufficient administrative support, competition with private sector medical facilities for qualified and skilled nurses, the rural location of the medical center, and employee dissatisfaction—may affect medical centers’ ability to effectively and efficiently recruit and retain nurses. Lack of sufficient administrative support. Officials from one medical center reported challenges in efficiently offering some of the initiatives due to the lack of sufficient administrative support. Specifically, medical center officials reported not having sufficient human resources and clerical staff to process in a timely manner the paperwork associated with specific VHA recruitment and retention initiatives, such as the Employee Incentive Scholarship Program. Competition with the private sector. Officials from two medical centers reported challenges in recruiting and retaining nurses because of competition with private hospitals in the area. Officials from one medical center told us that they face significant competition from local hospitals, as there are multiple private boutique and specialty hospitals in their area. Officials stated that competing with these hospitals, especially for entry-level nurses, is difficult because the hospitals offer generous signing bonuses. Officials from another medical center told us that the high cost of living and lower nursing salaries compared to the salaries offered by competing medical facilities in the area negatively affects the medical center’s ability to successfully recruit and retain nurses, specifically RNs and NPs. Officials from this medical center told us that they do not have sufficient funds, such as funds from VHA’s Education Debt Reduction Program, to offer nurses financial incentives to make up for the large difference in salaries. In addition, while the Choice Act increased the maximum repayment amount for each recipient of the Education Debt Reduction Program from $60,000 to $120,000, VHA officials told us that VHA did not increase the medical center’s annual funding allocation for the program to account for that increase. In FY 2014, this medical center had turnover rates of 10 percent or higher for NPs, RNs, and LPNs, above the national average of 7.9 percent for all nurses. Rural location. Officials from one medical center that has community outpatient clinics located in rural areas reported challenges recruiting qualified nurses with the requisite experience to work in critical care or other specialized units such as mental health. Officials from another medical center located in a rural area reported that, while the medical center receives high interest in nurse employment generally from the community and has a ready applicant pool for some nurses, it also faces challenges in recruiting nurses with advanced degrees or advanced training and expertise to work in the emergency department or intensive care unit because of its rural location. Employee dissatisfaction. Officials from one medical center and its union reported high levels of nurse dissatisfaction with medical center leadership as a result of recent investigations, including by VA’s OIG, examining access to care issues in the facility. This dissatisfaction has negatively affected the medical center’s ability to retain nurses, according to officials from this medical center. In FY 2014, for example, this medical center had a 12 percent turnover rate for NPs and close to a 30 percent turnover rate for NAs. With some nurses on administrative leave and high nurse turnover, officials stated that nurses are stepping into positions temporarily and are being asked to work additional or longer shifts. Officials stated that the medical center’s units are inadequately staffed to care for the medical center’s current patient load, which they believe is affecting access and the quality of care provided to veterans. In addition to challenges identified by the medical centers in our review, VHA also identified a challenge specific to the RN Transition to Practice initiative. Officials from the Office of Nursing Services told us that, when VHA began to require medical centers to offer the RN Transition to Practice initiative in November 2011, VHA did not provide specific funding to medical centers to do so and relied on medical centers to determine how to fund the initiative, which is financially and staff-resource intensive. According to VHA officials, there have been two unintended consequences of requiring medical centers to offer this initiative without VHA funding. First, some medical centers are deciding to hire experienced RNs only, who would not be eligible for the initiative, rather than hiring new RNs because of the financial burden associated with the initiative. Second, some medical centers in rural locations have found it difficult to offer the initiative because of a lack of available instructors qualified to provide the required training. VHA conducts limited monitoring of VA medical centers to ensure they are in compliance with its key nurse recruitment and retention initiatives. Consistent with federal internal control standards, monitoring should be ongoing in the course of normal program operations and provide reasonable assurance of compliance with applicable laws and regulations. VHA’s Office of Academic Affiliations has a system in place for conducting site visits to the medical centers that offer the VA Nursing Academic Partnerships initiative. Office of Academic Affiliations officials reported that the site visits occur at least once per year to gauge a medical center’s adherence to the residency’s policies and contractual requirements. In addition to providing consulting services during these site visits to all medical centers that offer this initiative, these officials also told us that site visit reports are specifically generated for medical centers that are offering the initiative for the first time, and these reports are provided to the nursing school and medical center leadership. Officials told us that they have stopped three medical centers from offering the VA Nursing Academic Partnerships initiative when it was in the pilot phase due to non-compliance with program policies. VHA Healthcare Talent Management officials told us that although they conducted site visits to medical centers in the past that offered the Education Debt Reduction Program, they are currently not conducting site visits. Officials reported that these site visits were in response to a medical center reporting difficulty implementing the initiatives the office manages, and were a method of comprehensively assessing individual medical center’s compliance with policies or guidance, as well as being consultative in nature. A Healthcare Talent Management official reported that the office lacked sufficient staff to enable them to conduct any site visits in FY 2015 and that additional staff have been hired, which will enable the office to resume site visits in FY 2016. In addition, although VHA required VA medical centers, as of November 2011, to offer VHA’s RN Transition to Practice initiative to RNs with 1 year or less of experience, the Office of Nursing Services does not have a process in place to determine if all medical centers are in compliance. We found, for example, that one medical center in our review that employed RNs with less than 1 year of experience had not offered the RN Transition to Practice initiative; officials from this medical center stated that they thought the initiative was recommended and not required. Officials from the Office of Nursing Services told us that, when the RN Transition to Practice initiative became a requirement in November 2011, there was no specific funding provided to medical centers to offer it. Because of this lack of funding, officials said that it has been difficult to provide oversight of this initiative. With limited monitoring taking place as part of its oversight, VHA lacks assurance that its medical centers are complying with the recruitment and retention initiatives’ policies and requirements, and that any problems can be identified and resolved in a timely and appropriate manner. Although three VA medical centers in our review reported that VHA’s key recruitment and retention initiatives for nurses have been helpful, VHA has conducted limited evaluations to determine any needed training resources or to determine the initiatives’ effectiveness system-wide and whether any changes are needed. This lack of evaluation may affect VHA’s ability to improve the initiatives and ultimately medical centers’ ability to recruit and retain nurses. Consistent with federal internal control standards, measuring performance allows organizations to track the progress they are making towards program goals and objectives, and provides managers important information on which to make management decisions and resolve any problems or program weaknesses. According to VHA officials, there are processes in place to determine if problems exist with several of its recruitment and retention initiatives. First, for the first time, in FY 2015, VHA’s Healthcare Talent Management conducted a survey of medical centers as part of the data collection process for VHA’s Interim Workforce and Succession Strategic Plan. The purpose of the survey was to collect information on workforce priorities in the field and to gauge barriers to medical centers as they offer the three recruitment and retention initiatives managed by Healthcare Talent Management. The survey responses provided feedback on some of the barriers that medical centers faced with offering the initiatives, such as an application process for the Education Debt Reduction Program that was not user friendly. Healthcare Talent Management officials said they plan to use these survey results to make changes to the initiatives it manages, and the office plans to continue including questions regarding workforce planning priorities in future surveys. Second, VHA’s Office of Nursing Services is currently conducting a formal evaluation of the RN Transition to Practice initiative. According to an official, the purpose of the evaluation is to gather information on any successes that medical centers have experienced with offering the initiative. As part of the data collection process, the evaluation team has started interviewing program coordinators at selected medical centers, and will analyze available participant survey data. In addition, the evaluation team plans to survey all medical centers to gauge their compliance with the requirement that all medical centers with RNs with 1 year or less of experience offer the initiative. According to officials, the initiative is set to expire in 2016, and VHA will use the information from the evaluation to make decisions and set goals regarding the program moving forward. Lastly, the Office of Academic Affiliations uses various tools to assess nurse residents’ skill competency and satisfaction with the initiatives it manages. For example, it uses an assessment tool to measure nurses’ progress toward the development of core clinical competencies at set intervals throughout their participation in the VA Nursing Academic Partnerships, specifically the Post-Baccalaureate Nurse Residency. The Office of Academic Affiliations also uses a survey to gauge participating students’ satisfaction with its training programs and residencies, including the VA Nursing Academic Partnerships - Graduate Education initiative, on topics such as the learning and working environments, as well as clinical faculty skills. However, VHA has not conducted any assessments of the adequacy of training resources for nurse recruiters. In particular, there are substantial differences in the availability of training resources for nurse recruiters, who can play a key role in medical centers offering VHA’s nurse recruitment and retention initiatives to nurses, according to officials from VHA and representatives of a national nursing organization. According to a VHA official, there is currently no face-to-face training provided by VHA specifically for nurse recruiters, but there is regular training available to those assigned to a human resources office as part of training available to all human resources staff. Representatives of a national nursing organization reported that the clinical nurse recruiters at VA medical centers often feel overwhelmed and unprepared in the position because of a lack of training and human resources-related information, which may have resulted in turnover in that position. VHA officials told us that these differences in training for different types of nurse recruiters have existed for years, but no review of the training provided to nurse recruiters has been conducted. Further, VHA officials told us there are no current plans to assess the differences in the training and the effect that it has on the effectiveness of nurse recruiters. VHA officials reported that the barrier to conducting this type of assessment was resources, both a lack of funding, as well as a lack of staff to conduct the assessment. Furthermore, VHA has not conducted any evaluations of the overall effectiveness of the key initiatives in meeting VHA’s system-wide nurse recruitment and retention goals. In its 2014 Interim Workforce and Succession Strategic Plan, VHA reported that its plan included recruiting highly skilled employees in mission critical occupations, which includes nurses, who are able to function at the top of the competency level, as well as retaining these employees as VHA develops a pipeline of qualified nurses that will take on more senior roles. In addition, VHA reported that it is challenged with ensuring it has the appropriate workforce to meet current and future needs that result from shortages and competition for certain health care positions, such as nurses. For example, 42 percent of VHA’s senior leadership, which includes senior-level nurses, is eligible for retirement in 2015, and this percentage will increase over the next 7 years. The strategic plan noted that VHA has several initiatives, such as the Education Debt Reduction Program, to address some of its recruitment challenges, but does not discuss the effectiveness of this initiative in meeting recruitment goals. VA’s annual report to Congress presents statistical information on some of VHA’s recruitment and retention initiatives, such as the number of nurses that received financial incentives in FY 2014 and the amount of financial incentives paid during that time, but does not provide information on the effectiveness of those initiatives in the recruitment and retention of nurses. VHA officials reported that they hold regular and ad hoc meetings for all offices that manage VHA’s nurse recruitment and retention initiatives to discuss a variety of topics, such as coordination and effectiveness. For example, the Office of Academic Affiliations holds ad hoc meetings with the Office of Nursing Services and Healthcare Talent Management to coordinate their initiatives related to recruitment and retention. In addition, Healthcare Talent Management holds quarterly meetings with the Office of Academic Affiliations and the Office of Nursing Services to share data, coordinate resources, and offer support for the other offices’ programs. Although these offices may meet to discuss the management of the initiatives, VHA officials reported no current plans to evaluate the overall effectiveness of the initiatives in meeting strategic goals. A VHA official noted that the lack of evaluations of the overall effectiveness of VHA’s initiatives is a gap in the organization’s oversight. This official said that the recruitment and retention initiatives for nurses are offered at the local medical center level, and their role has primarily been to provide consultative services to those facilities. VHA officials noted that some data are regularly maintained at the national level, and although they are able to gather limited data on the initiatives from the medical centers, they need to develop a process to evaluate its initiatives to provide better support. Oversight that includes evaluations of individual initiatives, if conducted, could provide VHA with data to identify any resource needs, such as training or administrative needs, and difficulties that medical centers are experiencing offering the initiatives, such as the lack of adequate administrative support as reported to us by medical centers in our review. A system-wide evaluation could help ensure that VHA’s recruitment and retention initiatives are effective in meeting departmental goals and that resources are effectively allocated across all VA medical centers. Evaluation results could also be useful if communicated to relevant stakeholders, such as medical centers, to inform them of any compliance issues or any operational changes that may be needed. Under federal internal control standards, relevant program information and guidance are needed throughout an agency to achieve all of its objectives, and should be communicated to management and others within the organization in a reliable form and within a time frame that enables them to carry out their organizational responsibilities, such as the implementation of a program or policy. Adequate numbers of qualified nurses are essential for VHA to meet its mission of providing quality and timely health care for veterans. As the number of veterans seeking health care increases and the demographics of that population continue to change, VHA faces challenges ensuring it has the appropriate nurse workforce needed to provide care, including more complex, specialized services. In addition, the Choice Act required VHA to add additional clinical staff, including nurses, to its workforce to increase access to care for veterans. VHA has a number of key initiatives to help medical centers recruit and retain nurses; however, challenges, including competition with the private sector for qualified and skilled nurses and the lack of sufficient administrative support, may limit their effectiveness. Furthermore, VHA’s limited oversight of its key nurse recruitment and retention initiatives hinders its ability to assess the effectiveness of these initiatives and make any needed adjustments to help ensure its nurse workforce is keeping pace with the health care needs of veterans. Because of its limited monitoring, VHA lacks assurance that its medical centers are offering recruitment and retention initiatives in accordance with the policies and guidance that it has developed. Further, limited evaluations of medical centers offering VHA’s initiatives have meant VHA is unable to systematically identify problems or needed program changes to ensure that the initiatives are being offered efficiently and effectively, including determining whether medical centers have sufficient training resources to support its nurse recruitment and retention initiatives. Further, without system-wide evaluations of its collective initiatives, VHA is unable to determine to what extent its nurse recruitment and retention initiatives are effective in meeting VHA polices and Choice Act provisions, or ultimately, whether VHA’s initiatives are sufficient to meet veterans’ health care needs. To help ensure the effective recruitment and retention of nurses across VA medical centers, we recommend the Secretary of Veterans Affairs direct the Under Secretary for Health to take the following three actions: 1. Develop a periodic reporting process to help monitor VA medical center compliance with the policies and procedures for each of its key recruitment and retention initiatives; 2. Evaluate the adequacy of training resources provided to all nurse recruiters at VA medical centers to ensure that they have the tools and information to perform their duties efficiently and effectively; and 3. Conduct a system-wide evaluation of VHA’s key nurse recruitment and retention initiatives, to determine the overall effectiveness of these initiatives, including any needed improvements, and communicate results and information in a timely manner to relevant stakeholders. We provided a draft of this report to VA for comment. In its written comments, reproduced in appendix III, VA generally agreed with our conclusions and concurred with our recommendations. In its comments, VA also provided information on workgroups it was planning to establish, as well as its plans for implementing each recommendation, with an estimated completion date of October 2017. As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce the contents of this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the report date. At that time, we will send copies of this report to appropriate congressional committees, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, and other interested parties. In addition, the report will be available at no charge on the GAO website at http://www.gao.gov.

VHA faces challenges such as increased competition for skilled clinicians in hard-to-fill occupations such as nurses. As GAO has previously reported, recruitment and retention is particularly difficult for nurses with advanced professional skills, knowledge, and experience, which is critical given veterans' needs for more complex specialized services. GAO was asked to provide information on the recruitment and retention of nurses within VHA. This report reviews (1) the initiatives VHA has to recruit and retain its nurse workforce and (2) the extent to which VHA oversees its nurse recruitment and retention initiatives. GAO reviewed documents and interviewed officials from VHA, four VA medical centers selected to reflect variation in factors such as nurse turnover, and regional offices for these medical centers. GAO used federal internal control standards to evaluate VHA's oversight. GAO also interviewed selected stakeholder organizations. The Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) Veterans Health Administration (VHA) has multiple system-wide initiatives to recruit and retain its nurse workforce, but three of the four VA medical centers in GAO's review faced challenges offering them. VHA identified a number of key initiatives it offers to help medical centers recruit and retain nurses, which focus primarily on providing (1) education and training, and (2) financial benefits and incentives. VA medical centers generally have discretion in offering these initiatives. The four medical centers in GAO's review varied in the number of initiatives they offered, and three of these medical centers developed local recruitment and retention initiatives in addition to those offered by VHA. GAO also found that while three of the four medical centers reported improvements in their ability to recruit and retain nurses through their offering of VHA's initiatives; they also reported challenges. The challenges included a lack of sufficient administrative support for medical centers, competition with private sector medical facilities, reduced pool of nurses in rural locations with advanced training, and employee dissatisfaction. VHA's oversight of its key system-wide nurse recruitment and retention initiatives is limited. Specifically, GAO found that VHA conducts limited monitoring of medical centers' compliance with its initiatives. For example, in the past, VHA conducted site visits in response to a medical center reporting difficulty with implementation of one of its initiatives, and to assess compliance with program policies, but it is no longer conducting these visits. Consistent with federal internal control standards, monitoring should be ongoing and should identify performance gaps in a policy or procedure. With limited monitoring, VHA lacks assurance that its medical centers are complying with its nurse recruitment and retention initiatives, and that any problems are identified and resolved in a timely and appropriate manner. In addition, VHA has not conducted evaluations of the training resources provided to nurse recruiters at VA medical centers or the overall effectiveness of the initiatives in meeting its nurse recruitment and retention goals, or whether any changes are needed. Consistent with federal internal control standards, measuring performance tracks progress towards program goals and objectives, and provides important information to make management decisions and resolve any problems or program weaknesses. For example, GAO found that VHA does not know whether medical centers have sufficient training to support its nurse recruitment and retention initiatives. In particular, there is currently no face-to-face training provided by VHA specifically for nurse recruiters, but there is regular training available to those assigned to a human resources office as part of training available to all human resources staff. Representatives from a national nursing organization reported that clinical nurse recruiters at VA medical centers often feel more unprepared for the position than those assigned to human resources offices, but no evaluation of this disparity or its effects has occurred. Without evaluations of its collective system-wide initiatives, VHA is unable to determine to what extent its nurse recruitment and retention initiatives are effective in meeting VHA policies and the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act provisions, or ultimately whether VHA has an adequate and qualified nurse workforce at its medical centers that is sufficient to meet veterans' health care needs. GAO recommends VA (1) develop a process to help monitor medical centers' compliance with its key nurse recruitment and retention initiatives; (2) evaluate the adequacy of training resources provided to nurse recruiters; and (3) conduct a system-wide evaluation of its key nurse recruitment and retention initiatives. VA concurred with the recommendations."}

In fiscal year 2004, DOD reported that its operations involved $1.2 trillion in assets, $1.7 trillion in liabilities, over 3.3 million in military and civilian personnel, and over $605 billion in net cost of operations. For fiscal year 2005, the department received an annual appropriation of about $417 billion and was appropriated about $76 billion for the global war on terrorism. Execution of DOD’s operations spans a wide range of defense organizations, including the military services and their respective major commands and functional activities, numerous large defense agencies and field activities, and various combatant and joint operational commands that are responsible for military operations for specific geographic regions or theaters of operation. To support DOD’s operations, the department performs an assortment of interrelated and interdependent business processes, including logistics, procurement, health care, and financial management. Transformation of DOD’s business systems and operations is critical to the department providing Congress and DOD management with accurate and timely information for use in the decision-making process. This effort is an essential part of the Secretary of Defense’s broad initiative to “transform the way the department works and what it works on.” The Secretary of Defense has estimated that improving business operations of the department could save 5 percent of DOD’s annual budget, which based on fiscal year 2005 appropriations, represents a savings of about $25 billion. For several years, we have reported that DOD faces a range of financial management and related business process challenges that are complex, long-standing, pervasive, and deeply rooted in virtually all business operations throughout the department. As the Comptroller General testified in April 2005, DOD’s financial management deficiencies, taken together, continue to represent a major impediment to achieving an unqualified opinion on the U.S. government’s consolidated financial statements. To date, none of the military services has passed the test of an independent financial audit because of pervasive weaknesses in internal controls and processes and fundamentally flawed business systems. In identifying improved financial performance as one of its five governmentwide initiatives, the President’s Management Agenda recognized that without sound internal controls and accurate and timely financial and performance information, it is not possible to accomplish the President’s agenda and secure the best performance and highest measure of accountability for the American people. Long-standing weaknesses in DOD’s financial management and related business processes and systems have (1) resulted in a lack of reliable information needed to make sound decisions and report on the status of DOD activities, including accountability of assets, through financial and other reports to Congress and DOD decision makers; (2) hindered its operational efficiency; (3) adversely affected mission performance; and (4) left the department vulnerable to fraud, waste, and abuse, as the following examples illustrate. The current inefficient, paper-intensive, error-prone travel reimbursement process has resulted in inaccurate, delayed, and denied travel payments for mobilized Army Guard soldiers. We found a broad range of reimbursement problems that included disputed amounts for meals that we estimated to be as high as about $6,000 for each of 76 soldiers in one case study that remained unpaid by the end of our review. Until DOD improves the antiquated process that requires Army Guard soldiers to accumulate, retain, and submit numerous paper documents, reimbursement problems and inefficiencies will likely continue. Of approximately 930,000 travel vouchers received between fiscal years 2002 and 2004, the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) Contingency Travel Operations Office rejected and returned about 139,000 vouchers to soldiers for additional paper documentation or to correct other processing deficiencies. This repeated churning of vouchers frustrated soldiers and added to the volume of claims to be processed. Injured and ill reserve component soldiers—who are entitled to extend their active duty service to receive medical treatment—have been inappropriately removed from active duty status in the automated systems that control pay and access to medical care. The current stovepiped, nonintegrated systems are labor-intensive and require extensive error-prone manual entry and reentry. Inadequate controls resulted in some soldiers experiencing significant gaps in their pay and medical benefits, causing hardships for the soldiers and their families. In addition, because these soldiers no longer had valid active duty orders, they did not have access to the commissary and post exchange—which allows soldiers and their families to purchase groceries and other goods at a discount. In one case we reviewed, during a 12-month period, while attempting to obtain care for injuries sustained from a helicopter crash in Afghanistan, one Special Forces soldier fell out of active duty status four times. During the times he was not recorded in the system as being on active duty, he was not paid and he and his family experienced delays in receiving medical treatment. In all, he missed payments for 10 pay periods—totaling $11,924. Ninety-four percent of mobilized Army National Guard and Reserve soldiers we investigated during two audits had pay problems. These problems distracted soldiers from their missions, imposed financial hardships on their families, and may have a negative impact on retention. The processes and automated systems relied on to provide active duty payments to mobilized Army Guard and Reserve soldiers are so error-prone, cumbersome, and complex that neither DOD nor, more importantly, the soldiers themselves could be reasonably assured of timely and accurate payments. Some of the pay problems soldiers experienced often lingered unresolved for considerable lengths of time, some for over a year. DOD continues to lack visibility and control over the supplies and spare parts it owns. Therefore, it cannot monitor the responsiveness and effectiveness of the supply system to identify and eliminate choke points. Currently, DOD does not have the ability to provide timely or accurate information on the location, movement, status, or identity of its supplies. Although total asset visibility has been a departmentwide goal for over 30 years, DOD estimates that it will not achieve this visibility until the year 2010. DOD may not meet this goal by 2010, however, unless it overcomes three significant impediments: (1) developing a comprehensive plan for achieving visibility, (2) building the necessary integration among its many inventory management information systems, and (3) correcting long-standing data accuracy and reliability problems within existing inventory management systems. A key to successful implementation of a comprehensive logistics strategy will be addressing these initiatives as part of a comprehensive, integrated business transformation. The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) and each of the military services experienced significant shortages of critical spare parts, even though more than half of DOD’s reported inventory—about $35 billion— exceeded current operating requirements. In many cases, these shortages contributed directly to equipment downtime, maintenance problems, and the services’ failure to meet their supply availability goals. DOD, DLA, and the military services each lack strategic approaches and detailed plans that could help mitigate these critical spare parts shortages and guide their many initiatives aimed at improving inventory management. The Navy did not know how much it spent on telecommunications and did not have detailed cost and inventory data needed to evaluate spending patterns and to leverage its buying power. At the four case study sites we audited, management oversight of telecommunication purchases did not provide reasonable assurance that requirements were met in the most cost-effective manner. For example, cell phone usage at three sites was not monitored to determine whether plan minutes met users’ needs, resulting in overpayment for cell phone services. In addition, the Navy lacks specific policies and processes addressing the administration and management of calling cards. On one card alone, in a 3-month period, the Navy paid over $17,000. Not until the vendor’s fraud unit raised questions about more than $11,000 in charges in a 6-day period was the card suspended. Over the years, DOD recorded billions of dollars of disbursements and collections in suspense accounts because the proper appropriation accounts could not be identified and charged. Because documentation needed to resolve these payment recording problems could not be found after so many years, DOD requested and received authority to write-off certain aged suspense transactions. While DOD reported that it wrote off an absolute value of $35 billion or a net value of $629 million using the legislative authority, neither of these amounts accurately represents the true value of all the individual transactions that DOD had not correctly recorded in its financial records. Many of DOD’s accounting systems and processes routinely offset individual disbursements, collections, adjustments, and correction entries against each other and, over time, amounts might even have been netted more than once. This netting and summarizing misstated the total value of the write-offs and made it impossible for DOD to identify what appropriations may have been under- or overcharged or to determine whether individual transactions were valid. At December 31, 2004, DOD reports showed that, even after the write-offs, more than $1.3 billion (absolute value) remained in suspense accounts for longer than 60 days; however, DOD has acknowledged that its suspense reports are incomplete and inaccurate. In addition, DOD is still not performing effective reconciliations of its disbursement and collection activity. Similar to checkbook reconciliations, DOD needs to compare its records of monthly activity to Treasury’s records and promptly research and correct any differences. In September 2004, we reported that DOD had begun implementing a financial improvement initiative that included the goal of obtaining an unqualified audit opinion on its fiscal year 2007 consolidated financial statements but that the initiative lacked a clearly defined, integrated, well- documented, and realistic plan for improving DOD’s financial management and thus achieving that goal. We also reported that DOD lacked effective oversight and accountability mechanisms to ensure that the mid-range financial improvement plans being developed by the military services and defense agencies in support of the initiative were adequately planned, implemented, and sustainable. Our report expressed concern that DOD’s emphasis on obtaining a clean audit opinion for fiscal year 2007 could divert limited resources away from ongoing efforts to develop and implement the long-term systems and process changes needed to improve financial information and to efficiently and effectively manage DOD’s business operations. In the Ronald W. Reagan National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005, Congress placed a limitation on the use of operations and maintenance funds for continued preparation or implementation of DOD’s mid-range financial improvement plan. Use of such funds for the mid-range plan is prohibited until the Secretary of Defense submits to the congressional defense committees a report containing the following: (1) a determination that DOD’s business enterprise architecture (BEA) and the transition plan for implementing the BEA have been developed, (2) an explanation of the manner in which fiscal year 2005 operations and maintenance funds will be used by DOD components to prepare or implement the mid-range financial improvement plan, and (3) an estimate of future year costs for each of the military services and defense agencies to prepare and implement the mid-range financial improvement plan. As of the end of May 2005, DOD has not yet provided the defense committees with the required report. Until DOD has complete, reliable information on the costs and number of business systems operating within the department, its ability to effectively control the money it spends on these systems will be limited. DOD’s fiscal year 2005 budget request for its business systems was $13.3 billion, which, on its face, is about $6 billion, or 29 percent, less than its fiscal year 2004 budget request. However, we found that this decrease can be attributed to DOD’s reclassification of some business systems to national security systems, not to a reduction in spending on its systems. While some of the reclassifications appeared reasonable, our analysis showed that others were questionable or inconsistencies exist, which hinder DOD’s ability to develop a definitive business systems inventory. At the same time the amount of requested business system funding declined, the reported number of business systems increased by about 1,900—from 2,274 in April 2003 to 4,150 in February 2005. Furthermore, given that DOD does not know how many business systems it has, it is not surprising that the department continues to lack effective management oversight and control over business systems investments. Since February 2003, the domains have been given the responsibility to oversee the department’s business systems investments, yet the billions of dollars spent each year continue to be spread among the military services and defense agencies, enabling the numerous DOD components to continue to develop stovepiped, parochial solutions to the department’s long-standing financial management and business operation challenges. Additionally, based upon data reported to us by the military services and DOD components, obligations totaling at least $243 million were made for systems modernizations in fiscal year 2004 that were not referred to the DOD Comptroller for the required review, as specified in the fiscal year 2003 defense authorization act. For fiscal year 2005, DOD requested approximately $28.7 billion in IT funding to support a wide range of military operations as well as DOD business systems operations. Of the $28.7 billion, our analysis showed that about $13.3 billion was for business applications and related infrastructure. Of the $13.3 billion, our analysis of the budget request disclosed that about $8.4 billion was for infrastructure and related costs. Business applications include activities that support the business functions of the department, such as personnel, health, travel, acquisition, finance and accounting, and logistics. The remaining $15.4 billion was classified as being for national security systems. Of that amount, our analysis ascertained that about $7.5 billion was for infrastructure and related costs. Of the $13.3 billion, $10.7 billion was for the operation and maintenance of the existing systems and $2.6 billion was for the modernization of existing systems, the development of new systems, or both. Table 1 shows the distribution, by DOD component, of the reported $13.3 billion between current services and modernization funding. Incorrect system classification hinders the department’s efforts to improve its control and accountability over its business systems investments. Our comparison of the fiscal years 2004 and 2005 budget requests disclosed that DOD reclassified 56 systems in the fiscal year 2005 budget request from business systems to national security systems, which are not subject to the same level of investment control. The net effect of the reclassifications was a decrease of approximately $6 billion in the fiscal year 2005 budget request for business systems and related infrastructure. The reported amount declined from about $19 billion in fiscal year 2004 to over $13 billion in fiscal year 2005. In some cases, we found that the reclassification appeared reasonable. The reclassification of the Defense Information System Network initiative as a national security system appeared reasonable since it provides a secure telecommunication network—voice, data, and video—to the President, the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and military personnel in the field. However, our analysis of the 56 systems also identified instances for which reclassification was questionable. For example, Base Level Communication Infrastructure—initiative number 254—for several DOD entities was shown as a national security system in the fiscal year 2005 budget request. Our review of the fiscal year 2005 budget found that within the Air Force, there were numerous other initiatives entitled Base Level Communication Infrastructure that were classified as business systems, not national security systems. The nomenclature describing these different initiatives was the same. Therefore, it was difficult to ascertain why certain initiatives were classified as national security systems while others, with the same name, were classified as business systems. In another example, this is the first year in which the Navy enterprise resource planning (ERP) effort was listed in the budget and incorrectly classified as a national security system. Its forerunners, four pilot ERP projects, have been classified as business systems since their inception. DOD officials were not able to provide a valid explanation as to why the program was classified as a national security program. For the fiscal year 2006 budget request, the Navy has requested that the DOD CIO reclassify the program from a national security system to a business system. Improper classification diminishes Congress’s ability to effectively monitor and oversee the billions of dollars spent annually to maintain, operate, and modernize the department’s business systems environment. The department’s reported number of business systems continues to rise, and DOD does not yet have reasonable assurance that the currently reported number of business systems is complete. As of February 2005, DOD reported that its business systems inventory consisted of 4,150 systems, which is an increase of approximately 1,900 reported business systems since April 2003. Table 2 presents a comparison of the April 2003 and February 2005 reported business systems inventories by domain. The largest increase is due to the logistics domain increasing its reported inventory of business systems from 565 in April 2003 to the current 2,005. We reported in May 2004 that the logistics domain had validated about 1,900 business systems but had not yet entered most of them into the BMMP systems inventory. Logistics domain officials informed us that they completed that process and this increase was the result. Table 3 shows the distribution of the 4,150 business systems among the components and domains. The table shows the stovepiped, duplicative nature of DOD’s business systems. For example, there are 713 human resources systems across all components whose reported funding for fiscal year 2005 includes approximately $223 million for modernization and over $656 million for operation and maintenance. According to DOD officials, the Defense Integrated Military Human Resources System (DIMHRS) is intended to totally or partially replace 113 of these systems. We were informed that the remaining 600 human resources systems are to be reviewed in the context of DOD’s BEA, as it is developed. In discussing the increase in the number of reported systems, some of the domains stated that funding for many of the systems are not included in the IT budget request. They said that some of these systems were likely developed at the local level and financed by the operation and maintenance funds received at that location and therefore were not captured and reported as part of the department’s annual IT budget request. Financing business systems in this manner rather than within the IT budget results in Congress and DOD management not being aware of the total amount being spent to operate, maintain, and modernize the department’s business systems. We found that DOD is not in compliance with the fiscal year 2003 defense authorization act, which requires that all financial system improvements with obligations exceeding $1 million be reviewed by the DOD Comptroller. Based upon the reported obligational data provided to us by the military services and the defense agencies for fiscal year 2004, we identified 30 modernizations with obligations totaling about $243 million that were not submitted for the required review. Because DOD lacks a systematic means to identify the systems that were subject to the requirements of the fiscal year 2003 defense authorization act, there is no certainty that the information provided to us accurately identified all systems improvements with obligations greater than $1 million during the fiscal year. BMMP officials stated that the domains were responsible for working with the components to make sure that business systems with obligations for modernizations greater than $1 million were submitted for review as required. In essence, compliance was achieved via the “honor system,” which relied on systems owners coming forward and requesting approval. However, the approach did not work. During fiscal year 2004, the number of systems reviewed was small when compared to the potential number of systems that appeared to meet the obligation threshold identified in the fiscal year 2004 budget request. We analyzed the DOD IT budget request for fiscal year 2004 and identified over 200 systems in the budget that could involve modernizations with obligations of funds that exceed the $1 million threshold. However, BMMP officials confirmed that only 46 systems were reviewed, of which 38 were approved as of September 30, 2004. The remaining 8 systems were either withdrawn by the component/domain or were returned to the component/domain because the system package submitted for review lacked some of the required supporting documentation, such as the review by the Office of Program Analysis and Evaluation, if necessary. In an attempt to substantiate that financial system improvements with over $1 million in obligations had in fact been reviewed by the DOD Comptroller, as provided for in the fiscal year 2003 act, we requested that DOD entities provide us with a list of obligations (by system) greater than $1 million for modernizations for fiscal year 2004. We compared the reported obligational data to the system approval data reported to us by BMMP officials. Based upon this comparison and as shown in table 4, DOD provided data showed that 30 business systems with obligations totaling about $243 million in fiscal year 2004 for modernizations were not reviewed by the DOD Comptroller. Examples of DOD business systems modernizations with obligations in excess of $1 million included in table 4 that were not submitted to the DOD Comptroller include the following. DFAS obligated about $3 million in fiscal year 2004 for the DFAS Corporate Database/DFAS Corporate Warehouse (DCD/DCW). In fiscal year 2003, DFAS obligated approximately $19 million for DCD/DCW without submitting it to the DOD Comptroller for review. Additionally, we reported in May 2004 that DFAS had yet to complete an economic analysis justifying that continued investment in DCD/DCW would result in tangible improvements in the department’s operations. The department has acknowledged that DCD/DCW will not result in tangible savings to DOD. Continued investment is being based upon intangible savings of man-hour reductions by DFAS. The Army obligated over $34 million for its Logistics Modernization Program (LMP) in fiscal year 2004. In fiscal year 2003, the Army obligated over $52 million without the prerequisite review being performed by the DOD Comptroller. We have previously reported that LMP experienced significant problems once it became operational at the first deployment site. Cumulatively, since passage of the fiscal year 2003 defense authorization act in December 2002 through the end of fiscal year 2004, based upon information reported to us, the military services and defense components obligated about $651 million for business systems modernizations without the required review by the DOD Comptroller. While this amount is significant, it is not complete or accurate because it does not include any fiscal year 2005 obligations that occurred prior to the enactment of the fiscal year 2005 defense authorization act on October 28, 2004. The statutory requirements enacted as part of the Ronald W. Reagan National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005 are aimed at improving the department’s business systems management practices. The act directs DOD to put in place a definite management structure that is responsible for the control and accountability over business systems investments by establishing a hierarchy of investment review boards from across the department and directs that the boards use a standard set of investment review and decision-making criteria to ensure compliance and consistency with the BEA. DOD has taken several steps to address provisions of the fiscal year 2005 defense authorization act. On March 19, 2005, the Deputy Secretary of Defense delegated the authority for the review, approval, and oversight of the planning, design, acquisition, development, operation, maintenance, and modernization of defense business systems to the designated approval authority for each business area. Additionally on March 24, 2005, the Deputy Secretary of Defense directed the transfer of program management, oversight, and support responsibilities regarding DOD business transformation efforts from the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, (Comptroller), to the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics. According to the directive, this transfer of functions and responsibilities will allow the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics to establish the level of activity necessary to support and coordinate activities of the newly established Defense Business Systems Management Committee (DBSMC). As required by the act, DBSMC, with representation including the Deputy Secretary of Defense, the designated approval authorities, secretaries of the military services, and heads of the defense agencies, is the highest ranking governance body responsible for overseeing DOD business systems modernization efforts. I would like to reiterate two suggestions for legislative consideration that I discussed in my July 2004 testimony, which I believe could further improve the likelihood of successful business transformation at DOD. Most of the key elements necessary for successful transformation could be achieved under the current legislative framework; however, addressing sustained and focused leadership for DOD business transformation and funding control will require additional legislation. These suggestions include the appropriation of business system funding to the approval authorities responsible and accountable for business systems investments under provisions enacted by the Ronald W. Reagan National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005, and the creation of a CMO. DOD’s current business systems investment process, in which system funding is controlled by DOD components, has contributed to the evolution of an overly complex and error-prone information technology environment containing duplicative, nonintegrated, and stovepiped systems. We have made numerous recommendations to DOD to improve the management oversight and control of its business systems investments. However, as previously discussed, a provision of the Ronald W. Reagan National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005, established specific management oversight and accountability with the “owners” of the various core business mission areas. This legislation defines the scope of the various business areas (e.g., acquisition, finance, logistics, and etc.), and established functional approval authority and responsibility for management of the portfolio of business systems with the relevant under secretary of defense for the departmental core business mission areas and the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Networks and Information Integration (information technology infrastructure). For example, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics is now responsible and accountable for any defense business system intended to support acquisition activities, logistics activities, or installations and environment activities for DOD. This legislation also requires that the responsible approval authorities establish a hierarchy of investment review boards, the highest level being DBSMC, with DOD-wide representation, including the military services and defense agencies. The boards are responsible for reviewing and approving investments to develop, operate, maintain, and modernize business systems for their business-area portfolio, including ensuring that investments are consistent with DOD’s BEA. Although this recently enacted legislation clearly defines the roles and responsibilities of business systems investment approval authorities, control over the budgeting for and execution of funding for business systems investment activities remains at the DOD component level. As a result, DOD continues to have little or no assurance that its business systems investment money is being spent in an economical, efficient, and effective manner. Given that DOD spends billions on business systems and related infrastructure each year, we believe it is critical that those responsible for business systems improvements control the allocation and execution of funds for DOD business systems. However, implementation may require review of the various statutory authorities for the military services and other DOD components. Control over business systems investment funds would improve the capacity of DOD’s designated approval authorities to fulfill their responsibilities and gain transparency over DOD investments, and minimize the parochial approach to systems development that exists today. In addition, to improve coordination and integration activities, we suggest that all approval authorities coordinate their business systems modernization efforts with a CMO who would chair the DBSMC. Cognizant business area approval authorities would also be required to report to Congress through a CMO and the Secretary of Defense on applicable business systems that are not compliant with review requirements and to include a summary justification for noncompliance. As DOD embarks on large-scale business transformation efforts, we believe that the complexity and long-term nature of these efforts requires the development of an executive position capable of providing strong and sustained change management leadership across the department—and over a number of years and various administrations. One way to ensure such leadership would be to create by legislation a full-time executive-level II position for a CMO, who would serve as the Deputy Secretary of Defense for Management. This position would elevate, integrate, and institutionalize the high-level attention essential for ensuring that a strategic business transformation plan—as well as the business policies, procedures, systems, and processes that are necessary for successfully implementing and sustaining overall business transformation efforts within DOD—are implemented and sustained. An executive-level II position for a CMO would provide this individual with the necessary institutional clout to overcome service parochialism and entrenched organizational silos, which in our opinion need to be streamlined below the service secretaries and other levels. The CMO would function as a change agent, while other DOD officials would still be responsible for managing their daily business operations. The position would divide and institutionalize the current functions of the Deputy Secretary of Defense into a Deputy Secretary who, as the alter ego of the Secretary, would focus on policy-related issues such as military transformation, and a Deputy Secretary of Defense for Management, the CMO, who would be responsible and accountable for the overall business transformation effort and would serve full-time as the strategic integrator of DOD’s business transformation efforts by, for example, developing and implementing a strategic and integrated plan for business transformation efforts. The CMO would not conduct the day-to-day management functions of the department; therefore, creating this position would not add an additional hierarchical layer to the department. Day-to-day management functions of the department would continue to be the responsibility of the undersecretaries of defense, the service secretaries, and others. Just as the CMO would need to focus full-time on business transformation, we believe that the day-to-day management functions are so demanding that it is difficult for these officials to maintain the oversight, focus, and momentum needed to implement and sustain needed reforms of DOD’s overall business operations. This is particularly evident given the demands that the Iraq and Afghanistan postwar reconstruction activities and the continuing war on terrorism have placed on current leaders. Likewise, the breadth and complexity of the problems and their overall level within the department preclude the under secretaries, such as the DOD Comptroller, from asserting the necessary authority over selected players and business areas while continuing to fulfill their other responsibilities. If created, we believe that the new CMO position could be filled by an individual appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, for a set term of 7 years. As prior GAO work examining the experiences of major change management initiatives in large private and public sector organizations has shown, it can often take at least 5 to 7 years until such initiatives are fully implemented and the related cultures are transformed in a sustainable way. Articulating the roles and responsibilities of the position in statute would also help to create unambiguous expectations and underscore Congress’s desire to follow a professional, nonpartisan, sustainable, and institutional approach to the position. In that regard, an individual appointed to the CMO position should have a proven track record as a business process change agent in large, complex, and diverse organizations—experience necessary to spearhead business process transformation across DOD. Furthermore, to improve coordination and integration activities, we suggest that all business systems modernization approval authorities designated in the Ronald W. Reagan National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005 coordinate their efforts with the CMO, who would chair the DBSMC that DOD recently established to comply with the act. We also suggest that cognizant business area approval authorities would also be required to report to Congress through the CMO and the Secretary of Defense on applicable business systems that are not compliant with review requirements and include a summary justification for noncompliance. In addition, the CMO would enter into an annual performance agreement with the Secretary that sets forth measurable individual goals linked to overall organizational goals in connection with the department’s business transformation efforts. Measurable progress toward achieving agreed-upon goals should be a basis for determining the level of compensation earned, including any related bonus. In addition, the CMO’s achievements and compensation should be reported to Congress each year. As previously noted, on April 14, 2005, a bill was introduced in the Senate that requires the establishment of a CMO who would be appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, for a set term of 7 years. DOD lacks the efficient and effective financial management and related business operations, including processes and systems, to support the war fighter, DOD management, and Congress. With a large and growing fiscal imbalance facing our nation, achieving tens of billions of dollars of annual savings through successful DOD transformation is increasingly important. Recent legislation pertaining to defense business systems, enterprise architecture, accountability, and modernization, if properly implemented, should improve oversight and control over DOD’s significant system investment activities. However, DOD’s transformation efforts to date have not adequately addressed key underlying causes of past reform failures. Reforming DOD’s business operations is a monumental challenge and many well-intentioned efforts have failed over the last several decades. Lessons learned from these previous reform attempts include the need for sustained and focused leadership at the highest level. This leadership could be provided through the establishment of a CMO. Absent this leadership, authority, and control of funding, the current transformation efforts are likely to fail. I commend the Subcommittee for holding this hearing and I encourage you to use this vehicle, on an annual basis, as a catalyst for long overdue business transformation at DOD. Mr. Chairman, this concludes my statement. For further information about this testimony, please contact Gregory D. Kutz at (202) 512-9095 or kutzg@gao.gov. The following individuals contributed to the various reports and testimonies that were the basis for the testimony: Beatrice Alff, Renee Brown, Donna Byers, Molly Boyle, Mary Ellen Chervenic, Francine DelVecchio, Francis Dymond, Geoff Frank, Gina Flacco, Diane Handley, Cynthia Jackson, Evelyn Logue, John Martin, Elizabeth Mead, Dave Moser, Mai Nguyen, Sharon Pickup, David\n\n### Summary:\n\n", "answer": "In July 2004, GAO testified before Congress on the impact and causes of financial and related business weaknesses on the Department of Defense's (DOD) operations and the status of DOD reform efforts. The report released today highlights that DOD still does not have management controls to ensure that its business systems investments are directed towards integrated corporate system solutions. GAO's reports continue to show that fundamental problems with DOD's financial management and related business operations result in substantial waste and inefficiency, adversely impact mission performance, and result in a lack of adequate accountability across all major business areas. Over the years, DOD leaders attempted to address these weaknesses and transform the department. For years, GAO has reported that DOD is challenged in its efforts to effect fundamental financial and business management reform and GAO's ongoing work continues to raise serious questions about DOD's chances of success. Congress asked GAO to provide information on the (1) pervasive long-standing financial and business management weaknesses that affect DOD's efficiency, (2) cost of and control over the department's business systems investments, and (3) legislative actions needed to enhance the success of DOD's business transformation efforts. Overhauling the financial management and business operations of one of the largest and most complex organizations in the world represents a daunting challenge. Eight DOD program areas, representing key business functions, are on GAO's high-risk list, and the department shares responsibility for six other governmentwide high-risk areas, meaning that DOD is fully or partially responsible for 14 of the 25 high-risk areas in the federal government. DOD's substantial financial and business management weaknesses adversely affect not only its ability to produce auditable financial information, but also to provide accurate, complete, and timely information for management and Congress to use in making informed decisions. Further, the lack of adequate accountability across all of DOD's major business areas results in billions of dollars in annual wasted resources in a time of increasing fiscal constraint and has a negative impact on mission performance. The department has recently taken several steps to address provisions of the fiscal year 2005 defense authorization act which are aimed at improving DOD's business systems management practices. For example, DOD has established the Defense Business Systems Management Committee to oversee its business systems modernization efforts. However, DOD's overall transformation efforts have not adequately addressed the key causes of past reform failures. Lessons learned from these previous reform attempts include the need for sustained leadership at the highest level and a strategic and integrated plan. The seriousness of DOD's weaknesses underscores the importance of no longer condoning the \"status quo.\" To improve the likelihood that DOD's transformation efforts will succeed, GAO proposes that business systems funding be appropriated to the approval authorities responsible for business systems investments.

In 1998, Medicare insured approximately 39 million people. All beneficiaries can receive health care through Medicare’s traditional fee-for-service arrangement, and many beneficiaries live in areas where they also have the option of receiving their health care through a managed care plan. Of the almost 7 million Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in managed care as of March 1999, nearly all were enrolled in plans whose MCOs receive a fixed monthly fee from Medicare for each beneficiary they serve. Total Medicare spending is expected to reach about $216 billion in fiscal year 1999, with managed care’s portion reaching approximately $37 billion. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) established the Medicare+Choice program as a replacement for Medicare’s previous managed care program. Medicare+Choice was intended to expand beneficiaries’ health plan options by permitting new types of plans, such as preferred provider organizations and provider-sponsored organizations, to participate in Medicare. BBA also established an annual, coordinated enrollment period to begin in 1999 during which beneficiaries may enroll or change enrollment in a Medicare+Choice plan. Previously, MCOs were required to have at least one 30-day period each year when they accepted new members, but most MCOs accepted new members throughout the entire year. Also, before BBA, Medicare beneficiaries could join or leave a plan on a monthly basis. Beginning in January 2002, Medicare beneficiaries will no longer be able to enroll and disenroll on a monthly basis. If they experience problems with a plan, identify a better enrollment option, or simply have second thoughts, beneficiaries will have a limited time each year to change the election they made during the coordinated enrollment period. Afterwards, they will be “locked into” their health plan decision for the remainder of the year. Each plan’s benefit package is defined through a contracting process that establishes the minimum benefits a plan must offer and the maximum fees it may charge during a calendar year. After a benefit package is approved by HCFA, a plan may not reduce benefits or increase fees until the next contract cycle. A BIF, which is included in an MCO’s contract as an exhibit, describes in detail the services, copayments, and monthly premiums associated with each plan. HCFA’s central and regional offices are involved in reviewing plans’ marketing materials, which include member literature. The central office negotiates contracts and establishes national policy regarding marketing material review. HCFA’s regional offices review marketing materials when submitted throughout the year and require MCOs to change the materials when they omit required information or are inaccurate, misleading, or unclear. While some regional offices may review materials that certain organizations distribute nationwide, generally each regional office is responsible for reviewing the materials to be distributed within its geographic jurisdiction. To verify the accuracy of benefit information, regional staff are instructed to check plan materials against the BIF. HCFA staff also verify that MCOs have included certain information in their materials, such as explanations of provider restrictions and beneficiary appeal rights. HCFA provides guidance for both developing and reviewing marketing materials through its contract manual, marketing guidelines, and operational policy letters. Despite HCFA’s authority to do so, the agency does not require MCOs to use standard formats or terminology in their marketing materials. According to HCFA regulations, if HCFA staff do not disapprove submitted materials within 45 days, the materials are deemed approved, and MCOs may distribute the materials to beneficiaries. Review procedures established by several regional offices allow “contingent approval”; that is, the materials are approved on the condition that the MCOs make specific corrections. When contingent approval is given, procedures in three regions call for HCFA staff to verify that the MCOs have made the required corrections before the materials are published and distributed to beneficiaries. (See fig. 1.) Historically, HCFA has done little to address beneficiaries’ need for comparable and unbiased information about Medicare managed care plans. In 1996, we reported that beneficiaries received little or no comparable information on Medicare health maintenance organizations and that the lack of information standards made it difficult for beneficiaries to compare plans’ member literature. At that time, we recommended that HCFA produce plan comparison charts and require plans to use standard formats and terminology in key aspects of their marketing materials. BBA mandated that HCFA undertake a number of activities to provide Medicare beneficiaries with information about their health plan options. Beginning in November 1998, HCFA was required to provide an annual national educational and publicity campaign to inform beneficiaries about the availability of Medicare+Choice plans and the enrollment process. Also, each fall starting in 1999, HCFA must distribute to beneficiaries an array of general information about the traditional Medicare program, supplemental insurance, appeal and other rights, the process for enrolling in a Medicare+Choice plan, and the potential for Medicare+Choice contract termination. At the same time, HCFA must provide each Medicare beneficiary with a list of available Medicare+Choice plans and a comparison of plan options. All of these activities are designed to coincide with and support the coordinated open enrollment period slated to occur each November starting in 1999. HCFA’s goal is to make beneficiaries aware of their health plan options and to provide some summary information to help beneficiaries compare those options. According to HCFA officials, in 1999 each beneficiary will receive a Medicare handbook that contains some comparable information about available health plans. Beneficiaries who want more information may call HCFA’s toll-free telephone number (1-800-MEDICAR) or log onto the Internet Web site (www.medicare.gov). All of these resources—the Medicare handbook, toll-free telephone number, and Web site—are designed to help beneficiaries identify enrollment options and compare selected aspects of benefits. To obtain detailed information about specific plans, however, beneficiaries must continue to rely on MCOs’ sales agents and member materials. (See fig. 2.) Our investigation of 16 MCOs uncovered flaws in their plans’ member literature, beneficiaries’ only source of detailed benefit information. Much of the MCOs’ plan literature contained errors or omissions about mammography and prescription drug benefits, ranging from minor oversights to major discrepancies. While we found no errors about ambulance services, some MCOs’ member literature omitted information about the benefit. Moreover, beneficiaries frequently did not receive important information until after enrollment. Even then, beneficiaries in some plans received member literature that was incomplete and did not fully disclose plan benefits, exclusions, and fees. The lack of full disclosure in member literature leaves the beneficiary vulnerable to unexpected service denials and additional out-of-pocket fees. Making comparisons among health plans’ benefits remains challenging because of the use of nonstandard formats and terminology. In contrast, FEHBP participants received plan brochures that contained relatively complete benefit descriptions presented in a standard format. We found significant errors and omissions in the plans’ member literature that MCOs distributed to beneficiaries. For example, effective January 1998, HCFA required organizations to cover annual screening mammograms and to permit beneficiaries to obtain this service without a physician’s referral. Also, MCOs were required to notify beneficiaries of this new Medicare benefit. Materials from five MCOs, however, explicitly stated that beneficiaries must obtain physician referrals to obtain screening mammograms. (See fig. 3 for three examples.) Member literature from five other organizations failed to inform beneficiaries of their right to self-refer for this service. Much of the MCOs’ member literature provided incorrect or inconsistent information about prescription drug coverage. For example, the member literature for a large, experienced Medicare MCO specified an annual dollar limit for prescription drugs that was lower than the amount required by the organization’s Medicare contract. The contract required the provision of unlimited generic drugs and coverage of at least $1,200 for brand-name drugs. This MCO’s materials, which varied by county, understated the brand-name drug coverage, listing annual dollar limits as low as $600. When we contacted the MCO officials, they confirmed that they were providing the lower benefit coverage. On the basis of the MCO’s enrollment for 1998, we estimated that about 130,000 members could have been denied part of the benefit that Medicare paid for and to which they were entitled under the MCO’s contract. Another MCO provided conflicting information about its prescription drug benefit. In one document, the MCO alternately described its prescription drug benefit as having a $200 monthly limit and a $300 monthly limit. (The correct limit was $300.) In another case, an MCO used the same member literature for four separate plans, emphasizing that all members were entitled to prescription drug benefits. Actually, however, only two of the four plans offered a prescription drug benefit. The member literature we reviewed did not contain errors regarding ambulance services, but the documents often omitted important information about the benefit. One MCO did not include any reference to the benefit in its preenrollment member literature. Three other MCOs stated that ambulance services were covered “per Medicare regulations” but did not define Medicare’s coverage. Most of the remaining MCOs provided general descriptions of their ambulance coverage but did not give details of the extent of the coverage, such as whether the MCOs would pay for out-of-area ambulance service in an emergency. Officials from several MCOs told us that their organizations typically issue a member policy booklet—a document that discloses the details of a plan’s benefit coverage, benefit restrictions, and beneficiary rights—after a beneficiary enrolls. Moreover, MCOs often provided enrollees with outdated member policy documents. For example, one MCO failed to provide enrollees with a current member policy document until August 1998—8 months after the start of the new benefits year. Distributing outdated information can be misleading. HCFA allows MCOs to use outdated plan member materials as long as the organizations attach an addendum indicating any changes to the benefit package. HCFA officials believe that this policy is reasonable because beneficiaries can determine a plan’s coverage by comparing the changes cited in the addendum with the prior year’s literature. However, some MCOs distributed outdated literature without the required addendum. When MCOs did include the addendum, the document did not always clearly indicate that its information superseded the information contained in other documents. In addition, some MCOs did not provide dates on their literature, which obscured the fact that the literature was outdated. Adequate preenrollment benefit information will become even more crucial in 2001, as BBA’s annual enrollment provisions begin to take effect in 2002 and Medicare beneficiaries are no longer able to disenroll on a monthly basis. To help beneficiaries make informed choices, BBA requires HCFA to provide beneficiaries with summary plan information before the annual November enrollment period. Furthermore, new regulations now require MCOs to issue letters by mid-October each year describing benefit changes that will be effective January 1 of the following year. MCOs must send these annual notification letters to all enrollees, and to any prospective enrollees upon request. However, HCFA has not required MCOs to provide more complete member literature prior to enrollment. As a result, beneficiaries still might not have the information they need to make sound enrollment choices. Additionally, beneficiaries enrolling in plans before 2002 may be unaware that their plans may be terminating services shortly after the beneficiaries have enrolled. A plan must notify its members at least 60 to 90 days before it ends services. However, there is no requirement that a terminating plan stop advertising and enrolling new members, with the result that in 1998, some beneficiaries unknowingly joined plans that soon exited the Medicare program. For example, one MCO notified its members in May 1998 of its intent to end services in several Ohio counties. The MCO continued to advertise and enroll new beneficiaries without informing them that plan services would end on December 31, 1998. After inquiries from beneficiaries, the MCO ceased marketing activities in July. Although these marketing activities angered many beneficiaries, the MCO was operating within HCFA’s notification requirements. Some beneficiaries do not receive important information about plan benefits and restrictions even after they have enrolled in a plan. Because HCFA’s instructions regarding benefit disclosure are vague, MCOs vary in the amount of information they provide to beneficiaries. Some organizations we reviewed provided relatively complete descriptions of plan coverage in a member policy booklet or similar document. However, other MCOs did not disclose important restrictions in any member literature. In fact, MCOs that adopt HCFA’s suggested disclosure language will send beneficiaries to an information dead end. In the guidelines it provides to MCOs, HCFA suggests that a plan’s “evidence of coverage,” a document frequently referred to as a member policy booklet, direct beneficiaries to the MCO’s Medicare contract to obtain full details on the benefit package. According to HCFA, a member policy booklet should state that “ constitutes only a summary of the . . . . The contract between HCFA and the [MCO] must be consulted to determine the exact terms and conditions of coverage.” HCFA officials responsible for Medicare contracts, however, said that if a beneficiary requested a contract, the agency would not provide it because of the proprietary information included in an MCO’s adjusted community rate proposal. Furthermore, an MCO is not required, according to HCFA officials, to provide beneficiaries with copies of its Medicare contract. MCO officials we spoke with differed on whether their organization would distribute copies of its contract to beneficiaries. By establishing an MCO’s Medicare contract—a document that is not usually available to beneficiaries—as the only document required to fully explain the plan’s benefit coverage, HCFA cannot ensure that beneficiaries are aware of the benefits to which they are entitled. Vague or incomplete benefit descriptions leave beneficiaries vulnerable to unexpected service denials. For example, disputes sometimes arise when beneficiaries are told they do not have the coverage they believed they would have when they enrolled. An official from the Center for Health Dispute Resolution (CHDR), HCFA’s contractor that adjudicates managed care appeal cases, told us that CHDR uses the information in MCOs’ member literature to determine whether plan members are entitled to specific benefits that are not covered by Medicare fee-for-service. When an MCO’s literature is vague, CHDR allows the MCO to submit internal plan memorandums that clarify its benefit coverage. But beneficiaries generally do not receive these internal memorandums. Consequently, beneficiaries who must rely on incomplete member literature and sales agents’ verbal interpretations of this literature are likely to be unaware of important benefit limitations or restrictions. Inconsistent formats and terminology made comparisons among plans’ benefit packages difficult. We generally had to read multiple documents to determine each plan’s benefit coverage for mammography, prescription drugs, and ambulance services. Answering a set of basic questions about three plans’ prescription drug benefits, for example, required a detailed review of twelve documents: two from plan A, five from plan B, and five from plan C (see fig. 4). It was not easy to know where to look for the information. For example, we found the answer to the question of whether a plan used a formulary in plan A’s summary of benefits, plan B’s Medicare prescription drug rider, and plan C’s contract amendment. Plan C’s materials required more careful review to answer the question because the membership contract indicated the plan did not provide drug coverage. However, an amendment—included in the member contract as a loose insert—indicated coverage for prescription drugs and the use of a formulary. As in previous studies, we found plans’ materials did not use comparable terms or formats. For example, it was difficult to determine whether the three plans offered by one MCO covered nonemergency ambulance transportation, because each plan’s materials used different terms to describe the benefit. The lack of clear and uniform benefit information almost certainly impedes informed decision-making. HCFA officials in almost every region noted that a standard format for key member literature, along with clear and standard terminology, would help beneficiaries compare their health plan options. FEHBP, administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), is similar to the new Medicare+Choice program in that it serves a large and diverse population, allows participation of different types of health care organizations, and allows plans’ benefit packages to vary. Unlike HCFA, however, OPM requires FEHBP plan materials to follow standard formats and terms. OPM officials believe this requirement helps FEHBP members make informed decisions. FEHBP health care organizations produce a single, standard brochure for each plan that is the “contractual document” between the member and the organization. This brochure is a complete description of the plan’s benefits, limitations, and exclusions. The 1999 FEHBP brochure explicitly states the following objective: “This brochure is the official statement of benefits on which you can rely. A person enrolled in the Plan is entitled to the benefits stated in this brochure.” OPM officials said that the brochures must describe what each plan’s coverage includes, as well as what it excludes, so that there is less chance for misunderstanding. The benefit information must be listed in a prescribed format and language to facilitate members’ comparisons among plan options, but OPM’s standards allow variation in some language to accommodate differences in plans’ benefits and procedures. Each plan’s brochure must include a benefit summary presented in OPM’s prescribed format. OPM officials update the mandatory brochure language every year to reflect changes in the FEHBP’s requirements and organizations’ requests for improvements to the language. Finally, OPM requires organizations to distribute plan brochures prior to the FEHBP annual open enrollment period so that prospective enrollees have complete information on which to base their decisions. OPM officials told us that all participating organizations publish brochures that adhere to OPM’s standards. Although OPM’s process for reviewing and approving member literature is generally similar to HCFA’s, it differs in important ways. The process begins when FEHBP organizations submit benefit coverage information to OPM in standard brochure format. OPM contract specialists then review the brochures to verify compliance with mandatory terminology and format requirements and to ensure that nonstandard information is presented appropriately, given the plans’ benefit packages and organizational structures. For example, organizations offering fee-for-service (indemnity) plans would use different language in describing plan procedures and restrictions than MCOs would. Organizations are then responsible for printing and distributing the brochures. To verify the accuracy of the final documents, OPM obtains 20 brochures from each plan’s first print run. According to an OPM official, if OPM contract reviewers identify errors, they can require organizations to attach an addendum, reprint the brochures, or pay a fine. The official said that any errors identified are generally minor and are corrected through an addendum attached to the brochures. Although HCFA approved all the member literature we reviewed, weaknesses in three critical elements of the agency’s review process allowed errors to go uncorrected and important information to be omitted. Our review showed that the structure of HCFA’s contracting documents has created problems in determining the accuracy of plan materials and has resulted in the omission of important benefit details by several organizations. Additionally, HCFA’s lack of consistent standards has contributed to inconsistent reviews and extra work and may have increased the chance of errors slipping through the review process undetected. Moreover, MCOs have failed to correct plan materials as required by HCFA staff. HCFA has begun to address some, but not all, of the issues we have identified. MCOs’ Medicare contracts, which include the BIF, establish the foundation for HCFA’s review of marketing materials. HCFA reviewers are instructed to use the BIF to check that plan member literature accurately reflects the contracted benefits and member fees. Reviewers told us, however, that the BIFs often do not provide the required detail, and our work revealed that the BIFs did not provide consistent or complete benefit descriptions. For instance, the BIFs did not always specify whether a plan’s prescription drug benefit covered only specific drugs. Restricting coverage to a list of specific drugs, or a formulary, is a common element of plans’ benefit packages. Yet of our sample of 16 MCOs, 14 used formularies in one or more of the plans they offered, but only 8 disclosed this restriction in their BIFs. Because BIFs are often incomplete, reviewers sometimes rely on benefit summary sheets provided by MCOs to verify the accuracy of plan materials. This practice is contrary to HCFA policy, which requires an independent review of the MCOs’ plan literature. The reviewers who approved the erroneous materials cited earlier explained that some of the errors might have occurred because the MCOs’ summary sheets incorrectly described plans’ benefits. This was the explanation given by the reviewer who approved the plan member literature advertising a $600 annual benefit limit for brand-name prescription drugs instead of the contracted $1,200 annual limit. The lack of detailed standards for plans’ member literature can result in misleading comparisons and put some MCOs at a competitive disadvantage. Without detailed standards, HCFA reviewers have wide discretion in approving or rejecting plan materials. The MCO representatives and HCFA officials we spoke with said that this latitude leads to inconsistent HCFA decisions. An MCO official told us that, while several plans in a market area required a copayment for ambulance services if a beneficiary was not admitted to a hospital, not all plans were required to disclose that fact. The HCFA reviewer responsible for one plan’s materials required the plan to disclose the fee, yet different HCFA staff in the same regional office who reviewed other plans’ materials did not require similar disclosure. These inconsistent review practices caused one plan’s benefits to appear less generous, even though several other plans had similar benefit restrictions. The lack of mandatory format and terminology standards for key member literature, such as benefit summary brochures and member policy booklets, increases the amount of time and effort needed to review and approve plans’ member literature. Moreover, unlike many government programs, Medicare does not require MCOs to use standard forms for such typical administrative functions as enrollment, disenrollment, and appeals. Instead, each organization creates its own forms. Consequently, HCFA staff spend a great deal of time reviewing disparate documents that could be routine forms. Several reviewers commented that the volume and complexity of MCOs’ member literature contributed to the likelihood that errors would pass through the review process undetected. Agency staff said that they could spend more time reviewing important member documents, such as member policy booklets, if HCFA required the use of standard forms for administrative functions. HCFA officials recognize that standardizing key documents and terms would facilitate their review of plans’ marketing materials and reduce the administrative burden on both HCFA and MCOs. Some agency officials expressed concern, however, that MCOs might resist efforts to standardize the way information is presented. In fact, many of the MCO officials we spoke with said they would welcome some standardization because it could save them time and money. One MCO official commented that MCOs may not be using HCFA’s current guidelines and suggested standards because they are voluntary and use language that is legalistic and confusing to beneficiaries. Several MCO officials stressed that any mandatory standards should be developed with industry input and with the advice of professional marketing specialists. MCOs are responsible for correcting errors in their marketing materials and distributing accurate information. Some HCFA reviewers told us that they do not approve marketing materials until the MCO has corrected all identified errors. Other HCFA reviewers told us that they give contingent approval—that is, they approve the material if the MCO agrees to make specific corrections. The MCO is required to send a copy of the print-ready document to HCFA so the reviewer can verify that the corrections were made. Reviewers often did not have copies of the print-ready or final documents in their files, however. Several reviewers admitted that it was difficult to get the final documents from MCOs and that they generally trust the organizations to publish materials as approved or to make the corrections outlined in approval letters. Moreover, reviewers noted that the contingent approval practice was adopted to expedite reviews when materials required only minor corrections. However, MCOs did not always correct the errors HCFA identified during the review process. We reviewed one plan’s summary of benefits that incorrectly commingled 1997 and 1998 benefit information. The document we received from the MCO official contained several handwritten notations correcting inaccurate benefit information. For example, the copayment for prescription drugs was listed as $5, but a handwritten note indicated that there was no copayment for generic drugs. The HCFA staff member responsible for approving the material showed us a working copy of the document on which she had indicated the need for numerous changes. The published document we observed, however, did not incorporate many of these corrections. The reviewer had been unaware that the published document contained errors because she had never received a print-ready copy from the MCO. HCFA has undertaken several efforts to address some of the problems we identified during our review. The agency is developing a new plan benefit package (PBP) that it hopes will replace the BIF. The PBP’s new format improves upon the BIF by standardizing the information collected from each plan. The PBP includes detailed checklists that make it easier to obtain consistent benefit information from plans. However, the PBP is flexible enough to capture benefit features that do not fit neatly into a predetermined checklist. Using the PBP should also facilitate efforts to standardize member literature. HCFA intends to pilot test the PBP with a few MCOs this year for contract submissions effective in 2000. HCFA officials estimate that the PBP proposal will need to begin the Office of Management and Budget’s clearance process no later than August 1999 to achieve full implementation by 2000. Otherwise, full implementation could be delayed. Agency officials also recognize the importance of more uniform member literature and have articulated their intent to standardize key documents in future years. As a first step, HCFA established a work group to develop a standard format and common language for all plans’ benefit summaries. HCFA hopes to establish the benefit summary by May and plans to use it in the fall 1999 benefit summary brochures. Achieving this goal will require HCFA’s work group to reach consensus on standards for clear and accurate information and to avoid imposing burdensome requirements on MCOs. HCFA’s long-term goals include establishing standards for other key documents, but the agency has not yet developed a coordinated strategy for its long-term efforts or decided whether such standards will be voluntary or mandatory. Beneficiaries who enrolled or considered enrolling in the plans we reviewed were not well-served by plans’ efforts to produce member materials or HCFA’s review of them. The information that plans distributed was often confusing and hard to compare. Some plans distributed inaccurate or incomplete information or provided the information after beneficiaries had made their enrollment decisions, when it was less useful. These problems significantly limited beneficiaries’ ability to make informed decisions about their health plan options. Moreover, some beneficiaries may have been denied health care coverage to which they were entitled or required to pay unexpected out-of-pocket fees. In contrast, each FEHBP plan must provide prospective enrollees with a single, comprehensive brochure to facilitate comparisons and informed enrollment choices. Revisions to HCFA’s current review process and procedures could greatly improve the quality of plans’ member literature. For example, full implementation of HCFA’s new contract form for describing plans’ benefit coverage, the PBP, could help ensure that approved member literature is accurate and fully discloses important plan information. Similarly, standard terminology and formats for key member literature would facilitate full disclosure and provide beneficiaries with comparable plan information. Moreover, new standards for the distribution of key member literature would enable beneficiaries to have the information they need when they need it. The required use of standard forms for routine administrative functions, such as member enrollment, could reduce HCFA’s workload and allow staff to spend more time reviewing important member literature. Finally, efforts to standardize review procedures would help ensure consistent application of the agency’s marketing material review policy. In October 1996, we recommended that the Secretary of Health and Human Services direct the HCFA Administrator to (1) require standard formats and terminology for important aspects of MCOs’ marketing materials, including benefits descriptions, and (2) require that all literature distributed by organizations follow these standards. Although HCFA has taken initial steps toward this end, significant work remains. Therefore, we are both renewing our previous recommendations and recommending that the HCFA Administrator take the following additional actions to help Medicare beneficiaries make informed health care decisions and reduce the administrative burden on agency staff and MCOs. Require MCOs to produce one standard, FEHBP-like document for each plan that completely describes plan benefit coverage and limitations, and require MCOs to distribute this document during sales presentations and upon request. Fully implement HCFA’s new contract form for describing plans’ benefit coverage, the PBP, for the 2001 contract submissions to facilitate the collection of comparable benefit information and help ensure full disclosure of plans’ benefits. Develop standard forms for appeals and enrollment. Take steps to ensure consistent application of the agency’s marketing material review policy. HCFA agreed with our findings that the agency’s review process and procedures need to be strengthened in order to ensure that beneficiaries receive accurate and useful information. The agency also concurred with our recommendations to improve the oversight of Medicare+Choice organizations’ marketing materials and to require the use of standardized formats and language in plans’ member materials. HCFA has steps under way that may help correct some of the problems we found. For example, the agency is developing a standardized summary of benefits document and intends to require Medicare+Choice organizations to use the document beginning in November 1999. While HCFA’s efforts may standardize important aspects of plans’ materials, such as information about appeal rights, these efforts stop short of requiring Medicare+Choice organizations to provide a single standard and comprehensive document that describes plan benefits and beneficiaries’ rights and responsibilities as plan members. HCFA believes that Medicare+Choice organizations should retain the flexibility to develop materials that differentiate their services from those provided by other Medicare+Choice organizations. We agree that MCOs should be able to differentiate their plans. However, requiring MCOs to provide an FEHBP-like brochure, in addition to other plan materials, would preserve the MCOs’ flexibility and provide Medicare beneficiaries with more complete and comparable information than they may currently receive. In fact, these standard brochures may encourage plans to compete on real differences in plan features. The full text of HCFA’s comments appears in appendix II. As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce its contents earlier, we plan no further distribution of this report until 1 day after the date of this letter. At that time, we will send copies of this report to the Honorable Donna E. Shalala, Secretary of Health and Human Services; the Honorable Jacob Lew, Director, Office of Management and Budget; the Honorable Nancy-Ann Min DeParle, Administrator of the Health Care Financing Administration; and other interested parties. We will also make copies available to others upon request. This report was prepared under the direction of James Cosgrove, Assistant Director, by Marie James, Keith Steck, and George Duncan. If you or your staff have any questions about this report, please contact Mr. Cosgrove at (202) 512-7029 or me at (202) 512-7114. To do this work, we reviewed relevant policies and procedures at Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) headquarters and regional offices. We also interviewed HCFA officials at headquarters and at all regional offices and spoke with representatives of industry and beneficiary groups. We visited four regional offices (Atlanta, Chicago, Philadelphia, and San Francisco) that cover high managed care penetration areas. In addition, we analyzed 1998 member literature and Medicare contracts for 16 of the 346 MCO contracts effective in 1998 (4 from each region we visited). Our sample included MCOs that varied in enrollment levels, structure, location, and years of Medicare experience. Because each MCO can offer more than one plan—for example, a standard option and a high option—we reviewed key materials for a total of 26 plans. We considered key member literature to include benefit summary brochures, member policy booklets, member handbooks, and plan letters related to benefit changes. The plans we reviewed used various combinations of these key documents to disclose the details of their benefit packages, including benefit restrictions and members’ rights. Finally, we compared the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program and Medicare’s standards for plans’ member literature. Our analysis focused on three benefits that vary in complexity: ambulance transportation, annual screening mammography, and outpatient prescription drugs. We selected ambulance transportation and screening mammography because these benefits must be provided by all Medicare plans and are relatively simple to describe and understand. We selected the outpatient prescription drug benefit because it is complex, not covered by traditional Medicare, and an important consideration in many beneficiaries’ enrollment decisions.

GAO noted that: (1) although HCFA had reviewed and approved the materials GAO examined, all 16 MCOs in GAO's sample from four HCFA regions had distributed materials containing inaccurate or incomplete benefit information; (2) almost half of the organizations distributed materials that incorrectly described benefit coverage and the need for provider referrals; (3) one MCO marketed (and provided) a prescription drug benefit that was substantially less generous than the plan had agreed to provide in its Medicare contract; (4) moreover, some MCOs did not furnish complete information on plan benefits and restrictions until after a beneficiary had enrolled; (5) other MCOs never provided full descriptions of plan benefits and restrictions; (6) although not fully disclosing benefit coverage may hamper beneficiaries' decisionmaking, neither practice violates HCFA policy; (7) as GAO has reported previously, it was difficult to compare available options using member literature because each MCO independently chose the format and terms it used to describe its plan's benefit package; (8) in contrast, the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program's (FEHBP) plans are required to provide prospective enrollees with a single comprehensive and comparable brochure to facilitate informed enrollment choices; (9) the errors GAO identified in MCO's member literature went uncorrected because of weaknesses in three major elements of HCFA's review process; (10) limitations in the benefit information form (BIF), the contract form that HCFA reviewers use to determine whether plan materials are accurate, led some reviewers to rely on the MCOs themselves to help verify the accuracy of plan materials; (11) additionally, HCFA's lack of required format, terminology, and content standards for member literature created opportunities for inconsistent review practices; (12) according to some regional office staff, the lack of standards also increased the amount of time needed to review materials, which contributed to the likelihood that errors could slip through undetected; (13) HCFA's failure to ensure that MCOs corrected errors identified during the review process caused some beneficiaries to receive inaccurate information; and (14) HCFA is working to revise the BIF and develop a standard summary of benefits for plans to use--steps that will likely improve the agency's ability to review member literature and other marketing materials--but other steps could be taken to improve the usefulness and accuracy of plan information."}
{"original_length": 8289, "trunc_length": 8192, "text": "\n\nSummarize the following text into a summary of less than 800 words.\n### Text:\n\nElectromagnetic spectrum, commonly referred to as radio frequency spectrum or wireless spectrum, refers to electromagnetic waves that, with applied technology, can transmit signals to deliver voice, text, and video communications. Electromagnetic waves include radio waves, microwaves, infrared radiation, visible light, ultraviolet light, x-rays, and gamma radiation. The allocation and assignment of radio frequency spectrum are managed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for commercial and other nonfederal uses and by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) for federal government use. Wireless broadband, with its rich array of services and content, requires new spectrum capacity to accommodate growth. Spectrum capacity is necessary to deliver high speed, high quality communications to consumers and businesses and also to support the communications needs of industries that use spectrum-dependent technologies. Although radio frequency spectrum is abundant, usable spectrum is currently limited by the constraints of applied technology. Spectrum policy therefore requires making decisions about how radio frequencies will be allocated and who will have access to them. Current spectrum policy is based on managing channels of radio frequencies to avoid interference. The FCC, over many years, has developed and refined a system of exclusive licenses for users of specific frequencies. Auctions are a market-driven solution to assigning licenses to use specific frequencies and are a recent innovation in spectrum management and policy. Previously, the FCC granted licenses using a process known as \"comparative hearings\" (also known as \"beauty contests\"), and has used lotteries to distribute spectrum licenses. The FCC also allocates spectrum for designated purposes, such as Wi-Fi, without assigning a license to a specific owner (unlicensed spectrum). For purposes of allocation and assignment, spectrum is segmented into bands of radio frequencies measured in cycles per second, or hertz. Standard abbreviations for measuring frequencies include kHz—kilohertz or thousands of hertz; MHz—megahertz, or millions of hertz; and GHz—gigahertz, or billions of hertz. The designation can refer to an entire band, such as the 700 MHz band, or to specific frequencies within a band. Most licenses are issued on a geographic basis, serving a specific area (license coverage). More than one license, therefore, is likely to have the same frequency designation. Technology for commercial mobile services generally is designed to operate most efficiently on frequencies below 3 GHz, although the ceiling has moved higher as technology has changed, so that frequencies through 5 GHz are now considered desirable for commercial network deployment. Similarly, the bandwidth of assigned frequencies is increasing. With new technology, wider bandwidths have been shown to reduce interference and mitigate other problems hampering the efficient use of spectrum. The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 ( P.L. 112-96 ) was signed into law on February 22, 2012. Many of the provisions in Title VI of the act focus on spectrum assignment within the existing regulatory framework, in which licenses for designated radio frequencies are awarded through competitive bidding systems (auctions). Specific provisions of Title VI (frequently referred to as the Public Safety and Spectrum Act, or Spectrum Act) include expediting auctions of licenses for spectrum designated for mobile broadband; authorizing incentive auctions, which would permit television broadcasters to receive compensation for steps they might take to release some of their airwaves for mobile broadband; requiring that specified federal holdings be auctioned or reassigned for commercial use; and providing for the availability of spectrum for unlicensed use. Major provisions in the Spectrum Act that are summarized in this report cover Deficit reduction; Directed auctions; Incentive auctions for television broadcasters; Reallocation of spectrum from federal to commercial use; and Unlicensed spectrum. Other provisions in the act, not covered in this report, include simplifying the approval of zoning requests for modification of cell towers at the state and local level and putting in place measures to facilitate antenna placement on federal property. The act also provides for the establishment of a new authority to plan and develop a nationwide public safety broadband network (FirstNet) and other measures in support of improved emergency communications. The Spectrum Act addresses the interlaced issues of spectrum access and deficit reduction. The issues are connected because, when radio frequency spectrum licenses are auctioned for commercial purposes by the FCC, the net proceeds are typically deposited in the U.S. Treasury. The act has extended the FCC's auction authority until the end of FY2022. Because the FCC's authority would have expired at the end of FY2012, revenue from auctions held after FY2012 is considered new revenue. The legislation that first authorized the FCC to establish \"system of competitive bidding\" for a limited period was included in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 ( P.L. 103-66 ). The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 gave the FCC auction authority until September 30, 2007. This authority was extended to September 30, 2011, by the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 and to 2012 by the DTV Delay Act ( P.L. 111-4 ). The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 also specified that $7.363 billion of proceeds from auctions required by the act be applied to new spending as well as deficit reduction. Proceeds from auctions of licenses in designated spectrum as specified in the act are directed first into a Public Safety Trust Fund, created by the act, with nearly $28 billion designated for purposes defined in the act, including $20.4 billion for deficit reduction. Spectrum revenue above the designated amount is applied to deficit reduction. Proceeds from the sale of licenses of repurposed federal spectrum identified in the Spectrum Act will be directed first to the Spectrum Relocation Fund, to cover costs of moving federal users, with the balance going to the Public Safety Trust Fund. Proceeds from the sale of advanced wireless service licenses in the other spectrum bands identified by the act will go directly to the Public Safety Trust Fund. Proceeds from the auction of new licenses created by the release of television broadcasting spectrum will go to cover costs specified in the act, with the balance to the Public Safety Trust Fund. Balances remaining in any fund created by the act will revert to the Treasury in 2022 to be used \"for the sole purpose of deficit reduction.\" The law provides for transfers from a Public Safety Trust Fund that is created by the act to receive revenues from designated auctions of spectrum licenses. Any revenue beyond the amounts specified in the act goes to the Treasury for deficit reduction. A major beneficiary of funding is FirstNet (First Responder Network Authority), the nationwide broadband network to be developed for public safety communications. Auction proceeds are to be distributed in the following priority: To the NTIA, to reimburse the Treasury for funds advanced to cover the initial costs of establishing FirstNet: not to exceed $2 billion. To the State and Local Implementation Fund for a grant program, as part of FirstNet: $135 million. To the Network Construction Fund for FirstNet, for costs associated with building the nationwide network and for grants to states that qualify to build their own networks: $7 billion, reduced by the amount advanced to establish FirstNet in the first round of funding. To the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) for public safety research: $100 million. To the Treasury for deficit reduction: $20.4 billion. To the NTIA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration for a grant program to improve 911 services: $115 million. To NIST for public safety research, phase two: $200 million. To the Treasury for deficit reduction: any remaining amounts from designated auction revenues. The Spectrum Act requires the FCC and the NTIA to identify specific bands for auction from spectrum designated for commercial advanced wireless services and for federal use, and in most cases to commence the auction process within three years. The act mandates spectrum license auctions for frequencies at 1915-1920 MHz; 1995-2000 MHz; 2155-2180 MHz; an additional 15 MHz to be identified by the FCC; and 15 MHz of spectrum between 1675 and 1710 MHz, subject to conditions in the act. The Secretary of Commerce was required to submit a report to the President identifying 15 MHz of spectrum between 1675 and 1710 MHz for reallocation from federal to nonfederal use. The NTIA reaffirmed an initial recommendation to reassign 1695-1710 MHz and submitted a report, as required by the act, recommending that the FCC reallocate the band for commercial use. The act requires that these auctions be completed and licenses issued by February 22, 2015, which would require that the auctions commence no later than the third quarter of 2014. These licenses were to provide at least 65 MHz of new spectrum for commercial broadband. The FCC scheduled the first designated auction for January 2014. Frequencies at 1915-1920 MHz and 1995-2000 MHz, known as the H Block, were offered in Auction 96. The reserve price was set at $1.56 billion, that is, the combined final bids for all licenses offered must total at least $1.56 billion. The licenses cover 176 Economic Areas. Auction 96 was completed on February 27, 2014, with a total winning bid of $1.564 billion. On January 30, 2015, the FCC completed a second auction (Auction 97), for Advanced Wireless Service (AWS) spectrum licenses, for an additional 65 MHz of frequencies that fulfills the congressional mandate for certain auctions by 2015. The frequencies cover 1695-1710 MHz; and paired licenses at 1755-1780 MHz; and 2155-2180 MHz. The auction, referred to as AWS-3, grossed almost $44.9 billion, of which $5.1 billion is to be applied to the costs of relocation or sharing of frequencies now used by the federal government. The FCC also will reimburse its costs for managing the auction and some bidders may default, reducing the total available for payment in to the Public Safety Trust Fund. There were 31 winning bidders for a total of 1,611 licenses. Among the top four wireless carriers with nationwide coverage, AT&T reportedly has acquired 251 licenses through the auction, at a cost of nearly $18.2 billion; Verizon Wireless acquired 181 licenses for approximately $10.4 billion; and T-Mobile received 151 licenses for bids totaling nearly $1.8 billion; Sprint, the fourth major carrier, did not participate. Dish Network (rebranded as Dish) acquired $13.3 billion in licenses through two joint ventures: SNR Wireless LicenseCo., LLC (357 licenses) and Northstar Wireless, LLC (345 licenses). How the results will affect interest in the remaining mandated auction, the Broadcast Incentive Auction program, is a subject of lively debate. Some, including broadcasters interested in selling their spectrum rights, predict even higher prices for the incentive auction. Others, notably financial analysts, are concerned that lending prospects for future spectrum acquisition are limited, both by the willingness of the financial markets to provide the cash and by the ability of the major winning bidders to amortize their newly acquired debt. One analyst was reported to estimate that, to cover the cost of the auctioned licenses, wireless carriers would have to generate \"an incremental $1.40 per month of wireless revenue for every man, woman, and child in America. In perpetuity.\" The Spectrum Act permits the FCC to conduct incentive auctions, that is, to establish a mechanism whereby spectrum capacity may be relinquished for auction by some license-holders, who would then share in the proceeds. Many commercial wireless licenses can be resold directly by their license-holders for comparable uses; the purpose of incentive auctions is to reward license-holders, such as television broadcasters, who repurpose their spectrum for a different use. Although incentive auctions might be used for other types of license-holders, the act specifically addresses spectrum assignments for over-the-air television broadcasters. The act established procedures and guidelines for the FCC to follow in reallocating television broadcasting spectrum licenses for commercial auction. Through a reverse auction process, the broadcasters would establish the amount of compensation they are willing to accept for the spectrum they voluntarily release for auction. Additionally, broadcasters that do not voluntarily relinquish spectrum rights, but are required to relocate or incur certain other costs, may be compensated. In lieu of cash payments as compensation for relocation, broadcasters may choose to accept regulatory relief that would allow new uses for their spectrum. Spectrum voluntarily released by TV broadcasters is to be repurposed for commercial broadband communications, with licenses sold through what the law refers to as a \"forward auction.\" At least one successful reverse auction is required to set minimum prices for a forward auction. The outcome of the forward auction for spectrum licenses depends on the results of the reverse auction in which the broadcasters agree to the price at which they will release spectrum. For the results of a forward auction to be valid, auction proceeds must at a minimum cover (1) payments to broadcasters that relinquished spectrum for auction, (2) the costs to the FCC of conducting the auctions, and (3) the estimated costs for relocation of other broadcasters, which are not to exceed $1,750 million, deposited in a TV Broadcaster Relocation Fund for relocation costs. If auction revenues do not cover costs as specified in the act, the FCC may not assign new licenses and planned reassignments and reallocations may not occur. If the reverse auction and forward auction conditions are met, the FCC may \"make such reassignments of televisions channels\" (repacking) as appropriate in its consideration, subject to certain conditions. Examples of conditions include a general prohibition against reassigning licenses to frequencies from one band to a band below an existing assignment, and obligations to determine that a reassigned channel is not adversely affected by cross-border channel assignment agreements with Canada and Mexico. The auction and channel reassignment process may only occur once. The Broadcast Incentive Auctions are scheduled to begin on March 29, 2016. The Public Notice establishing Incentive Auction bidding procedures was released on August 11, 2015. Auction 1000, as it is called, consists of two parts, as required by the Spectrum Act: Auction 1001 (reverse) and Auction 1002 (forward). The notice also describes the process for setting the initial target of spectrum to be cleared in the repurposed 600 MHz band. The FCC also issued an Order on Reconsideration , reaffirming an earlier Report and Order that created a \"market-based spectrum reserve of up to 30 MHz\" to enhance competitive bidding. Based on the amount of spectrum released by the broadcasters, a block of spectrum will be set aside in each market with competitive bidding open to Sprint, T-Mobile, and any entrant deemed not to have national network coverage. If, for example, 60 MHz of spectrum is made available by broadcasters, 20 MHz will be reserved; all registered bidders would be eligible to compete for licenses in the remaining 40 MHz. Verizon and AT&T may also be allowed to bid on reserved licenses, if there is insufficient bidding activity. Other actions taken in August 2015 include the adoption of rules for unlicensed services, and wireless microphones. Actions the FCC announced on May 15, 2014, include Creating smaller license coverage areas within EAs (called Partial Economic Areas, PEAs); Assigning licenses for 5 MHz of paired spectrum, with an initial term of 12 years; Applying various measurements of spectrum ownership intended to handicap the ability of Verizon and AT&T to acquire licenses in certain areas; Reconsidering qualifications for Designated Entities based on a separate proceeding to be applied to the Broadcast Incentive Auction; Requiring interoperability across the entire 600 MHz band; and Applying to the 600 MHz band the same technical rules as for the 700 MHz band. The Spectrum Act addressed how spectrum resources might be repurposed from federal to commercial use through auction or sharing, and how the cost of such reassignment would be defined and compensated, among other provisions. The Commercial Spectrum Enhancement Act of 2004 ( P.L. 108-494 , Title II) was amended to facilitate the transfer of spectrum rights to commercial purchasers from the agencies relinquishing spectrum. (See following section.) Expenditures incurred by federal agencies for planning may now be included among those costs eligible for reimbursement as part of the transfer of spectrum to the commercial sector. Other reimbursable costs cover a wide range of technical options, including spectrum sharing. Although spectrum sharing to facilitate the transition from federal to commercial use is supported in the act's provisions, the NTIA has been required to give priority to reallocation options that assign spectrum for exclusive, nonfederal uses through competitive bidding. The act required the establishment of a Technical Panel within the NTIA to review transition plans that each federal agency must prepare in accordance with provisions in the act. The Technical Panel is required to have three members qualified as a radio engineer or technical expert. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications and Information Administrator of the NTIA, and the Chairman of the FCC have been required to appoint one member each. A full discussion and interpretation of provisions of the act as regards the technical panel and related procedural requirements such as dispute resolution have been published by the NTIA as part of the rulemaking process. The Commercial Spectrum Enhancement Act of 2004 put in place statutory rules for covering the costs to federal agencies of relocating wireless communications facilities to new spectrum assignments. The act created the Spectrum Relocation Fund to provide a means for federal agencies to recover relocation costs directly from auction proceeds when they are required to vacate spectrum slated for auction. In effect, successful commercial bidders cover the costs of relocation. Among key provisions of the act were requirements that the auctions must recoup at least 110% of the costs projected by the NTIA, and that unused funds would revert to the Treasury after eight years. These provisions remain in effect. Specific frequencies were designated for immediate auction by the Commercial Spectrum Enhancement Act but the law was written to apply to any federally used frequencies scheduled for reallocation and possible auction. The NTIA, with input from the Policy and Plans Steering Group (PPSG), has produced a 10-year plan and timetable that identifies bands of spectrum that might be available for commercial wireless broadband service. As part of its planning efforts, the NTIA prepared a \"Fast Track Evaluation\" of spectrum that might be made available in the near future. Specific recommendations were to make available 100 MHz of spectrum within bands 3550-3650 MHz. The FCC has opened a proceeding for the 3.4GHz band, which may be turned into an \"innovation band\" for small cell networks. The fast track evaluation also recommended studying two 20 MHz bands to be identified within 4200-4400 MHz for possible repurposing. Working through the PPSG, the NTIA studied federal spectrum use by more than 20 agencies with over 3,100 separate frequency assignments in the 1755-1850 MHz band. After evaluating the multiple steps involved in transferring current uses and users to other frequency locations, the NTIA concluded that it would cost $18 billion to clear federal users from all 95 MHz of the band. Based on this assessment, the NTIA report included recommendations for seeking ways for federal and commercial users to share many of the frequencies, although some frequencies were identified to be cleared for auction to the private sector. DOD estimated that relocation of its users from the 1755-1850 MHz band to clear spectrum would cost $12 billion if the bands were fully cleared. Industry estimates have valued the licenses at as much as $12 billion. The NTIA assumptions for the estimates of the cost of relocating federal agencies from the 1755-1850 MHz band were challenged at a hearing of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, Subcommittee on Communications and Technology, leading to a request to the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to examine the process. In particular, the NTIA was criticized during the hearing by some committee members for not separately evaluating the 1755-1780 MHz band, which might be auctioned separately with another spectrum band already available for commercial use. At the hearing, the GAO provided testimony regarding its preliminary findings on spectrum sharing and followed up with a report. Both the hearing and the report indicated that spectrum sharing technology and policies were largely undeveloped. Some of the options to encourage sharing spectrum, as identified by the GAO, include considering spectrum usage fees to provide economic incentive for more efficient use and sharing; identifying more spectrum that could be made available for unlicensed use; encouraging research and development of technologies that can better enable sharing; and improving and expediting regulatory processes related to sharing. Given the challenges for implementing spectrum sharing policies, the GAO found that further study by the NTIA and the FCC was needed. In a hearing before the Senate Committee on Armed Services, Subcommittee on Strategic Forces, the GAO presented preliminary findings on DOD estimates of reallocation costs from some radio frequencies. The GAO evaluated DOD relocation cost estimates of $12 billion for frequencies at 1755-1850 MHz and reported that the \"preliminary cost estimate substantially or partially met GAO's identified best practices.\" In particular, the GAO noted the variable nature of a number of assumptions for costs and revenues, such as the characteristics of the spectrum to which services would be relocated, the availability of new technology, and market demand for spectrum. Federal frequencies at 1695-1710 MHz and 1755-1780 MHz are being reassigned for commercial use on a shared basis with federal incumbents as part of Auction 97. The frequencies at 1755-1780 MHz are paired with unencumbered spectrum already allocated for commercial use at 2155-2180 MHz; auction of the latter frequencies is required by the Spectrum Act. The released federal frequencies, with multiple federal incumbents, are to be shared indefinitely with successful commercial bidders, although some federal systems are to migrate to other frequencies. The frequencies at 1695-1710 MHz were auctioned as unpaired spectrum on a shared basis with weather satellite systems. Licensees are obligated to coordinate with federal users to avoid harmful interference and to meet other requirements of transition plans. The transition plans are posted on the NTIA website. Unlicensed spectrum is not sold to the highest bidder and used for the services provided by the license-holder but is instead accessible to anyone using wireless equipment certified by the FCC for those frequencies. Both commercial and noncommercial entities use unlicensed spectrum to meet a wide variety of monitoring and communications needs. Suppliers of wireless devices must meet requirements for certification to operate on frequency bands designated for unlicensed use. Examples of unlicensed use include garage door openers and WiFi communications. WiFi provides wireless Internet access for personal computers and handheld devices and is also used by businesses to link computer-based communications within a local area. Links are connected to a high-speed landline either at a business location or through hotspots. Hotspots are typically located in homes or convenient public locations. New technologies are being developed by companies in various industry sectors to expand the usefulness of unlicensed spectrum without causing interference. For example, to use unassigned spectrum, known as white spaces, between broadcasting signals of digital television, geolocation database technology is being put in place to identify unencumbered airwaves. Similar technologies will be used to expand the availability of spectrum for unlicensed use at 5 GHz. Commercial providers, such as for wireless Internet, currently share parts of the spectrum at 5 GHz with federal users. With the objective of improving future WiFi capacity, the Spectrum Act required new studies and evaluations of frequencies at 5 GHz. The FCC was required to commence a proceeding that might open access for some unlicensed devices in the 5350-5470 MHz band. The NTIA was required to prepare an evaluation of spectrum-sharing technologies for the 5350-5470 MHz and 5850-5925 MHz bands. Pursuant to the findings of the two agencies, the FCC has issued a Report and Order that adds 100 MHz of spectrum for unlicensed use by changes in usage at frequencies ranging from 5.15-5.85 GHz part of the band. Future actions are likely to release additional segments of the band. Implementation of the Spectrum Act raises a number of policy issues such as how to structure incentive auctions and how best to utilize spectrum assigned for federal use. Inherent to these debates is the question of how to provide access to spectrum on a competitive basis. Actions taken by the FCC that are intended to improve competitive access to spectrum include modifying FCC auction rules to provide licenses with smaller area coverage; encouraging participation by designated entities; and establishing limitations on the number of licenses available to Verizon or AT&T. Spectrum caps might limit the amount of spectrum available through auction to the top two carriers in key auctions such as those for repurposed television spectrum. A number of comments and petitions for reconsideration have been filed to request that the FCC include licenses for Cellular Market Areas (CMAs) in its auction rules, arguing that smaller licenses are more affordable to small, primarily rural, carriers and more nearly match the location of their target customer base. For example, using auction rules that allowed only for Economic Areas (EAs), the FCC created 176 licenses for the H Block auction (Auction 96), as compared to a potential 700 CMA licenses. For the Broadcast Incentive Auction, the FCC proposes to create Partial Economic Area licenses within Economic Areas, to allow for a greater choice between urban and rural coverage among bidders for licenses. The history of spectrum caps as a policy to promote competition dates to preparations for the first spectrum license auctions. The FCC decided to set caps on the amount of spectrum any one company could control in any geographically designated market. The FCC's support of spectrum capping was based on the theory that each license has an economic value and a foreclosure value. The economic value is derived from the return on investment in spectrum licenses and network infrastructure. The foreclosure value is the value to a wireless company that already has substantial market share and wants to keep its dominant position by precluding competition. Spectrum caps were chosen as the method to prevent foreclosure bidding. The intent was to ensure multiple competitors in each market and to restrict bidding to only the licenses that could be used in the near term. Beginning in 2001, spectrum policy placed increased emphasis on promoting spectrum and market efficiency. The FCC ruled to end spectrum caps, citing greater spectral efficiency from larger networks as one benefit of the ruling. Spectrum caps were seen as barriers to mergers within the wireless industry, to the growth of existing wireless companies, and to the benefits of scale economies. The spectrum caps were eliminated on January 1, 2003. Auction rules requiring the timely build-out of networks became a key policy tool to deter hoarding. The FCC instituted a policy for evaluating spectrum holdings on a market-by-market, case-by-case basis—a practice referred to as spectrum screening—as a measure of competitiveness. Current proposals to reinstate spectrum caps reflect different perspectives on competition and the role of spectrum license auctions. Although some would like to see Verizon and AT&T excluded from participation in the Broadcast Incentive Auction, the Spectrum Act prohibits exclusion of any qualified bidder. How this approach might be implemented and how limitations might affect auction revenue have been the topic of spirited debate. Numerous position papers have argued effectively that any form of spectrum cap would depress auction revenues or, from a different perspective, that spectrum caps would have no impact on revenue and might even enhance it. The Department of Justice has filed comments regarding the important role of spectrum access for competition and innovation. It has urged the FCC to promulgate auction rules that would prevent bids based on the foreclosure value of spectrum and that would enhance bidding opportunities for smaller carriers. A separate FCC Report and Order will establish new guidelines on the amount of spectrum that any one carrier may hold. The FCC plans to apply its new criteria to the incentive auction by placing restrictions on bidding activity intended to handicap the ability of Verizon and AT&T to acquire licenses in certain areas. The majority of the 700 MHz band commercial licenses were purchased at auction in 2008 (Auction 73) by Verizon and AT&T, which together also hold approximately 70% of commercial spectrum licenses below 1000 MHz. The other two national carriers, Sprint (majority-controlled by SoftBank, Corp., a Japanese telecommunications provider) and T-Mobile, Inc. (majority-owned by Deutsche Telekom, AG), own 15% of commercial licenses below 1000 MHz. Although Sprint and T-Mobile are generally viewed as the primary beneficiaries of the bidding rules, the rules are also intended to provide opportunities for smaller carriers to bid successfully. Based on the amount of spectrum released by the broadcasters, a block of spectrum will be set aside in each market with bidding priority for Sprint, T-Mobile, and any entrant deemed not to have national network coverage. If, for example, 60 MHz of spectrum is made available by broadcasters, 20 MHz will be reserved; as described by the staff report, all registered bidders would be eligible to compete for licenses not acquired in priority bidding as well as in the remaining 40 MHz. Sprint, T-Mobile and smaller carriers, among others, have unsuccessfully pressed the FCC to increase amount of spectrum reserved for priority bidding. One tool that the FCC regularly uses to improve competition among current and potential wireless network providers is the establishment of bidding credits for smaller companies, referred to as Designated Entities . A Designated Entity meets established criteria for size and revenue and is awarded a credit against the purchase price of an auctioned license, based on these criteria. Presently, small businesses with average gross revenue of no more than $40 million in the preceding three years receive a credit of 15%. A very small business, with revenue of $15 million or less over three years, receives a credit of 25%. Rules governing eligibility for designated entity status include restrictions on the use of spectrum assets acquired through a successful bid at auction. For example, currently not more than 25% of spectrum assets acquired with a bidding credit can be leased to a larger partner with which the company has what is described as an attributable material relationship (AMR). The FCC has reconsidered the rules for designated entities in a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. Among the rules reevaluated are those for AMR, which the FCC believes may be discriminating against entrepreneurs that have formed partnerships with larger companies. In preparation for the Broadcast Incentive Auction, the FCC has granted a waiver to a private equity company that exceeds the income limits; this may set a precedent for future waivers that will widen the pool of potential bidders through more generous interpretations of designated entity rules. The history of Designated Entity status and benefits—especially for minority ownership—of relaxing the rules are detailed in a report by the Minority Media & Telecom Council (MMTC). The Spectrum Act employs three key policy tools for increasing the availability of radio frequency spectrum for wireless broadband: allocating additional spectrum; reassigning spectrum to new users; and opening up spectrum for unlicensed use. Other policy options that may be employed to increase spectrum capacity include requiring that wireless network infrastructure be shared; changing the cost structure of spectrum access; moving to more spectrum-efficient technologies; and sharing spectrum. Facilitating the adoption of new wireless technologies that enable spectrum sharing is emerging as a major policy consideration for spectrum management. Policies to auction licenses for exclusive use of spectrum still appear to prevail in spectrum management planning. However, a number of new spectrum-dependent industries are emerging that do not seem well served by current policies. These industries include much of the Internet of Things, such as advanced robotics, autonomous vehicles, cloud computing, and machine-to-machine communications. Spectrum resources are also needed, for example, for smart grid communications, railroad safety, water conservation, the safe maintenance of critical infrastructure industries, and for many other applications that may not have an immediate commercial value but can provide long-lasting value to society as a whole. Actions taken by the 114 th Congress regarding spectrum policy include the introduction of the Wireless Innovation Act of 2015 ( S. 1618 , Senator Rubio) that, among other provisions, would require the NTIA to identify for release 200 MHz of federal spectrum below 5 GHz. The spectrum would be reallocated for commercial use according to guidelines provided in the act, notably: 120 MHz below 3.7 GHz shall be for exclusive-use, commercial licenses; no more than 20 MHz may be\n\n### Summary:\n\n", "answer": "The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 (P.L. 112-96, signed February 22, 2012) contains provisions in Title VI that expedite the availability of spectrum for commercial mobile broadband. The provisions in Title VI—also known as the Public Safety and Spectrum Act, or the Spectrum Act—cover reallocation of spectrum, new assignments of spectrum rights, and changes in procedures for repurposing spectrum used by the federal government. The act establishes a process for television broadcasters to release spectrum licensed to them for auction as commercial licenses (Broadcast Incentive Auctions). The act also includes provisions to apply future spectrum license auction revenues toward deficit reduction; to establish a planning and governance structure to deploy public safety broadband networks, using some auction proceeds for that purpose; and to assign additional spectrum resources for public safety communications. Broadband capacity to support popular mobile services and devices, such as real-time viewing of video on smartphones, can be improved in several ways. Examples include (1) providing new spectrum for networks to expand; (2) investing in denser infrastructure; (3) developing new technologies; or (4) expanding opportunities for sharing spectrum. Provisions of the Spectrum Act focus on increasing the amount of spectrum as the key policy tool for spectrum management. Going forward, other policy tools may need to be considered in order to make spectrum access more inclusive. Many policy makers and Members of Congress are concerned, for example, that the current structure of auctions to assign spectrum licenses does not provide enough opportunities for competition or new entrants into mobile communications markets. The spectrum needs of the Internet of Things and other emerging technologies that some believe may be key drivers of future economic growth are not specifically addressed in the Spectrum Act. Many growth industries that are deemed to be part of the Internet of Things require reliable, affordable access to spectrum."}

This workforce is seen by many as a catalyst of U.S. global economic competitiveness and is likewise considered a key element of the legislative options aimed at stimulating economic growth. The challenge central to the policy debate is facilitating the migration of professional, managerial, and skilled foreign workers without adversely affecting U.S. workers and U.S. students entering the labor market. This report provides legislative analyses of the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act ( S. 744 ), as passed by the Senate, and the Supplying Knowledge-based Immigrants and Lifting Levels of STEM Visas Act (SKILLS Visa Act, H.R. 2131 ), as ordered reported by the House Committee on the Judiciary. Both bills would substantially revise the law governing the admission of professional, managerial, and skilled foreign workers to the United States. The companion report, CRS Report R43735, Temporary Professional, Managerial, and Skilled Foreign Workers: Policy and Trends , by [author name scrubbed] , as its name suggests, analyzes the current policy and statistical trends. Currently, there are 24 major nonimmigrant (i.e., aliens who the United States admits on a temporary basis) visa categories, and over 70 specific types of nonimmigrant visas issued. These visa categories are commonly referred to by the letter and numeral that denote their subsection in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). Several visa categories are designated for employment-based temporary admission. A variety of temporary visas—by their intrinsic nature—allow foreign nationals to be employed in the United States. Over the past two decades, the number of visas issued for temporary employment-based admission has more than doubled from just over 400,000 in FY1994 to over 1 million in FY2013. The Department of Homeland Security Office of Immigration Statistics estimated that there were approximately 1.1 million temporary workers and long-term exchange residents living in the United States in January 2012. While the data include some unskilled and low-skilled workers as well as accompanying family members, the visas for managerial, skilled, and professional workers dominate the trends. The admission of professional, managerial, and skilled foreign workers raises a series of policy options as the United States competes internationally for the most talented workers in the world without putting downward pressures on the wages and working conditions of U.S. workers and U.S. students entering the labor market. Adding to the complexity of the debate is the variety of temporary visa categories that enable employment-based temporary admissions for highly skilled foreign workers. They perform work that ranges from skilled labor to management and professional positions as well as jobs requiring extraordinary ability in the sciences, arts, education, business, or athletics. Congress has considered several overarching legislative options to reform the system of admitting highly skilled foreign workers, which include the following: streamlining procedures that govern the admission of professional, managerial, and skilled foreign workers so that the rules are less time consuming and burdensome for employers; increasing the number of temporary professional, managerial, and skilled foreign workers admitted each year; requiring employers of professional, managerial, and skilled foreign workers to meet labor markets tests, such as making efforts to recruit U.S. workers and offering wages and benefits that are comparable to similarly employed U.S. workers; extending labor protections and worker rights to professional, managerial, and skilled foreign workers to prevent abuse or exploitation of the worker; enabling professional, managerial, and skilled foreign workers to have \"visa portability\" so they can change jobs; and permitting professional, managerial, and skilled foreign workers to have \"dual intent\"; that is, to apply for lawful permanent resident (LPR) status while seeking or renewing temporary visas. In addition to these issues that cross-cut the various temporary employment-based visas, Congress has focused in particular on two visa categories: H-1B visas for professional specialty workers, and L visas for intra-company transferees. These two nonimmigrant visas epitomize the tensions between the global competition for talent and potential adverse effects on the U.S. workforce. The 113 th Congress has considered legislation that would make extensive revisions to nonimmigrant categories for professional specialty workers (H-1B visas), intra-company transferees (L visas), and other skilled temporary workers; and two bills have received action. They are the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act ( S. 744 ) as passed by the Senate, and the Supplying Knowledge-based Immigrants and Lifting Levels of STEM Visas Act (SKILLS Visa Act; H.R. 2131 ), as ordered reported by the House Committee on the Judiciary. Both bills would substantially revise these visa categories, with provisions largely aimed at streamlining procedures, strengthening enforcement, and expanding admissions. The major nonimmigrant category for temporary professional workers is the H-1B visa. To obtain an H-1B visa, the foreign national must work in a \"specialty occupation.\" Current law generally limits annual H-1B admissions to 65,000, but most H-1B workers are exempted from the limits because they are returning workers or they work for universities and nonprofit research facilities that are exempt from the cap. In FY2012, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) approved 257,538 H-1B professional specialty worker petitions, an increase from 192,990 in FY2010 (during the recession). In recent years, applications for new H-1B workers have routinely exceeded the numerical limits—in some years exceeding limits during the first week or even on the first day that applications are received. S. 744 would seek to address perceived H-1B shortages by replacing the 65,000 per year cap on new H-1B admissions with a flexible cap that would range from a floor of 115,000 to a ceiling of 180,000 annually, with a \"market-based\" mechanism to increase or decrease the cap based on demand during the previous year (i.e., whether and how quickly the previous year's limit was reached). Up to 25,000 STEM advanced degree graduates would be exempted from the cap. Spouses of H-1B workers would be permitted to work, thereby eliminating a potential barrier to H-1B recruitment. The bill would ease the renewal of H-1B by limiting the review of such renewals to material errors, substantive changes, and newly discovered information. In addition, H-1B workers would have a 60-day grace period after loss of a job to seek additional employment without losing their visa status. S. 744 would also streamline the adjustment of status for certain aliens with long-standing employment-based petitions for such adjustment, a provision aimed at addressing the backlog of H-1B workers with pending legal permanent resident (LPR) petitions. H.R. 2131 would increase the annual cap on H-1B workers from 65,000 to 155,000 and replace the current higher education degree exemption of 20,000 with an exemption for up to 40,000 foreign nationals who have STEM master's or doctorate degrees. It would also permit the spouses of H-1B workers to seek employment. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) would be required to develop a streamlined pre-certification process for employers who file multiple petitions. In addition to these concerns about whether employers have adequate access to H-1B workers, some Members of Congress have raised questions about whether H-1B workers may have an adverse effect on U.S. workers and whether H-1B workers are being treated legally under the terms of their employment. Most notable are concerns about H-1B workers displacing U.S. workers in certain occupations and the use of H-1B workers by companies that are out-sourcing jobs overseas. Some also express the viewpoint that the availability of H-1B workers may possibly place downward pressure on certain skilled U.S. workers' wages and/or discourage U.S. workers from entering STEM fields in which H-1B workers are well represented. Current law requires prospective employers of H-1B workers to submit a labor attestation to the Secretary of Labor to bring in foreign workers. The H-1B labor attestation, a three-page application form, is a statement of intent rather than a documentation of actions taken. In the labor attestation for an H-1B worker, the employer must attest that the firm will pay the nonimmigrant the greater of the actual wages paid to other employees in the same job or the prevailing wages for that occupation; the firm will provide working conditions for the nonimmigrant that do not cause the working conditions of the other employees to be adversely affected; and there is no applicable strike or lockout. The firm must provide a copy of the labor attestation to representatives of the bargaining unit or—if there is no bargaining representative—must post the labor attestation in conspicuous locations at the work site. S. 744 would seek to protect U.S. workers by modifying H-1B application requirements for investigating H-1B complaints. The bill would amend the employer H-1B application process to revise wage determination requirements based on Department of Labor (DOL) surveys, and would require employers to advertise for U.S. workers on a DOL website. Section 4213 would impose additional restrictions on how employers advertise for H-1B positions, and would impose limits on the total number of H-1B and L workers certain employers can hire. S. 744 would establish a new fee of $1,250–$2,500 for H-1B (and L) visas that would be aimed at providing a disincentive for employers' undue reliance on these visas. The INA requires that employers defined as H-1B dependent (generally firms with at least 15% of the workforce who are H-1B workers) meet additional labor market tests. These H-1B dependent employers must also attest that they tried to recruit U.S. workers and that they have not displaced U.S. workers in similar occupations within 90 days prior to or after the hiring of H-1B workers. Additionally, the H-1B dependent employers must offer the H-1B workers compensation packages (not just wages) that are comparable to U.S. workers. As passed by the Senate, the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act ( S. 744 ) would increase the numerical limits on H-1B workers admitted each year, revise the requirements on businesses that employ H-1B workers, and impose additional provisions aimed at fraud and abuse. These provisions are discussed below by purpose of the revision. Subtitle B of Title IV would establish a new class of H-1B dependent employers: H-1B skilled-worker dependent employers, defined as a function of the proportion of an employer's workforce that consists of H-1B workers in highly skilled occupations. The bill would retain and revise the broader class of H-1B dependent employers defined in current law. Notably, H-1B workers for whom an employer petitions to become LPRs would be considered \"intending immigrants\" under S. 744 and would not count in calculations of whether their employers were H-1B dependent. New provisions aimed at preventing employers from hiring H-1B workers intentionally to displace U.S. workers would be established, with different requirements for H-1B dependent employers, H-1B skilled-worker dependent employers, and all other H-1B employers. Employers would be required to make good faith efforts to recruit U.S. workers prior to hiring H-1B workers, and those employers deemed H-1B skilled worker dependent would be required to offer a position to any equally or better qualified U.S. worker applying for a job that would otherwise be filled by an H-1B worker. Certain H-1B dependent employers would not be permitted to outsource H-1B workers, and employers who outsource H-1Bs would pay a $500 fee. Over the years, the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) has issued reports that recommended more controls to protect workers, prevent abuses, and streamline services in the issuing of H-1B visas. GAO has observed that DOL has limited authority to question information on the labor attestation form and initiate enforcement activities. In 2011, GAO identified several weaknesses in the H-1B program's ability to protect workers: (1) oversight that is fragmented between four agencies and restricted by law; (2) lack of legal authority to hold employers accountable to program requirements when they obtain H-1B workers through a staffing company; and (3) expansions that have increased the pool of H-1B workers beyond the cap and lowered the bar for eligibility. A 2008 internal Department of Homeland Security (DHS) investigation of H-1B visa adjudications found a 13.4% fraud rate as well as a 7.3% technical violation rate. Violations reportedly ranged from document fraud to deliberate misstatements regarding job locations, wages paid, and duties performed. The investigation also discovered that some petitioning employers shifted the burden of paying various filing fees to foreign workers. A 2010 DHS investigation found a 14% \"not verified\" rate, which U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) officials cited to suggest a reduced level of fraud in the H-1B program. It was unclear, however, how the 14% \"not verified\" rate compared with 13.4% fraud rate and the 7.3% technical violation rate. To address these issues, S. 744 would permit DOL to review an H-1B attestation for evidence of fraud and to investigate and adjudicate any evidence of fraud identified. Subtitle B of Title IV of S. 744 also would broaden DOL's authority to investigate alleged employer violations, and would require DOL to conduct annual compliance audits of certain employers. Employers who willfully violate the terms of their labor attestations would be subject to increased fines and would be liable for the lost wages and benefits of employees harmed by such violations. Employers also would be prohibited from failing to offer H-1Bs insurance, pension plans, and bonuses offered to U.S. workers, and from penalizing H-1B workers for terminating employment before a previously agreed date. The bill would also establish new information-sharing requirements between USCIS and DOL when there is evidence of H-1B employer noncompliance, and new reporting requirements to Congress regarding information about the number and characteristics of H-1B (and L) workers and employers. In addition, the subtitle would require the U.S. Department of State and DHS to provide H-1B (and L) workers with information regarding their rights and employer obligations. Certain H-1B dependent employers would be required to pay an additional $5,000–$10,000 in filing fees. H.R. 2131 would direct the Department of State to verify the authenticity of foreign educational degrees and would authorize a fee on employers to cover the costs of verifying the credentials of the foreign degree. The bill also would add requirements for DHS to verify that the employer is either a bona fide business with \"aggregate gross assets with a value of not less than $50,000,\" an institution of higher education (as defined in §101(a) of the Higher Education Act of 1965), or a governmental or nonprofit entity. Furthermore, H.R. 2131 would authorize the Secretary of Labor to issue subpoenas to employers of H-1B (and E-3) workers. The L intra-company transferee visa was established for companies that have offices abroad to transfer key personnel freely within the organization. It is considered a visa category essential to retaining and expanding international businesses in the United States. Some, however, have raised concerns that intra-company transferees on the L visa may displace U.S. workers who had been employed in those positions for these firms in the United States. Others express concern that the L visa has become a substitute for the H-1B visa, noting that L employees are often comparable in skills and occupations to H-1B workers, yet lack the labor market protections the law sets for hiring H-1B workers. These concerns have been raised, in particular, with respect to certain outsourcing and information technology firms that employ L workers as subcontractors within the United States. A related concern is that an unchecked use of L visas will foster the transfer of STEM and other high-skilled professional jobs overseas. After investigating the L visa, the Department of Homeland Security Inspector General offered this assessment: \"That so many foreign workers seem to qualify as possessing specialized knowledge appears to have led to the displacement of American workers, and to what is sometimes called the 'body shop' problem.\" Under current law, the prospective L nonimmigrant must demonstrate that he or she meets the qualifications for the particular job as well as the visa category. The alien must have been employed by the firm for at least six months in the preceding three years in the capacity for which the transfer is sought. More precisely, the foreign national must be employed in an executive capacity, a managerial capacity, or have specialized knowledge of the firm's product to be eligible for the L visa. The INA does not require firms who wish to bring L intracompany transfers into the United States to demonstrate that U.S. workers will not be adversely affected in order to obtain a visa for the transferring employee. S. 744 would extend some of the same provisions that it would require for employers of H-1B workers to employers of L workers. It would impose limits on the total number of L workers certain employers can hire. S. 744 would establish a new fee of $1,250–$2,500 for L visas that would be aimed at providing a disincentive for employers' undue reliance on these visas. It would also add new requirements for reporting to Congress regarding information about the number and characteristics of L workers and employers. The Senate-passed bill would require DHS and DOS to provide L workers with information regarding their rights and employer obligations. In addition, S. 744 would add prohibitions on the outsourcing and outplacement of L employees, including by charging a $500 fee to be deposited in the proposed STEM Education and Training Account. Employers seeking to bring an L-visa worker to the United States to open a new office would face special application requirements. DHS would be required to work with DOS to verify the existence of multinational companies petitioning for the L workers. Section 4304 would impose caps on the total proportion of certain employers' workforces that may consist of L and H-1B workers, falling from an upper limit of 75% in FY2015 to an upper limit of 50% after FY2016. Section 4305 would also impose additional fees of $5,000–$10,000 for certain H-1B/L-dependent employers beginning in FY2014. With respect to compliance, S. 744 would authorize DHS to investigate and adjudicate alleged employer violations of L visa program requirements for up to 24 months after the alleged violation; and DOL would be required to conduct annual compliance audits of certain employers. The subtitle also would impose civil monetary penalties and other remedies for violations, including debarment from L-worker petitions and liability for lost wages and benefits to employees harmed by violations. In addition, Section 4308 would add whistleblower protections for L-workers. And DHS would be required to report on the L visa blanket petition process. H.R. 2131 would add labor market tests to the L-1B visa for individuals with specialized knowledge who would be working in the United States for at least six months over a two-year period. In those cases, the employer would be required to pay either the actual wage paid to similarly employed workers or the prevailing wage (whichever is higher). In addition, the employer would be required to provide working conditions that would not adversely affect the working conditions of similarly employed workers. DHS would be required to develop a streamlined pre-certification process for employers who file multiple petitions. Foreign nationals who are treaty traders enter on E-1 visas, whereas those who are treaty investors use E-2 visas. An E-1 treaty trader visa allows a foreign national to enter the United States for the purpose of conducting \"substantial trade\" between the United States and the country of which the person is a citizen. An E-2 treaty investor can be any person who comes to the United States to develop and direct the operations of an enterprise in which he or she has invested, or is in the process of investing, a \"substantial amount of capital.\" Both these E-class visas require that a treaty exist between the United States and the principal foreign national's country of citizenship. The E Treaty visas are especially attractive to global businesses and subsidiaries of international corporations. As a consequence, interest in expanding access to these visas has grown as more businesses seek access to U.S. markets. S. 744 would amend the requirements for the E visa to allow E visas to be issued to citizens from countries where there is a bilateral investment treaty or a free trade agreement. The legislation would also expand the use of treaty professional workers and would lower the educational and training requirements for foreign nationals coming from specified countries. The E-3 treaty professional worker visa is a temporary work visa limited to citizens of Australia. It is usually issued for two years at a time. Occupationally, it mirrors the H-1B visa in that the foreign worker on an E-3 visa must be employed in a specialty occupation. S. 744 would amend the E-3 visa category so that nationals of Ireland would be eligible. The Irish national would not be required to be employed in a professional specialty, and could provide services as an employee, provided he/she has at least a high school education or, within five years, two years work experience in an occupation that requires two years of training or experience. There would be a limit of 10,500 E-3 visas per year for Irish nationals. H.R. 2131 would require employers of E-3 employees to pay the $500 Fraud Detection and Prevention Fee currently required of employers of H-1B and L employees. In addition, H.R. 2131 would authorize the Secretary of Labor to issue subpoenas to employers of E-3 workers to enhance investigation and enforcement efforts. S. 744 also would create a new E-4 visa category that would be limited to 5,000 visas per year per country; only principal aliens would be counted against the cap. Additionally, the bill would create an E-5 visa category for South Korean workers in specialty occupations that would be limited to 5,000 visas annually. Employers seeking to hire E-4 or E-5 workers would have to file a labor attestation form with DOL. A new E-6 nonimmigrant visa category also would be established for nationals of eligible sub-Saharan African countries or beneficiary countries of the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act who are coming to the United States to work, and have at least a high school education or, within the past five years, two years of work experience in an occupation that requires at least two years of training/experience. These visas would be limited to 10,500 per year. The U.S. Department of State's Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs (BECA) is responsible for approving the J visa cultural exchange programs. Most foreign nationals on J-1 visas are permitted to work as part of their cultural exchange program participation. The J cultural exchange visas have expanded over time from visas issued for educational, research, or scholarship purposes to visas issued for programs engaged in more mundane tasks, such as child care, resort work, or camp counseling. Spouses and minor children of J-1 visaholders may accompany them on J-2 visas, but they are not permitted to work. As the J visa has transformed from a predominately educational visa to a largely employment visa, a new set of concerns has arisen. In 2011, about 400 temporary workers on J visas went on strike at the Hershey's Chocolate packing plant in Palmyra, PA, garnering national attention. The DOS Office of Inspector General made the following observation in 2012: \"Public criticism of the Summer Work Travel (SWT) program is the most recent negative consequence of unfettered growth and weak regulation of privately funded exchanges. BECA should strictly limit SWT until it can provide proper oversight.\" The following year, however, another group of temporary workers on J visas employed by a MacDonald's franchise in Pennsylvania protested their working conditions. Efforts to address these matters have been met by those who maintain that it is inappropriate to treat cultural exchange programs \"the same way as non-immigrant labor programs (like migrant farm workers, \"Deadliest Catch\" fishing boat crews and construction crews),\" because they are public diplomacy programs. The Senate approved a floor amendment to S. 744 that included provisions that would establish a new definition of foreign labor recruitment for use with the J visa, and would give the J visaholder as well as DOS the right to bring a civil action in federal court against a program sponsor, foreign entity, or an employer. The bill would also prohibit retaliation against a J visaholder complaining about program conditions, including housing and job placements, wages, hours, and general treatment, or for disclosing retaliation. DOS would be required to promulgate new regulations in consultation with DOL on various J-1 categories, to provide J visaholders with additional disclosures on rights and protections under the INA, and to maintain a list of employers who have had substantiated complaints. Also, the Senate approved a floor amendment to S. 744 that added language to impose a $100 fee on designated program sponsors for each nonimmigrant entering on a J visa as part of a summer work/travel exchange. The $100 fee would be deposited in the proposed Comprehensive Immigration Reform Trust Fund and could not be charged to the nonimmigrant. The bill would also specify that summer work/travel exchange participants on J visas are eligible to be employed in seafood processing in Alaska. S. 744 would also make eligible for a J visa foreign nationals who are coming to the United States to perform specialized work that requires proficiency of languages spoken in countries with less than 5,000 LPR admissions in the previous year. Currently, foreign medical graduates (FMGs) may enter the United States on J visas in order to receive graduate medical education and training. Such FMGs must return to their home countries after completing their education or training for at least two years before they can apply for certain other nonimmigrant visas or LPR status, unless they are granted a waiver of the foreign residency requirement. States are permitted to sponsor up to 30 waivers per state, per year on behalf of FMGs under a temporary program, colloquially known as the Conrad 30 Program because it was originally sponsored by former Senator Kent Conrad. The objective of the Conrad 30 Program is to encourage immigration of foreign physicians to medically underserved communities. Both S. 744 and H.R. 2131 would make the Conrad 30 J waiver permanent and would allow the program to grow by up to five waivers per year, or be reduced (though never below 30), based on demand for the program. The bills also include a number of provisions to regulate working conditions and add flexibility to the J visa program for such physicians. S. 744 would make changes to facilitate physicians holding J or H-1B visas seeking to remain in the United States, including by allowing dual intent for J-1 foreign medical graduates, making alien physicians who received a Conrad waiver or completed their two-year home residency requirement exempt from numerical limits if they adjust to LPR status, and making the spouses and children of J-1s no longer subject to the two-year home residency requirement. The bill would also allow physicians in H-1B status and completing their medical training to automatically have such status extended. Persons with extraordinary ability in the sciences, arts, education, business, or athletics are admitted on O visas, whereas internationally recognized athletes or members of an internationally recognized entertainment group come on P visas. Generally, the O visa is reserved for the highest level of accomplishment and covers a fairly broad set of occupations and endeavors, including athletics and entertainers. The P visa has a somewhat lower standard of achievement than the O visa, and it is restricted to a narrower band of occupations and endeavors. The P visa is used by a foreign national who performs as an artist, athlete, or entertainer (individually or as part of a group or team) at an internationally recognized level of performance and who seeks to enter the United States temporarily and solely for the purpose of performing in that capacity. The law allows individual athletes to stay in intervals up to five years at a time, up to 10 years in total. Both S. 744 and H.R. 2131 would add visa portability (i.e., the ability to change employers without reapplying for a new visa) for foreign nationals on O-1 visas. Both bills also would add flexibility to the requirements for being admitted on an O-1 visa based on achievement in motion picture or television production. DHS would be required to develop a streamlined pre-certification process for employers who file multiple O or P petitions. Temporary professional workers from Canada and Mexico may enter according to terms set by the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) on TN visas. In many ways, these visas are similar to H-1B visas because of the nature of the work performed as well as the education and skills required to obtain these visas. H.R. 2131 would add labor market tests to the TN visas for Canadian and Mexican professional workers. In those cases, the employer would be required to pay either the actual wage paid to similarly employed workers or the prevailing wage (whichever is higher). In addition, the employer would be required to provide working conditions that would not adversely affect the working conditions of similarly employed workers. DOL would also have authority to investigate these elements. The $500 Fraud Detection and Prevention fee would also be required in the cases of TN visas as well as the E-3 visas. Foreign students on F-1 visas are generally barred from off-campus employment. After completing their undergraduate or graduate studies, however, F-1 foreign students are permitted to participate in employment known as Optional Practical Training (OPT), which is temporary employment that is directly related to an F-1 student's major area of study. Generally, an F-1 foreign student may work up to 12 months in OPT status. In 2008, DHS expanded the OPT work period to 29 months for F-1 students in STEM fields. To qualify for the 17-month extension, F-1 students must have received STEM degrees included on the STEM Designated Degree Program List, be employed by employers enrolled in E-Verify, and have received an initial grant of post-completion OPT related to such a degree (i.e., already approved for 12 months in OPT). Much like the evolution of the J visa from cultural exchange to employment, concerns have arisen that the F-1 visa is transforming into an employment visa. Many observers point to difficulties in obtaining an H-1B visa and the backlogs in adjusting to lawful permanent residence as reasons that drive the relaxation of the work rules for F-1 students. GAO recently released a report noting the potential for fraud and abuse of the OPT status. GAO concluded that DHS' Immigration and Customs Enforcement was unable to \"fully ensure foreign students working under optional practical training are maintaining their legal status in the United States.\" Aimed at easing the transition from international student to LPR, both S. 744 , as passed by the Senate, and H.R. 2131 , as ordered reported by the House Judiciary Committee, would make changes to the F visa category. S. 744 would allow aliens on F visas who are seeking bachelor's or graduate degrees, dual intent; thus, they could seek LPR status while maintaining F status. H.R. 2131 would allow dual intent only for aliens on F visas who are seeking bachelor's and graduate degrees in STEM fields. In other words, many F-1 students working with OPT would, if enacted, be able to apply for LPR status while engaged in OPT employment. In addition, H.R. 2131 would require employers of OPT students to pay either the actual wage paid to similarly employed workers or the prevailing wage (whichever is higher). DOL would also have authority to investigate. The likelihood of enacting legislation to revise laws on the migration of professional, managerial, and skilled foreign workers is linked to the competing approaches to immigration reform. Among those who support imm\n\n### Summary:\n\n", "answer": "The admission of professional, managerial, and skilled foreign workers raises a complex set of policy issues as the United States competes internationally for the most talented workers in the world, without adversely effecting U.S. workers and U.S. students entering the labor market. Legislative proposals that Congress has considered include streamlining procedures that govern the admission of professional, managerial, and skilled foreign workers; increasing the number of temporary professional, managerial, and skilled foreign workers admitted each year; requiring employers of professional, managerial, and skilled foreign workers to make efforts to recruit U.S. workers and offer wages and benefits that are comparable to similarly employed U.S. workers; extending labor protections and worker rights to professional, managerial, and skilled foreign workers to prevent abuse or exploitation of the worker; enabling professional, managerial, and skilled foreign workers to have \"visa portability\" so they can change jobs; and allowing professional, managerial, and skilled foreign workers to have \"dual intent\"; that is, to apply for lawful permanent resident (LPR) status while seeking or renewing temporary visas. Adding to the complexity of the debate is the variety of temporary visa categories that enable employment-based temporary admissions for highly skilled foreign workers. They perform work that ranges from skilled labor to management and professional positions to jobs requiring extraordinary ability in the sciences, arts, education, business, or athletics. These visa categories are commonly referred to by the letter and numeral that denote their subsection in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). Congress has focused on two visa categories in particular: H-1B visas for professional specialty workers, and L visas for intra-company transferees. These two nonimmigrant visas epitomize the tensions between the global competition for talent and potential adverse effects on the U.S. workforce. The United States struggles to support the recruitment of highly skilled professionals on H-1B visas and L visas without displacing U.S. workers or putting downward pressures on the wages and working conditions of U.S. workers and U.S. students entering the labor market. Achieving this end through a process that both meets the expeditious needs of U.S. business and preserves employment opportunities for U.S. workers is a challenge, and there are critics of the current H-1B and L policies on each side of the issue. Congress is also weighing reforms of other professional and outstanding worker visas as well as treaty-specific visas. The 113th Congress has acted on legislation that would make extensive revisions to nonimmigrant categories for professional specialty workers (H-1B visas), intra-company transferees (L visas), and other skilled temporary workers. The Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act (S. 744), as passed by the Senate, and the Supplying Knowledge-based Immigrants and Lifting Levels of STEM Visas Act (SKILLS Visa Act, H.R. 2131), as ordered reported by the House Committee on the Judiciary, would substantially revise these visa categories. Both bills have provisions aimed at streamlining procedures, strengthening enforcement, and expanding admissions."}

European governments support defense exports primarily to maintain a desired level of defense production capability. Their national markets are not large enough to sustain the full range of weapon systems they believe necessary for their national security. The United States has traditionally supported defense exports to meet national security and foreign policy objectives through its security assistance program. In the United States more recently, however, the impact of exports on maintaining the industrial base has gained support as a rationale for providing additional assistance to defense exporters. Defense exports in general have a positive impact on the balance of trade. In 1993 defense exports represented about 0.3 of total exports for Germany, 1.7 percent for France, 2.2 percent for the United States, and 2.4 for the United Kingdom. The impact of defense exports to total exports, however, shows a general downward trend since 1990 for three of the four countries we reviewed. During 1990 defense exports represented 0.4 percent of total exports for Germany, 3.2 percent for France, and 3.4 percent for the United States. In the United Kingdom defense exports to total exports remained at about 2.4 percent in 1990 and 1993. Deliveries of global defense exports have declined 64 percent since 1987, when deliveries were $77 billion. In 1993 deliveries were $28 billion. The end of the Cold War and changes in the political and economic structure of the former Soviet Union were considered significant factors contributing to the overall decrease in arms trade. While the global defense export market has declined since the late 1980s, the United States has become the world’s leading defense exporter. The United States had the largest share of global arms deliveries at 32 percent in 1990 and increased its share to 49 percent in 1993. The overall increase in the U.S. market share from 1990 to 1993 was due, in part, to decreased sales by the former Soviet Union. In 1990 the Soviet Union’s arms deliveries were $17 billion. By 1993 Russia’s defense exports had decreased 82 percent to less than $3 billion. The dollar value of U.S. arms deliveries also decreased during this time, declining 22 percent from $18 billion in 1990 to $14 billion in 1993. Arms deliveries data for calendar year 1994 is not yet available. However, the Department of Defense (DOD), which collects data on a fiscal year basis, reported that fiscal year 1994 U.S. arms deliveries were about $10 billion. According to defense analysts, U.S. arms deliveries are likely to remain at about $10 billion annually for the rest of the decade. The market share of France, Germany, and the United Kingdom combined has increased from 26 percent of total arms deliveries in 1990 to 32 percent in 1993. Of these three countries, only the United Kingdom increased its market share, raising it from 9 percent in 1990 to 15 percent in 1993. The French market share declined from 14 percent to 13 percent during the same period, while Germany remained constant at about 4 percent of the arms market in 1990 and 1993. The total value of arms deliveries for the three European countries combined declined 40 percent, from $15 billion in 1990 to about $9 billion in 1993. Preliminary 1994 delivery data for France and the United Kingdom suggests a decline from 1993 levels. French and U.K. defense exports for 1994, in terms of deliveries, are estimated at $2.2 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively. Delivery data for Germany for 1994 is not yet available. Figures 1 and 2 show the percentage of global arms deliveries for 1990 and 1993 by supplier country. *Includes all other European countries, except France, Germany, and the United Kingdom. *Includes all other European countries, except France, Germany, and the United Kingdom. In the short term, at least, it is likely that the United States will remain strong in the world market; it has $86 billion in defense orders placed from 1990 to 1993, while France, Germany, and the United Kingdom combined have $27 billion in defense orders from the same period. Although 1994 data for the three European competitor nations, in terms of defense orders, is not yet available, U.S. defense orders for fiscal year 1994 were about $13 billion—a 59-percent decrease from fiscal year 1993 levels, when orders were $32 billion. Figure 3 shows the total value of defense orders placed with France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States from 1990 to 1993. Further growth in the U.S. market share will be limited by several factors, including U.S. national security and export control policies. For example, in order to reduce dangerous or destabilizing arms transfers, the United States does not sell its defense products to certain countries, as part of its national security objectives. Those countries include Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Syria, and several countries of the former Soviet Union. According to the State Department, U.S. sales to other countries are reviewed on a case-by-case basis against U.S. conventional arms transfer policy criteria. Certain major foreign country buyers’ practices of diversifying weapons purchases among multiple suppliers further limits U.S. market share. For example, Kuwait announced in 1994 that it planned to diversify its weapons purchases among all five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council. Prior studies conducted by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA), and our office have concluded that there are numerous factors affecting defense export sales and that no one factor is paramount in every sale. These studies indicate that (1) each sale has its own unique set of circumstances and (2) the outcome is dependent on various factors. For example, the OMB study on financing defense exports concluded that each customer’s decision-making process on defense acquisitions is sufficiently different that it is impossible to draw definitive conclusions about the relative importance of any one factor. While the study was conducted to determine the need for defense export financing, it found that other factors influence defense sales, such as price, technical sophistication of the equipment, the cost and availability of follow-on support, system performance, lead time from placement of order to delivery, the availability of training, political influence, and the financial and economic conditions of purchasing countries. The OTA study identified co-production and technology transfer as factors that can influence a defense sale. This study noted countries that desire to develop their own defense industries are likely to consider access to technology when buying defense goods. In our May 1991 testimony before the House Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs on a proposal to finance defense export sales, we pointed out that it is difficult to quantify the effect of financing on defense sales because of all the other factors involved in the decision-making process. In addition to the factors cited by OMB and OTA, we noted the importance of offsets to a buying country when deciding between competitors in a defense sale. Industry representatives and government officials in the United States and Europe cited numerous factors that are important to defense export sales, but had differing views on what factors contributed to winning a specific defense sale. These officials cited the same factors identified by earlier government studies, including offsets, political ties, and price and quality of a product. However, when discussing the reasons behind any particular sale’s outcome, U.S. government officials and industry representatives identified different reasons for the outcome of the sale. For example, in the recent German tank sale to Sweden, U.S. government officials identified offsets as the deciding factor in the sale, while an industry representative believed that the historical ties between Sweden and Germany was the reason why the German tank was chosen. In a sale of French tanks to the United Arab Emirates, U.S. government officials considered offsets to be the more important determinant in the sale, while an industry representative cited historical relationships between the buyer and the seller as the primary factor. Moreover, several U.S. and European government officials and industry representatives stated that potential customers abroad view domestic procurement of a product as an important endorsement of confidence and one that helps lower unit costs by increasing the economies of scale associated with a system. These officials added that it is very difficult for a company to sell a defense article if its own country’s defense department or ministry does not use the equipment. For example, according to a U.S. government official, Northrop’s F-20 was designed specifically for export; however, Northrop was unable to sell the aircraft overseas, in part, because the U.S. government did not purchase it for domestic use. Further, because of the large size of the U.S. domestic defense market, European businesses feel that they are at a disadvantage with respect to their U.S. competitors, according to a 1992 survey conducted by the major French land-defense industry association and the consulting firm Ernst & Young. We found that France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States generally provided the same types of assistance, but the extent and structure of the assistance varies. All three European countries provide some form of government-backed export credit guarantees for both non-defense and defense exports as a means to provide security assistance and promote sales of their defense products. Data on the value of guarantees for defense exports, however, was available only in the United Kingdom. During fiscal year 1993/1994,the United Kingdom guaranteed $2.9 billion in defense exports. France and Germany report total export financing and do not differentiate between defense and non-defense export financing. Therefore, we were unable to obtain information on the extent of guarantees provided to defense exports in either country. In the United States, government financing is provided through the FMF program. According to DOD officials, FMF is provided as an instrument to advance U.S. foreign policy and national security interests rather than a means to promote U.S. exports. In fiscal year 1994 the United States used the program to provide about $3.1 billion in grants, mostly to Israel and Egypt, and $0.8 billion in loans to Greece, Turkey, and Portugal. Applicable U.S. legislation provides that FMF grants are generally intended to fund purchases of U.S. military goods and related services. It is unlikely U.S. contractors would lose sales to foreign competitors for FMF grant-funded purchases. The U.S. government is fully funding the purchase of U.S. military goods and services by other countries, thus giving U.S. companies an advantage over foreign competitors that are only offering government guarantees on loans. In addition, in fiscal year 1994, the Defense Security Assistance Agency waived about $273 million in research and development costs on foreign military sales to nine allied countries. U.S. commercial banks provide some financing of defense exports; however, the U.S. government does not guarantee such financing. The Export-Import Bank of the United States is prohibited from providing loans or guarantees for purchasing defense articles or services unless requested to do so by the President. Limited export financing is also provided at the state level. For example, from July 1988 to November 1994 the state of California provided about $26 million in loan guarantees to California-based defense companies. The French and U.K. governments have historically sent high-level government officials, such as ministers of defense, ambassadors, or prime ministers, to persuade foreign buyers to buy their national defense products. The German government has generally avoided using high-level government officials to promote defense exports, in part because defense exports are a politically sensitive issue in Germany. In the United States, defense exports have traditionally been approved to further U.S. national security and foreign policy goals. Nevertheless, as part of the U.S. government’s emphasis on overall export promotion efforts, high-ranking U.S. officials have been increasingly willing to intervene to influence competitions in favor of U.S. defense companies. However, DOD policy indicates that U.S. officials should support the marketing efforts of U.S. companies but maintain strict neutrality between U.S. competitors. During the competition for the United Kingdom’s Skynet-4 Satellite launch vehicle, U.S. government officials intervened at a high level on behalf of U.S. defense exporters. According to an industry representative involved in this sale, the U.K. Ministry of Defence split the contract between the U.S. company and the French as a result of intervention by the U.S. Ambassador and the Secretary of Commerce. The official stated that without U.S. government involvement, the French manufacturer would have received the entire $1-billion contract. France and the United Kingdom each have a single organization within their respective defense ministries with responsibility for identifying defense export opportunities abroad, promoting and facilitating defense exports, providing assistance with defense equipment demonstrations and trade shows, and providing advice to industry regarding offsets. In France this organization is known as the Delegation for International Relations. In the United Kingdom this organization is known as the Defence Export Services Organisation. Although Germany does not have a defense ministry organization comparable to that of France or the United Kingdom, German companies involved in cross-border collaborative efforts with those countries are able to benefit indirectly from the export promotion activities of the French and U.K. organizations. While the United States has no centralized government organization with a comparable export promotion role, the Departments of Defense, Commerce, and State each provide similar support for U.S. defense exports. The Departments of Commerce, Defense, and State were given the opportunity to comment on a draft of this report. Defense concurred with the report. Commerce wrote that it had reviewed the draft report and did not have any comments. State, in general, agreed with our analysis and conclusions and found the draft report to be an accurate reflection of the international competition for military export contracts. State also commented that offsets play a major role in determining which firms obtain contracts and foreign governments are eager to support offset arrangements to obtain a competitive advantage. In addition, State noted that sales of conventional arms are a legitimate instrument of U.S. foreign policy deserving U.S. government support when they help friends and allies deter aggression, promote regional stability, and increase interoperability of U.S. and allied forces. However, State pointed out that an examination of the dynamics of regional power balances and the potential for destabilizing changes in the region is required for each specific sale. We have made minor factual revisions to the report where appropriate based on technical comments provided by Defense and State. We did our work between January 1994 and February 1995 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. A discussion of our scope and methodology is in appendix I. More information on government support to enhance the competitiveness of defense products is provided in appendix II. The comments of the Departments of Defense, State, and Commerce are presented in appendixes III, IV, and V, respectively. We are sending copies of this report to the Secretaries of Defense, Commerce, and State and the appropriate congressional committees. Copies will also be available to other interested parties on request. Please contact me at (202) 512-4587 if you or your staff have any questions concerning this report. Other major contributors to this report are listed in appendix VI. Because of the continuing debate on how much support to provide to defense exporters, we reviewed conditions in the global defense export market and the tools used by France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States to enhance the competitiveness of their defense exports. Specifically, we compared the U.S. position in the global defense market relative to its major competitors and analyzed the various factors that can contribute to a sale, including export financing and other types of government support. For our review, we selected France, Germany, and the United Kingdom because they (1) represent the major competitors to U.S. defense exporters in terms of the value of exports sold and (2) sell to approximately the same buyers. In 1993 these four countries represented 81 percent of the world’s total defense market. Together, Russia and China represented 13 percent of the total market, but were not part of this review because a large share of Russian and Chinese defense products are sold to countries to which the United States would not sell. While several U.S. government agencies collect information on defense exports, it is difficult to compare their analyses because each agency uses different methodologies for collecting and reporting the data. We used mostly Congressional Research Service (CRS) data on defense exports for calendar years 1990 to 1993 to compare the U.S. position in the global defense market relative to its European competitors. We also used more current data on French defense exports, in terms of deliveries, provided by the U.S. government. This new data increased the level of French defense exports, both in absolute and relative terms, previously reported by CRS. Further, we use calendar year data rather than fiscal year data because data on European defense exports is reported on a calendar year basis. We did not independently verify CRS data, but the data is generally accepted among government agencies as dependable. In addition, we used the State Department’s Office of Defense Trade Controls data on deliveries of U.S. direct commercial sales, because CRS does not include that data in its annual reports on global arms sales. To determine the U.S. position in the global defense market in the near future, we used the value of U.S. defense orders as reported by CRS. However, the value of these orders includes only those placed through the Foreign Military Sales program and does not include orders placed by direct commercial means. While the State Department reports the value of export licenses approved for direct commercial sales, it does not report the value of actual defense orders placed as a result of those licenses. The value of direct commercial sales deliveries as a result of those licenses, according to government documents, may be as little as 40 to 60 percent of the value originally reported when the license was approved. The State Department reported that it issued about $87 billion in licenses from fiscal year 1990 to 1993. In analyzing the various factors that contributed to winning a defense sale, we held discussions with U.S. government and defense company officials responsible for tracking U.S. defense sales. In addition, we reviewed prior government reports on the subject. To obtain information on U.S. defense export promotion efforts, we reviewed numerous government and nongovernment studies and reports on the subject. In addition, we interviewed officials at the Departments of Defense, Commerce, and State, and the Defense Security Assistance Agency; U.S. defense company officials located in the United States and Europe; and trade organizations. We also spoke to officials from the Office of Management and Budget, the Export-Import Bank, the Banker’s Association for Foreign Trade, and six commercial banks, to obtain additional information on defense export financing. To obtain information on European countries’ export promotion programs, we discussed with, and analyzed documents from, officials involved in their countries’ defense export promotion activities. This group included officials from national governments, academia, and European defense companies. We also met with officials from the Department of Defense’s Office of Defense Cooperation and the Department of Commerce’s U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service offices. We also attended the Eurosatory Land Show in Paris, France, to observe U.S. exporters and their competitors at a major defense trade show. To convert French francs and British pounds to U.S. dollars, we used the following exchange rates. To report on France’s Delegation for International Relations annual budget, we used the average calendar year 1994 exchange rate. To report on the U.K.’s Defence Export Services Organisation annual budget and the amount of defense export financing provided by the Export Credits Guarantee Department, we used the exchange rate at the end of the U.K. fiscal years ending March 31, 1993, and March 31, 1994. We sought to report on multilateral agreements on defense trade and found that no such agreements exist. Approaches to financing defense exports vary among the four countries. Such financing includes the use of various financial instruments, including grants, loans, and guarantees. In the United States, most financing is provided through the government’s Foreign Military Financing (FMF) program, with limited financing provided by commercial banks. Some financing is also available at the state level. A 1992 decision to cancel fees on some sales that recovered part of the government’s investment in a weapon system was made to increase the competitiveness of U.S. firms. In fiscal year 1994 the United States used the FMF program to provide about $3.1 billion in grants—mostly to Israel and Egypt—and $0.8 billion in loans to Greece, Turkey, and Portugal. The FMF program enables U.S. allies to buy U.S. defense goods and related services and training. Congress often specifies the extent of assistance to certain countries. Most grants and loans are used to purchase U.S. defense products, although a designated amount of FMF funding is permitted to be spent on procurement in Israel. In fiscal year 1994 Israel was permitted to spend at least $475 million of its grant assistance on procurement in Israel. The FMF program has decreased since 1990, when the program provided over $4.8 billion in loans and grants. The U.S. government does not guarantee commercial financing for defense exports. Further, the Export-Import Bank of the United States is prohibited from providing loans or guarantees for purchasing defense equipment. Therefore, according to U.S. bank officials, U.S. commercial banks provide few financial services for defense exports, partly because of concerns that such services might generate negative publicity. Senior bank managers approve defense export financing transactions on a case-by-case basis. Financing is provided for defense transactions that are low risk and will carry a short repayment schedule. According to bank officials, repayment terms of commercial loans for defense exports generally do not exceed 2 years. These officials further stated that commercial banks are reluctant to provide financing to foreign countries without some type of U.S. government guarantee program. Moreover, even with such a program, some banks would still be reluctant to provide financing to defense exports, because of concerns about negative publicity. Some export financing is provided at the state level. For example, the state of California provides export financing for its defense companies. From July 1988 through November 1994 California provided about $26 million in loan guarantees for 77 transactions to California-based defense companies. At the time of this review, 30 states provided export financing. However, data on export financing is not separated out by defense and nondefense exports; therefore, we were not able to determine how many states, other than California, provided financing for defense exports. For years the price of U.S. military exports generally included a Department of Defense (DOD) charge to recover a portion of its non-recurring research and development costs. In 1992 the policy of recovering these costs when the sales were directly between the U.S. contractor and a foreign government was canceled. The recovery of U.S. government costs were canceled in an effort to increase the competitiveness of U.S. firms in the world market. In addition, the Arms Export Control Act, which generally requires recovery of such costs on government to government sales, permits DOD to waive or reduce such charges on sales to North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan in furtherance of standardization and mutual defense treaties. In fiscal year 1994, DOD recovered $181 million in such costs but waived about $273 million. Recently, the executive branch has proposed that Congress repeal the requirement to collect such charges on future government to government sales. All three European countries provide some form of government-backed export credit guarantees for both nondefense and defense exports. Export credit guarantees are a form of insurance covering risk of loss due to such factors as exchange rate fluctuations or buyer nonpayment. They can allow access to financing for exporters extending credit to their buyers and for overseas buyers borrowing directly from banks. Data on the value of guarantees for defense exports, however, was available only in the United Kingdom. France and Germany report total export financing and do not differentiate between defense and nondefense export financing. Thus, we were unable to obtain information on the extent of guarantees provided to defense exports in either country. During fiscal year 1993/1994, the United Kingdom’s Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD) guaranteed about $6.1 billion in exports, of which $2.9 billion (or 48 percent) was for defense exports. About 90 percent of the $2.9 billion was for defense equipment sold to countries in the Middle East, mostly to Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia. Among industry sectors, military aircraft represented about 40 percent of the $2.9 billion total, military vehicles represented about 39 percent, and naval vessels represented about 21 percent. In fiscal year 1992/1993, ECGD guaranteed about $5.8 billion in exports, of which $2.4 billion (or 42 percent) was for defense exports. About 57 percent of the $2.4 billion was for defense equipment sold to countries in the Far East and about 43 percent of the total was for equipment sold to the Middle East. Among industry sectors, naval vessels represented about 39 percent of the $2.4 billion total, military aircraft represented about 32 percent, and munitions and missiles represented about 27 percent. The French and U.K. governments have historically sent ministers of defense, ambassadors, or prime ministers to persuade foreign buyers to buy their national defense products. The German government has generally avoided using high-level government officials to promote defense exports, in part because such exports are a sensitive political issue in Germany. In the United States, defense exports have been approved to further U.S. national security and foreign policy goals. Nevertheless, as part of the U.S. government’s emphasis on overall export promotion efforts, high-ranking U.S. officials have been increasingly willing to intervene to influence competitions in favor of U.S. defense companies. An example of high-level government advocacy is the Swedish government’s purchase of the German Leopard 2 tank. The German Chancellor and Minister of Defense advocated on behalf of the German Leopard 2 tank, which, according to U.S. government officials, led to Sweden purchasing it over the French or U.S. tank. Other factors contributing to Sweden’s choice included the German manufacturer’s promise to buy Swedish defense material and services worth full value of the tanks they were exporting to Sweden. France and the United Kingdom each have a single organization within their respective defense ministries with responsibility for identifying defense export opportunities abroad, promoting and facilitating defense exports, providing assistance with defense equipment demonstrations and trade shows, and providing advice to industry regarding offsets. Although Germany does not have a defense ministry organization comparable to those of France or the United Kingdom, German companies involved in cross-border collaborative efforts with those countries are able to benefit indirectly from the export promotion activities of the French and U.K. organizations. While the United States has no centralized government organization with a comparable export promotion role, several U.S. government agencies provide similar support for U.S. defense exports. In France, the Ministry of Defense’s Delegation for International Relations (DRI) is responsible for facilitating and promoting French global defense sales. DRI assigns defense attachés overseas to promote military and armament relations with other countries. DRI also subsidizes missions for small business to participate in events such as trade shows. DRI employs roughly 200 staff—about 60 are involved in facilitating and promoting defense sales with the remaining staff involved in export control activities and oversight of cooperation activities with allied nations. DRI has an annual budget of $7 million which is used in a variety of ways, including Ministry of Defense participation in trade shows and subsidizing small business missions to participate in those shows. DRI also serves as a liaison between the Ministries of Defense and Industry, which, according to DRI officials, is the most important support provided to the French defense industry. While DRI promotes and facilitates sales, sales are primarily handled either by defense companies themselves or by various marketing and sales organizations. The French government owns 49.9 percent of the Défense Conseil International (DCI). DCI serves as a consultant to buying countries to help them define their operational needs, weapon requirements, and specifications. The remaining 51.1 percent is owned by private-sector marketing and sales organizations. In the United Kingdom, the Ministry of Defence’s Defence Export Services Organisation (DESO) is responsible for assisting in the marketing and sales efforts of U.K. defense companies overseas, whether manufactured nationally or in collaboration with others. DESO serves as a focal point for all defense sales and service matters, including advising firms on defense market prospects on a worldwide, regional, or country basis; providing marketing and military assistance in support of sales; organizing exhibitions, missions, and demonstrations; providing advice on export and project financing; ensuring that overseas sales consideration is given due weight in the U.K. Ministry of Defence’s own procurement process; briefing companies new to the defense sector and to exporting; and monitoring offset agreements. DESO’s budget for fiscal year 1992/1993 was about $25.9 million. DESO has approximately 350 staff—about 100 in marketing services, 50 in general policy, and 200 in direct project work. DESO concentrates primarily on supporting higher-value exports, although smaller companies also benefit from DESO guidance on such matters as how best to pursue potential subcontracts. In addition, larger companies rely on DESO to serve as a liaison with high-level U.K. and foreign government officials. The Departments of Defense, Commerce, and State each provide support in promoting U.S. defense exports. Moreover, the U.S. government has long recognized the positive impact that defense exports can have on the defense industrial base. Beginning in 1990 the U.S. government began to give more prominence to the economic value of defense exports. At that time, the Secretary of State directed overseas personnel to assist defense companies in marketing efforts. The Secretary added that individuals marketing U.S. defense products should receive the same courtesies and support offered to persons marketing any other U.S. product. More recently, the U.S. government announced its National Export Strategy, which is designed to establish a framework for strengthening U.S. export promotion efforts. Although the strategy does not target defense exports, some recommendations for improving export promotion activities could benefit defense exports. For example, the strategy recommended that overseas posts prepare country commercial guides. The guides are to include information on the host country’s best export prospects for U.S. companies, which may include defense exports. These guides are to be made available to the public through the Department of Commerce’s National Trade Data Bank. In February 1995, the President announced his conventional arms transfer policy which included, as one of its principal goals, enhancing the U.S. defense industry’s ability to meet U.S. defense requirements and maintain long-term military technological superiority at lower costs. The announcement indicated that once a proposed arms transfer is approved, the U.S. government will take such steps as (1) tasking U.S. embassy personnel to support overseas marketing efforts of American companies bidding on defense contracts, (2) actively involving senior government officials in promoting sales of particular importance to the United States, and (3) supporting DOD participation in international air and trade shows. As part of the U.S. security assistance program, the Defense Security Assistance Agency and the military services implement the Foreign Military Sales program, through which most U.S. defense sales are made. U.S. security assistance personnel stationed overseas are primarily responsible for security assistance and defense cooperation activities in the host country. When requested, these personnel provide information and support to U.S. industry on business opportunities in the host country, including information on the buying countries’ defense budget cycle, national procurement process, and estimates of equipment the country currently needs to fill defense requirements or likely future procurement plans. In addition, the Defense Security Assistance Agency coordinates DOD participation in international air shows and trade exhibitions. The military services lease equipment to U.S. defense companies for display or demonstration at such events. The Department of Commerce has primary responsibility for export promotion and has recently expanded its export promotion activities to include defense exports. For example, Commerce prepares market research reports on various countries. These reports identify trade opportunities in the host country, including those in defense trade. Other information on the host country included in these reports includes information on market assessment, best sales prospects, the competitive situation, and market access. These reports are made available to the public through the National Trade Data Bank. Other activities include preparing U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service Officer guidance on supporting defense exports. This guidance directs officers to provide information similar to that provided by the Defense Security Assistance Agency and the military services. Moreover, the Departments of Commerce, State, and Defense participate in defense industry liaison working groups to assess improving U.S. government support for U.S. defense exporters.

GAO found that: (1) the United States has been the world's leading defense exporter since 1990; by 1993 its market share had increased to 49 percent of the global market; (2) the increased U.S. market share occurred during a period of worldwide decreases in total defense exports; (3) the three European countries reviewed (France, Germany, and the United Kingdom) had in 1993 a combined global market share of about 32 percent of total defense exports, which also increased since 1990; (4) in the short term, at least, the United States will likely remain strong in the world market; however, further growth in its market share will be limited by a number of factors, including U.S. policies to reduce dangerous or destabilizing arms transfers to certain countries and certain major foreign country buyers' practices of diversifying weapons purchases among multiple suppliers; (5) government involvement in the defense industry's sales affects the position of defense manufacturers in overseas markets, but other factors also influencing defense sales include technical sophistication and performance, the cost and availability of follow-on support and training, price, financing, and offset arrangements; (6) government policies and programs can also affect these other factors; (7) because each sale has its own unique set of circumstances, it is not possible to quantify or rank the contribution of any one factor across the board; (8) the U.S. government has long recognized the positive impact that defense exports can have on the defense industrial base; (9) in 1990, the Secretary of State directed overseas missions to support the marketing efforts of U.S. defense companies as in all other areas of commercial activity; (10) governments in France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States generally provide comparable types of support, including: (a) government-backed or -provided export financing; (b) advocacy on behalf of defense companies by high-level government officials; and (c) organizational entities that promote defense exports; (11) although all four countries generally provide comparable types of assistance to their defense exporters in these areas, the extent and structure of such assistance varies; (12) central organizations support defense exports in France and the United Kingdom, while in the United States several government agencies share in supporting defense exports; and (13) all three European countries provide government-backed guarantees for commercial bank loans, while in the United States, financing is provided primarily through the Foreign Military Financing Program in the form of grants and loans and available only to a small group of countries."}

Pursuant to this power, Congress enacted the Postal Reorganization Act of 1970, which created the United States Postal Service as an independent establishment in the executive branch of the U.S. government. It enacted this statute to permit the Postal Service to operate more like a business than a government entity. Before the 1970 act became law, the Cabinet-level Department of the Post Office operated postal services. While Congress applied to the Postal Service some statutes, including those relating to veterans' preference and retirement, that apply to federal entities and prohibited postal employees, like other federal employees, from striking, it provided in Section 1209(a) of Title 39 of the United States Code that, \"Employee-management relations shall, to the extent not inconsistent with the provisions of this title, be subject to the provisions of subchapter II of chapter 7 of Title 29.\" This language cites the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), which governs private sector employee-management relations. These relations in most federal departments and agencies are regulated by chapter 71 of Title 5 of the U.S. Code, known as the Federal Labor-Management Relations Statute. Congress in the 1970 act, codified at Title 39 of the U.S. Code, also granted the U.S. Postal Service broader employee-management authority than exercised by most other federal departments and agencies. A provision of the act, 39 U.S.C. Section 1005(f), identifies subjects of Postal Service collective bargaining: compensation, benefits, and other terms and conditions of employment. This scope differs from the one that applies to most federal agencies, which is limited to conditions of employment. For those agencies, the phrase \"conditions of employment\" is defined in 5 U.S.C. Section 7103 expressly to exclude policies, practices, and matters relating to political activities prohibited under subchapter III of chapter 73 of Title 5 (i.e., the Hatch Act); classification of any position; and, significantly, conditions of employment that are specifically provided for in federal statute. This final exclusion precludes collective bargaining over conditions of employment such as Federal Employees Group Life Insurance (FEGLI) and the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) because they are specifically provided for in 5 U.S.C. chapters 87 and 89, respectively. Addressing the transition from the Postal Office Department to the businesslike U.S. Postal Service, Congress in 39 U.S.C. Section 1005(f) indicated that compensation, fringe benefits, and other terms and conditions of employment that were in effect immediately prior to the effective date of the section (i.e., July 1, 1971) would continue to apply to officers and employees of the Postal Service in accordance with chapters 10 and 12 of Title 39, which relate to employment and employee-management relations, respectively. The final sentence of Section 1005(f) states the following: No variation, addition, or substitution with respect to fringe benefits shall result in a program of fringe benefits which on the whole is less favorable to the officers and employees in effect on the effective date of this section, and as to officers and employees for whom there is a collective-bargaining representative, no such variation, addition, or substitution shall be made except by agreement between the collective bargaining representative and the Postal Service. Congress provided procedures for terminating collective bargaining agreements in Section 1207 of Title 39. This section states that a party wishing to terminate or modify an agreement while it is in effect must serve timely written notice on the other party. If parties cannot agree on a resolution or adopt a procedure for a binding resolution of a dispute, the Director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service must appoint a mediator. This section also grants authority to establish an arbitration board under certain circumstances and provides that a board decision is conclusive and binding on the parties. Collective bargaining agreements are contracts between the Postal Service and unions that prescribe employee-management relations on subjects that Congress has permitted to be collectively bargained. Can Congress through legislation modify the scope of bargaining or terms of collective bargaining agreements? Congress has authority prospectively to modify the scope of bargaining or terms of collective bargaining agreements after they expire. In the 1970 act, Congress granted the Postal Service and collective-bargaining representatives authority to bargain collectively over compensation, fringe benefits such as health insurance and life insurance, and other conditions of employment, but it could amend that statute to limit the scope of bargaining subjects in the future. For example, Congress could mandate that rates of employee premiums for health or life insurance no longer will be subjects of collective bargaining. Enacting a statute to modify the scope of bargaining or terms of agreements before they expire, however, may present legal questions to be resolved by a court. For example, a court may have to determine whether such a statute may cause the Postal Service to breach a contract or exceed constitutional limits under the Takings and/or Due Process Clauses of the Fifth Amendment. Some sections of Title III \"Postal Service Workforce\" as reported favorably to the full House by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform on October 13, 2011, would directly modify some provisions of Title 39 of the U.S. Code that relate to Postal Service collective bargaining agreements and employee-management relations. Many of these sections appear to have been based on recommendations of the President's Commission on the United States Postal Service issued in 2003. Section 301(a), \"Modifications Relating to Pay Comparability,\" of H.R. 2309 would amend the first sentence of 39 U.S.C. Section 101(c), which states that, \"As an employer, the Postal Service shall achieve and maintain compensation for its officers and employees comparable to the rates and types of compensation paid in the private sector of the economy of the United States.\" This subsection would insert \"total\" before \"rates and types of compensation\" and insert \"entire\" before \"private sector.\" Section 301(b) would make a corresponding change to the second sentence of 39 U.S.C. §1003(a), which provides that, \"It shall be the policy of the Postal Service to maintain compensation and benefits for all officers and employees on a standard of comparability to the compensation and benefits paid for comparable levels of work in the private sector of the economy.\" \"Total\" would be inserted before \"compensation and benefits\" each place it appears and \"entire\" would be inserted before \"private sector.\" Section 301(c) would provide that for purposes of amendments made by Section 301, any determination of total rates and types of compensation or total compensation and benefits \"... shall, at a minimum, take into account pay, health benefits, retirement benefits, life insurance benefits, leave, holidays, and continuity and stability of employment.\" The President's Commission Report explained that amendments to this effect would clarify that the 1970 act's commitment to comparability with the private sector should apply to total compensation packages that are available to Postal Service officers and employees and should take into account the value of federal benefits such as cost of living increases in retirement that may not be widely available to private sector workers. Section 302 of H.R. 2309 , \"Limitations under FEGLI and FEHBP,\" would amend 39 U.S.C. Section 1003 by adding at the end a new subsection (e) to provide that Postal Service employer contributions for government life insurance and health insurance benefit programs shall be the same as those for government departments and agencies. This amendment would take effect for each fiscal year after September 30, 2013, the end of FY2013. For employees covered by collective bargaining agreements, however, this change would not take effect for any fiscal year until after these agreements expire, including any portion that remains of a fiscal year if those agreements expire before the end of a fiscal year. Section 8707(c)(2) of Title 5 of the U.S. Code provides that 66.66% of premium costs shall be withheld for employees who participate in the Federal Employees Group Life Insurance (FEGLI) program. Section 8708(a) states that the government agency contribution is one-half of the share paid by employees. According to the committee report, Postal Service employees currently pay nothing for life insurance premiums compared to over 66% that other federal employees pay. Because employees pay nothing for these premiums, the Postal Service as the employing agency pays 100% of them. Section 8906(b)(1) of Title 5 provides that the biweekly government contribution rate in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) for most federal employees can be adjusted to 72% of the Office of Personnel Management-determined weighted average of subscription charges for individual only and for individual and family health insurance coverage. Under current law, bargaining representatives can and have negotiated higher Postal Service employer contributions for employees that have resulted in lower employee contributions. The committee report observes that postal employees currently pay 21% of health care premiums compared to 28% that other federal employees pay. As a consequence of these agreement terms, the Postal Service as the employing agency pays an average of 79% of health insurance premiums for its employees. Section 303 of H.R. 2309 , \"Repeal of Provision Relating to Overall Value of Fringe Benefits,\" would repeal the last sentence of 39 U.S. Section 1005(f), which constrains the ability of the Postal Service to modify fringe benefits. As noted above, this subsection states that compensation, benefits, and other terms and conditions of employment that were in effect before the effective date of the Postal Reorganization Act of 1970, July 1, 1971, shall continue to apply to Postal Service officers and employees unless changed by the Postal Service in accordance with chapters 10 and 12 of Title 39 of the U.S. Code. The final sentence of Section 1005(f) that would be repealed by Section 303 of H.R. 2309 provides that No variation, addition, or substitution with respect to fringe benefits shall result in a program of fringe benefits which on the whole is less favorable to the officers and employees in effect on the effective date of this section, and as to officers and employees for whom there is a collective bargaining representative, no such variation, addition, or substitution shall be made except by agreement between the collective bargaining representative and the Postal Service . (Emphasis supplied.) This section would implement a recommendation of the President's Commission Report. It would appear to permit the Postal Service to vary, add to, or substitute fringe benefits which on the whole could be less favorable to officers and employees than those that were in effect in 1971. Moreover, the Postal Service would appear to be able to modify fringe benefits for officers and employees who have a collective bargaining representative without achieving agreement between that representative and the Postal Service. Section 304, \"Applicability of Reduction-in-Force Procedures,\" would amend 39 U.S.C. Section 1206, which relates to collective bargaining agreements, by adding at the end new subsections (d) through (f). As amended by Section 304, 39 U.S.C. Section 1206(d) would prohibit any provision that would bar reduction-in-force procedures under Title 5 of the United States Code for collective bargaining agreements between the Postal Service and bargaining representatives that are ratified after subsection (d) is enacted. For collective bargaining agreements between the Postal Service and bargaining representatives that were ratified before the enactment date of H.R. 2309 , Section 1206(e), as amended by Section 304, would require renegotiating any provision that restricts applying Title 5 reduction-in-force procedures. The new Section 1206(f) would provide that if a collective bargaining agreement ratified after the enactment date of H.R. 2309 includes reduction-in-force procedures that can be applied in lieu of those in Title 5, the Postal Service may, in its discretion, apply to members of that bargaining unit the alternative procedures or the Title 5 procedures. If procedures for resolving a dispute or impasse are invoked, however, the award of an arbitration board or other resolution reached could not provide for eliminating or substituting any alternative procedures in lieu of Title 5 reduction-in-force procedures. The intent of Section 304 is to prohibit no-layoff clauses in future collective bargaining agreements and require renegotiating any agreements that currently have them. The President's Commission Report observed that protection from layoffs had been included in collective bargaining agreements since around 1978 and that as of February of 2003, when that report was written, these clauses protected from layoffs an average of about 89% of Postal Service union employees with some variation from union to union. Referring to collectively bargained restrictions on the Postal Service's ability to use Title 5 reduction-in-force procedures, the House committee report states that, \"... postal employees are virtually the only federal workers who enjoy such protections.\" Title 5 procedures generally take into account tenure of employment including type of appointment (e.g., career or career-conditional); veterans' preference; length of service; and efficiency or performance ratings. The report adds that, \"This is no longer tenable, since the Postal Service is now in a position where it is unable to achieve workforce reductions through attrition alone. The bill specifically allows unions to negotiate alternative reduction-in-force methods that achieve needed rightsizing.\" The report continues that this alternative authority was granted to permit postal unions to negotiate other forms of reduction-in-force such as retirement conversion as alternatives to the last-in-first-out method prescribed under Title 5. Section 305 of H.R. 2309 , \"Modifications Relating to Collective Bargaining,\" would strike subsections (c) and (d) of 39 U.S.C. Section 1207, which relate to procedures for resolving labor disputes. It would replace them with new subsections (c) and (d) to require neutral arbitrators, impose and/or shorten time limits on mediation and arbitration, and specify factors that arbitration boards must consider. Subsection (c) would be amended to change the manner of selecting members of each three-member arbitration board which is established if parties cannot resolve a dispute within 30 days after a mediator was appointed or if they decide upon arbitration before that 30-day period expires. The board would consist of one member appointed by the Postal Service and one member appointed by the bargaining representative of employees and a third member who had been appointed as a mediator pursuant to 39 U.S.C. Section 1207(b). Section 1207(c)(1) of current law provides that the Postal Service and the collective bargaining representative of employees each shall select one board member and that the two members who were selected by the parties shall choose the third board member. Currently, these parties are not required to select neutral arbitrators. If either of the parties fails to select a member or if the two parties cannot agree on a third member, however, the Director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service selects a party's member or third member from a list of nine neutral arbitrators. While the amendment in Section 305 of H.R. 2309 would retain each party's opportunity to select one arbitration board member, it would require that the parties select an arbitrator from a list of nine neutral arbitrators provided by the Director rather than anyone each party selects as under current law. This amendment would retain current law regarding the Director's selection of a party's board member from that list if a party fails to select a neutral arbitrator from it within seven days after the list is made available. It would change current law by making the mediator who had been selected from that list by the Director pursuant to Section 1207(b) the third arbitration board member. The parties no longer jointly would select the third member. The President's Commission Report indicated that by putting the mediator on an arbitration board, progress that had been made during the negotiation and mediation phases would not be lost, arbitrators would be made aware of earlier concessions that each party had made, and the parties would be less likely to revert to earlier bargaining positions. The report said that the entire process would not have to \"start from scratch.\" Pursuant to 39 U.S.C. Section 1207(c)(3), as amended by Section 305 of H.R. 2309 , an arbitration board would be required to give the parties a full and fair hearing no more than 40 days after it is established. No more than seven days after the hearing is concluded, each party would have to present two offer packages, each of which would specify the terms of a proposed final agreement. No later than three days after submission of final offer packages, the arbitration board would select one of them as its tentative award. The board, however, could not select a final offer package unless the offer complies with each of the following: (1) it has comparability with the private sector in 39 U.S.C. Sections 101(c) and 1003(a); (2) it takes into account the current financial condition of the Postal Service; and (3) it takes into account the long-term financial condition of the Postal Service. If the board unanimously determines, based on clear and convincing evidence presented during the hearing, that neither final offer satisfies these three conditions, the board by majority vote would be required to select a tentative award (i.e., the package that best meets these conditions) and modify it to the minimum extent to satisfy them. The parties could negotiate a substitute award to replace the tentative award selected by the arbitration board from the final offers that had been submitted by the parties or rendered by the board after it selects a final offer package that best meets the three conditions and modifies it. If no agreement on a substitute award is reached by the parties within 10 days after the date on which the tentative award is selected or rendered, the tentative award would become final. If neither party submits a final offer package by the seventh day after a hearing is concluded, the arbitration board would have to develop and issue a final award no later than 20 days after the seventh day. A final award or agreement would be conclusive and binding upon the parties. Costs of the arbitration board and mediation would be shared by the Postal Service and the bargaining representative. Section 1207(d) of Title 39 of the U.S. Code would be amended by Section 305 of H.R. 2309 to require appointing a mediator if a bargaining unit whose recognized collective bargaining representative does not have a collective bargaining agreement with the Postal Service and if the parties fail to reach agreement on such an agreement within 90 days after bargaining commences. A mediator would have to be appointed unless the parties previously have agreed to another procedure for binding resolution of their differences. If parties fail to reach agreement within 180 days after collective bargaining commences, an arbitration board would be established to provide conclusive and binding arbitration in accordance with subsection (c). The committee report explains that Section 305 Reforms the collective bargaining process to contain a mediation-arbitration process with a defined timeline model after recommendations of the 2003 President's Commission on the Postal Service. Creates an arbitration board of three neutral individuals. Any arbitration award is required to take into account both pay comparability with the private sector and the financial condition of the Postal Service. Further, once the arbitration stage has been reached, any agreement reached by the Postal Service and a union independent of the arbitration panel must also satisfy these same requirements. If such an agreement fails to do so, the arbitration panel is required to amend the agreement in a manner that does satisfy the requirement. As this excerpt reveals, this mediation-arbitration process is based on recommendations in the 2003 President's Commission on the Postal Service. The commission asserted that the current process took too long and encouraged parties to revert to entrenched positions rather than seek to resolve their differences. Section 202, \"Establishment of the Authority,\" in Title II of H.R. 2309 would create the Postal Service Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority (the Authority) to assume all authorities and responsibilities of the Postal Service Board of Governors, individual governors, and the Postal Service during a \"control period.\" The Authority would be a receiver-like body of five non-salaried members appointed by the President from recommendations made by congressional leaders. According to the committee report, this proposal \"... drew on the highly successful D.C. Control Board, formally known as the District of Columbia Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority, ... a receiver-like body put in place during the 1990s in order to restore D.C.'s solvency during a period of financial mismanagement.\" A control period would commence whenever the Postal Service has been in default to the United States Treasury for a period of 30 days. For the first control period, the Authority would operate solely in an advisory capacity. At the end of the second full fiscal year or any year thereafter during the length of a control period if the Postal Service's annual deficit is greater than $2 billion, however, the Authority would be fully in force. During an advisory period, the Authority could not employ any staff, and any provision that requires it or the Postal Service to take any action only would take effect in the event that the Authority comes into full force. The date that the Authority comes into full force would be considered the commencement date of the control period. During a control period when fully in force, the Authority would direct the exercise of the Postal Service's powers, including, among other things, \"human resource strategies, collective bargaining strategies, negotiation parameters, and collective bargaining agreements, and the compensation structure for nonbargaining employees.\" Section 224(b) of H.R. 2309 , \"Responsibilities of the Authority,\" would direct the Postmaster General to submit to the Authority any proposal that has a substantial effect on these quoted items. If the Authority determines that a proposal is consistent with a financial plan and budget, it would notify the Postmaster General that the proposal is approved. If it determines that a proposal significantly is inconsistent with that plan and budget, the Authority would be required to notify the Postmaster General of its finding with an explanation of its reason for that finding and, to the extent it considers appropriate, provide the Postmaster General with recommendations for modifying the proposal. The Authority's failure to notify the Postmaster General of approval or disapproval within a prescribed time would be deemed approval. When in full force, the Authority would be empowered to review each contract, including each labor contract entered into through collective bargaining, that the Postal Service proposes to enter into, renew, modify, or extend during a control period. The Postal Service could not enter into such a contract unless the Authority determines that it is consistent with the financial plan and budget for the fiscal year. Other contracts, after execution, including collective bargaining agreements entered into by the Postal Service that are in effect during a control period, would have to be submitted to the Authority when any control period commences and at such other times as it may require. The bill would direct the Authority to review these contracts after execution to determine whether they are consistent with the financial plan and budget for the fiscal year. If the Authority determines that a contract is not consistent, the Authority would have to take such actions that are within its powers to revise it. The Authority and its members would not be liable for any obligation or claim against the Postal Service resulting from actions to carry out Title II of H.R. 2309 , entitled \"Postal Service Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority.\" The bill expresses the sense of Congress that, in making determinations that affect prior collective bargaining agreements and prior agreements on workforce reduction, any rightsizing effort within the Postal Service that results in a decrease in the number of postal employees should ensure that such employees can receive their full pensions, are fully compensated, and that agreements on workforce reduction which were entered into with the Postal Service be fully honored. When fully in force, the Authority could seek judicial enforcement of its Authority to carry out its responsibilities. Any Postal Service officer or employee who, by action or inaction, fails to comply with any Authority directive or other order under Section 226(c) of H.R. 2309 , \"Recommendations Regarding Financial Stability,\" would be subject to appropriate administrative discipline, including suspension from duty without pay or removal from office, by order of either the Postmaster General or the Authority. Whenever a Postal Service officer or employee takes or fails to take any action in a manner which is noncompliant with such a directive or order, the Postmaster General would be required immediately to report to the Authority all pertinent facts, together with a statement of any administrative disciplinary actions that the Postmaster took or proposes to take. Section 226(c) would empower the Authority to implement recommendations regarding financial stability that it has submitted to the Postal Service, but that were rejected by the Postal Service. The Authority's recommendations could include, among others, establishing alternatives to meet obligations to pay for pensions and retirement benefits of current and future Postal Service employees and increasing use of an employee personnel system based upon performance standards. This subsection would apply with respect to Authority recommendations made after the expiration of the six-month period beginning on the date a control period commences. Section 213(a) of H.R. 2309 , \"Treatment of Actions Arising Under This Title,\" would authorize a person, including the Postal Service, adversely affected or aggrieved by an Authority order or decision to institute proceedings within 30 days after a decision or order becomes final by filing a petition with the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. It would direct the court to review the order or decision in accordance with 5 U.S.C. Section 706 and 28 U.S.C. chapter 158 and Section 2112. This subsection states that, \"Judicial review shall be limited to the question of whether the Authority acted in excess of its statutory authority, and determinations of the Authority shall be upheld if based on a permissible construction of the statutory authority.\" The bill would permit Supreme Court review of a D.C. Circuit decision only if a petition for review is filed within 10 days after a decision is entered. No order of any court granting declaratory or injunctive relief against the Authority, including relief that permits or requires obligating, borrowing, or expending funds, could take effect while an action is pending in court, during the time an appeal may be taken, or, if an appeal is taken, during the period before the court has entered its final order disposing of the action. The bill states that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia and the Supreme Court have a duty to advance on the docket and expedite to the greatest possible extent the disposition of any matter brought by an affected or aggrieved person. The Senate passed S. 1789 on April 25, 2012, by a vote of 62 to 37. Section 106, \"Arbitration: Labor Disputes,\" would amend 39 U.S.C. Section 1207(c)(2), which relates to arbitration proceedings to resolve labor disputes. It would add a requirement that, \"In rendering a decision under this paragraph, the arbitration board shall consider such factors as the financial condition of the Postal Service.\" It also would add the following language: \"Nothing in this section may be construed to limit the relevant factors that the arbitration board may take into consideration in rendering a decision under paragraph (2).\" This Senate-passed language is similar but not identical to language in Section 105 of S. 1789 that was reported to the Senate by the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. The committee report observed that two successive Postmasters General requested a statutory amendment requiring arbitration boards to consider the Postal Service's financial condition and that the Government Accountability Office favored such an amendment, but that some postal union presidents opposed it. This report added that The Committee decided that, at this period when the Postal Service faces such dire financial difficulties, arbitrators must consider the financial condition of the Postal Service, and S. 1789 should say so explicitly. However, the Committee was determined to include a balanced provision in S. 1789 , making it clear that Congress does not believe that the financial condition of the Postal Service, or any other objectives put forward by the Postal Service or one of its unions, are the only factors that arbitrators must consider. Another provision of S. 1789 , as passed by the Senate, Section 104, states that consistent with 39 U.S.C. Section 1005(f), which provides that the program of fringe benefits must not be less favorable than the one in effect in 1971, the Postal Service may enter into a joint collective bargaining agreement with bargaining representatives to establish the Postal Service Health Benefits Program as a substitute for the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. Any dispute in negotiating this program would not be subject to arbitration. Authority for this joint negotiation would extend until September 30, 2012. During floor consideration of S. 1789 , the Senate by a vote of 23 to 76 rejected an amendment offered by Senator Rand Paul to amend Section 1206, \"Collective bargaining agreements,\" of title 39 of the U.S. Code. This amendment would provide that, \"The Postal Service may not enter into any collective bargaining agreement with any labor organization.\" It also made technical and conforming changes to other sections in chapter 12, \"Employee-Management Agreements,\" of Title 39 that relate to collective bargaining. This report has described the scope of Postal Service collective bargaining and authority of Congress to modify employee-management relations by altering the scope of collective bargaining or terms of collective bargaining agreements. It also has summarized changes to collective bargaining proposed in H.R. 2309 , the Postal Reform Act of 2011, as reported to the House by the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, and in S. 1789 , 112 th Congress, as passed by the Senate Congress created the United States Postal Service as an instrumentality in the executive branch of the federal government in the Postal Reorganization Act of 1970, P.L. 91-375, to permit it to operate more like a business than a government department or agency. Postal Service employee-management relations were made subject to the National Labor Relations Act, which governs private sector relations, rather than the Federal Labor-Management Relations Statute in chapter 71 of the United States Code, which applies to most federal entities. Congress granted the Postal Service broader authority to bargain collectively over compensation, benefits, and other conditions of employment. Most federal departments and agencies may bargain collectively only over conditions of employment, excluding conditions that are subjects of federal statute such as life insurance and health insurance and position classification. The Postal Service Reform Act of 2011, H.R. 2309 , would modify some provisions of Title 39 of the U.S. Code regarding collective bargaining and employee-management relations. These provisions would seek to broaden the measures of pay comparability between Postal Service officers and employees and private sector employees as well as the overall value of fringe benefit packages by taking into account some benefits that are not widely available in the private sector. They also would reduce the employing agency share that the Postal Service now pays for government life insurance and health insurance premiums for its employees. These changes also would prohibit including no-layoff clauses in collective bargaining agreements not yet ratified when H.R. 2309 is enacted and require renegotiating already ratified agreements that have them, and modify procedures for resolving collective bargaining disputes by requiring parties to appoint neutral arbitrators and by including mediators in arbitration boards. H.R. 2309 also would create a receiver-like Postal Service Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority to assume all authorities and responsibilities of the Board of Governors of the Postal Service during a control period (i.e., any period when the Postal Service has been in default to the Treasury of the United States). The Authority would be advisory only during the first two years of a control period, but would become fully in force at the completion of the second full fiscal year or any year thereafter during the length of a control period if the Postal Service's annual deficit is greater than $2 billion. When fully in force, the Authority, among other responsibilities, could approve human resources strategies, collective bargaining strategies, negotiation parameters, and collective bargaining agreements. The Postmaster General could not enter into, renew, modify, or extend a contract, including a labor contract entered into through collective bargaining, unless the Authority determined that doing so is consistent with the financial plan and budget for the fiscal year.

From fiscal year 1996 through fiscal year 2001, an average of about 11,000, or 1 percent, of the roughly 900,000 reservists were mobilized each year. The length of mobilizations can be as long as 2 years with the mean length of mobilizations for the 6-year period we reviewed being 117 days. As of April 2002, about 80,000, or 8 percent, of reservists had been mobilized for 1 year for operations related to September 11, 2001. At the same time, additional reserve personnel continued to be deployed throughout the world on various peacekeeping and humanitarian missions. The rights of mobilized personnel of the reserve components are protected under the Soldiers’ and Sailors’ Civil Relief Act of 1940 (SSCRA), as amended, and by the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA), as amended. Included in these acts are protections related to health care coverage. For example, SSCRA provides protections for reservists who have individual health coverage. Specifically, for individually covered reservists returning from active duty, SSCRA requires private insurance companies to reinstate coverage at the premium rate they would have been paying had they never left. Under SSCRA, the insurance company cannot refuse to cover most preexisting conditions. During military service, USERRA protects reservists’ employer-provided health benefits. Specifically, for absences of 30 days or less (training periods typically last 2 weeks or less), health benefits continue as if the employee had not been absent. For absences of 31 days or more, coverage stops unless (1) the employee elects to pay for the coverage, including the employer contributions, or (2) the employer voluntarily agrees to continue coverage. Under USERRA, employers must reinstate reservists’ health coverage the day they apply to be reinstated in their civilian positions—even if the employers cannot put the employees back to work immediately. Reservists mobilized under federal authorities are covered by TRICARE, DOD's health care system. If they are ordered to active duty for 31 days or more, reservists are enrolled in Prime, TRICARE’s managed care option, and—like other active duty personnel—are required to receive care through TRICARE, either through 1 of 580 MTFs worldwide, or through TRICARE’s network of civilian providers. When reservists’ mobilization orders are for 31 to 178 days, their dependents are eligible for the Standard and Extra options—TRICARE’s fee-for-service and preferred provider options, respectively. Once eligible for TRICARE, reservists and their dependents also become eligible for prescription drug benefits. When reservists’ orders are for 179 days or more, dependents are eligible for health care under Prime. Under TRICARE, active duty personnel, including mobilized reservists, do not pay premiums for their health care coverage; however, depending on the option chosen, they may be responsible for copayments, deductibles, and enrollment requirements for their dependents. (For an overview of these benefits, see table 1.) Mobilized reservists are eligible for dental care through the military health care system. However, like active duty dependents, mobilized reservists’ dependents are only eligible for dental care if they participate in DOD’s voluntary dental insurance program, which requires enrollment and has monthly premiums. Because mobilized reservists’ dependents could be liable for two health coverage deductibles in 1 year—their civilian insurers’ deductible prior to mobilization and the TRICARE Standard or Extra deductible once mobilized—DOD has used authorities included in the National Defense Authorization Acts for 2000 and 2001 to provide financial assistance through several demonstration programs. For example, the Reserves Component Family Member Demonstration Project—available for those currently mobilized under DOD’s Operation Noble Eagle and Operation Enduring Freedom—eliminates the TRICARE deductible and the requirement that dependents obtain statements that inpatient care is not available in an MTF before obtaining nonemergency treatment from a civilian hospital. In addition, DOD may pay non-network physicians up to 15 percent more than the TRICARE rate for treating dependents of mobilized reservists—a cost that otherwise would be borne by dependents if physicians required this additional payment. Until recently, DOD had administered a transitional benefit program that provided demobilized reservists and their dependents 30 days of additional TRICARE coverage as they returned to their civilian health care. The 2002 NDAA extended the transitional period during which reservists may receive TRICARE coverage from 30 days to 60--120 days, depending on the length of active duty service. This change more closely reflects the 90 days that USERRA provides reservists to apply for civilian reemployment when they are mobilized for more than 181 days, and the change will provide health care coverage if they elect to delay return to their employment subsequent to demobilization. However, the 2002 NDAA did not provide any transitional benefit for dependents. Overall, the percentage of reservists with health care coverage when they are not mobilized is similar to that found in the general population—and, like the general population, most reservists have coverage through their employers. According to DOD’s 2000 Survey of Reserve Component Personnel, nearly 80 percent of reservists reported having health care coverage. In the general population, 81 percent of 18 to 65 year olds have health care coverage. Officers and senior enlisted personnel were more likely than junior enlisted personnel to have coverage. Only 60 percent of junior enlisted personnel, about 90 percent of whom are under age 35, had coverage—lower than the similarly aged group in the general population. Of reservists with dependents, about 86 percent reported having coverage. Of reservists without dependents, about 63 percent reported having coverage. More than three-quarters of reservists were provided health care coverage by their civilian employers’ health plans or their spouses’ health plans. (See fig. 1.) Some reservists were covered by more than one health plan. Most reservists maintained their civilian coverage when mobilized. Reservists generally maintained this coverage to better ensure continuity of health benefits and care for their dependents, sometimes at an additional cost. However, some reservists who dropped their civilian insurance to use TRICARE reported that their dependents had problems finding providers, establishing eligibility, understanding TRICARE’s benefits, and obtaining assistance when questions or problems arose. We found that such problems could be ameliorated through additional education and assistance targeted to reservists and their dependents. Because most reservists maintained their civilian coverage when mobilized, few dependents experienced disruptions in coverage. According to DOD’s 2000 survey, about 87 percent of reservists who had been mobilized at least once reported having civilian insurance at the time they were mobilized. The remaining 13 percent did not have civilian coverage. Of those who had civilian coverage, about 90 percent maintained it while mobilized. According to DOD officials and reservists we interviewed, many reservists maintained their civilian coverage to avoid disruptions associated with a change to TRICARE and to ensure that their dependents could continue seeing their current providers—who may not accept TRICARE reimbursements, either as network providers or under the Standard option. Preserving provider relationships was especially important to reservists whose dependents with special needs had specialists familiar with their care or to dependents who had long-standing relationships with civilian providers. Reservists we contacted reported varying financial arrangements for covering the costs of their civilian premiums while they were mobilized. USERRA does not require employers to continue paying their share of health insurance premiums when mobilizations extend beyond 30 days. However, employers continued to pay at least their portion of health insurance premiums beyond this 30-day period for about 80 percent of the reservists we contacted who maintained their employer-sponsored coverage. Sometimes, these employers paid all costs, both their own and the employee portion, while in other instances reservists continued to pay the employee portion of the premium. The remaining reservists paid the total insurance premium while mobilized. In the general population in 2001, the average employer-sponsored premium for a family plan was $588 per month with the employee generally paying about 26 percent of this premium. Mobilized reservists who used TRICARE reported a variety of problems that they and their dependents experienced when they tried to access the system. However, when DOD provided information and assistance targeted toward the situations reservists and their dependents face, these types of problems were more likely to be averted. The most common problems that reservists reported were difficulties they and their dependents had moving into the system—finding TRICARE providers, establishing eligibility, understanding TRICARE’s benefits, and obtaining assistance when questions or problems arose. While similar problems have been reported by other active duty personnel, reservists and their dependents are more likely to experience such problems because they often live in areas distant from MTFs, and their active duty service is brief and episodic. Of the 360 reservists with recent mobilization experience that we contacted, about 38 percent reported some kind of problem with TRICARE. One problem, constituting about a quarter of the reported problems, was finding a TRICARE provider. Mobilized reservists and their dependents can have more difficulty finding TRICARE providers because many do not live in areas where the network is robust. Compared to 5 percent of active duty personnel, about 70 percent of reservists live and work more than 50 miles (or an hour’s drive) from an MTF—areas DOD has designated as remote. Because DOD’s civilian contractors are generally not required to establish TRICARE civilian networks in these areas, a network of providers may not exist. Where networks do exist, provider choice may be limited. TRICARE Prime Remote (TPR) and TPR for Active Duty Family Members were established to help improve access to care in remote areas for active duty and mobilized reservists and their dependents. However, dependent eligibility is statutorily based on residing with a service member who both lives and works in a remote area. As a result, because mobilized reservists are most often assigned to work in a location near an MTF or deployed overseas, few dependents of reservists who are mobilized for 179 days or more are eligible for these programs. About 17 percent of reported problems involved documenting and establishing eligibility. For example, reservists had problems with DOD not providing identification cards acknowledging that they and their dependents were TRICARE beneficiaries. They also had difficulties with the accuracy of information in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS), DOD’s database that maintains benefit eligibility status. In order to ensure TRICARE eligibility, any status changes must be reported to DEERS, and according to a DOD civilian contractor, the services do not always send these changes to DEERS promptly. Reservists reported a variety of situations in which DEERS inaccuracies created problems. DEERS did not reflect that some reservists were on active duty; therefore, they and their dependents appeared to be ineligible for services and were denied care or medications. Further, in instances in which DEERS failed to reflect Prime enrollment for a dependent, claims were paid under Extra, resulting in charges for copayments that should not have been required. Also, mobilized reservists married to active duty personnel reported problems ensuring that DEERS accurately reflected their mobilized status so that they were eligible for active duty, rather than dependent, benefits and access privileges. Active duty families also have problems with DEERS, but, according to a TRICARE adviser at one site we visited, DEERS problems are accentuated for reservists because they move in and out of the system. However, determining the extent of such DEERS problems was beyond the scope of our work. Finally, about 40 percent of the problems reservists reported related to understanding TRICARE’s benefits and obtaining assistance when questions or problems arose. According to DOD officials, mobilized reservists have greater difficulty understanding and navigating TRICARE than other active duty personnel. First, reservists have less incentive to become familiar with TRICARE because mobilizations are for a limited period and because TRICARE only becomes important to them and their dependents if they are mobilized. Further, when first mobilized, reservists must accomplish many tasks in a compressed period. For example, they must prepare for an extended absence from home, make arrangements to be away from their civilian employment, obtain military physical examinations, and ensure that their families are registered in DEERS. DOD officials told us that learning about TRICARE may be a low priority for reservists when they are mobilizing. According to interviews with reservists and support personnel at sites we visited, problems with TRICARE could be reduced if education and administrative assistance were available and information was targeted to the needs of reservists. In addition, when beneficiaries, especially reservists’ dependents, were provided assistance with using the TRICARE system—identifying contact points and understanding TRICARE benefits and how to use them—they generally were able to obtain appropriate, timely health care through TRICARE. At one site we visited, assistance had been lacking or inadequate, and reservists were experiencing numerous difficulties with TRICARE. Here, 1,100 personnel, who were mobilized beginning in late September 2001 under Operation Noble Eagle and Operation Enduring Freedom, initially had no on-base MTF or TRICARE assistance. As a result, when questions arose, these mobilized reservists and their dependents sometimes obtained and passed along inaccurate information. In other instances they contacted TRICARE’s civilian contractor directly, sometimes waiting for over an hour on hold trying to obtain information. In November 2001, two administrative personnel were assigned, including a health benefits expert, and at the time of our visit in February 2002, progress was being made to resolve reservists’ and their dependents’ health care questions. However, because this assistance was initially delayed, two staff members were insufficient to address the volume of misinformation and problems that existed on site. Beneficiaries told us they were still confused about TRICARE regulations at the time we visited. Some mobilized reservists still did not understand that they had to select a TRICARE primary care manager and were continuing to use their non-network providers, even though regulations require active duty personnel to participate in Prime. Likewise, their dependents were continuing to have problems, such as determining whether they could continue to see their civilian providers under TRICARE. At another site we visited, which had an MTF and better on-base assistance, we observed that reservists and their dependents generally were not experiencing problems with TRICARE. In this location DOD had a mobilization team on site to help explain the benefits and had a staff on base to offer assistance when needed. To help ensure that reservists and dependents understood the various TRICARE options, the mobilization team presented general information on TRICARE and tailored benefits discussions to beneficiaries’ specific circumstances. For example, the mobilization team tailored TRICARE information depending on whether reservists’ dependents lived in areas with established networks or in areas where TRICARE networks were minimal or nonexistent. For the latter, the mobilization team discussed how TRICARE’s Standard option could permit dependents to continue relationships with civilian physicians by paying copayments similar to those required by many civilian insurers. The mobilization team members also referred reservists to TRICARE offices, Internet Web links, and toll-free information lines, and provided backup telephone numbers, including their own, to handle additional questions. The 2002 NDAA directed us to evaluate several health coverage options through TRICARE, FEHBP, or civilian insurance as possible mechanisms for ensuring continuity in benefits for reservists and their dependents. Some of the options would provide coverage on a continuous basis during the entire enlistment period, regardless of reservists’ mobilization status, while others would provide additional or alternative coverage only during or following periods of mobilization. Cost estimates for these options, which were provided by CBO, range from a low of about $89 million to a high of about $19.7 billion over a 5-year period. (See app. II for estimate assumptions.) For 2003 through 2007, the estimated cost to DOD for providing reservists and their dependents continuous health care coverage, regardless of reservists’ mobilization status, would range from about $4 billion to $19.7 billion for the 5-year period, depending on how the benefit was provided. CBO estimates that providing the benefit through TRICARE with no premium for reservists would cost DOD about $10.4 billion. (See table 2.) DOD’s cost would be reduced to about $7 billion if reservists paid a premium similar to that paid by active duty retirees under age 65 or to about $4 billion if reservists paid a premium share similar to that paid by federal employees for FEHBP. Providing insurance through FEHBP would be more expensive to DOD because CBO estimated the premium would be based on the existing FEHBP pool—an older population using more health care services. (See table 3.) While CBO estimates that the actual cost of providing health care for reservists and their dependents under FEHBP would be about $10.9 billion, similar to the cost of providing the TRICARE benefit, it estimates the DOD health insurance premium costs for FEHBP to be about $19.7 billion. If reservists paid the typical FEHBP employee portion of the premium, CBO estimates that DOD premium costs would be reduced to about $10.2 billion. The cost for options providing health care coverage only during mobilizations or for expanding the benefit after mobilizations would be from $89 million to $1.8 billion over the 5-year period, according to CBO estimates. (See table 4.) For example, in lieu of a TRICARE benefit, DOD might assume the costs of reservists’ civilian coverage during mobilization. The value of this benefit would vary from reservist to reservist depending on (1) the cost of the reservist’s portion of the premium, (2) the extent of employer coverage, and (3) whether the employer continued to pay the premium during the reservist’s mobilization. CBO estimates that if each year 80,000 reservists, the approximate number mobilized in April 2002, were mobilized for a 1-year period, the cost to fully pay for civilian health coverage for the 5-year period would be about $1.8 billion. The cost of DOD allowing dependents with civilian insurance the choice of TRICARE or a monetary voucher equivalent to the estimated value of the TRICARE benefit would be about $1.1 billion over 5 years, according to CBO’s estimate. Although the amount of this voucher would be based on the average cost of the TRICARE benefit for which the dependent is eligible, this option would increase DOD’s costs because historically many dependents of mobilized reservists have relied on their civilian coverage and have not used their TRICARE benefit. Revising the transitional period that DOD has provided so that demobilized reservists retain their TRICARE benefits for an additional 30 days and their dependents retain benefits for a 90-day period would cost $89 million for the 5-year period, according to CBO’s estimate. Because most reservists have civilian insurance and maintain it while mobilized, few of their dependents experience problems with disruptions to their health care, such as being forced to change providers, learn new health care plan requirements, and adjust to different benefit packages. However, when using TRICARE some dependents of mobilized reservists have experienced certain problems—in part, because they do not adequately understand how the plan works. Problems that reservists and their dependents face with health coverage during mobilizations could be mitigated if DOD improved the information and assistance provided them. Reservists are confronted with choices and circumstances that are more complex than those faced by active duty personnel. Their decisions about health care are affected by a variety of factors—length of orders, where they and their dependents live, whether they or their spouses have civilian health coverage, and the amount of support civilian employers would be willing to provide with health care premiums. In addition, reservists must determine whether their existing civilian providers would be willing to accept TRICARE while they are mobilized since their desire not to disrupt these relationships during a temporary mobilization may outweigh other considerations. We recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs to ensure that reservists, as part of their ongoing readiness training, receive information and training on health care coverage available to them and their dependents when mobilized and provide TRICARE assistance during mobilizations targeted to the needs of reservists and their dependents. DOD reviewed and commented on a draft of this report. It concurred with the report’s recommendation and generally agreed with its findings. DOD stated that it recognized the importance of a well-informed TRICARE beneficiary population and to that end has already taken a number of steps to ensure that reservists understand their health care benefits. For example, the TRICARE Management Activity website and the Reserve Affairs portion of the Department of Defense website provide information about the health benefits available for reservists. Further, DOD stated it will continue to emphasize the importance of health care education and, as problem areas are identified, will immediately take steps to correct them. DOD’s comments are reprinted in appendix III. DOD provided additional comments from the Department of the Army and technical comments from the TRICARE Management Activity and from the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Reserve Affairs. The Army took exception to some of the information presented in the report that was obtained from DOD’s 2000 Survey of Reserve Component Personnel. The Army stated that the number of reservists who continued to retain their civilian health care coverage “seems exceptionally high” although they could provide no basis to support this claim. Nevertheless, because of their concern, we subsequently contacted DOD officials at the Defense Manpower Data Center, who were responsible for the survey, to reconfirm the information they provided. After we explained the Army’s position to them, they reaffirmed that the data from the survey instrument were correct. They stated that for the period covered by this survey prior to the 2001 partial mobilization there was no reason to question the accuracy of the estimate. The Army also asked for other analyses, such as a cost- benefit analysis of various TRICARE demonstration programs that were beyond the scope of our work. Technical corrections and clarifications have been incorporated into the text as appropriate. We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of Defense, appropriate congressional committees, and other interested parties. Copies will also be made available to others on request. In addition, the report is available at no charge on the GAO Web site at http://www.gao.gov. If you or your staffs have any questions about this report, please contact me at (202) 512-7101. Other contacts and major contributors are listed in appendix IV. To determine whether reservists had health coverage when not on active duty and the source of any civilian coverage, we obtained analyses from the Department of Defense’s (DOD) 2000 Survey of Reserve Component Personnel. Although all survey questions had not been analyzed, we obtained information from DOD on selected questions for which survey processing had been completed. Because DOD had not yet completed processing for all questions, we were unable to obtain a more thorough DOD analysis or to obtain data for our own analyses. Using the analyses DOD provided, we were able to do limited checks for consistency of results, but, for the most part, we were not able to verify the accuracy of DOD’s data. To learn about the type of civilian health care coverage reservists and their dependents have and the extent to which mobilizations caused disruptions in coverage, we obtained information from 286 mobilized, or recently mobilized, reservists from three judgmentally selected reserve units— representing the Army, Navy, and Air Force. We selected these units with the help of DOD personnel using two criteria: (1) the unit consisted of at least 50 reservists and (2) at the time of our audit work, the unit was mobilized or had recently completed a mobilization and was drilling. We visited these sites and administered a questionnaire to identify the types and volume of problems that reservists and their dependents were experiencing with health care coverage. Sometimes we used the questionnaire as a structured interview guide and administered it to individuals; more frequently, reservists completed the questionnaires in a group and spoke with us individually afterwards if they had issues they wanted to discuss. During these visits, we also interviewed unit commanders, personnel responsible for mobilization activities, TRICARE personnel, and medical staff, when available. We also used our questionnaire as a guide in conducting a telephone survey of an additional 74 reservists or their family members. We obtained a randomized list of reservists who had been mobilized during the period July 2000 through December 2001, along with the sampled reservists’ home addresses and telephone numbers, from DOD’s Defense Manpower Data Center. We first excluded from the sample those reservists whose records lacked both addresses and telephone numbers; then proceeded in order from the first name on the list, either calling the telephone number provided or attempting to locate a telephone number using the name and address. When we were not able to obtain a telephone number or when the telephone number given to us had been disconnected or was determined to be inaccurate, we also excluded that reservist. Of 100 reservists whom we were able to contact or leave messages for, we ultimately completed an interview with 74 reservists or family members. The remaining 26 reservists either did not return our calls or refused to participate in our survey. Finally, we interviewed officials in the offices of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Reserve Affairs and the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs; the TRICARE Management Activity; the National Guard Bureau; the Department of Labor; representatives of the Army, Navy, and Air Force Reserve Components; and reservist advocacy groups, including the Enlisted Association of the National Guard of the United States, the National Guard Association of the United States, the National Military Family Association, the Ohio Air National Guard, the Reserve Officers Association, the Retired Officers Association, and the Retired Enlisted Association. We also reviewed our prior work on reservists and military health care. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) calculated costs associated with options specified in the 2002 NDAA for providing coverage for reservists. We did not independently verify data used to calculate the cost estimates. See appendix II for CBO’s assumptions. In calculating the cost estimates specified in the National Defense Authorized Act for FY 2002 for providing health care coverage to reservists, CBO used the following basic assumptions: The estimates were based on 865,000 reservists, unless otherwise indicated. The benefit would start on January 2003. The percentage of the reserve force with dependents is 50.42. Reservists with dependents each have about 2.17 dependents. Inflation would be 8.5 percent in 2003, 7.5 percent in 2004, and 6.5 percent in the remaining years. The 14 percent of reservists who were federal employees were excluded from the estimates because they presumably have health insurance coverage under Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP). The specific assumptions used to develop each benefit option are discussed below. TRICARE (no premium) Ninety percent of reservists would take advantage of this option. Reservists and their dependents would use TRICARE-approved civilian physicians with little use of military treatment facilities (MTF). TRICARE costs were weighted from FEHBP costs, assuming that reservists cost about 40 percent of the FEHBP premium and families cost about 60 percent. TRICARE costs were estimated at $1,513 for a single reservist and $5,173 for a family during 2003. Costs of TRICARE Prime and TRICARE Standard are the same. Some beneficiaries would use TRICARE as a second payer insurance. (The 14 percent of reservists who presumably were enrolled in FEHBP was used as a proxy for this purpose.) Second payer costs were 25 percent of the regular TRICARE costs. Reservists will enroll over 3-year phase-in period. TRICARE with premium similar to under 65 active duty retirees Premium consists of $230 per year for individuals and $460 per year for families. Seventy percent of reservists would enroll in TRICARE under these conditions. Reservists and their dependents would use TRICARE-approved civilian physicians with little use of MTFs. TRICARE costs were weighted from FEHBP costs, assuming that reservists would cost about 40 percent of the FEHBP premium and families would cost about 60 percent of the FEHBP premium. TRICARE costs were estimated at $1,513 for an individual and $5,173 for a family during 2003. Costs of TRICARE Prime and TRICARE Standard are the same. No second payer costs exist. Reservists will enroll over 3-year phase-in period. TRICARE with premium-share equal to that of FEHBP Reservists would pay 28 percent of premium costs, which is similar to the percentage of FEHBP premiums paid by civilian federal employees. Fifty percent of reservists would enroll in TRICARE under these conditions. Reservists and their dependents would use TRICARE-approved civilian physicians with little use of MTFs. TRICARE costs were weighted from FEHBP costs, assuming that reservists cost about 40 percent of the FEHBP premium and families cost about 60 percent. Cost for an individual would be $1,513 and cost for a family would be $5,173 during 2003. Costs of TRICARE Prime and TRICARE Standard are the same. No second-payer costs exist. Reservists will enroll over 3-year phase-in period. FEHBP (no premium) Ninety percent of reservists would enroll in this program. DOD would pay the employee’s share of the premium for the 14 percent of reservists who presumably were enrolled in FEHBP. Blue Cross/Blue Shield and Kaiser Permanente premiums were used to calculate costs. The estimated average annual cost was $3,760 for individuals and $8,718 for families during 2003. Reservists will enroll over 3-year phase-in period. FEHBP (regular premium) Seventy percent of reservists would enroll in FEHBP if they had to pay the employee’s share of the premium. No cost was included for the 14 percent of reservists who presumably are enrolled in FEHBP. Average premiums for individuals and families were based on data provided by FEHBP actuaries. During 2003, the estimated cost for an individual would be $3,670 with DOD paying about 71 percent, and cost for a family would be $8,635 with DOD paying about 73 percent. Reservists will enroll over 3-year phase-in period. Costs are based on 80,000 reservists—the approximate number mobilized in April 2002. No cost was included for the 14 percent of reservists who presumably are enrolled in FEHBP. Ninety percent of reservists would enroll in the program. Average cost of employee premium and employer’s share were based on Kaiser Family Foundation data. During 2003, cost for an individual would be $2,877 with DOD paying 86 percent, and cost for a family would be $7,656 with DOD paying 74 percent. There is no phase-in period. Provide voucher for civilian insurance Costs are based on 80,000 reservists—the approximate number mobilized in April 2002. Voucher could be used to pay for any current health insurance coverage, including both employee’s and employer’s share. FEHBP enrollees would not receive vouchers. Ninety percent of reservists would use vouchers. Voucher costs were based on 2003 estimated TRICARE costs of $1,513 for individuals and $5,173 for families. (TRICARE costs were weighted from FEHBP costs, assuming reservists would cost about 40 percent of the FEHBP premium and families would cost about 60 percent.) Voucher may not be used to cover the cost of paying second payer insurance—only covers primary insurance. There is no phase-in period. Extend/Offer transition period following demobilization Costs are based on 80,000 reservists— the approximate number mobilized in April 2002. Forty percent of demobilized reservists would use this option. No cost was included for the 14 percent of reservists who presumably were enrolled in FEHBP. Reservists would use TRICARE-approved civilian physicians with little use of MTFs. TRICARE costs were weighted from FEHBP costs (assuming reservists would cost about 40 percent of the FEHBP premium and families would cost about 60 percent of\n\n### Summary:\n\n", "answer": "To expand the capabilities of the nation's active duty forces, the Department of Defense (DOD) relies on the 1.2 million men and women of the Reserve and National Guard. Currently, reserve components constitute nearly half of the total armed forces. Although DOD requires reservists to use TRICARE DOD's health care system for their own health care, using TRICARE is an option for their dependents. Nearly 80 percent of reservists had health care coverage when they were not on active duty, according to a GAO survey. The most frequently cited sources of coverage were civilian employer health plans and spouses' employer health plans. Few dependents of mobilized reservists experience disruptions in their health coverage--primarily because most maintained civilian health coverage while reservists were mobilized. Ninety percent of the reservists with civilian health coverage maintained that coverage. The 5-year cost of the coverage options delineated in the 2002 National Defense Authorization Act range from $89 million, for expanding the transition benefit allowing mobilizations, to $19.7 billion, for continuous coverage under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, as estimated by the Congressional Budget Office."}

The work conducted at NIST underlies much of our nation’s business and public infrastructure, from helping to ensure the quality of air and water to helping to ensure the security of online financial transactions. Fundamental to NIST’s ability to sustain these contributions is the quality of the almost 3,000 scientists who work there, including 3 Nobel Laureates, and the many visiting researchers who come to use NIST’s specialized measurement facilities. In 2007, the COMPETES Act granted NIST the authority to “procure” the temporary services of experts or consultants to supplement its workforce for urgent or short-term projects. This authority allows NIST to procure the services of up to 200 experts or consultants per year. The act further requires NIST to obtain these services in accordance with 5 U.S.C. § 3109(b), which grants an agency the authority to “procure by contract” the temporary (not to exceed 1 year) or intermittent services of experts or consultants. Under section 3109(d), OPM is required to prescribe regulations necessary to administer this section, including setting the criteria for the appropriate circumstances in which to employ an expert or consultant and the criteria for setting the pay of experts and consultants under this section. OPM’s regulations on expert and consultant appointments appear at 5 C.F.R. part 304. Obtaining personal services from individuals or organizations by contract, rather than by appointment, is generally prohibited unless specifically authorized by statute, such as 5 U.S.C. § 3109. Agencies that have such statutory authorization may use 5 U.S.C. § 3109 as a contracting authority and apply FAR procedures, rather than OPM regulations, when awarding contracts to procure personal services from organizations. Additionally, agencies that have such statutory authorization may use 5 U.S.C. § 3109 to appoint individual experts or consultants as temporary federal employees in accordance with OPM regulations. The law is unsettled, however, on the extent to which 5 U.S.C. § 3109 permits agencies to award procurement contracts in accordance with the FAR when they obtain the personal services of individual experts. Although the FAR permits the use of a contract to obtain the personal services of individual experts, the text of 5 U.S.C. § 3109 may imply that these services should be obtained through appointment. As we have previously noted and as described in more detail in table 1, a personal services contract is characterized by the close working relationship that is established between the agency and the contractor. To date, NIST has used its authority under 5 U.S.C. § 3109 to award personal services contracts to individuals. Within NIST, the Acquisition Management Division is responsible for managing, overseeing, and supporting NIST’s procurement operations, including personal services contracts, and for advising agency staff on acquisition strategies. NIST’s contracting officials are also responsible for ensuring that all acquisitions of goods and services are in compliance with various federal laws, regulations, and policies governing procurement operations and procedures. When a laboratory needs expert services, subject matter experts—called technical information contacts—work with the laboratory director to prepare a request for a personal services contract that describes the work to be performed and the expertise needed. This request is then reviewed by a contracting officer technical representative and NIST’s contracting officials prior to approval. From August 2007 through April 2009, NIST had awarded 39 contracts to obtain the services of individual experts to assist with a variety of urgent or short-term research projects. According to agency officials, NIST initially restricted the use of the authority to the services of experts and not consultants, in part, because of concerns that the historical demand for consultants from its laboratories had averaged about 200 per year and, therefore, might exceed the limit of 200 set by the COMPETES Act. NIST officials said the agency had not used the authority more extensively, in part, because it had been operating at a reduced funding level for much of the time that it has had the authority. In addition, NIST officials said that they will develop a plan to allocate the 200 contracts among the laboratories if the demand increases. As of April 30, 2009, work under 16 of the contracts had been completed, work under 22 contracts was ongoing, and 1 contract was canceled at the request of the contractor prior to any payment being made. The 38 contracts that NIST funded totaled about $1.9 million. All but 3 of the 38 contracts were valued at $100,000 or less (see fig. 1). The awards averaged $50,754 and ranged from $7,492 to $114,033. All 38 contracts were firm fixed-price contracts. Award amounts covered the costs of purchasing a specified number of the experts’ labor hours, and 9 contracts also included from $2,500 to $10,000 for the experts to attend professional conferences or conduct other travel related to their research. None of the 38 contracts that NIST funded exceeded the statutory limit of 1 year in duration. The number of hours purchased averaged 939 hours per contract and ranged from 149 hours to 2,080 hours (see fig. 2). According to NIST officials, 2,080 hours translates to the agency’s definition of 1 full- time equivalent (FTE)—that is, the number of hours worked by an employee during the course of a year. Six of the seven NIST laboratories requested the 38 contracts that NIST funded, as shown in figure 3. Four laboratories—the Chemical Science and Technology Laboratory, Manufacturing Engineering Laboratory, Materials Science and Engineering Laboratory, and Physics Laboratory—awarded 32 of the funded contracts, and 2 laboratories—the Building and Fire Research Laboratory and Information Technology Laboratory—each awarded 3 of the funded contracts. An additional contract awarded by the seventh NIST laboratory, the Electronics and Electrical Engineering Laboratory, was canceled at the request of the contractor prior to any payment being made. NIST awarded contracts to acquire the services of 32 experts in fiscal year 2008 and 6 experts through the end of April in fiscal year 2009 (see table 2). The 29,208 hours acquired in fiscal year 2008 translates to approximately 14 FTEs. The Physics Laboratory made the most use of this authority, awarding 8 contracts in fiscal year 2008 totaling about $500,000. The 9,392 hours acquired by the laboratory translated to about 4.5 FTEs. Although data for fiscal year 2009 are preliminary, the apparent drop in the use of the COMPETES Act authority compared with the previous year is the result of NIST operating under a continuing resolution during the first half of fiscal year 2009 and does not reflect a declining need for the authority, according to agency officials. In fiscal year 2008, the hours of expert services that the six NIST laboratories procured under the COMPETES Act authority supplemented their federal staff resources by about 1 percent (see table 3). Similarly, the dollar amount of these awards totaled less than 1 percent of the approximately $254 million budget for the laboratories in fiscal year 2008. Thirty-five of the 38 contracts that NIST funded using the COMPETES Act authority were awarded to experts who had at least some prior experience in working with the agency. More specifically, we found that 25 of the contractors were former NIST employees, many of whom had worked for the agency for more than 20 years. An additional 10 experts had worked at NIST as guest researchers or contractors. The remaining 3 contract experts either had no prior federal experience or had worked at other federal agencies. In general, for the 38 contracts that NIST funded, the contract experts designed and conducted experiments, analyzed data, and delivered the results of their work in reports that are expected to meet NIST’s standards for publication in a professional journal. The research projects that these experts assisted with served a variety of purposes, such as a study of the characteristics of various types of lighting sources and retro- reflective materials that are used for traffic sign materials and road markings; the development of standard methods to assess the flammability of materials in upholstered furniture, which were needed in setting regulations designed to reduce the risk of fire spread in buildings; and an analysis to help develop cryptographic and information technology security standards and guidelines. NIST officials identified a number of benefits of the agency’s COMPETES Act authority in meeting urgent and short-term needs for the services of experts. NIST officials also stated that despite limits on this authority, their ability to perform high-quality research in the future will be hampered if this authority is not extended. According to NIST officials, the COMPETES Act authority has been highly effective in helping the agency meet urgent and short-term needs for the services of experts. Although NIST laboratory officials noted that they do not have any formal metrics to measure the effectiveness of the personal services contracts they have awarded using this authority, they cited the following five benefits that enhanced the laboratories’ ability to conduct research. First, NIST officials stated that research rarely follows a direct path and is often dependent on the results of individual experiments. Laboratory officials told us that the employer-employee relationship created by a personal services contract provides NIST with the flexibility to redirect the research as needed to quickly respond to new and potentially fruitful developments, and that this relationship is critical to maintaining the pace of research progress. They explained that without a close working relationship with the contractor, changes in the work would require a formal contract modification, which often increases the cost of a contract and takes valuable time away from research. Second, according to NIST officials, the COMPETES Act authority allows NIST to take advantage of short-term funding opportunities that do not merit the long-term investment required to hire new staff. Typically, such opportunities are offered to NIST by other agencies that need NIST’s assistance for such purposes as to help with regulatory decision making or to develop specialized scientific information that the agencies cannot develop for themselves. For example, a NIST laboratory official told us that the Department of Energy (DOE) provided funding to NIST through an interagency agreement as part of an effort to develop standards for light-emitting diodes and other forms of solid-state lighting. The official explained that DOE approached NIST for assistance with this effort because DOE did not have the expertise within its national laboratories to develop such standards. Because the funding was available for only 1 to 3 years, the laboratory official stated that NIST would have been unable to commit to hiring a full-time employee. The official stated that the authority (1) allowed NIST to effectively use this funding to quickly obtain an experienced researcher through a personal services contract to work on the project and (2) helped accelerate the completion of scheduled work for DOE, while furthering NIST’s own research in this area. Even in cases when funding was not supplied by other agencies, the authority has allowed NIST to undertake research vital to regulatory efforts. For example, one laboratory acquired the services of an expert to develop a new test to measure the flammability of foam mattresses. The results of this test, according to a NIST scientist, will help guide new regulations being prepared by the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Third, some NIST scientists with whom we spoke stated that the COMPETES Act authority also helps to bridge gaps in workforce and succession planning. They explained that the personal services contracts awarded under the authority provided an effective means of obtaining the skills and knowledge of senior scientists outside NIST as well as NIST scientists who have retired, and allowed them to share their knowledge with scientists who currently work at NIST. This is particularly helpful when funding limitations have restricted the agency’s ability to hire individuals to work alongside senior researchers before they retire to provide continuity in the technical and scientific skills that laboratories have identified in their workforce plans. NIST scientists stated that while the agency has a broad research focus, most of the researchers have a specialized expertise, which can be difficult to replace when individual scientists retire. Fourth, most laboratory officials told us that they value the COMPETES Act authority because they have interpreted it to mean that NIST is allowed to award personal services contracts without competition. As a result, agency officials have used the authority to target individuals whom they have determined already have the needed technical expertise, usually a scientist who has previously worked at NIST as an employee, guest researcher, or contractor. According to NIST officials, such individuals are known to have the specialized expertise the laboratory needs and are familiar with the agency’s culture. In other words, these officials said that such experts were a “known quantity” who would require little to no lead time before providing valuable contributions to the agency. Also, NIST laboratory officials told us that the use of the authority has eliminated some of the delays that accompanied competitive acquisition processes regulated by the FAR. For example, laboratory officials with whom we spoke stated that, prior to the use of the COMPETES Act authority, delays associated with completion of the competitive procurement process had led to experts being unavailable to assist with research projects when the agency was prepared to award the contracts. NIST officials stated that acquisitions under the authority usually do not take much longer than 1 month, whereas the lead time for similar competitive NIST awards has been as many as 75 days. Finally, NIST scientists stated that the COMPETES Act authority provides a cost-effective means of obtaining the services of experts. NIST officials explained that because the personal services contracts that have been awarded under the authority have gone to individual experts, NIST does not incur any overhead costs commonly associated with contracts awarded to organizations. One laboratory official estimated that personal services contracts awarded to individual experts may reduce some costs associated with nonpersonal services contracts awarded to organizations due to the elimination of such costs. In addition, one laboratory official also noted that the personal services contracts were more cost-effective because of the GS-15, step 10, pay ceiling imposed by 5 U.S.C. § 3109(b). NIST laboratory officials told us that the COMPETES Act authority limits the agency’s ability to obtain expert services on a short-term basis in two important ways. First, although the GS-15, step 10, limit in the pay can help make the contracts more cost-effective, NIST officials stated it may also prevent NIST from contracting with some experts, especially if they come from industry, where experts are typically more highly compensated. However, neither contracting officials nor laboratory officials could provide us with specific examples of when this limitation impacted their ability to attract an expert whose services they needed. Second, NIST has interpreted the 1-year limit cited in the COMPETES Act as an inflexible limit on the duration of each contract. NIST officials told us that this time limit prevents the agency from retaining contract experts for an additional year to complete work begun under short-term funding opportunities. Laboratory officials with whom we spoke explained that this need is not uncommon, since research sometimes progresses more slowly than anticipated or may provide results that alter the direction of the research in ways that require additional work. NIST officials told us that, if the COMPETES Act authority is not made permanent, they will have to resume the use of nonpersonal services contracts to obtain the services of experts in the future. According to NIST officials, nonpersonal services contracts are not as effective as the personal services contracts they have awarded under the authority because they do not allow for a direct working relationship with the contract expert and also require time-consuming contract modifications to redirect the research, if needed. For example, NIST officials explained that when the agency awards nonpersonal services contracts to organizations, the agency has limited ability to select the individual experts who will be assigned to conduct the work. As a result, when a contractor provides an expert who is not familiar with NIST or the ongoing research project, NIST officials must take time to train the expert. According to these officials, the time spent training these experts on the background of the research projects and NIST’s culture delays the progress of the research. Furthermore, any changes in the scope or direction of the research work would require formal contract modifications, which, as we have previously mentioned, are both time-consuming and can lead to cost increases for the contract. NIST has developed and implemented a set of procedures to guide the use of personal services contracts awarded to individual experts under the COMPETES Act authority and has adopted some of the safeguards contained in the FAR and some contained in the OPM regulations. However, it is unclear whether additional safeguards are needed for NIST’s use of this authority because which safeguards NIST is legally required to apply is an unsettled question. This lack of clarity stems from inconsistency or ambiguity in the statutes, regulations, decisions, and practices on this issue. To provide safeguards over the use of the COMPETES Act authority, NIST has developed and implemented procedures for agency officials to follow when awarding personal services contracts to individual experts. The procedures describe the type of documentation that must be maintained in the contract files, specify requirements for review of the contracts, and identify the laws and regulations that NIST believed were or might be applicable to its use of the authority. To develop these procedures, NIST officials told us that in 2007, after the COMPETES Act was enacted, they consulted with officials at Commerce’s Office of General Counsel and at OPM, but were unable to get clear guidance about, among other things, whether FAR requirements or OPM regulations apply to awarding personal services contracts to individuals when using this authority. For example, NIST officials told us that they had contacted Commerce attorneys via e-mail regarding several issues that they needed clarification about, but said that the discussions they had with Commerce attorneys did not adequately address their concerns. Similarly, according to NIST officials, when they consulted with OPM, the officials referred them back to the laws and regulations. According to NIST officials, OPM officials did not address any of the issues that NIST officials said they were confused about. When we contacted OPM officials, they told us that, although agencies with authority under 5 U.S.C. § 3109 are legally permitted to appoint individuals as federal employees in a manner consistent with the OPM regulations in 5 C.F.R. part 304, it was not clear as a legal matter whether 5 U.S.C. § 3109 also allows agencies to use contracts to obtain the personal services of individual experts and consultants, and, if so, the extent to which the FAR would apply in these circumstances. Because of the unclear guidance from Commerce and OPM, NIST contracting officials told us that they had difficulty in determining which specific laws and regulations to apply when using the COMPETES Act authority. Consequently, to help limit the risk to the agency, they adopted some safeguards from the FAR and some from OPM’s regulations for NIST’s procedures. Table 4 summarizes the laws and regulations cited in NIST’s procedures. Our review of the 39 contracts awarded from August 2007 through April 2009 indicates that NIST essentially took a contracting approach, rather than an appointment approach subject to OPM regulations, when it acquired the services of experts under the COMPETES Act authority. Specifically, we found that NIST did not appoint any of the experts as employees as provided for in the OPM regulations and instead entered into personal services contracts with individual experts. Nevertheless, we also found that NIST applied some of the safeguards from the personnel statutes as implemented through OPM’s regulations. For example, none of the contracts awarded a rate of pay to an expert that exceeded the basic rate of pay of a GS-15, step 10, applicable for the calendar year in which the contract was awarded. Furthermore, NIST did not award any personal services contracts exceeding 1 year in duration, in accordance with the limitations of 5 U.S.C. § 3109 and the COMPETES Act. We also found that NIST had implemented a number of safeguards from the FAR to minimize financial and performance risks to the agency. Specifically, NIST awarded all 39 personal services contracts as firm fixed- price contracts, which generally transfer most of the financial risk to the contractor. The use of firm fixed-price contracts mitigates concerns regarding cost controls, since the costs are fixed at the time the contracts are established. Also, all of these contracts included a clause allowing either the government or the contractor to terminate the contract at any time and for any reason without penalty after providing 15 days notice. A termination clause further limits the government’s risk because the agency will not incur financial penalties for terminating the contract. In addition, we found that NIST implemented contracting practices beyond those included in its procedures, to reduce the risk to the government. For example, for 37 of the 39 contracts, NIST officials reviewed a federal database of parties excluded from federal contracting to determine whether the potential contractors had experienced any performance problems in the execution of other federal contracts. Furthermore, NIST provided training to both contracting and laboratory officials on how to use this authority and included in each contract a requirement that the contractor fully disclose any actual or potential conflicts of interest. NIST officials also periodically discuss issues related to the agency’s COMPETES Act authority through an Acquisition Advisory Panel, which can recommend changes to existing acquisition practices on the basis of feedback from program and contracting officials. Although NIST applied a number of contracting safeguards, we found that NIST did not compete any of the 39 contracts we reviewed. NIST laboratory officials we interviewed said they were told by NIST contracting officials that COMPETES Act contracts were not subject to competition requirements of the FAR. NIST contracting officials told us that they reached this conclusion because they interpreted 5 U.S.C. § 3109(b)’s exemption from the public advertisement requirements of 41 U.S.C. § 5 as an exemption from the FAR’s competition requirements. NIST officials told us that they nonetheless decided to include a statement in the COMPETES Act contract files that only one qualified expert was available to perform the services NIST needed, a process they believe is authorized by the FAR’s simplified acquisition procedures. We found that 37 of the 39 contract files did contain a one-sentence statement attesting that the expert selected was the only person reasonably available to perform the needed services. However, the files did not indicate how that determination was made. The remaining 2 files contained no statement concerning the lack of competition. In January 2008, NIST began to forward COMPETES Act contracts that it had awarded to Commerce’s Office of General Counsel for review. A Commerce attorney told NIST via e-mail that 5 U.S.C. § 3109 did not contain an explicit exemption from the FAR competition rules for COMPETES Act contracts, and, therefore, advised NIST that the contracts should be competed to the maximum extent practicable, with file documentation concerning any lack of competition. Similarly, a Commerce attorney told us that the department believes these contracts should be competed, unless the agency obtains a more explicit exemption from the FAR’s competition requirements. However, the Commerce attorney also told us that the department had not considered the possibility that NIST could have used this authority to appoint individuals as experts in accordance with OPM regulations. Moreover, OPM officials told us (1) that its regulations implementing 5 U.S.C. § 3109 were limited to the use of that section as an authority to appoint experts and consultants as federal employees and (2) that it is unclear whether 5 U.S.C. § 3109 also allows agencies to use contracts to obtain the personal services of individual experts and consultants, and, if so, the extent to which the FAR would apply to such contracts. One OPM official suggested that the Congress may need to provide clarification on this issue. Since March 2009, in response to a recommendation by Commerce, NIST has issued public announcements of its intent to award eight personal services contracts and has received proposals from potentially interested contractors that are now under review by the agency. Because the statutes granting NIST authority to obtain the temporary services of experts and consultants do not clearly state whether NIST is required to obtain the services by appointing individuals as federal employees in accordance with OPM regulations or by awarding personal services contracts in accordance with the FAR, NIST faces substantial uncertainty as it continues to formulate procedures and safeguards for the use of the authority granted by the COMPETES Act. In our view, the question of which safeguards NIST is legally required to apply—and thus the need for any additional safeguards—is unclear at this time. We believe that the Congress will have an opportunity to clarify this issue should it decide to extend NIST’s COMPETES Act authority. NIST plays a vital role in fostering the nation’s position as a scientific and technological leader. The skills and abilities of its scientists help the agency respond to public and private sector needs for complex and challenging research results. The COMPETES Act has conferred on NIST the authority to acquire supplemental expertise to help it respond even more quickly to the demand for its services. When NIST awarded contracts to obtain temporary expert services, it applied safeguards from both OPM regulations and the FAR. Whether there is a need for additional safeguards, however, is unclear because which safeguards NIST is required to apply is legally unsettled. One possible interpretation of 5 U.S.C. § 3109 is that NIST must apply the FAR because 5 U.S.C. § 3109 authorizes agencies to “procure by contract.” Another possible interpretation of 5 U.S.C. § 3109 is that NIST must apply personnel laws and OPM regulations because 5 U.S.C. § 3109(d) directs OPM to issue implementing regulations, including specifying the circumstances in which it is appropriate to “employ” temporary experts and consultants. Ultimately, because executive branch agencies have authority to carry out the laws, not to definitively interpret them, this issue can be resolved definitively only through a judicial interpretation of the law or by further legislative action by the Congress. Because the law is unsettled about which procedures NIST should use to obtain the services of experts under the COMPETES Act authority, if the Congress chooses to extend or make the authority permanent, it may want to consider specifying which procedures NIST should employ. We provided the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the Department of Commerce, and the Office of Personnel Management with a draft of this report for their review and comment. Commerce and NIST provided a consolidated response and concurred with our conclusion that further clarification of the law granting NIST the authority to obtain temporary services of experts and consultants is needed from the Congress. OPM only provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate. The consolidated comments from Commerce and NIST are presented in appendix II. We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional committees and other interested parties. We are also sending a copy to the Deputy Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, Secretary of Commerce, and Director of the Office of Personnel Management. In addition, this report will be available at no charge on GAO’s Web site at http://www.gao.gov. If you or your staffs have questions about this report, please contact me at (202) 512-3841 or mittala@gao.gov. Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. Key contributors to this report are listed in appendix III. The objectives of this study were to determine (1) the extent to which and for what purposes the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has used its authority under the America Creating Opportunities to Meaningfully Promote Excellence in Technology, Education, and Science Act (COMPETES Act) to obtain the services of experts, (2) how effective this authority has been in helping NIST meet its need for experts to assist with urgent and short-term research projects, and (3) the extent to which NIST policies and procedures provide appropriate safeguards over the use of this authority. To determine the extent to which and for what purposes NIST used its new authority under the COMPETES Act, we obtained and reviewed all files related to the 39 personal services contracts that NIST had awarded from August 2007 through April 2009 and developed a database of descriptive information about these contracts. The descriptive information we collected included, among other things, the NIST laboratory that requested the expert, information on whether the expert had worked at NIST in some capacity or at another federal agency, the number of labor hours covered by the contract, the total contract award amounts for labor and travel, the duration of the contract, and information on whether the contract was for a fixed price. We also obtained and reviewed budget and workforce data for each of NIST’s seven laboratories and determined, for fiscal year 2008, the portion of each laboratory’s budget and workforce that these contract experts represented. In addition, we interviewed NIST contracting and laboratory officials to gain an in-depth understanding of the nature of the projects and the skills of the experts procured. To determine how effective this authority has been in helping NIST meet its need for experts, we interviewed NIST laboratory officials to obtain their views on the benefits of using personal services contracts and more detail on how work under the contract was conducted. More specifically, we interviewed nine technical information contacts, who worked directly with the experts working on 17 of the 39 contracts. We selected these nine officials to ensure that we interviewed at least one technical information contact from each of the six NIST laboratories that funded contract experts. In selecting technical information contacts to interview, we also considered the number of contract experts with which each official worked, the number of former NIST employees that were awarded contracts, the laboratory that sponsored the research, whether the contracts had been completed, and the total dollar value of the contracts. We also reviewed NIST strategic, workforce, and laboratory plans to determine the extent to which this authority has been incorporated into the agency’s planning. To determine the extent to which NIST policies and procedures provide the appropriate safeguards, we identified NIST’s procedures for using the COMPETES Act authority and reviewed NIST’s contract files to determine the extent to which they adhered to the agency’s procedures as described in NIST’s Personal Services Contract Procedures (NIST-01-09). In addition, we reviewed the statutes and regulations that NIST identified as governing its use of the COMPETES Act authority. The laws consist of Public Law 110-69, section 3009 (Procurement of Temporary and Intermittent Services) and 5 U.S.C. § 3109(b) (Employment of Experts and Consultants; Temporary or Intermittent). The regulations include 5 C.F.R. part 304 (Expert and Consultant Appointments) and two sections of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)—part 13 (Simplified Acquisition Procedures) and section 37.104 (Personal Services Contracts). The safeguards in NIST’s procedures included such things as certification that the expert’s assistance was for an urgent or short-term project; evidence of review by NIST contracting and human resources officials and completion of a risk-level assessment and information technology security checklist; a report from the Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation report; and a legal review by the Department of Commerce’s Office of General Counsel. To determine whether NIST needed to include additional safeguards in its management of this authority, we first identified measures designed to protect the government’s interests and help ensure that decisions regarding the use of federal funds promote integrity (safeguards). Specifically, we reviewed guidance issued by the Office of Management and Budget’s Office of Federal Procurement Policy, prior GAO and Commerce Inspector General reports, as well as other FAR and Office of Personnel Management (OPM) regulations, and we interviewed officials at OPM. Furthermore, we reviewed best practices and policies in place at other agencies that have the authority to procure the temporary or intermittent services of experts and consultants under 5 U.S.C. § 3109(b). We focused on agencies that NIST had contacted as it developed its procedures, such as the Department of Homeland Security, Department of Defense, Department of Health and Human Services, and National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The safeguards we identified through this process included, among other things, certification that the position was temporary and appropriate as defined in 5 C.F.R. part 304; evidence of public notice through commonly used sources to announce federal contracting opportunities, such as FedBizOpps; evidence that the contract was performance-based; and the inclusion of organizational conflict-of-interest and termination clauses in each contract. Regarding competition, we included such FAR safeguards as documentation of the number of sources considered for the contract, the reason that the expert was the only reasonably available source, and justification for the lack of competition for awards exceeding $100,000. We compared each of the 39 personal services contracts awarded by NIST with the safeguards we identified to determine the extent to which NIST followed its own procedures and the extent to which NIST followed other hiring and contracting safeguards. In addition, we reviewed NIST’s efforts to train program and procurement staff in the use of this authority. We conducted our work between October 2008 and August 2009 in\n\n### Summary:\n\n", "answer": "The America COMPETES Act gave the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), within the Department of Commerce, the authority, through 2010, to obtain the temporary services of up to 200 experts or consultants per year, but did not specify how the agency should acquire these services. NIST has used this authority to award personal services contracts to obtain the services of individuals. The act requires GAO to report on whether additional safeguards would be needed if NIST's authority were to be made permanent. To meet that requirement, GAO determined (1) the extent to which NIST has used its authority; (2) how effective the authority has been in helping NIST meet its need for experts; and (3) the extent to which NIST has provided appropriate safeguards over its use, and what additional safeguards are needed. GAO reviewed statutes, regulations, federal guidance, and NIST's contracts. In addition, GAO interviewed officials at NIST, Commerce, and the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). From August 2007 through April 2009, NIST had awarded 39 contracts totaling about $1.9 million using the COMPETES Act authority. Work under 16 of these contracts has been completed, 1 was canceled prior to being funded, and work on 22 is ongoing. Four of NIST's seven laboratories awarded 32 of the 38 funded contracts. Award amounts averaged $50,754. Award amounts covered the costs of labor hours and, in 9 cases, the costs of travel. No contract exceeded 1 year in duration, and the number of hours purchased averaged 939 hours per contract. In general, the experts designed and conducted experiments, analyzed data, and delivered their results in peer-reviewed reports. These experts also assisted with research projects, such as a study of the lighting sources and the materials used for traffic signs and road markings. According to NIST officials, the COMPETES Act authority, despite limitations, has been highly effective in helping NIST meet its need for experts. These officials told GAO that the authority allows NIST to award personal services contracts that enable the agency to quickly redirect research as needed. The officials also stated that the authority allows NIST to respond to the short-term research needs of other agencies that do not merit NIST hiring new staff. Most of these officials value the authority because they interpret it as allowing NIST to award contracts without competition, which helps them to quickly select individuals with specialized expertise. Nonetheless, some officials said the authority limits the amount of pay that can be offered, which may prevent NIST from contracting with the most highly qualified experts; although none of these officials could provide an example of when this had occurred. Also, because NIST has strictly applied the 1-year limit in the authority, NIST officials said they are limited in their ability to retain experts, even if the experts are still needed. If the authority is not made permanent, NIST officials said they will have to revert to the use of nonpersonal services contracts, which they believe are less effective in meeting the agency's needs because they require time-consuming contract modifications to redirect research and limit NIST's ability to select specific experts to do the work. NIST has developed procedures that include safeguards for using the authority, but it had difficulty determining which specific laws and regulations to apply because it did not receive clear guidance from Commerce or OPM. As a result, to help limit the risk to the agency, NIST adopted some safeguards from the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) that apply to contracts and some from OPM's regulations that implement personnel statutes. For example, NIST awarded the contracts at a firm fixed price, a FAR safeguard, and limited the pay offered to experts, a safeguard in the personnel statute. Neither the COMPETES Act nor a second law incorporated in the act clearly state whether NIST is required to use its new authority by appointing individuals as federal employees in accordance with OPM regulations or by awarding personal services contracts in accordance with the FAR. Because the question of which safeguards NIST is legally required to apply is unsettled, the need for any additional safeguards is also unclear at this time."}

Nearly all coal consumed in the United States is produced domestically, and coal represents about 29 percent of all domestically produced energy. U.S. coal production generally increased since 1960 and reached its highest level in 2008. Advancements in mining technology and a shift to using surface mines to a greater extent than underground mines has boosted coal’s overall productivity and enabled production to increase even as the number of workers decreased. In 2011, half as many workers produced 24 percent more coal than in 1985, as shown in figure 1. Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics indicate that about 86,200 people were employed in coal mining in the United States in 2011. In the United States, coal is primarily used to generate electricity—over 90 percent of coal was used to generate about 42 percent of electricity in 2011. The amount of electricity generated using coal has generally increased since the 1960s, but decreased recently due to a combination of a decline in overall electricity demand, shifts in the relative prices of fuels, and other reasons. (See fig. 2.) Meanwhile, coal’s share of total electricity generation has fluctuated over time. EIA has stated that several factors, including low oil prices during the late 1960s—which served to increase electricity generation from oil—and the oil price shocks of the 1970s have influenced the mix of fuel sources used to produce electricity. Two broad trends—recent environmental regulations and changing market conditions—are affecting power companies’ decisions related to coal-fueled electricity generating units. Regarding environmental regulations, as we have previously reported, since June 2010, EPA proposed or finalized several regulations that would reduce certain adverse health or environmental impacts, including impacts associated with coal-fueled electricity generating units.potentially significant implications for public health and the environment. One of the most significant regulations in terms of EPA’s estimated benefits and costs, EPA’s Mercury and Air Toxics Standards, establishes emissions limitations on mercury and other toxic pollutants. Mercury is a toxic element, and human intake of mercury, for example, through consumption of fish that ingested the mercury, has been linked to a wide range of health ailments. In particular, mercury can harm fetuses and cause neurological disorders in children, resulting in, among other things, impaired cognitive abilities. Other toxic metals emitted from power plants, such as arsenic, chromium, and nickel can cause cancer. EPA estimates that its finalized regulation would reduce mercury emissions from coal- fueled electricity generating units by 75 percent, as well as reduce SOemissions.retrofit generating units with controls to reduce pollutants and, when it is not economic to retrofit, may retire some generating units. In response to these regulations, power companies might Regarding broader market conditions, important market drivers have been weighing on the viability of coal-fueled electricity generating units. Key among these has been the recent decrease in the price of natural gas, which has made it more attractive for power companies to build new gas-fueled electricity generating units and to utilize existing units more. In addition, slow expected growth in demand for electricity in some areas has decreased the need for new generating units. Power companies may weigh the costs of any needed investments compared with the benefits of continuing to generate electricity at a particular unit. When the costs outweigh the benefits, a power company may decide to retire a unit rather than continue to operate the unit or install new pollution control equipment. The majority of coal produced in the United States is used domestically, though exports represent a small but recently growing fraction of U.S. coal production. In 2010, the United States exported 82 million tons of coal, which accounted for 8 percent of total production. As shown in figure 3, coal exports to European and Asian markets represented 76 percent of total U.S. coal exports in 2011. In 2011, total coal exports were up 31 percent compared with 2010, reaching 107 million tons, due largely to rising exports to Europe and Asia. This was the highest level of exports since 1991. In 2011, 35 percent of U.S. coal exports were of the types of coal typically used to produce electricity, the remainder were of metallurgical coals used in industrial processes, such as steelmaking. To better understand the potential future of the coal and electricity industries, the federal government, private companies, and others use models to project future industry conditions, including the future use of coal. For example, EIA, IEA, and IHS Global Insight produce long-term projections of electricity generation and generation from coal. Because the future depends on a multitude of factors that are difficult to predict, EIA assesses various scenarios with different assumptions about future conditions to better understand the range of potential future outcomes. For example, EIA’s primary scenario, called its “reference” scenario, is a business-as-usual estimate based on existing policies, known technology, and current technological and demographic trends. Additional scenarios make different assumptions about fuel prices, economic conditions, and government policies, among other things. Some of these scenarios are especially relevant to the question of coal’s future, because they address factors currently affecting the industry, such as the prices of coal and natural gas—a fuel that competes with coal—and possible future policies to address climate change. Appendix II presents further information about the major assumptions behind these forecasts and scenarios. The nation’s fleet of coal-fueled electricity generating units may have less total generating capacity in the future, and the fleet may be capable of emitting lower levels of pollutants, according to available information. These changes will be driven by industry plans to retire a significant number of units, install pollution control equipment on others, and build a few, new coal-fueled units that may emit lower levels of pollutants than the current fleet’s average emissions. According to forecasts we reviewed, power companies may retire a significant number of coal-fueled units in the future. In its reference scenario reflecting current policies, EIA projects that power companies may retire 49,000 MW of coal-fueled capacity from 2011 through 2035 (i.e., 15 percent of coal-fueled capacity in 2011). IHS Global Insight projects that power companies may retire 76,476 MW of capacity from 2011 through 2035 (i.e., 24 percent of coal-fueled capacity in 2011). Our statistical analysis of Ventyx data on announced retirement plans indicates that, among other things, companies are planning to retire units that are older, smaller, and more polluting. To assess the types of units that may be retired, we analyzed data on current power company plans to retire coal-fueled units. According to Ventyx data, power companies have already reported plans to retire 174 coal-fueled units with a total 30,447 MW net summer capacity through 2020—which accounted for 10 percent of coal-fueled capacity in 2011. As we have previously reported, this would be significantly more retirements than have occurred in the past–– almost twice as much coal-fueled capacity as retired in the 22 years from 1990 through April 2012. Based on our statistical analysis of these plans, power companies are more likely to plan to retire units that are older, smaller, and more polluting. (Appendix I provides further information on our statistical analysis, which included examining several other characteristics that may affect plans to retire units such as (1) whether power companies are traditionally regulated or operate in restructured markets and (2) a unit’s cost of generating electricity relative to regional prices.) Older. Power companies’ plans indicate they are more likely to retire older coal-fueled electricity generating units than newer units. Today’s fleet of operating coal-fueled units was built from 1943 through 2012, with the bulk of the capacity built in the 1970s and early 1980s. As shown in figure 4, units that power companies plan to retire are generally older, on average 54 years old compared with units with no retirement plans that average 39 years old. Some stakeholders we interviewed said that power companies are more likely to retire older units because these units may be reaching the end of their useful lives, can be less efficient at converting coal to electricity, and can be more expensive than newer units to retrofit, maintain, and operate. Smaller. The smaller a unit is, the more likely a power company is to be planning to retire it. (See fig. 5.) Size can be important when assessing the economics of additional investments needed to continue to operate coal-fueled units, as smaller units can be more expensive to retrofit, maintain, and operate on a per-MW basis. For example, some power companies may choose to install flue gas desulfurization units—known as scrubbers—to control SO and other air emissions. According to an EPA report, a typical 100 MW coal- fueled unit could incur capital costs 66 to 74 percent higher per MW to install a scrubber than a 700 MW unit. In addition, smaller generating units are generally less fuel-efficient than larger units. Units that are planned for retirement average 175 MW of capacity compared with units that are not planned for retirement that average 351 MW of capacity. Figure 5 shows the number of coal-fueled units by capacity in MW. As we reported in July 2012, power companies may retrofit many coal- fueled electricity generating units with new or upgraded pollution control equipment in response to new environmental regulatory requirements.Though the requirements and deadlines these regulations may establish for generating units are somewhat uncertain at this time, EPA’s analyses and two other studies we reviewed in our prior report suggest that one- third to three-quarters of all coal-fueled capacity could be retrofitted or upgraded with some combination of pollution control equipment, including scrubbers and other technologies to reduce SO, mercury, and other emissions. Once retrofitted with this pollution control equipment, the coal- fueled fleet would be capable of generating electricity and emitting much lower levels of pollution. For example, EPA projects that mercury emissions from coal-fueled electricity generating units will decrease by 75 percent as a result of its new regulatory requirements. Nevertheless, even the cleanest running coal-fueled unit may still be more polluting than generating units that use other fuel sources. For example, the 10 least- emitting coal-fueled units emitted over 10 times as much SO per million Btu compared with an average of 0.0006 for combined cycle units. Electricity generating units that rely on solar and wind sources produce no such emissions. Available information suggests that industry intends to build some new coal-fueled electricity generating units. According to Ventyx data, power companies have plans to build 42 new coal-fueled electricity generating units with 21,634 MW of capacity in various stages of planning or development (see fig. 7). However, as we have previously reported, developers generally have more planned projects than they complete. The total capacity of coal-fueled electricity generating units in the United States may decline in the future as less capacity is expected to be built than is expected to retire. As discussed, 49,000 to 76,476 MW of coal- fueled capacity is projected to retire by 2035 according to EIA and IHS Global Insight, respectively, and they project that 11,000 MW and 22,134 MW of new coal-fueled capacity will be added by 2035, respectively. EIA officials told us that new coal-fueled capacity in their projections is primarily expected in the next few years and represents units that are already planned or under construction. As less capacity is expected to be built than is expected to retire, total coal-fueled capacity is expected to decline in the future, as shown in figure 8. Coal's share of total electricity generating capacity was about 30 percent in 2011. In EIA’s reference scenario, coal's share of capacity declines to 25 percent in 2035 as retiring coal-fueled units are not fully replaced, and as 176,100 MW of other generating capacity is added in the future. Any coal-fueled units that are built in the future are likely to be larger, less polluting, and more fuel-efficient than the average of the coal-fueled fleet overall. Units that power companies are currently planning to build average 515 MW of net summer capacity, and the operating fleet averages 319 MW. Additionally, new units must install technologies to control emissions, and so are likely to emit lower levels of pollutants and thus be cleaner than the fleet overall. For example, generating units built after August 7, 1977, have had to obtain preconstruction permits that establish air emissions limits and require the use of certain emissions control technologies such as scrubbers to reduce emissions of SO.addition, some stakeholders we interviewed said that new coal-fueled units were likely to incorporate designs that are able to convert fuel to electricity more efficiently. Coal is likely to continue to be a key fuel source for electricity generation in the United States, but its share as a source of electricity is expected to decline, and the future use of coal to generate electricity in the United States may be affected by several key factors that include the price of natural gas and other competing fuels, environmental regulations, and the demand for electricity, among others. In addition, several stakeholders we interviewed said that coal may increasingly be exported for use in other nations, though the extent of future exports is uncertain. According to stakeholders we interviewed and projections by EIA, IEA, and IHS Global Insight, coal is likely to continue to be a key fuel source for U.S. electricity generation, but its share as a source of electricity is generally expected to decline in the future. Some stakeholders told us that, in the future, electricity generation from coal is likely to be displaced by generation from other fuel sources, particularly natural gas, but they still expect coal’s contribution to electricity generation to be significant. Furthermore, in its reference scenario, EIA estimates that coal will represent 38 percent of U.S. electricity generation in 2035 under current policies––down from 42 percent in 2011.amount of electricity generated using coal is expected to remain relatively constant over this same period under EIA’s reference scenario, growing by 0.1 percent annually. However, the amount of electricity generated using some other fuel sources, for example, natural gas and renewables, will increase at higher annual rates—1.4 percent and 2.3 percent respectively—diminishing coal’s total share of electricity generation. We met with EIA officials to discuss an early draft of this report and incorporated technical suggestions where appropriate. We also provided a draft of this report to EIA and EPA for formal comment. EIA and EPA did not provide written comments for inclusion in this report. EPA's Office of Air and Radiation did provide technical comments and stated that the report contained a very good description of many of the changes going on in coal and electricity markets that are affecting the use of coal to generate electricity. In its technical comments, EPA suggested that the draft’s emphasis on environmental regulations, particularly on the Highlights page, was misleading and not consistent with the rest of the report, which has a fuller discussion of many factors affecting the future use of coal. EPA stated that market changes, which we discuss in the report, would have significant impacts even in the absence of EPA's regulations. We do not agree that the report was misleading, but given that the Highlights page may be read without the benefit of the fuller discussion found in the report, we moved language from the body of the report to the Highlights page about other factors affecting the use of coal. EPA provided other technical comments, which we incorporated where appropriate. As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce the contents of this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the report date. At that time, we will send copies to the appropriate congressional committees, the Administrators of the EIA and EPA, and other interested parties. In addition, the report will be available at no charge on the GAO website at http://www.gao.gov.

Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. GAO staff who made key contributions to this report are listed in appendix III. This appendix describes our statistical analysis of characteristics of coal- fueled electricity generating units, such as age and size, that are likely to affect power companies’ plans to retire certain units. We use this analysis to estimate the number and generating capacity of other coal-fueled units that power companies are likely to consider retiring. To test the hypothesis that power companies are likely to retire older, smaller, and more polluting coal units by 2020, we used logistic regression analysis. We analyzed industry data on all coal-fueled units owned by power companies that have already announced plans to retire one or more of these units. Using unit- and company-level data, primarily from company-reported databases, we developed a model depicting the relationship between companies’ announced plans to retire a unit and that unit’s characteristics—age, size, emissions rates of sulfur dioxide (SO) and nitrogen oxides (NO), and the regulatory status of the power company that owns the unit, specifically whether the company is traditionally regulated or operates in a restructured market. To estimate the number and generating capacity of additional units likely to be retired, we applied our model to a dataset consisting of coal-fueled units owned by power companies that have not announced any retirements. In developing our model of power companies’ plans to retire coal-fueled units, we relied on economic theory, as well as discussions with stakeholders and our review of studies. Stakeholders included representatives from power companies, a coal company, industry associations, and nongovernmental organizations, and officials from federal and state agencies. Stakeholders and studies mentioned the following characteristics as likely unit-level determinants of power companies’ plans to retire a coal-fueled unit or keep it in operation: age; generating capacity; fuel efficiency (i.e., how efficiently a unit converts fuel to electricity) operating cost and profitability; pollution emission rates and whether a unit already has various types of emissions control equipment; and regulatory status. As a general matter, the larger, newer, more efficient, and less polluting a generating unit is, the more likely it is that a power company may to want to keep it in service and invest in retrofits that may be needed for it to comply with environmental laws or regulations. For example, if a large, new generating unit that a power company uses to meet a significant portion of customer demand is not in compliance with environmental regulations, retiring it would likely require replacing it with another unit of similar size. Doing so may be very costly, and retrofitting it with the requisite pollution control equipment may be a more economical choice. It is also reasonable to expect regulatory status to have some impact on power companies’ retirement plans because such plans could involve significant investments. For companies that are traditionally regulated, state public utility commissions review power companies’ plans for major investments in pollution control equipment in the case of a retrofit, or in replacement power generation capacity if it is needed after a unit is retired. Decisions by power companies in restructured markets are not subject to the same state public utility oversight. Furthermore, once state public utility commissions approve a traditionally regulated company’s plan to invest in major retrofits or replacement units, they allow it to charge rates to recover its investment costs. Companies operating in restructured markets have no such cost-recovery provisions, so their investments in retrofits or replacement units may be riskier. Our model does not include all the characteristics that stakeholders and studies identified as possible characteristics that power companies consider in deciding which coal-fueled units to retire. First, economic theory and our analysis of data on coal-fueled units indicate that there are interrelationships among some of these characteristics; for example, newer, larger electric generating units tend to be more fuel efficient, and this fuel efficiency contributes to lower operating costs. Hence, including all characteristics would be redundant and weaken the statistical results. Below, we discuss some specifications of the model with alternative sets of variables. Second, there are likely other characteristics that may influence power companies’ plans to retire generating units that we were unable to include in our statistical analysis. We discuss limitations of our model below. We used U.S. electricity data at the level of individual coal-fueled generating units that we obtained under contract from Ventyx, a company that maintains a proprietary database containing consolidated energy and emissions data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA),size, measured in megawatts (MW) of generating capacity; fuel efficiency; , and carbon dioxide; types of installed control equipment or whether owners plan to install control equipment in the future; various cost measures, including generating unit marginal cost; and regulatory status: equals 1 if the power company that owns the unit was traditionally regulated or 0 if the company was operating in a restructured market. We also used regional day-ahead market prices from the IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) company, and spot market prices from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to calculate an average wholesale market price for the regional markets associated with each unit in our dataset. For each market region, we calculated a simple average of daily prices for the year 2011 from daily ICE price data. For some of the regions, however, there were no price data available from ICE, so we used the 2011 average spot market price from FERC. While our model does not include all the aforementioned characteristics, we used most of these characteristics in alternative specifications of the model and discuss two of these specifications below. Our complete dataset includes 959 coal-fueled units. This dataset includes only units that have a net summer generating capacity greater than 25 MW, making them subject to EPA emissions monitoring and reporting requirements. We excluded units that have not reported any electricity generation or SO or NO emissions over the past 5 years.the total 959 units, 482 units belong to power companies that have announced plans for retiring at least one coal-fueled unit. We used logistic regression (logit) analysis to analyze the characteristics that are affecting power companies’ retirement plans of coal-fueled electricity generation units. Regression analysis in general estimates the effect of a change in an independent variable on the outcome (dependent) variable, while holding other variables constant. Logit is a type of regression analysis for situations in which the dependent variable is a categorical variable—one that can take on a limited number of values—instead of a continuous, quantitative variable. In this case, the categorical variable is binary, which means that the choice is between only two outcomes. We estimated the logit regression equation for the subgroup of 482 coal- fueled generating units belonging to power companies that have announced plans to retire at least one coal-fueled unit. The dependent variable in our model is whether to retire or not retire a coal unit, and the independent variables are the (1) age of unit; (2) net summer capacity as a measure of unit size; (3) unit’s SO emissions per unit of heat input from the fuel used in the unit’s electricity generation, measured using millions of British thermal units (Btu); (4) unit’s NO emissions rate in lb/million Btu; (5) whether the power company that owns the unit is traditionally regulated or operates in a restructured market. Table 2 shows our resulting estimated equation and relevant statistics. These results generally confirm that smaller, older and more polluting units are more likely candidates for retirement. In the table above, the second column gives the estimated value of the coefficient, which describes the relationship between the independent variables and the likelihood of retirement. The remaining columns give the standard error and the significance level. For example, the coefficient on net summer capacity is negative, which means that an increase in capacity decreases the probability that a unit is planned for retirement. Furthermore, as shown in table 2, the estimated coefficient is significant at the 6 percent level. An estimated coefficient is typically considered statistically significant if the significance is less than 10 percent and very significant if it is less than 5 percent. Similarly, the coefficient on unit age is positive, which means that an older unit is more likely to be retired, and this coefficient estimate is significant at the 1 percent level. The coefficients on SO and NO emissions are also positive and significant at the 1 percent level. Using the resulting logit regression equation, we analyzed “marginal effects” of changes in each of the independent variables on plans to retire an “average” unit owned by a power company in (1) a traditionally regulated market and (2) a restructured market, and the “average unit,” for this purpose, is one with median values for age, size/net summer capacity, SO emissions rates, as shown in tables 3 and 4. For example, a 10 percent increase in the capacity of an average unit owned by a power company in a restructured market, from 193 to 212 MW, would decrease the probability of that unit’s retirement by about 2 percent, all other variables being held constant. For a unit owned by a power company in a traditionally regulated market, the same 10 percent would decrease the probability of retirement by about 1 percent. Note that the median values for units owned by power companies operating in traditionally regulated and restructured markets are not the same and that a 10 percent increase is therefore different. The next step in our analysis was to use the resulting logit regression equation to estimate the number and generating capacity of other coal- fueled units that companies are likely to consider retiring among units belonging to companies that have not, as of yet, announced plans to retire coal-fueled units. We also estimated the generation associated with these potential retirements in megawatt-hours (MWh). We assume that some or all of these companies are likely to retire coal-fueled units, but that they either have not decided which ones, or simply have not publicly announced their plans. We further assume that these companies have or will base their decisions on the same characteristics as the companies that have already made announcements. Table 5 shows our analysis of units that power companies may consider for retirement by 2020. As shown in table 5, for the group of coal-fueled units whose owners have not reported any coal-fueled unit retirements, our analysis indicates from 90 to 138 units may likely be considered for retirement by 2020. This range represents the 95 percent confidence interval around our point estimate of 114 units. In other words, our model indicates that there is a 95 percent probability that the actual number of units that will retire is within this range. These 90 to 138 units account for 15,700 to 25,200 MW of capacity and 91 to 151 million MWh of electricity generation. If we add these units to those that power companies have announced for retirement, the total of coal-fueled retirements could range from 264 to 312 units by 2020, amounting to from 46,100 to 55,600 MW of capacity and average annual generation of 241 to 301 million MWh.percentage terms, this would be 15 to 18 percent of the capacity and 13 to 16 percent of the generation of the current coal-fueled fleet of generating units. This section discusses the limitations of our model and alternative model specifications that we tested. A major limitation of our model is that we used a nonrandom sample of the entire population of coal-fueled units to estimate the relationship between the characteristics of coal-fueled units and power companies’ plans to retire a unit. Our sample consisted of companies that announced plans to retire at least one unit but was not a random sample. It is possible that the companies that announced planned retirements and those that did not so announce differ in systematic ways that we do not observe from the data.bias. Such differences could result in omitted variable Another important limitation of our model is that we did not include all factors that contribute to power companies’ decision to retire coal-fueled units. Apart from unit-level considerations, major factors that affect a power company’s decision to retire a coal-fueled unit include fuel costs, environmental regulations, regional and local market considerations (e.g., expected future electricity demand and supply conditions, and transmission constraints), and technological developments in electricity generation and pollution control. For example, we did not take into account that planned unit retirements might make otherwise marginal units in some regions more valuable and less likely to retire. Companies that own coal-fueled units may have different expectations regarding these factors, which we did not consider in our analysis. Effectively, therefore, we assumed that power companies have very similar expectations regarding these factors. These above limitations could mean that our model does not accurately or fully reflect power companies’ unit retirement decisions. This would also mean that our estimates of how many unannounced units will retire may be inaccurate. For most of the limitations, the direction of bias in our model—the extent to which it may over- or under-estimate the likelihood of a unit retiring—is unclear. Addressing these limitations was beyond the scope of our review. To check the robustness of our model, we tested different specifications; that is, we ran logistic regressions using different sets of independent variables. For example, we tried specifications that included a measure of a unit’s fuel efficiency, and another representing whether a unit is planning to install pollution control equipment. We also tried a version with unit average capacity factors in recent years, a measure of how intensively a unit is utilized. Based on our results, none of these variables significantly improved the model. Below, we discuss two other alternative specifications in more detail. In one alternative specification, we used clustered standard errors. Our model assumes that each individual coal-fueled unit has a unique error term that is independent of every other unit. In this specification, we allow for the possibility that units owned by the same power companies may be related in unobserved ways and, therefore, the error terms may be correlated. As shown in table 6, the estimated coefficients in this alternative specification are very similar to our model, but the standard errors are generally bigger, and the estimated coefficients are generally less statistically significant. This is especially true for net summer capacity, which is no longer statistically significant at the commonly accepted 10 percent level. In a second alternative specification, we used adjusted marginal cost as a proxy for the profitability of a unit. Based on economic logic and what we heard from stakeholders, we expected some indicator of the cost and profitability of electricity generation to contribute significantly to the retirement decision. Table 7 shows a version with marginal cost adjusted for regional wholesale prices and an interaction term with marginal cost and regulatory status. We adjusted marginal cost by dividing it by the regional wholesale price to account for the fact that units are more or less valuable depending on regional wholesale electricity prices. The interaction term allows us to effectively estimate two coefficients for adjusted marginal cost, one for power companies in traditionally regulated markets, and one for power companies in restructured markets. We included an interaction term to account for the possibility that power companies in traditionally regulated and restructured markets view costs Indeed, as shown in table 7, the estimated adjusted marginal differently.cost coefficients differ—for power companies in restructured markets, the adjusted marginal cost coefficient is about 5.8, while the estimated coefficient for power companies in traditionally regulated markets is the adjusted marginal cost coefficient plus the interaction term (or 5.8 plus - 8.2 = -2.4). These results suggest that while higher adjusted marginal costs increase the probability of retirement of units owned by power companies in restructured markets, they decrease the probability for units owned by traditionally regulated power companies. The interpretation of these results is unclear. Regarding the costs of producing electricity, our findings differed for companies in restructured markets and companies that are traditionally regulated. Specifically, our results suggest that companies in restructured markets are more likely to retire units with higher adjusted marginal costs. In contrast, our results suggest that companies operating in regulated markets are less likely to retire units with higher adjusted marginal costs. A number of characteristics, not considered in our model, could provide alternative explanations for this difference. For example, it could be the case that the units in our sample have unique characteristics. One such potential case could be that units owned by power companies in traditionally regulated markets may be located in areas where concerns about the reliability of the electricity system are significant, and the costs of retrofitting an older generating unit are less costly than retiring it. Similarly, it could be that our sample contains a number of units located in areas with lower cost alternative suppliers or where prices are low— diminishing the attractiveness of even a relatively low-cost unit.

Clean Coal: DOE’s Decision to Restructure FutureGen Should Be Based on a Comprehensive Analysis of Costs,\n\n### Summary:\n\n", "answer": "Coal is a key domestic fuel source and an important contributor to the U.S. economy. Most coal produced in the United States is used to generate electricity. In 2011, 1,387 coal-fueled electricity generating units produced about 42 percent of the nation's electricity. After decades of growth, U.S. coal production and consumption have fallen, primarily due to declines in the use of coal to generate electricity. According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), using coal to generate electricity is associated with health and environmental concerns such as emissions of sulfur dioxide, a pollutant linked to respiratory illnesses, and carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas linked to climate change. In response to recent environmental regulations and changing market conditions, such as the recent decrease in the price of natural gas, power companies may retire some units, which could affect the coal fleet's generating capacity--the ability to generate electricity--and the amount of electricity generated from coal. Power companies may also retrofit some units by installing controls to reduce pollutants. GAO was asked to examine (1) how the fleet of coal-fueled electricity generating units may change in the future in terms of its generating capacity and other aspects and (2) the future use of coal to generate electricity in the United States and key factors that could affect it. GAO conducted a statistical analysis of plans for retiring coal-fueled units, interviewed stakeholders, and reviewed information on industry plans and long-term forecasts by EIA and others. GAO is not making any recommendations in this report. Retirements of older units, retrofits of existing units with pollution controls, and the construction of some new coal-fueled units are expected to significantly change the coal-fueled electricity generating fleet, making it capable of emitting lower levels of pollutants than the current fleet but reducing its future electricity generating capacity. Two broad trends are affecting power companies' decisions related to coal-fueled generating units--recent environmental regulations and changing market conditions, such as the recent decrease in the price of natural gas. Regarding retirements, forecasts GAO reviewed based on current policies project that power companies may retire 15 to 24 percent of coal-fueled generating capacity by 2035--an amount consistent with GAO's analysis. GAO's statistical analysis, examining data on power companies that have announced plans to retire coal-fueled units, found that these power companies are more likely to retire units that are older, smaller, and more polluting. For example, the units companies plan to retire emitted an average of twice as much sulfur dioxide per unit of fuel used in 2011 as units that companies do not plan to retire. Based on the characteristics of the units companies plan to retire, GAO estimated additional capacity that may retire. In total, GAO identified 15 to 18 percent of coal-fueled capacity that power companies either plan to retire or that GAO estimated may retire--an amount consistent with the forecasts GAO reviewed. Regarding retrofits, the coal-fueled generating fleet may also become less polluting in the future as power companies install controls on many remaining units. Regarding new coal-fueled units, these are likely to be less polluting as they must incorporate advanced technologies to reduce emissions of regulated pollutants. Coal-fueled capacity may decline in the future as less capacity is expected to be built than is expected to retire. According to stakeholders and three long-term forecasts GAO reviewed, coal is generally expected to remain a key fuel source for U.S. electricity generation in the future, but coal's share as a source of electricity may continue to decline. For example, in its forecast based on current policies, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecasts that the amount of electricity generated using coal is expected to remain relatively constant through 2035, but it forecasts that the share of coal-fueled electricity generation will decline from 42 percent in 2011 to 38 percent in 2035. Available information suggests that the future U.S. use of coal may be determined by several key factors, including the price of natural gas and environmental regulations. For example, available information suggests that the price of coal compared with other fuel sources will influence how economically attractive it is to use coal to generate electricity. EIA assessed several scenarios of future fuel prices and forecasts that coal's share of U.S. electricity generation will fall to 30 percent in 2035 if natural gas prices are low or 40 percent if natural gas prices are high. In addition, some stakeholders told GAO that the future use of coal could be significantly affected if existing environmental regulations become more stringent or if additional environmental regulations are issued. For example, EIA forecasts that two hypothetical future policies that reduce carbon dioxide emissions from the electricity sector by 46 percent and 76 percent would result in coal's share of U.S. electricity generation falling to 16 and 4 percent in 2035, respectively. EPA provided technical comments that were incorporated as appropriate."}

Many employers report difficulties in finding qualified workers, and many unemployed workers lack the skills they need to find jobs. Training programs can help workers gain the skills needed for today’s jobs, and employment placement programs can help employers find qualified employees. In 2002, the federal government funded 44 employment and training programs that provided services, such as job search assistance, employment counseling, basic adult literacy, and vocational training, to over 30 million people at a cost of approximately $12 billion. Although these programs were administered by nine federal agencies, many of the programs provided services to the public through one-stop centers in communities throughout the country. When the Congress passed the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) in 1998, it mandated that at least 17 federally funded programs provide employment and training services through a one-stop center system (see table 1). WIA also established workforce investment boards. Each state workforce investment board is responsible for developing statewide workforce policies and overseeing its local workforce investment boards. The local workforce investment boards, in turn, are responsible for developing local workforce policies and overseeing one-stop center operations (see fig. 1). Some of the federal employment and training programs are not required to provide services through the one-stop centers. These include the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program (TANF) and the H-1B Technical Skills Training Grant Program. The TANF program is administered by the Department of Health and Human Services and assists needy adults with children in finding and retaining employment. The H-1B Technical Skills Training Grants are administered by the Department of Labor, and the funds are distributed to select local workforce investment boards to increase the supply of skilled workers in occupations identified as needing more workers. In addition to federally funded programs, states use their own revenues to expand employment placement and training opportunities. For example, states create unemployment insurance (UI) tax offsets by decreasing the UI tax amount paid by employers and at the same time imposing a separate tax on employers for the same amount as the UI tax deduction. In addition, states use other employer taxes, and revenues from each states’ UI interest fund or from UI penalty fees imposed on employers. Employers may be charged UI penalty fees for late payments, for failing to file a UI return for an employee, or for failing to report an employee’s wages. While all of these revenues are generated through employer taxes, states also commit general revenue funds to expand employment placement and training opportunities. A study for the National Governors’ Association Center for Best Practices found that state-funded worker training programs are operating in 48 states. States have increased the availability of employment placement and training opportunities in various ways. Some states have used their revenues to expand federally funded programs. In fact, a recent national study by National Association of State Workforce Agencies found that 19 states used these revenues to supplement WIA job training services. Other states have used their revenues, including employer tax funds, to create their own employment placement and training programs; however, little is known about these programs. Some employers invest their own resources in training their workers. The exact amount of money that employers spend every year to train their workers is difficult to estimate; a study of trends in employer-provided training suggests that employers’ financial commitment to training has recently increased. Some individuals, as well, invest their own funds for training as a way to either upgrade their job-related skills or to become employable. Impact evaluations for public programs, like employment and training programs, produce findings that allow conclusions about the effectiveness of the programs to be made. These evaluations may be implemented using a few different design strategies. Two designs that are used to isolate a program’s effects, such as those on participants, are experimental designs and quasi-experimental designs. Experimental designs. These are characterized by the use of random selection and control groups. All individuals have an equal chance of being assigned to either the intervention group or the control group. The intervention group contains individuals who will receive the intervention, or program’s services, while the control group does not receive the intervention or services. This research design produces findings that allow conclusions about the effectiveness, or impact, of the intervention to be made. However, conducting experimental designs may be problematic because of the need to treat intervention and control groups differently. For example, to determine the impact of a training program on workers’ wages, a program would need to randomly provide services to some and randomly deny services to others, and track subsequent earnings for both groups of people. This approach requires services to be denied to some workers who qualify for training. Due to these difficulties, as well as the amount of time and money it takes to conduct experimental designs, quasi- experimental research designs are often preferable for their practicality. Quasi-experimental designs. These designs are characterized by comparison groups that are not randomly selected. For training programs, a quasi-experimental design would compare a group of people who have elected to take the training courses with nonparticipants who may have characteristics, such as wage or education levels, that are comparable to the group receiving services. Comparing the two groups allows researchers to account for other factors, such as the local economy, that may have influenced outcomes. The Department of Labor’s Employment and Training Administration (ETA) Office of Policy Development, Evaluation and Research has valuable resources related to designing and implementing evaluations. Labor has established evaluation coordination liaisons in each state to help with evaluations of federal programs. These liaisons can help states access logistical support and technical assistance for program evaluations. Such resources include ETA’s recent review of alternative research methodologies, which contains guidance on conducting experimental and quasi-experimental evaluations of workforce programs to determine the social and economic values of the programs. Twenty-three states reported using employer tax revenues in 2002 from a variety of employer taxes to fund their own employment placement and training programs. States most often provided job-specific training for workers. States reported spending a total of $278 million to provide these training and employment placement services. Some states established their programs as a way to address a variety of specific workforce and economic issues, such as chronic shortages of skilled workers. Twenty-three states reported using a variety of employer taxes in 2002 to fund employment placement and training services to address specific workforce issues (see fig 2). These states reported spending a total of $278 million on their workforce programs. Expenditures in 2002 varied dramatically from state to state, ranging from $100,000 in Kansas to over $84 million in California (see fig. 3). In 18 of the states, employer tax revenues completely funded these employment and training programs, while in 3 of the states employer tax revenues made up at least 50 percent of the funding for these programs. Only 1 state reported that employer tax dollars constituted less than 50 percent of its program’s funds. (For more information on individual state employment placement and training program budgets in 2002, see app. II.) States used various types of employer taxes to fund employment placement and training services (see table 2). Eleven states reported using a UI tax offset. Eight states funded their programs through a separate state employer tax. For example, Delaware employers were taxed $12.75 for the first $8,500 of each employee’s annual salary. Similarly, Massachusetts’s employers were taxed up to $8.10 per employee annually. Five states used UI penalty and interest funds. One state, California, reported combining funds from more than one employer tax source and funded its program through revenues generated by a UI tax offset and a separate state employer tax of up to $7 per employee. (For more information on the total funds collected by states through these employer taxes in 2002, see app. II.) California was the first state to use employer taxes for employment placement and worker training in 1982 and other states have followed suit (see fig. 4). In addition to California, 6 other states started using employer taxes to fund employment placement and training services by the end of the 1980s. New Hampshire most recently started to use these tax revenues to fund its program in 2001. Texas is the only state in our survey of programs operating in 2002 that has since terminated its worker training program. Some states established their programs as a way to address a variety of specific workforce and economic issues, such as chronic shortages of skilled workers. For example, Louisiana used $1.3 million to create an emergency medical services training program at a local community college after one of the state’s largest providers of paramedics and emergency medical care staff reported needing to hire most of its staff from out of state due to a lack of qualified workers. Similarly, to increase the supply of elder care providers, California funded training to certified nurses’ assistants so that they could become vocational nurses. In addition, other states noted that their employment placement and training programs address service and eligibility gaps in federally funded workforce programs. For example, Rhode Island officials said that because federal funds could not be used to provide training to employed workers prior to the passage of WIA, their employer tax-funded program provided employers with training funds specifically to improve employed worker skills. New Jersey and Washington officials also noted that their states used employer tax funds to provide employment placement and training services that are not offered through federally funded workforce programs. Other states, such as Louisiana, used employer taxes to fund training services for individuals who do not meet the income eligibility requirements used in WIA programs. Most states focused on certain industries, particularly manufacturing, because of their overall benefit to the state’s economy. California’s worker training program specifically targets manufacturing industries because these industries tend to offer high-paying, stable employment. Other industries that were also frequently targeted for training include: information; health care or social assistance; professional, scientific, or technical; and construction. Our earlier study examining how states and local areas are training employed workers found similar results: manufacturing along with health care and social assistance are two of the most commonly targeted economic sectors for training workers. Our survey of employer tax-funded state programs also showed that industries that were least often targeted included wholesale and retail trade, finance and insurance, and accommodation and food service (see fig. 5). States also targeted their services to certain employers as part of their workforce and economic development strategies. Over 11,000 employers were provided training services, and most states provided services for employers with 100 or fewer employees (see fig. 6). Rhode Island, for example, offered employers with 100 or fewer employees training grants of up to $10,000. Rhode Island officials said that they targeted smaller employers because these employers often do not have the resources to provide their workers with training and that smaller employers make up the majority of the companies in the state. States provided services in a variety of ways. States reported providing worker training either directly or through grants awarded to employers or training providers. For example, Louisiana generally awarded grants in amounts that covered an employer’s entire training costs. Employers could use these funds to provide training themselves, hire private training contractors, or contract with public training providers. Funded training could occur either during normal working hours or off the clock. Louisiana officials noted that they encouraged employers to use public training providers, most often the state’s technical colleges. On the other hand, California required employers to contribute to training-related costs. Employers were expected to match up to 100 percent of the training grant to pay for related expenses, such as worker wages during training or training materials. Officials from California reported that most training grants are awarded contingent upon workers being trained on the job, as opposed to off the clock. States funding employment placement services, such as interview technique and resume writing workshops, provided services directly or through other service providers. States most often reported that worker training was the primary emphasis of their employer tax-funded programs and spent more on worker training services than on employment placement services (see fig. 7). Fourteen states reported that worker training was the primary emphasis of their programs, and 10 of these states funded worker training exclusively. States spent approximately $202 million on worker training services; this represents 72 percent of the total funds spent on employment placement and training services (see fig. 8). States used these funds to provide a variety of training services. For example, in Louisiana funds were used to provide training related to automobile services and repairs, welding, painting, and sandblasting. Funds were also used in Louisiana to purchase training equipment, such as a Bridge Resource Management Simulator, which was used for river navigation training. States reported providing training services to about 200,000 people and were more likely to focus on the provision of training services to employed workers as opposed to dislocated workers or those receiving UI benefits (see fig. 9). (For a detailed review of states’ primary service focus, expenditures by service area, and the number of individuals served in 2002, see app. III.) States were most likely to provide job-specific training—such as on new production methods and computer software—and 17 states reported funding these types of services with employer tax revenues (see fig. 10). Officials from Louisiana said that they focus on job-specific training because this type of training contributes to increased worker productivity and company growth. State officials also noted that fostering company growth creates new jobs that can lower state unemployment rates. States were less likely to use employer taxes to provide nonjob-specific training, including conflict resolution, team building, or how to dress appropriately for the workplace. Twelve of the 23 states reported providing this type of training. These findings echo our previous study on worker training that found similar trends: states were more likely to focus state and federal funds on occupational training as compared to nonjob- specific training. Basic skills training—such as math, GED preparation, and English as a second language—is least often provided, with only 10 states reporting they used employer tax revenues to fund this type of training. Fewer state employer tax-funded programs emphasized employment placement services, such as career counseling, skill assessments, and self- access employment services like Internet job listings and career planning videos. Eight states reported that employment placement was their primary focus, and 6 of these states funded employment placement services exclusively. States reported spending approximately $77 million to provide employment placement services to approximately 1.17 million individuals. Despite the fact that fewer states reported emphasizing employment placement services, the total number of individuals receiving employment placement services is approximately six times as great as the total number of individuals receiving training services. The difference in the number of people served may be attributed to the time and resource intensity of training services compared with employment placement services. For example, Louisiana awards training grants that are up to 2 years in length. In comparison with training services, many of the employment placement services that states reported providing are far less time- and resource-intensive. Twenty-one of the 23 states with employment placement and training programs funded through employer taxes reported some coordination with federal workforce programs in 2002. The most common coordination activity reported by states was the joint promotion of state and federally funded workforce programs through outreach or referrals (see fig. 11). These promotion activities occurred in various ways. For example, in California, a local workforce investment board and its one-stop center hired staff to make cold calls to companies advertising the benefits of participating in the state-funded training program. In Louisiana, on the other hand, state officials provided information packets to employers about how to upgrade their employees’ skills or fill job openings using state and federally funded workforce programs. In addition, many states reported that they coordinated with federal workforce programs by sharing technical assistance and administrative resources. Technical assistance involves the exchange of program information to improve program practices. For example, in California, staff from both state and federally funded workforce programs worked together on a task force and provided each other with technical assistance to improve services to small businesses. Sharing administrative resources, on the other hand, can involve activities such as using a common management information system, or sharing office space or staff. In Rhode Island, for example, staff at the local workforce investment boards were responsible for administering some of the training grants funded by the state program. Fewer states reported co-funding employment and training services or jointly developing policies with federal workforce programs. The number of partnerships between employer tax-funded programs and the federal workforce system varied from state to state. Some state programs coordinated with only one federal partner. For example, New Hampshire’s program chose to coordinate exclusively with its state workforce investment board. Other state programs coordinated with many federal partners. For example, Delaware’s program coordinated with a one-stop center, TANF, the H1-B technical skill grants program, and other federal workforce programs. (For additional information on each state’s partnerships with federal programs, see app. IV.) Although state employer tax-funded programs vary in their relationships with federal workforce programs, some patterns are evident regarding the most common federal partners. The majority of the states (19) reported coordinating with at least one one-stop center during 2002. However, several one-stop centers can operate in a state, and we do not know if states coordinated with more than one of these centers. Thus, it is difficult to gauge the degree of coordination between state-funded programs and one-stop centers within each state. Nevertheless, we do know that many states also reported coordinating with state workforce investment boards, of which there is only one per state (see fig. 12). The number of federal partners that state employer-funded programs have does not seem to be closely associated with the number of years that the state programs have operated. Although Delaware’s program is older than New Hampshire’s and coordinated with more federal workforce programs, this is not a consistent pattern across the country. For example, Kansas reported fewer federal partners than Louisiana, despite the fact that Kansas’s employer tax-funded program has been in existence for about a decade longer. As a result of their various partnerships with workforce investment boards and one-stop centers, almost all states reported an increase in awareness of their employer tax-funded programs. In addition, some state officials noted that coordination had improved service quality and availability. For example, officials from Michigan and New Jersey’s state programs, as well as an official from an Oregon workforce investment board, noted that co- locating staff from the state-funded programs at the one-stop centers improved the services delivered to individuals. By co-locating these programs, state officials said that they can help these individuals learn about a broader range of employment and training services and job opportunities. The Oregon official also pointed out that such co-location can reduce transportation and child care barriers for clients. Coordination can also assist states in improving services to employers. For example, a state official from Idaho reported that having staff members who are knowledgeable about both the state-funded program and WIA programs enables them to better meet the needs of employers looking to expand their businesses or move to the state. Although many state officials noted that coordination had improved services, they were less likely to report increases in funding for employment and training services as a result of these collaborative relationships (see fig. 13). Twenty-two of the 23 states with employer-funded employment placement and training programs reported assessing the performance of their programs in 2002, though program impacts could not be determined. States reported using a range of approaches to assess their employment placement and training programs, including variations in who conducted the assessments, data collection methods used for the assessments, and the frequency of the assessments. Of the 18 states that could provide assessments of their individual employment placement and training programs, 4 assessed their programs exclusively using process-oriented indicators, while the other 14 used outcome-oriented indicators in their assessments. However, none of the states used sufficiently rigorous research designs to allow them to make conclusive statements about the impact of their programs. Twenty-two of the 23 states with employer-funded employment placement and training programs reported assessing the performance of their programs in 2002. States reported using a variety of data collection methods for their assessments, and most states used a combination of data sources for their assessments. For example, Tennessee’s assessment was based on data collected from site visits to training locations and surveys administered to employers, while self-reported feedback and a fiscal audit were the data sources used for Texas’s assessment. The most commonly used data sources were: surveys, self-reported feedback, and on-site visits. Only 2 states relied solely on quantitative data, such as program expenditures and employment statistics. For example, Alabama used its UI wage database to track how program participants fared in finding jobs. Most states used a combination of internal and external evaluators for their assessments (see fig. 14). For example, California used both in- house program staff and external evaluators from several state universities to evaluate its program. On the other hand, 9 states used in-house evaluators exclusively, while only 1 state, Indiana, used external evaluators exclusively. Furthermore, states conducted their assessments at varying intervals. About two-thirds of the states (14) regularly conducted assessments— annually, quarterly, and monthly. Eight states conducted assessments once training contracts were completed. For example, Tennessee sent surveys to employers once the contracts it awarded were completed. None of the state assessments used sufficiently rigorous research designs to allow them to make conclusive statements about the impact of their programs. We asked states to provide us with copies of recent assessments of their programs. Although 5 states could not provide us with assessments of their individual employment and training programs, 18 of the 23 states shared recent assessments with us. On the basis of the 28 assessments received from 18 states, we examined indicators used by the states and found that 4 assessed their programs exclusively using process-oriented indicators. For example, Hawaii and New Hampshire collected data on the number of businesses served. Likewise, Alabama and Texas both collected data on how many people participated in their programs. Process-oriented indicators help assess a number of factors, including who uses the program, how funds are spent, and how well a program is being implemented. Fourteen states included outcome-oriented indicators along with process- oriented indicators in their assessments, with 11 states measuring worker wages (see table 3). States also used a variety of other outcome-oriented indicators, including job placement and retention rates of trainees. Outcome-oriented indicators provide important data for states related to changes, such as those in: worker wages, employment stability, and advancement rates. Although 14 states used outcome-oriented indicators, none used sufficiently rigorous research designs to allow them to make conclusive statements about the impact of their programs. Twelve of the 14 states that used outcome-oriented indicators did not use comparison groups in their evaluation design. Without comparing a program’s participants to similar nonparticipants, it is not possible to account for other factors, such as an upturn in the local economy, which may have influenced participant outcomes. While 2 states used comparison groups, their methodological design did not allow for the identification of conclusive impacts of these programs because their comparison groups were not comparable enough to their participant groups. To help close the gap between employer needs and employee skills, both federal- and state-funded workforce programs are providing skills training to employees and helping employers find qualified employees. Twenty- three states used employer taxes in 2002 to fund their own employment placement and training programs. These state programs have the potential to enhance the federal workforce system by filling service and eligibility gaps. However, the impact of these programs is unknown because states have not adequately studied them. Because these programs contribute to our nation’s ability to provide comprehensive workforce development services to meet employers’ needs for skilled workers, it would be helpful to have information on the impact of these efforts. The Department of Labor’s Employment and Training Administration (ETA) Office of Policy Development, Evaluation and Research has valuable resources related to designing and implementing evaluations that might help address this lack of information. Labor has established evaluation coordination liaisons in each state and, although this position was designed to help with evaluations for federal programs, the liaison may be able to direct state program administrators to resources such as ETA’s recent review of alternative research methodologies. Furthermore, this liaison could help state administrators access other program evaluation expertise, such as logistical support and technical assistance. We provided a draft of this report to the Department of Labor for its review, and Labor provided technical comments. Labor expressed an interest in state employment placement and training programs funded by employer taxes. In addition, Labor acknowledged the importance of collaboration between these state-funded programs and federally funded programs, by noting that it may seek opportunities to better assist states in coordinating their programs with federal Workforce Investment Act programs. We will send copies of this report to the Secretary of Labor, relevant congressional committees, and other interested parties. Copies will be made available to others upon request. In addition, the report will be available at no charge on GAO’s Web site at http://www.gao.gov. Please contact me on (202) 512-7215 if you or your staffs have any questions about this report. Other major contributors to this report are listed in appendix VII. We were asked to determine (1) How many states use employer taxes to fund their own employment placement and training programs, and what type of services do they provide; (2) The extent to which these state employment placement and training programs are coordinating with federal workforce programs; and (3) How states are assessing the performance of their employment placement and training programs. To address these questions, we conducted three surveys, reviewed program evaluations, and visited 3 states. First, we surveyed all 50 states and the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico to identify those that were using employer tax revenues to provide their own employment placement or training programs in 2002. We then conducted a follow-up survey with the 23 states that reported using employer taxes to fund their own programs during state fiscal year 2002. Specifically, we surveyed the state programs that reported receiving the largest portion of employer tax revenues collected in their state to provide employment placement and training services. To gain a perspective on service coordination with federally funded workforce programs, we surveyed staff from workforce investment boards in 6 states that began to fund their employment placement and training programs through employer taxes in the 1980s. We also requested recent assessments from the 23 states we surveyed and reviewed the assessments from the 18 states that could provide them to us. Finally, we conducted site visits to 3 states—California, Louisiana, and Rhode Island. To determine how many states used employer taxes to fund their own employment placement and training programs, we surveyed workforce officials from the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. This structured survey was administered via e-mail and the telephone and had a 100 percent response rate. Twenty-three states reported that they used employer tax revenues to fund their own employment placement and training programs in state fiscal year 2002. To determine the types of employment placement and training services states offered, we conducted a second survey of the 23 states that reported using employer taxes to fund these services in our first survey. This survey was designed to obtain information related to program mission, services provided, populations served (individuals and industries), budget size, and expenditures. To determine if states assessed their programs, we also asked questions related to the frequency of program performance assessments and the types of methods used to measure program performance. In addition, we requested copies of recent program assessment reports. To determine the extent to which state programs coordinated with federal workforce programs, we also asked states to report how their employment placement and training programs worked with federal organizations and programs, including workforce investment boards, one-stop centers, TANF, Welfare-to-Work, H1-B grants, employment placement and training programs administered by the U.S. Department of Education, and other federally funded programs. In addition, we asked states how these coordination efforts affected program awareness, quality of service, available funding, and the amount of employment placement and training services available. To gain the perspective of officials from federally funded programs on coordination with these state programs, we administered a structured telephone survey to representatives from workforce investment boards operating in 6 states that began their employer tax-funded employment placement or training programs during the 1980s (see table 4). We chose these states with older programs, because we believed that they would have more established partnerships with federal programs and would be able to provide in-depth information on coordination. We surveyed representatives from 5 of the state workforce investment boards. We also surveyed a total of 10 purposively and randomly selected local workforce investment boards. At least one local workforce investment board was surveyed from each state that began operating its employer tax-funded program during the 1980s. We included steps in both the survey data collection and data analysis stages to account for and minimize the variability that occurs when respondents interpret questions differently or have different information available to them. For example, survey specialists along with subject matter specialists designed each questionnaire, and we pre-tested each questionnaire with the appropriate target audience to ensure that questions were clear. We pre-tested our workforce investment board survey with representatives from state workforce investment boards and a local workforce investment board. We also reviewed survey questionnaire responses for consistency and in several cases contacted respondents to resolve inconsistencies. However, we did not otherwise verify the information provided in the responses. In order to increase our response rate for each survey, we followed up with program officials through e-mail and telephone contact. We analyzed these survey data by calculating descriptive statistics. We reviewed recent assessments from the 18 states that could provide them to us. Two of those states shared more than one recent assessment with us, all of which we used in our analysis. The assessments we collected ranged from annual reports to budget briefings to strategic plans to external evaluations. We analyzed these reports by performing a content analysis in which we coded the assessment indicators as outputs (process-oriented data) or outcomes (outcome-oriented data). Furthermore, when provided, we analyzed the research designs states used to assess their programs against standard evaluation research design characteristics as described by Rossi and Freeman (1993) and McBurney (1994). We selected 3 states for site visits according to several criteria, including the year employer taxes were first used to fund their employment placement and training program. We chose states that were early, mid- and late implementers. Site selection was also based on diverse program funding levels and geographic diversity (see table 5). In each state, we interviewed officials responsible for administering each state’s employer tax-funded employment placement or training program to gain further insight into the types of services provided and populations served by these programs. To learn more about the extent to which these state-funded employment placement and training programs coordinate with federally funded workforce programs, we also interviewed officials from each state’s workforce investment board. We also interviewed officials from two one-stop career centers operating in each state we visited. We purposively selected these one-stop career centers because they coordinated with employer-funded state programs. Program solely funded through employer taxes Yes These states’ program budgets for state fiscal year 2002 were greater than the amount collected through each state’s employer tax. Reasons for this disparity varied and included rollovers of unspent funds from previous years. Some states, specifically Delaware, Indiana, Michigan, Oregon, and South Dakota, also used other funding sources in addition to employer tax revenues to pay for these programs. In Indiana, Michigan, and South Dakota at least 50 percent of the funding for these programs came from employer taxes. However, in Oregon employer taxes constituted less than half of the funds used for the program. Delaware did not specify the portion of its program budget funded by employer taxes. Our survey permitted states to report “DK” or “Don’t Know.” Applicable data not provided. Delaware, Indiana, Michigan, and South Dakota reported that their program budgets included funds from other sources, making it difficult to isolate expenditures from their state employer tax revenues. While Oregon also reported that its program budget included funds from other sources, Oregon provided us with additional data. Oregon’s expenditures included in this figure are those that were solely funded through employer tax revenues. Texas was unable to provide us with the number of individuals that received training services in 2002.

Some experts indicate that such a skill gap already affects many employers. To help close this skill gap, both federal- and state-funded programs are providing training and helping employers find qualified employees. In 2002, the federal government spent about $12 billion on workforce programs, and there are various studies on these programs. States also raised revenues in 2002--from taxes levied on employers--to fund their own workforce programs. However, little is known about these state programs. GAO was asked to provide information on how many states use these employer taxes to fund their own employment placement and training programs, what services are provided, the extent to which these state programs coordinate with federal programs, and how states assess the performance of these programs. Twenty-three states reported using employer tax revenues in 2002 to fund their own employment placement and training programs, and states most often provided job-specific training for workers. States used various types of employer taxes and reported spending a total of $278 million to address state-specific workforce issues. States invested in a variety of industries, but manufacturing was the most frequently targeted. Most states with employment placement and training programs funded through employer taxes reported some coordination with federal workforce programs in 2002. States were most likely to coordinate with federal workforce programs by jointly promoting programs through outreach and referrals. According to most state officials, coordination with federal workforce programs raised awareness of their state-funded programs. Some state officials also reported that coordination improved the quality and availability of services. Twenty-two of the 23 states reported assessing the performance of their programs in 2002. However, none have used sufficiently rigorous research designs to allow them to make conclusive statements about the impact of their programs, such as their effect on worker wages or company earnings. Because these programs contribute to our nation's ability to provide comprehensive workforce development services to meet employers' needs for skilled workers, it would be helpful to have information on the impact of these efforts. The Department of Labor has valuable resources that might help states evaluate the impact of their programs."}

Most Medicare beneficiaries can choose to receive covered services through Medicare FFS or through an MA plan if one is offered where they live. Beneficiaries in Medicare FFS and in MA plans, including PFFS plans, pay monthly premiums and are responsible for cost sharing, which can be in the form of coinsurance (a percentage payment for a given service that a beneficiary must pay), a copayment (a standard amount a beneficiary must pay for a medical service), or a deductible (the amount a beneficiary must pay before Medicare FFS or an MA plan begins to pay). MA plans operate under annual contracts between MA plan sponsors and CMS and provide Medicare benefits in exchange for a monthly payment from CMS for each beneficiary enrolled in the plan. Beneficiaries can disenroll from MA plans during the annual coordinated election period, from November 15 through December 31 of a given year by enrolling in another plan or in Medicare FFS. Changes made during the annual coordinated election period take effect on January 1 of the following year. Beneficiaries can also disenroll from MA plans once during the open enrollment period, from January 1 through March 31 of a given year. Changes made during this time period take effect on the first day of the month following the plan’s receipt of the beneficiary’s request. Relative to beneficiaries in other MA plans and Medicare FFS in April 2007, beneficiaries in PFFS plans were healthier, generally younger, and more likely to live in rural areas with fewer MA options. Specifically, beneficiaries in PFFS plans had projected health care expenditures—an indicator of health status—that were lower, on average, than those of beneficiaries in other MA plans and Medicare FFS. Beneficiaries in PFFS plans had projected health care expenditures that were 7 percent less than those of beneficiaries in other MA plans and 10 percent less than beneficiaries in Medicare FFS. Beneficiaries in PFFS plans were generally more likely to be younger and reside in rural areas than beneficiaries in other MA plans and Medicare FFS (see table 1). PFFS plans had a smaller percentage of beneficiaries age 85 or older compared to other MA plans and Medicare FFS. Approximately 14 percent of PFFS beneficiaries lived in rural areas compared to 1 percent of beneficiaries in other MA plans and 10 percent of beneficiaries in Medicare FFS. Medicare beneficiaries in rural areas, on average, had access to about 12 different PFFS plan options, but only about 4 other MA plan options. In contrast, Medicare beneficiaries in urban areas had access to an average of about 13 PFFS plan options and about 12 other MA plan options. As a result, beneficiaries in rural areas might have been more likely to enroll in a PFFS plan because there were fewer other MA options available in those areas. New enrollees in PFFS plans as of April 2007 were more likely than new enrollees in other MA plans to have been in Medicare FFS prior to enrollment but less likely to have been new to Medicare altogether or previously in a different type of plan. About 81 percent of new enrollees in PFFS plans were in Medicare FFS prior to joining their plan, compared to 65 percent of new enrollees in other MA plans (see table 2). About 6 percent of new PFFS enrollees were new Medicare beneficiaries prior to joining their plan, compared to about 13 percent of new enrollees in other MA plans. About 13 percent of new enrollees in PFFS plans were in a different type of plan before enrolling in their current plan, compared to 23 percent of new enrollees in other MA plans. In contrast to most beneficiaries in other MA plans and Medicare FFS, beneficiaries in PFFS plans may have faced certain financial risks if they or their providers did not contact their plan before receiving services. Specifically, if PFFS beneficiaries or their providers did not obtain advance coverage determinations, which specified whether services would be covered and how much beneficiaries would have to pay, beneficiaries unexpectedly may have been responsible for the entire cost of the service if coverage was later denied by their PFFS plans as not medically necessary. In addition, even if PFFS plans covered the services as medically necessary, some PFFS beneficiaries may have experienced substantially higher cost sharing if they or their providers did not contact their plans before receiving certain services. PFFS plans sometimes used the term prior authorization inappropriately to describe beneficiary or provider responsibilities for contacting their plans. CMS officials stated that PFFS plans should not have used this term because PFFS plans are not permitted to deny coverage for services when prior plan approval was not obtained. However, CMS guidance for PFFS plans related to prior authorization has been inconsistent and sometimes incorrect. If PFFS beneficiaries or their providers did not contact their plan before receiving a service to obtain an advance coverage determination, beneficiaries may have been responsible for the entire cost of the service if coverage for it was later denied by the plan because it was not medically necessary. Beneficiaries may have learned, from the information they received from their PFFS plan, whether a particular type of service would be covered, subject to a determination of medical necessity. However, from that information, the beneficiary would not know whether the plan would determine a service to be medically necessary in a specific instance. To ascertain before a specific service was received whether it would be covered, beneficiaries or their providers may request an advance coverage determination from the PFFS plan. CMS officials told us that they thought it was rare for beneficiaries in PFFS plans to face unexpected costs of denied claims, but they did not have data on the extent to which this occurs. Beneficiaries in other MA plans, such as HMOs and PPOs, generally had certain protections from unexpected costs when receiving services from network providers. Pursuant to CMS policy, when beneficiaries in other MA plans seek care from network providers and these providers are required to fulfill plan procedures to ensure coverage of services, such as obtaining a referral or prior authorization, beneficiaries are held harmless financially when providers fail to take these steps. In this circumstance, if beneficiaries in other MA plans reasonably believe that services would be covered, they would only be liable for their plan’s cost sharing for the services, even if their plan later denies coverage. In addition, when these beneficiaries are responsible for taking steps to ensure coverage of services they receive from network providers, providers are required to inform beneficiaries of their responsibilities before providing these services. If the providers fail to do so, beneficiaries are responsible only for their plans’ cost sharing for the services even if their plans later deny coverage. Because virtually all PFFS plans did not have provider networks, they did not provide these beneficiary protections. Beneficiaries in Medicare FFS also had protection from the unexpected costs of claims that were denied when services provided were subsequently determined to be not medically necessary. Specifically, beneficiaries in Medicare FFS generally are protected from incurring financial liability if they do not receive an advance beneficiary notice notifying them when Medicare is expected to deny coverage for a given service because it was not medically necessary. Some PFFS plans—plans administered by four of the nine PFFS plan sponsors we reviewed—required their providers, under the terms and conditions of the plans, to inform beneficiaries if a specific service was likely to be denied by the plan. However, these terms and conditions did not specify the penalty, if any, for not complying with this requirement. The terms and conditions of the remaining five plan sponsors did not require that providers notify beneficiaries if a service was likely to be denied by the plan. Beneficiaries in some PFFS plans were responsible for higher cost-sharing amounts if they (or their health care providers) did not contact their plans in advance (a process called prenotification) before obtaining certain covered services. Under CMS policy, PFFS plans can vary cost sharing depending on whether beneficiaries (or their providers) have notified the plan before receiving certain services. Four of the nine PFFS plan sponsors in our review offered plans that charged higher cost sharing if prenotification did not occur for certain services, such as inpatient hospital stays, durable medical equipment, inpatient mental health services, and skilled nursing services. The specific services subject to prenotification requirements and the amount of additional cost sharing varied by PFFS plan and could have been substantial (see table 3), as the following examples illustrate. Three PFFS plan sponsors offered plans that required prenotification for inpatient hospital stays. Plans offered by two of the three PPFS plan sponsors increased required cost sharing by $100 to $150 per inpatient hospital admission without prenotification, while plans offered by the third sponsor required an additional $50 per day up to a maximum of $500 per admission. Four PFFS plan sponsors offered plans that required prenotification for durable medical equipment, and doubled, or more than doubled, beneficiary coinsurance rates if prenotification did not occur. One plan increased the coinsurance rate for durable medical equipment and prosthetic devices from 30 percent to 70 percent for items that cost more than $750 if beneficiaries or their providers did not prenotify. In these plans, for example, cost sharing for beneficiaries who purchased a power wheelchair for approximately $4,000 could increase from about $1,200 if they notified their plan to about $2,800 if they did not. Three PFFS plan sponsors offered plans that required prenotification for inpatient mental health stays and increased cost sharing in amounts ranging from $100 per admission to $50 per day up to a maximum of $500 if prenotification did not occur. One PFFS plan sponsor offered plans that required prenotification for skilled nursing facility stays and increased cost sharing by $50 per day up to a maximum of $500 if prenotification did not occur. In contrast to PFFS plans, the other MA plans we reviewed did not appear to have prenotification requirements for services received from network providers. CMS officials noted that prenotification was generally unnecessary in HMOs, which accounted for about 89 percent of beneficiaries in other MA plans in April 2007, because HMOs typically had a primary care physician who authorized care for the beneficiary. CMS officials also confirmed that Medicare FFS does not have prenotification requirements. Administrators from one of the four plan sponsors that required prenotification told us that they did so for inpatient hospital stays and other services in order to help them identify beneficiaries for case and disease management and for discharge planning. Administrators from another plan sponsor stated that they decided to require prenotificiation for durable medical equipment because the benefit typically had a high likelihood of abuse. A representative from another plan sponsor said that when the plan was prenotified it determined whether the equipment was medically necessary and informed the beneficiary of the potential financial liability that would be associated with the use or purchase of the durable medical equipment. The same representative noted that durable medical equipment was often determined to be not medically necessary. Some PFFS plans we reviewed inappropriately used the term prior authorization rather than prenotification in the informational materials they distributed to beneficiaries, which may have caused confusion about beneficiaries’ financial risks. CMS officials stated that PFFS plans should not have used the term prior authorization because PFFS plans are not permitted to deny service coverage due to lack of prior plan approval. Inconsistent information that CMS provided to PFFS plans may have contributed to some PFFS plans’ inappropriate use of the term prior authorization. One source of CMS guidance—a CMS manual—incorrectly stated that PFFS plans’ terms and conditions were required to indicate “whether the provider must obtain advance authorization from the PFFS organization before furnishing a particular service.” CMS officials acknowledged when we interviewed them in April 2008 that this statement was incorrect and should be deleted from its manual; however, as of August 2008 it had not been deleted. Another source of inconsistent guidance from CMS was the data system that the agency used to obtain benefits information from PFFS and other MA plans. CMS officials explained that, prior to our inquiries, they did not realize that the Plan Benefit Package (PBP) software, which PFFS plans used to specify their benefits, did not allow plans to enter their prenotification information, but did allow plans to specify whether they had prior authorization requirements. As a result, some PFFS plans’ summaries of benefits incorrectly indicated that these plans had prior authorization requirements. CMS officials said that they would update the PBP software for contract year 2010 to ensure that PFFS plans would be unable to specify prior authorization requirements and would make available a screen where PFFS plans could enter their prenotification information for specific services. Following our inquiries on prior authorization and prenotification, CMS issued guidance to all PFFS plan sponsors in May 2008 through an operational policy memorandum to clarify its policy in these areas. This policy memorandum reiterated that PFFS plans could not require prior authorization from providers or beneficiaries as a condition of coverage. Regarding prenotification, the policy memorandum clarified that PFFS plans could not impose penalties, but that they were permitted to offer cost-sharing reductions for complying with voluntary prenotification protocols. From January through April 2007, beneficiaries in PFFS plans disenrolled at an average rate that was more than twice that of other MA plans, and we conclude that CMS did not comply with statutory requirements to mail disenrollment rates to Medicare beneficiaries for the previous 2 years for MA plans in their area. Furthermore, information CMS has provided to beneficiaries on MA plan disenrollment rates and reasons for disenrollment is outdated. Beneficiaries in PFFS plans were more than twice as likely to disenroll as beneficiaries in other MA plans from January through April 2007. PFFS beneficiaries disenrolled at an average rate of about 21 percent, compared to about 9 percent for beneficiaries in other MA plans. Disenrollment rates varied by plan, which could reflect plan-level differences in factors such as beneficiary satisfaction with care, service, and out-of-pocket costs. The range of disenrollment rates for PFFS plans—about 4 percent to 59 percent—was similar to the range of rates for other MA plans—about 2 percent to 54 percent. However, PFFS beneficiaries were more likely than other MA beneficiaries to be in a plan with high disenrollment rates. For example, about 19 percent of PFFS beneficiaries were in plans that experienced disenrollment rates of 30 percent or more. In contrast, only 3 percent of other MA beneficiaries were in plans that experienced such high disenrollment rates. Approximately 15 percent of PFFS beneficiaries, but about 65 percent of other MA beneficiaries, were in plans that had disenrollment rates below 10 percent. (See fig. 1.) On average, disenrollees from PFFS plans were generally sicker compared to the average for all beneficiaries in PFFS plans. This pattern was also evident in other MA plans, although the average health status difference between disenrollees and all beneficiaries in these plans was less pronounced. Beneficiaries’ risk scores indicated that the projected health care expenditures, on average, of disenrollees from PFFS plans were estimated to be about 6 percent higher than the average for all PFFS beneficiaries. Similarly, beneficiaries who disenrolled from other MA plans had projected health care expenditures that were, on average, estimated to be about 3 percent higher compared to average projected health care expenditures for all beneficiaries in other MA plans. PFFS disenrollment rates differed depending on beneficiaries’ age group and location (see table 4). Older beneficiaries in PFFS plans tended to disenroll at higher rates. For example, PFFS beneficiaries age 85 and older had the highest disenrollment rate (about 25 percent) while beneficiaries younger than age 65 had the lowest disenrollment rate (about 18 percent). In contrast, there was no such relationship between age and disenrollment rates for other MA plans. Also, beneficiaries in PFFS plans who resided in urban areas were more likely than rural beneficiaries to disenroll, but this was not the case for other MA plans. We conclude that CMS did not comply with statutory requirements to mail disenrollment rates to Medicare beneficiaries prior to the annual coordinated election period. In creating the MA program (previously called the Medicare+Choice program), Congress required CMS to annually mail information to beneficiaries comparing MA plans, including PFFS plans. The mailings were required to contain information about each MA plan available in a beneficiary’s area, including beneficiary disenrollment rates for the previous 2 years, to the extent that these data were available. CMS officials informed us that they had not mailed disenrollment rate information to all Medicare beneficiaries since the Medicare & You 2001 handbook was sent in fall 2000, but more recent data were available. MA plan sponsors are required to provide CMS with disenrollment rates for beneficiaries who had been enrolled in their plans. Although CMS did not respond to our questions about whether MA plan sponsors complied with requirements to provide CMS with disenrollment rates, CMS does have the information needed to calculate current disenrollment rates by using Medicare enrollment data. We used Medicare enrollment data from CMS to calculate disenrollment rates presented in this report for January through April 2007 and also in previous reports in 1996 and 1998. In response to our inquiries, CMS officials stated that there is no requirement to mail disenrollment rates to Medicare beneficiaries, but did not provide any explanation for the agency’s position. We, however, disagree as under federal law, prior to each annual coordinated election period, CMS is required to provide to Medicare beneficiaries disenrollment rates for plans in their area to the extent these rates are available. Because we concluded that disenrollment rates for MA plans were available, CMS was required to include relevant disenrollment rates in annual mailings to Medicare beneficiaries to enable them to make informed choices about their Medicare coverage. CMS published disenrollment rates and reasons for disenrollment through MOC on Medicare’s Web site. As of August 2008, this information was available through MOC based on data for 2004 and 2005. However, given the recent growth in PFFS plans, from about 109,000 beneficiaries in June 2005 to about 2.3 million beneficiaries in June 2008, disenrollment rates and reasons for disenrollment based on disenrollment in 2004 and 2005 may not accurately represent the experience of PFFS plans available to beneficiaries in 2008. CMS officials stated that information on beneficiaries’ reasons for disenrollment is necessary to understand the underlying differences in disenrollment rates across plans. Nonetheless, CMS officials said that the disenrollment reasons survey was discontinued after 2005 due to budget constraints. A CMS official also noted that providing disenrollment rates without reasons for disenrollment would be misleading because one would not know the extent to which beneficiaries left a plan, for example, because another plan was less expensive or due to poor quality care. We disagree with CMS’s position. Although it would be useful to know the reasons behind beneficiaries’ disenrollment decisions, disenrollment rates alone can provide useful relative information about MA plans and prompt beneficiaries to investigate plans further. The substantial enrollment growth in PFFS plans shows that these plans are an attractive option for Medicare beneficiaries. Yet, beneficiaries in these plans may have faced unexpected out-of-pocket costs if plans denied coverage for services for which beneficiaries or their providers had not obtained an advance coverage determination. While officials from CMS did not believe that PFFS plans often denied services unexpectedly for not being medically necessary, it is important to determine the extent to which such denials occur. Having this knowledge would inform CMS and policy makers about whether additional protective measures or beneficiary educational efforts are warranted. It is also important that beneficiaries have accurate and current information about MA plans’ policies and procedures. As such, ensuring that prior authorization guidance is accurate will help beneficiaries and providers better understand the obligations and financial risks associated with PFFS plans. Similarly, providing beneficiaries with current information about MA plan disenrollment rates would help them make more informed choices when considering enrolling in an MA plan. We recommend that the Acting Administrator of CMS take the following three actions: investigate the extent to which beneficiaries in PFFS plans are faced with unexpected out-of-pocket costs due to the denial of coverage when they did not obtain an advance coverage determination from their plan; ensure that CMS guidance on prior authorization accurately reflects CMS policy and that PFFS plan materials conform to CMS requirements; and mail to Medicare beneficiaries MA plan disenrollment rates for the previous 2 years for MA plans that are or will be available in their areas, as required by statute, and update disenrollment rates provided to Medicare beneficiaries through MOC. We provided a draft of this report to CMS and AHIP for comment. CMS provided us with written comments that are reprinted in appendix II, and representatives from AHIP provided us with oral comments. CMS stated that beneficiaries may have more certainty that a particular service will be covered if that service is obtained from a provider in a plan’s network. As a consequence, CMS stated that it is important for beneficiaries in non-network plans (such as virtually all PFFS plans) to understand their rights and obligations. CMS advised that beneficiaries in non-network plans may want to consider obtaining advance determinations from their plans in appropriate circumstances. CMS said that it would continue to work closely with Congress, GAO, beneficiary advocacy groups, and other interested parties to ensure that beneficiaries receive appropriate health care and do not incur unexpected financial risks. CMS outlined the steps that it was taking, or planned to take, in response to each of our three recommendations. In response to our recommendation that CMS investigate the extent to which beneficiaries in PFFS plans are faced with out-of-pocket costs due to the denial of coverage when they did not obtain an advance coverage determination from their plan, CMS is examining coverage denials and complaints, and will be collecting new information from plans and refining its complaint tracking module to support this effort. In response to our recommendation that CMS ensure prior authorization guidance accurately reflects CMS policy, the agency described several steps it has already taken and planned to take to address the inaccuracies, including providing new guidance, modifying the PBP, and providing model terms and conditions that PFFS plans will be required to use in 2009. In response to our recommendation that CMS mail disenrollment rates to Medicare beneficiaries and update disenrollment rates through MOC, the agency commented that it had recently awarded a contract to obtain disenrollment rates and other performance metrics by late 2009. However, the agency was silent as to how it would distribute information on MA plan disenrollment rates to beneficiaries. In general, AHIP representatives thought the report could better highlight certain points related to prenotification, MIPPA, and case management, and AHIP representatives made several observations about other aspects of the report. AHIP representatives stated that, while our presentation of prenotification requirements was accurate, the report should have more clearly stated that we did not know the extent to which beneficiaries actually faced higher cost sharing as a result of not fulfilling prenotification requirements. They also stated that our discussion of MIPPA should have occurred earlier in the report given the potential impact of this legislation on PFFS plans, and suggested that our finding that all nine PFFS organizations in our study provided either case management or disease management services should have been given greater prominence in the report. We believe our methodology and findings regarding prenotification are clearly presented in the report and do not agree that clarifications are warranted. We also believe the placement and emphasis on MIPPA and case and disease management are appropriate given the focus and timing of our work. AHIP representatives made several other observations they thought might help clarify aspects of the report. They explained that prenotification was originally intended to protect beneficiaries by providing them with an incentive to contact their plan to determine whether a service was covered before the service was rendered. AHIP representatives informed us that CMS had posted standard terms and conditions on its Web site that would help to address use of incorrect terms by the industry. They also stated that one explanation for our finding that beneficiaries in PFFS plans were younger on average could be that younger beneficiaries were more likely to try new types of plans. In addition, AHIP representatives emphasized the importance of collecting information about beneficiary reasons for disenrollment and endorsed making this information available to beneficiaries. As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the report date. At that time, we will send copies to the Acting CMS Administrator, appropriate congressional committees and others. The report also will be available at no charge on the GAO Web site at http://www.gao.gov/. If you or your staff have any questions about this report, please contact me at (202) 512-7114 or cosgrovej@gao.gov. Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. GAO staff who made major contributions to this report are listed in appendix III. This appendix explains the scope and methodology that we used to address our reporting objectives that (1) compare the characteristics of beneficiaries in private fee-for-service (PFFS) plans to the characteristics of beneficiaries in other MA plans and Medicare FFS; (2) describe the financial risks that beneficiaries in PFFS plans face, compared to beneficiaries in other Medicare Advantage (MA) plans and Medicare fee- for-service (FFS), if they do not contact their plan prior to receiving services; and (3) compare the rates at which beneficiaries in PFFS plans disenroll to the rates for other MA plans and evaluate whether the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) met statutory requirements to mail disenrollment rates to beneficiaries. To compare the characteristics of beneficiaries in PFFS plans, specifically age, gender, and residential location, to the characteristics of beneficiaries in other MA plans and Medicare FFS, we used Medicare enrollment data from CMS for April 2007 from the Management Information Integrated Repository (MIIR) database and data from CMS on the average risk score for each MA plan in 2007, which provide an indicator of the health status of the plan’s beneficiaries. We focused our analysis on beneficiaries enrolled in five types of MA plans as of April 2007 that accounted for more than 99 percent of the approximately 7.8 million beneficiaries in MA plans at that time—PFFS plans and four other types of MA plans—Health Maintenance Organizations (HMO), Local Preferred Provider Organizations (PPO), regional PPOs, and Provider-Sponsored Organizations (PSO). Among beneficiaries in the five MA plan types in our analysis, we excluded those (1) who were in plans that have enrollment restrictions (i.e., employer plans, Special Needs Plans (SNP), and plans that only cover Medicare Part B services) and (2) who live outside the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. After implementing these exclusions, we analyzed data as of April 2007 for 1,304,288 beneficiaries in 431 PFFS plans, 4,535,881 beneficiaries in 1,567 other MA plans, and 31,680,824 beneficiaries in Medicare FFS. We used the Health Resources and Services Administration’s Area Resource File for 2006 to obtain data on counties’ level of urbanization. We defined new enrollees in PFFS and other MA plans as beneficiaries who were in a given MA plan type in April 2007, based on data from the MIIR database, but who were not in that same plan type in December 2006. To compare the health status of beneficiaries in PFFS plans, other MA plans, and Medicare FFS, we used plan-level risk scores from CMS as a proxy for health status. After excluding beneficiaries in employer plans, SNPs, and plans that only cover certain Medicare FFS services as described above, we analyzed risk scores for 430 PFFS plans in which 1,371,169 beneficiaries were enrolled and 1,576 other MA plans in which 4,610,368 beneficiaries were enrolled as of July 2007. To describe the financial risks that beneficiaries in PFFS plans face, compared to beneficiaries in other MA plans and Medicare FFS, if they do not contact their plan prior to receiving services, we reviewed relevant laws, regulations, documentation from CMS, and materials from nine PFFS plan sponsors interviewed that accounted for about 81 percent of PFFS enrollment in July 2007. We reviewed plan benefit information for 2008 provided to beneficiaries as well as provider terms and conditions of payment for 30 PFFS plans, accounting for more than half of each sponsor’s total PFFS plan enrollment. We reviewed plan benefit information for 2008 provided to beneficiaries for 33 HMO or PPO plans operated by the same nine plan sponsors, accounting for more than half of each sponsor’s total enrollment in other MA plans. If the plan’s benefit information provided to beneficiaries explicitly stated that beneficiaries would face higher cost sharing for certain services if they or their provider did not notify the plan before receiving such services, we considered that plan to have a prenotification requirement. We also interviewed officials from CMS and the plan sponsors. Information gathered from our review of the benefit information provided to beneficiaries for PFFS and other MA plans may not be representative of, or generalizeable to, other types of plans offered by these plan sponsors or to other PFFS and other MA plans that were not in our sample. To compare the rates at which beneficiaries in PFFS plans disenroll to the rates for other MA plans, we used Medicare enrollment data from the MIIR database for 6,913,780 beneficiaries in MA plans in December 2006. Because MA plan selections for 2007 generally take effect from January through April 2007, we identified disenrollees as beneficiaries who were covered under a given MA contract in December 2006 but were no longer covered under that contract in April 2007 based on Medicare enrollment data. Because we calculated disenrollment at the MA contract level, we did not address the extent to which beneficiaries transferred from one plan to another within an MA contract. We chose to calculate disenrollment rates at the MA contract level, rather than at the MA plan level, for two reasons: (1) transferring from one plan to another within a contract can occur for administrative reasons and therefore may not reflect beneficiary decisions, and (2) a beneficiary’s decision to transfer, for example, from a zero premium plan to a plan within the same MA contract that charges a premium and has a richer benefit package does not suggest dissatisfaction with the type of MA plan or the sponsor that administers it. We calculated disenrollment rates for each MA contract as the total number of beneficiaries who disenrolled from their MA contract divided by total enrollment in that contract. The disenrollment rate for an MA contract applies to all plans under that contract. We did not include beneficiaries in disenrollment rate calculations if they disenrolled involuntarily due to factors such as death, loss of Medicare eligibility, moving out of their MA contract’s service area, or to administrative factors such as a change in their MA contract’s service area or a termination of their MA contract or plan. After excluding beneficiaries (1) in certain plans and locations as described above and (2) in contracts or plans that were terminated in 2006 or 2007, we analyzed data for 158 PFFS plans accounting for 805,734 beneficiaries and 169,465 disenrollees and for 1,410 other MA plans accounting for 4,488,653 beneficiaries and 392,704 disenrollees. We used risk scores for 2006—an indicator of projected health care expenditures—to compare the health status of disenrollees to beneficiaries overall in PFFS and other MA plans. To estimate average risk scores of disenrollees from PFFS and other MA plans, we used 2006 beneficiary-level risk scores for 169,271 beneficiaries who disenrolled from PFFS plans and for 391,126 beneficiaries who disenrolled from other MA plans from January through April 2007. To estimate the average risk scores of beneficiaries overall in these plans, we used 2006 plan-level risk scores, which are based on 725,110 beneficiaries in 154 PFFS plans and 4,421,308 beneficiaries in 1,400 other MA plans in July 2006, and weighted each plan’s risk score by its July 2006 enrollment. According to a CMS official, MA plans’ risk scores generally decline over the course of a year, so a plan’s risk score based on beneficiaries in the plan in July 2006 could be higher than it would have been based on beneficiaries in the plan in December 2006. As a result, the actual percentage difference between the average projected\n\n### Summary:\n\n", "answer": "Medicare Advantage (MA) plans are an alternative to the original Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) program. Private fee-for-service (PFFS) plans--one type of MA plan--give beneficiaries an option that is more like Medicare FFS than other MA plans, with a wider choice of providers and less plan management of services and providers. PFFS enrollment increased from about 35,000 beneficiaries in June 2004 to about 2.3 million in June 2008. This report compares PFFS plans to other MA plans and Medicare FFS in three areas: (1) characteristics of beneficiaries, (2) financial risks for beneficiaries who do not contact their plans before receiving services, and (3) disenrollment rates. To do this work, GAO reviewed materials from a selected sample of nine PFFS plan sponsors, analyzed Medicare data, and interviewed officials from CMS, which administers the Medicare program, and other organizations. In April 2007, beneficiaries in PFFS plans tended to be healthier and generally younger than beneficiaries in other MA plans and Medicare FFS. Specifically, projected health care expenditures for PFFS beneficiaries were 7 percent less than the projected average for beneficiaries in other MA plans and 10 percent less than the projected average for beneficiaries in Medicare FFS. Beneficiaries in PFFS plans also generally were more likely than beneficiaries in other MA plans and Medicare FFS to reside in rural areas where fewer other MA plans were available. In addition, about 81 percent of beneficiaries who were new enrollees in PFFS plans were in Medicare FFS before enrolling in their plan, compared to 65 percent in other MA plans. PFFS beneficiaries may have faced certain financial risks if they did not contact their plan before receiving services. These risks were generally not assumed by beneficiaries in other MA plans and Medicare FFS. Specifically, if beneficiaries or their providers did not contact their PFFS plans before obtaining a service to make sure it would be covered, beneficiaries unexpectedly may have had to pay for the entire cost of the service if coverage was later denied by their plan. CMS officials told GAO they did not have data on the extent to which PFFS beneficiaries were faced with such costs. Furthermore, some beneficiaries likely experienced higher out-of-pocket costs for covered services if they did not contact their plan before obtaining the services. For example, one sponsor of PFFS plans increased the share of the cost for which beneficiaries were responsible from 30 percent to 70 percent if the beneficiaries did not contact the plan before obtaining certain durable equipment. GAO found that some PFFS plans were inappropriately using the term prior authorization, which can involve denying service coverage if prior plan approval is not obtained, in their informational materials. CMS officials stated that PFFS plans should not have used this term because these plans were not permitted to deny service coverage due to lack of prior plan approval. However, CMS guidance on this issue has been inconsistent and sometimes incorrect. From January through April 2007, beneficiaries in PFFS plans disenrolled at an average rate of 21 percent compared to 9 percent for other MA plans, and GAO concludes that CMS has not complied with statutory requirements to mail disenrollment rates to Medicare beneficiaries. Disenrollment rates can reflect factors such as beneficiary satisfaction and CMS is required by law to mail this information to Medicare beneficiaries to help them compare available MA plans in their area. Although CMS has not mailed disenrollment rates to beneficiaries since 2000, the agency did provide disenrollment rates through Medicare's Web site. However, this information was based on disenrollment in 2004 and 2005 and, given the enrollment growth since then, may not accurately reflect plans available to beneficiaries in 2008."}

Twenty distinct ARV medications can be used to treat people living with HIV/AIDS. The standard treatment is a regimen that combines three or more ARVs. People receiving ARV treatment can develop strains of HIV that are resistant to some or all of their ARVs, and as a result their treatment regimens become ineffective and they must switch to a different regimen. The risk of developing resistance decreases when patients are able to adhere to their recommended treatment by taking the prescribed ARVs, the right number of times each day, and without missing doses. WHO has recommended certain regimens for settings in which resources are limited. For people receiving ARVs for the first time in such settings, WHO recommends one of four regimens, known as first-line regimens. These regimens are built from combinations of the following five first-line ARVs: stavudine (d4T), zidovudine (ZDV), lamivudine (3TC), nevirapine (NVP), and efavirenz (EFV). (See fig. 1.) Of the four first-line regimens, WHO recommends d4T + 3TC + NVP as the first-choice regimen for rapid implementation of large-scale treatment programs in resource-limited settings because, for example, it is expected that most people will be able to tolerate it without developing side effects that would require switching to another regimen. Each of the focus countries highlighted in the Emergency Plan has selected one or more of these first-line regimens for its national treatment strategy, and most have selected d4T + 3TC + NVP as their first-choice regimen. For people who have developed strains of HIV that are resistant to their initial treatment regimen, WHO recommends one of four second-line regimens. The second-line regimens use a different set of five ARVs. Second-line regimens can have disadvantages, which may be magnified in resource-limited settings. The disadvantages include the need to take more pills, the potential for additional side effects, the need for refrigeration during transportation and storage, and prices that are generally higher than those for first-line regimens. WHO emphasizes that promoting better adherence to a first-line regimen, thereby reducing the occurrence of resistance and delaying the need to shift to a second-line regimen, is particularly important in resource-limited settings because of these disadvantages. The Coordinator’s Office, FDA, and the Institute of Medicine, as well as the Global Fund, the World Bank, UNAIDS, and WHO, have endorsed the use of FDCs, which combine two or more ARVs into one pill, as an important strategy to promote adherence to ARV regimens. These organizations have determined that the benefits of FDCs include promoting adherence, by reducing the number of pills a person has to take at one time, reducing the time and costs associated with procurement and distribution of ARVs, and simplifying the selection and prescribing of ARVs. Both national initiatives—such as the Emergency Plan—and multinational initiatives provide funding for HIV/AIDS treatment in the focus countries. In general, these initiatives provide their funding through grants, cooperative agreements, and contracts with governments and NGOs. The NGOs provide technical assistance and support the implementation of treatment programs by, for example, purchasing medications. In recognition of the fact that several initiatives may be active in any one country, the U.S. government and the multinational initiatives have agreed to promote coordination across their initiatives in order to use resources efficiently and effectively and to ensure rapid expansion of treatment programs. The Emergency Plan is the largest national initiative to combat the global HIV/AIDS epidemic. Through the Emergency Plan, the U.S. government both provides direct technical assistance through field offices and funds NGOs that support HIV/AIDS treatment programs in the focus countries. Under the direction of the Coordinator’s Office, USAID and HHS’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have primary responsibility for implementing the Emergency Plan, with USAID responsible for overseeing the purchase of medications. Multinational organizations, including the Global Fund and agencies within the UN system, also provide funding to HIV/AIDS programs in the focus countries. The Global Fund, which was initiated in 2002, expects disbursements to total $1 billion by the end of 2004, over half of which are intended to fund HIV/AIDS programs. Within the UN system, the World Bank represents the largest source of funding for HIV/AIDS activities in developing countries. Since 1986, the World Bank reports that it has invested $2 billion in HIV/AIDS prevention, care, and treatment services in developing countries. All HIV/AIDS treatment programs must comply with the laws—including patent and drug registration laws—that apply in the country for which they are purchasing ARV products, as well as the requirements that pertain to the source of funding they are using. The purchase of ARVs under the Emergency Plan is subject to USAID quality assurance requirements and a statutory patent requirement. To assure quality, USAID requires that ARV products purchased under the plan have either FDA approval or the approval of another acceptable regulatory authority. Because the Emergency Plan is largely funded under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, the purchase of ARVs with these funds is subject to a provision of the act that prohibits the purchase of any medication manufactured outside the United States if the manufacture of that medication in the United States would be covered by a valid U.S. patent, unless the patent owner gives its permission. The purchase of ARV products with funds from the other initiatives must meet the quality assurance requirements that the World Bank, UNICEF, and the Global Fund have in common. Specifically, these organizations require that all ARV products either be approved by an acceptable regulatory authority such as FDA or be prequalified through WHO’s Prequalification Project. WHO’s Prequalification Project includes a process for assessing the quality of products that have not been subject to review by an acceptable regulatory authority. Prequalification relies on review of product information and manufacturing site inspections to determine if the product meets WHO standards. The Emergency Plan provides a smaller selection of ARV products than the other initiatives. Because the plan provides only ARV products that have been approved by FDA or another acceptable regulatory authority, it provides six ARV products, all of which are original versions. In addition to ARV products that have met the Emergency Plan’s quality assurance requirement, other initiatives also provide generic ARVs that have been prequalified by WHO. While the plan does not provide the FDCs preferred by the focus countries, these products are available through the other initiatives. As of December 2004, the Emergency Plan provides one version—the original version—of each of the five ARVs necessary to build all of the first-line regimens. The plan also provides a double-ARV FDC (ZDV + 3TC) that can be used in half of those regimens, but not the regimen that is recommended by WHO as the first choice for rapid implementation of large-scale HIV/AIDS treatment programs in resource-limited settings (d4T + 3TC + NVP). These six products, flagged with filled diamonds in figure 2, are the only first-line ARVs that have been approved by FDA or another acceptable regulatory authority and thus comply with the plan’s quality assurance requirement. Because no generic ARVs currently meet the plan’s quality assurance requirement, the Emergency Plan does not provide generic versions of any of the first-line ARVs or the double-ARV FDC provided under the plan. In addition, the Emergency Plan does not provide any version of three other FDC products that are generally available to the focus countries, including the triple-ARV FDC (d4T + 3TC + NVP) that is preferred by the majority of the focus countries. The other initiatives provide not only the original versions of the first-line ARVs but also generic versions that meet their quality assurance requirements. In addition to ARVs that have been approved by FDA or another acceptable regulatory authority, the other initiatives also accept those that have been prequalified by WHO. Thus the other initiatives provide generic versions of most of the first-line single ARVs, as well as a double-ARV FDC (ZDV + 3TC) and a triple-ARV FDC (d4T + 3TC + NVP), flagged with unfilled diamonds in figure 2, that are not provided under the plan. Other generic versions of all ARV products are available to the focus countries but are not provided under the Emergency Plan or under the other initiatives. The additional generic ARVs generally available to the focus countries, shown in figure 2 as vertical lines without diamonds, have been neither approved by FDA or another acceptable regulatory authority nor prequalified by WHO. At the prices quoted to us during June and July 2004, most first-line regimens could be built for a lower price with the generic ARV products provided under the other initiatives than with the original ARV products provided under the Emergency Plan. (See table 1.) The difference in price between the original ARVs provided under the Emergency Plan and the lowest-priced generic ARVs provided under the other initiatives ranged from $11 less per person per year for original 3TC to $328 more for original NVP. (See fig. 2.) At these prices, three of the four first-line regimens could be built for a lower price with the generic ARV products provided under the other initiatives than with the original ARV products provided under the Emergency Plan. The difference in price for these three regimens when built with the lowest-priced ARVs provided under the other initiatives and when built with the lowest-priced ARVs provided under the Emergency Plan ranged from $40 less per person per year for the regimen ZDV + 3TC + EFV to $368 less for the regimen ZDV + 3TC + NVP. There was no difference in price for the regimen d4T + 3TC + EFV because the lowest-priced ARVs provided under the Emergency Plan and the other initiatives are the same. All of the first-line regimens could be built for a lower price using the lowest-priced generic ARVs that are generally available to the focus countries but not provided under either the Emergency Plan or the other initiatives. Differences in the price of a regimen per person per year can translate into millions of dollars of additional expense when considered on the scale of the Emergency Plan’s goal of treating 2 million people by the end of 2008. For example, the price for the regimen that WHO recommends as the first choice for rapid scale-up in settings with limited health care resources (d4T + 3TC + NVP) is $343 more per person per year under the Emergency Plan. Thus for every 100,000 patients on this regimen for 5 years, the plan could pay over $170 million more than the other initiatives for purchase of these ARVs. The overall impact of these price differences over the life of the plan and on the treatment goal is difficult to estimate precisely because, for example, the mix of ARVs and treatment regimens that will be used as the Emergency Plan expands is unknown and product prices may change. The Coordinator’s Office has taken steps to expand the selection of quality-assured ARV products it provides to the focus countries to include the preferred FDCs and lower-priced generics. However, the patent requirement could present a barrier to expanding the selection. The Coordinator’s Office has worked with FDA to expand the selection of quality-assured ARV products, particularly the preferred FDCs, that the Emergency Plan provides to the focus countries. The selection of ARV products provided is currently limited primarily by the plan’s quality assurance requirement. The Coordinator’s Office has been encouraging manufacturers to seek FDA approval for their ARV products, and thereby satisfy the plan’s quality assurance requirement. FDA officials told us that the agency has been helping existing and potential manufacturers of ARV products, particularly FDCs, to prepare applications for submission to FDA. Several manufacturers told us that they have been working with FDA to develop applications. One of the manufacturers we spoke with announced in October 2004 that it had submitted an application, and the others told us that they intended to do so. FDA officials said that these applications would have priority for review and that they expect to be able to act on complete applications within several months of submission. In addition, the Coordinator’s Office has worked with FDA to clarify that FDCs are eligible for expedited review and to assemble into a single guidance document several sets of regulations and guidelines that pertain to this expedited review. As part of this guidance, FDA has included a list of combinations of ARVs for which FDA believes there are sufficient publicly available safety and effectiveness data that an application would not need to include additional clinical studies. The Emergency Plan may not be able to expand the selection of ARV products it provides to include lower-priced generic ARVs unless the Coordinator’s Office addresses a potential barrier presented by the applicable patent requirement in the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. Although the selection of ARV products available under the plan is currently limited primarily by the quality assurance requirement, if generic ARVs receive FDA approval, the patent requirement could be a barrier to expansion. Because all five of the first-line ARVs are currently under U.S. patents, even if a generic ARV were to receive FDA approval, thus meeting the plan’s quality assurance requirement, the patent requirement would prevent its purchase unless the patent holder had granted permission. If such permission is not granted, this requirement could prevent the purchase of generic ARVs, including generic FDCs, that have met the plan’s quality assurance requirement. The Coordinator’s Office has the authority to provide ARV products notwithstanding the patent requirement. We asked officials from the Coordinator’s Office whether the Coordinator would use this authority in order to purchase an FDA-approved generic ARV for which permission could not be obtained from the patent owner. Officials from the Coordinator’s Office told us that they could not address hypothetical situations but that the Coordinator would consider using his authority to make funds available to purchase these products notwithstanding this requirement if the ARV in question is critical to the plan’s treatment responsibilities and no readily available substitute exists. It may not be possible for most generic ARVs to meet these conditions because generics are by definition substitutes for existing products. In addition, a representative of one of the generic manufacturers we spoke with told us that the company is concerned and is hesitating to apply to FDA because it has sought, but not yet obtained, assurances from the Coordinator’s Office that once its products have met the plan’s quality assurance requirement these products will be eligible for purchase under the Emergency Plan. During its first year, the Emergency Plan has provided a limited selection of ARV products that does not fully support the treatment strategies of the focus countries and is not optimally coordinated with other multinational initiatives because it does not include the FDCs and lower-priced generics that the majority of these countries prefer. Better coordination with the focus countries and with other treatment initiatives could facilitate more rapid implementation of the Emergency Plan. Moreover, given the intended scale of the plan, lower prices for ARVs could result in savings of hundreds of millions of dollars, which could be used to treat additional patients or to support other aspects of the program. The Coordinator’s Office has taken steps to expand the selection of ARV products that meet its quality assurance requirement—with special focus on FDCs—by working with manufacturers and FDA to increase the number of products that have FDA approval. If applications proceed as anticipated by ARV manufacturers and FDA, we expect that FDA-approved generic ARVs will be available early in 2005. However, unless the patent holders for these ARVs give permission or the Coordinator’s Office exercises its authority to purchase these products notwithstanding the patent requirement, the selection of ARVs provided under the Emergency Plan may not expand rapidly enough to address the AIDS emergency. We provided a draft of this report to the Department of State, HHS, and USAID. Written comments submitted by the Department of State on behalf of itself, HHS, and USAID are reprinted in appendix III. In its comments, the Department of State expressed concern about how our report addressed the issue of ARV quality and urged us to mention prominently in the report recent changes in the list of products that are prequalified by WHO. However, we stated in the draft report that concern about quality is the primary factor limiting the selection of ARVs provided under the Emergency Plan and the other initiatives. Our draft report recognized that quality assurance is a critical concern, and provided background information on the quality assurance requirements of the Emergency Plan and the other initiatives and specified the quality assurance processes applied to each ARV product. However, as the draft report stated, evaluating the quality assurance processes used by each initiative was beyond the scope of our work. We have updated the draft report to reflect all changes in the availability of ARV products, including those highlighted by the Department of State. The Department of State also characterized figure 3 (see app. II) in the report as misleading because not all of the generic ARV products are sold on the market in all 15 focus countries. However, the draft report explained that the laws of individual countries may not allow for the purchase of some products. In response to the agency’s concerns, we clarified this further in notes to figure 3. In addition, the agency expressed confusion over our use of the term “generic” and offered the more formal term, “therapeutic equivalents,” used by FDA. In the draft report, we used the word “generic” broadly to mean a copy of an original product, regardless of whether FDA or another national regulatory authority has determined the generic product to be a therapeutic equivalent to an original product. We have further clarified our use of the term in the report. We agree with the agency’s comment that it is important to distinguish between issues of quality assurance and intellectual property, and these issues were treated separately in the draft report. In addition, our concern about the patent requirement being a potential barrier to expanding the selection of ARV products provided under the Emergency Plan is only with respect to those generic products that have first met the plan’s quality assurance requirement. Lastly, the Department of State highlighted that the patent requirement is a statutory restriction under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as we noted throughout the draft report. We revised the draft to further clarify the source of the patent requirement. The Department also said that the Coordinator’s Office has decided to exercise its authority with respect to the patent requirement “as necessary.” However, because the comments did not clarify when it might be necessary for the Coordinator’s Office to use its authority to make funds available to purchase products notwithstanding the patent requirement, it remains unclear if all generic products that have met the quality assurance requirement will be eligible for purchase under the Emergency Plan. In its comments, the agency also provided additional information on the Emergency Plan’s outreach activities and plans for bulk purchasing of ARV products. The Department of State, HHS, and USAID individually submitted technical comments, which we incorporated where appropriate. As we agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of this report earlier, we plan no further distribution of it until 30 days from the date of this letter. We will then send copies to the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and the Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development and make copies available to others who request them. In addition, the report will be available at no charge on GAO’s Web site at http://www.gao.gov. If you or your staffs have any questions about this report, please call me at (202) 512-7119. Another contact and key contributors are listed in appendix IV. This report compares the selection of antiretroviral medication (ARV) products that are being provided under the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (Emergency Plan) with that provided under other initiatives that also fund HIV/AIDS treatment programs in the focus countries, as of December 2004. Our discussion is focused specifically on the ARVs that are recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for first-line treatment of HIV/AIDS in countries where health care resources are limited. Our report also provides price information for the ARV products provided under the Emergency Plan and under the other initiatives. We report prices quoted, during June and July 2004, by 13 selected manufacturers of ARV products that are generally available to the focus countries. Lastly, we examine the efforts of the Office of the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator (Coordinator’s Office) within the Department of State to expand the selection of quality-assured ARV products provided at the lowest possible price to the focus countries. Aspects of implementing HIV/AIDS treatment programs other than the selection and price of medications, such as human resources and supply chain management, and treatments other than ARVs, such as medications to treat opportunistic infections, are outside the scope of this report. Similarly, the HIV/AIDS prevention and care objectives of the Emergency Plan are outside the scope of this report. We conducted our review from January 2004 through January 2005 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. To compare the selection of ARV products provided under the Emergency Plan to that provided under the other initiatives, we reviewed the requirements that apply to the purchase of ARV products under the Emergency Plan. Specifically, we reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and guidance from which the plan’s requirements arise. We also reviewed documentation from the Coordinator’s Office and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) to determine which products had been provided under the plan as of December 2004. In addition, we interviewed officials from the Coordinator’s Office, USAID, and the Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) Office of Global Health Affairs, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) about experience within federal programs with purchasing ARVs for developing countries. Lastly, we interviewed officials at the nongovernmental organizations (NGO) that have received funding under the Emergency Plan to purchase ARVs in the focus countries. These NGOs include Catholic Relief Services Consortium, Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation, and Harvard University School of Public Health. To determine the selection of ARV products provided under the other initiatives, we reviewed the requirements that apply to the purchase of ARV products under the HIV/AIDS treatment initiatives funded by the World Bank, the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria (Global Fund). Specifically, we reviewed guidance documents from the Global Fund, the World Bank, UNICEF, and WHO related to the purchase of ARVs under these initiatives. We also interviewed officials from these organizations regarding the requirements that apply to the provision of ARVs under their treatment initiatives and to confirm the accuracy of information obtained from their Web sites. In our comparison we determined the quality assurance process applied to each product, but we did not evaluate the different quality assurance processes required under the Emergency Plan as compared with those required under the other initiatives or determine the comparative quality of the products. Our review of the ARV products provided under the Emergency Plan and the other initiatives focuses specifically on the ARVs that are recommended by WHO for treatment of HIV/AIDS in countries with limited health care resources. In order to determine the appropriate treatment recommendations to focus on in this report, we reviewed literature on the use of ARVs in general and in countries with limited health care resources in particular. Our literature review included searches of scientific publications using electronic databases, including the National Library of Medicine’s PubMed, as well as the Web sites of the New England Journal of Medicine, the Journal of the American Medical Association, and The Lancet. We reviewed literature on ARV treatment available from the Coordinator’s Office, USAID, HHS, FDA, CDC, the HHS Office of the Inspector General, the Congressional Research Service, the Congressional Budget Office, and the Institute of Medicine. We also reviewed treatment guidelines and related documentation from WHO, the Global Fund, the World Bank, the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, UNICEF, and the United Kingdom’s Department for International Development. We also interviewed officials from several of these organizations. To understand the issues involved in providing ARVs in countries with limited health care resources, we interviewed officials from several NGOs that are working in these settings—including Doctors Without Borders, the William Jefferson Clinton Foundation (Clinton Foundation), the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, John Snow Incorporated (JSI), Family Health International (FHI), and Management Sciences for Health (MSH). We also reviewed documentation on the focus countries’ national HIV/AIDS strategies and treatment guidelines, including information that we obtained from the Coordinator’s Office and NGOs. The prices we report are prices that 13 selected manufacturers quoted to us during June and July 2004 for the focus countries. We surveyed the manufacturers from which the major organizations that support treatment programs in the focus countries have considered purchasing their ARVs. These organizations include JSI, FHI, MSH, the Clinton Foundation, the Global Fund, the World Bank, WHO, UNICEF, Doctors Without Borders, the International Dispensary Association, and MissionPharma. We selected a manufacturer for inclusion in our report if it makes at least one of the ARVs included in the WHO-recommended first-line regimens and was selling or willing to sell its ARV product to at least one of the focus countries. Thirteen of the 15 manufacturers that we considered met these criteria and were willing to quote their prices for the first-line ARVs for the focus countries. We did not select products based on registration with the focus countries’ national drug regulatory authorities because information on country-level registration was incomplete or not available. Because some of the manufacturers we surveyed offer their products at significantly lower prices to developing countries than to developed countries, we requested price quotes specifically for the focus countries. We did not attempt to determine the prices that specific purchasers are paying for these products because at the time we conducted our analysis there was limited experience in the focus countries with using the funding sources discussed in this report for large-scale purchase of ARVs. Because different manufacturers offer their reduced prices according to differing criteria, in some cases the lowest price offers are not available to all of the focus countries. Specifically, Guyana and Vietnam are not eligible to purchase ARVs at some manufacturers’ lowest price. In addition to these two focus countries, other developing countries outside the scope of this report may not be eligible for the prices we present. To help ensure that the manufacturers’ prices we present are as comparable as possible across different manufacturers of the same ARV, we surveyed manufacturers using a standard set of questions. We developed our questions on the basis of our literature review and discussions with various officials from U.S. government agencies, officials from other initiatives, representatives from NGOs, and representatives from pharmaceutical manufacturers. These questions took into account differences in purchasing agreements, including price negotiation based on volume and length of contract, inclusion of shipping and insurance, and financing guarantees. Some of the manufacturers we spoke with told us that they offer prices that are negotiable depending on the volume of the purchase, the length of the contract for purchase, and the degree to which financing can be guaranteed. Therefore we requested prices based on the following purchase scenarios, all of which assume financing has been guaranteed: (1) purchase of enough medication to treat 500 patients for 1 year, (2) purchase of enough medication to treat 10,000 patients for 1 year, and (3) purchase of enough medication to treat 10,000 patients for 3 years. All manufacturers were given the opportunity to provide prices according to these scenarios, although some told us that their prices were not negotiable. We developed the scenarios based on estimates of the scale of existing treatment programs in the focus countries, and the potential scale of programs over the next 3 years. We verified, with officials from USAID and other experts in ARV procurement, that these scenarios represented plausible purchasing arrangements both now and over the next 3 years as treatment programs expand in developing countries. Because the price information we requested is considered proprietary by the manufacturer, we could not directly assess the reliability of the price data given to us. However, we checked the prices quoted to us against other published sources from our literature search and manufacturers’ Web sites and determined they were reliable for our purposes. In some cases a manufacturer’s prices include costs that other manufacturers do not include—such as shipping and insurance charges. We note where these differences exist, and have determined that they do not undermine the essential comparability of the prices presented in our report. In making this determination, we first requested specific information from each manufacturer about what is included in its price and the terms of the purchase agreements it uses. The manufacturers we surveyed for this report used one of six standard agreements to cover shipping and insurance (see table 2). We also asked multiple purchasers about the shipping and insurance costs they have incurred when purchasing ARVs. While systematic evidence was not available, the organizations we spoke with provided estimates ranging from 3 to 15 percent additional cost for shipping and insurance for large-scale ARV purchases. One NGO that was purchasing ARVs under the Emergency Plan told us that purchasing the same ARV product through two different distribution channels—one directly from the manufacturer with shipping and insurance costs included in the price and one through a distributor that added those costs to its price—made no appreciable difference in the final cost of the product. We also found, after reviewing responses to our survey, that manufacturers of both original and generic products used a range of purchase agreements, both more and less inclusive of shipping and insurance costs. Other factors that may contribute to the total cost of ARVs to a specific treatment program, such as taxes and distribution surcharges, are beyond the scope of this report. To examine the efforts of the Coordinator’s Office to expand the selection of quality-assured ARV products provided under the Emergency Plan to the focus countries, we reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and guidance from which the plan’s quality assurance and patent requirements arise. We interviewed officials from the Coordinator’s Office and USAID regarding how they interpret these laws, regulations, and guidance and how they apply these requirements to the provision of ARVs under the plan. We also interviewed officials from the Coordinator’s Office regarding their efforts to address potential barriers to expansion. Lastly, because the Coordinator’s Office is working with FDA to support the ability of additional ARV manufacturers to meet the Emergency Plan’s quality assurance requirement, we interviewed officials from FDA regarding these efforts. We surveyed the following 13 manufacturers during June and July 2004 to obtain price quotes for the focus countries for the ARVs used to build the WHO-recommended first-line regimens: Aurobindo Pharma Limited (Aurobindo) Boehringer Ingelheim (BI) Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMS) Cipla Limited (Cipla) Combino Pharm Cristalia Produtos Quimicos Farmaceuticos LTDA (Cristalia) Far-Manguinhos FIOCRUZ Ministry of Health (Far-Manguinhos) GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Government Pharmaceutical Organization Thailand (GPO) Hetero Drugs Limited (Hetero) Merck & Co., Inc. (Merck) Ranbaxy Laboratories Limited (Ranbaxy) Strides Arcolab Limited (Strides) The price per person per year for each ARV product—stavudine (d4T), zidovudine (ZDV), lamivudine (3TC), nevirapine (NVP), and efavirenz (EFV)—is shown in figures 3 and 4. Figure 3 shows prices quoted for single-ARV products, and figure 4 shows prices quoted for fixed-dose combination (FDC) ARV products. For each product we indicate the type of standard agreement used to cover shipping and insurance charges and whether the manufacturer indicated that the price quoted was negotiable or based on a specific purchase scenario (see figure notes a, b, and c). Both figures also show which ARV products are provided under the Emergency Plan, which additional products are provided under the other initiatives, and which products are generally available to the focus countries but not provided under either the Emergency Plan or the other initiatives, as of December 2004.

In 2003, the Congress authorized the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, a 5-year, $15 billion initiative under the Office of the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator. The Emergency Plan focuses on 15 developing countries, with a goal of supporting treatment for 2 million people. Treatment regimens use multiple antiretroviral medications (ARV), which can be original or generic. Fixed-dose combinations (FDC) combine two or three ARVs into one pill. Questions have been raised about whether the plan is providing ARVs preferred by the focus countries at reasonable prices. GAO compared the selection of ARVs provided under the plan with that provided under other major treatment initiatives, compared the prices of those selections, and determined what the Coordinator's Office is doing to expand the plan's selection of quality-assured lower-priced ARVs. The Emergency Plan provides a smaller selection of recommended first-line ARVs than other major HIV/AIDS treatment initiatives in developing countries. The plan's selection includes six original ARV products--the only ARVs that have met the plan's quality assurance requirement--and does not include some FDCs that are preferred by most of the focus countries because they can simplify treatment. In contrast, the other initiatives provide a selection that in addition to the six original ARVs includes generic ARVs and more of the preferred FDCs. The original ARVs provided under the plan are generally higher in price than the generic ARVs provided under the other initiatives. The differences in the prices, quoted to GAO during June and July 2004 by 13 manufacturers, ranged from $11 less to $328 more per person per year for original ARVs than for the lowest-priced corresponding generic ARVs provided under the other initiatives. At these prices, three of the four first-line regimens recommended by the World Health Organization could be built for less--from $40 to $368 less depending on the regimen--with the generic ARVs provided under the other initiatives than with the original ARVs provided under the plan. Such differences in price per person per year could translate into hundreds of millions of dollars of additional expense when considered on the scale of the plan's goal of treating 2 million people by the end of 2008. The Coordinator's Office has worked to expand the selection of quality-assured ARVs--including FDCs and lower-priced generics--that it provides to the focus countries under the plan. The selection of ARVs available under the plan is primarily limited by its quality assurance requirement. The Coordinator's Office is working with manufacturers to take the steps necessary for more ARVs to meet this requirement. However, if generic ARVs meet the plan's quality assurance requirement, a statutory prohibition on the purchase of any medication manufactured outside the United States if the manufacture of that medication in the United States would be covered by a valid U.S. patent could become a barrier to expansion because all ARVs are currently under U.S. patents. Unless the patent holders for ARVs that have met the plan's quality requirement give permission or the Coordinator's Office exercises its authority to purchase these products notwithstanding the patent requirement, the selection of ARVs provided under the Emergency Plan may not expand rapidly enough to address the AIDS emergency."}

Labor administers its programs through state workforce agencies in each state. Within Labor, VETS administers five employment programs targeted to veterans. VETS provides grants to states to support state workforce agency staff who serve veterans through the Disabled Veterans’ Outreach Program, Employment Representative Program, and TAP. Through the Homeless Veterans’ Reintegration Program and VWIP, VETS also provides funding to organizations that serve eligible veterans, including nonprofits. Labor oversees these programs through federal officials stationed in each region, as well as a Director of Veterans’ Employment and Training located in each state. Within VA, the Vocational Rehabilitation Program provides employment services to certain veterans with disabilities. VA offers the program in 56 regional offices and 169 satellite offices. The program has about 1,000 staff, including vocational rehabilitation counselors, employment coordinators, support staff, and managers. Rehabilitation counselors determine entitlement to services. In addition to its programs administered by VETS, Labor offers employment and training services to the general population—including veterans. These services are administered by the Employment and Training Administration (ETA). First, ETA administers the ES Program, which provides a national system of public employment services to all individuals seeking employment. ES provides services such as job search, labor market information, and job referrals to the public, including job seekers and employers. ETA carries out its ES Program through state workforce agencies. ETA also administers the WIA Adult and Dislocated Worker programs, which provide a broad range of services including job search assistance, skill assessment, and training for eligible individuals. When funds are limited, the WIA Adult Program is to give priority for intensive and training services to low income adults or those on public assistance. In program year 2010, 94,629 veterans exited from the WIA Adult Program. WIA’s Dislocated Worker Program generally targets adults who have been terminated or laid off from employment and meet other criteria. In program year 2010, 58,350 veterans exited from the WIA Dislocated Worker Program. Federal law requires VETS, ES, and WIA Adult and Dislocated Worker programs to offer their services through the one-stop system—which includes centers through which job seekers can access a range of employment and training programs. Two of VETS’ programs—Disabled Veterans’ Outreach and Employment Representative programs—have about 2,100 staff who work primarily in local one-stop centers. Federal law also requires other Labor-funded programs—including ES and WIA Adult and Dislocated Worker programs—to give veterans priority over the general population when they seek services (referred to as priority of service). VETS and ETA jointly monitor compliance with this requirement. Most ETA and VETS programs report the same performance measures, known as the common measures. They include percentage of program exiters who have obtained employment (entered employment rate), percentage retaining employment for 6 months after exiting the program (employment retention rate), and 6-month average earnings of program exiters (average earnings). For each of these, Labor establishes annual performance goals. VA reports an employment rehabilitation rate as a measure of performance for the Vocational Rehabilitation Program. A “rehabilitated” veteran is one who successfully completes a rehabilitation plan and is equipped with the required skills and tools needed to obtain and maintain suitable employment (i.e., employment that is consistent with the veteran’s skills, aptitudes, and interests). DOD works with Labor and VA to provide transition assistance workshops as a part of TAP. In addition, DOD helps Guard and Reserve members obtain civilian employment though its operation of several programs, including the Yellow Ribbon Program and ESGR. The Yellow Ribbon Program serves National Guard and Reserve members and their families by hosting events that provide information on employment opportunities, health care, education/training opportunities, finances, and legal benefits. The ESGR is a nationwide network of volunteers who address unemployment and underemployment of Guard and Reserve members through participation in employment-related events. As shown in figure 1, the six federal employment and training programs targeted to veterans offer similar types of employment and training services. assessment, job search or job placement activities, and job readiness skills training. Other services available from more than one of these programs include the development of job opportunities, job referrals, and occupational and vocational training, among others. Labor and VA have established a framework to coordinate their employment and training programs. In 2005, Labor and VA signed an interagency memorandum of agreement that outlines how the agencies plan to coordinate the Vocational Rehabilitation and Disabled Veterans’ Outreach and Employment Representative programs to serve disabled veterans, respectively. The agencies have also collaboratively created an interagency handbook that delineates roles and responsibilities and establishes a referral process between the Disabled Veterans’ Outreach and the Vocational Rehabilitation programs. To assist field staff, the interagency handbook also provides standard language and guidance for agreements between local Labor and VA offices. As a result, local offices from both agencies can tailor the standard agreement language to meet local situations. The handbook has not been updated since 2008. Labor and VA have provided staff with training on the handbook and formed a group to monitor coordination. Labor and VA conducted a national training webinar based on the interagency handbook for both agencies’ staff after it was published, have made virtual trainings available since 2009, and provided technical assistance to staff. To monitor the coordination activities outlined in the interagency handbook, Labor and VA created a Joint Work Group. According to Labor and VA officials, this group recently discussed and agreed on a plan to review one-third of local agreements made between Labor and VA field locations annually. Labor and VA have collected information that could be useful in updating the handbook. The Joint Work Group recently conducted its first in-depth review of states’ implementation of the handbook since it was established in 2008. According to Labor and VA officials, the Joint Work Group electronically surveyed the VA employment coordinators in all 56 VA Regional Offices and the 52 state-level directors of the Disabled While Veterans’ Outreach and Employment Representative programs. VA officials stated that they are currently reviewing the survey results to determine if the handbook needs to be updated, Labor officials told us told us they believe the handbook needs to be updated. We have reported previously that agencies need to create means to monitor agreements and related guidance periodically to keep them current and to identify areas for improvement. Our interviews with Labor and VA officials identified certain challenges with meeting desired program outcomes resulting, in part, from sections of the handbook that are subject to misunderstanding or provide insufficient guidance. They pertain to incorporating labor market information into rehabilitation plans and finding “suitable employment” for participants. The first challenge with referrals as outlined in the handbook involved ensuring that participants’ rehabilitation plans prepared them for jobs that existed in their local area. According to the referral process outlined in the interagency handbook and by agency officials (see fig. 3), there are two main referral points from the Vocational Rehabilitation Program to Labor’s Disabled Veterans’ Outreach Program staff: (1) before the participant’s rehabilitation plan is completed and (2) after the participant has completed a rehabilitation plan and been deemed job-ready, or ready for employment, by VA staff. Disabled Veterans’ Outreach Program staff may provide participants with labor market information or other employment assistance at the first referral point and are required to at the second referral point. While VA officials in four of the six states we reviewed reported that they connected participants with Labor staff to receive labor market information and other employment consulting, only three of these states reported that they did this early in the process before the rehabilitation plan is completed. In two other states, VA officials reported they understood that they were supposed to refer participants to Labor only after they had completed rehabilitation plans and were job-ready, essentially skipping the first step where labor market information may have been useful. VA officials reported that labor market information may be provided to participants through small group presentations with Disabled Veterans’ Outreach staff. For their part, state-level Labor officials noted that job placement was more challenging for Disabled Veterans’ Outreach Program staff when participants’ rehabilitation plans were developed without labor market information. In such cases, according to Labor officials, Disabled Veterans’ Outreach Program staff were sometimes working with plans focused on training in occupations not available in the local labor market—in effect using programs’ funds to prepare participants for jobs that do not exist in their local area. According to Labor officials, this made it more difficult for participants to have successful employment outcomes. The second challenge with referrals as outlined in the handbook involved ensuring that job-ready participants are directed to “suitable employment.” When veterans are referred to the Disabled Veterans’ Outreach Program at the job-ready stage, Disabled Veterans’ Outreach Program and VA staff are supposed to coordinate to find “suitable employment,” or employment that will not aggravate the participant’s disability and follows the participant’s rehabilitation plan. State-level Labor officials noted that, in some cases, veterans may choose to accept jobs they want or need but that do not fit in their employment or rehabilitation plan. Such jobs do not count as “suitable employment” for VA because the job may, in the long run, aggravate the veteran’s disability. While the handbook says agencies are to coordinate to achieve “suitable employment,” it does not explicitly say how Disabled Veterans’ Outreach Program and VA staff should deal with situations where a veteran’s financial need or preferences do not align with the goal of suitable employment. Absent guidance about how to navigate such situations, program staff may be working at cross purposes and program participants may be taking employment they cannot retain in the long run. This employment, in turn, may make a veteran’s disability worse and may make finding future employment more difficult. One official stressed that having labor market information incorporated into rehabilitation plans early may help veterans avoid taking a job that does not match their plans. DOD is expanding its employment assistance to National Guard and Reserve members, but does not have employment service agreements with Labor or VA beyond an agreement for TAP. In fiscal year 2011, DOD launched an employment assistance initiative under the Yellow Ribbon program, known as the Employment Initiative Program, that provides job workshops and job fairs to connect Guard and Reserve members to employers. The Employment Initiative Program under the Yellow Ribbon Program has hired and placed 56 “Employment Transition Coordinators” covering all 50 states, territories, and the District of Columbia who provide service members employment assistance among other services. The Yellow Ribbon Program has also held 27 job fairs since the beginning of fiscal year 2012. To support the job fairs, the Yellow Ribbon Employment Initiative Program leverages the network of 4,900 volunteers who are affiliated with ESGR. These volunteers also provide resume-building workshops, mock interviews, and career counseling. DOD also recently testified that it is leading, per a White House directive, a new Credentialing and Licensing Task Force to address gaps between military occupational specialties and civilian licensing requirements. DOD reported that this additional employment assistance is needed to support Guard and Reserve members who may not meet veteran status requirements necessary for participating in Labor or VA programs. Most of the ESGR representatives we spoke with also anticipated the program would continue to provide employment-related services. Although DOD has established these employment assistance services, no agreement or formal mechanism has been established for coordinating Specifically, them with Labor’s and VA’s veterans’ employment efforts. there is no interagency agreement for coordinating employment services beyond DOD’s and Labor’s work on the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA) and TAP. Although DOD and VA have an agreement, it focuses on connecting service members who are leaving the military for civilian life with vocational rehabilitation services. Further, ESGR has no formal mechanism for identifying and referring eligible veterans to the Disabled Veterans’ Outreach and Employment Representative programs. We have previously reported that agencies with common goals and programs can enhance and sustain collaboration by creating mutually agreed-upon strategies to help align agencies’ activities and leverage resources to meet their common goals. Currently, ESGR in the states we reviewed reported informal coordination—such as meetings and co-participation in job fairs—with Labor-funded programs. For example, a DOD official noted that the Washington ESGR used a grant to hire 13 employment transition counselors in areas that needed service not provided by the state workforce agencies. According to this official, this ultimately increased impact while saving funds. However, this informal coordination may be affecting Labor resources and confusing employers. According to Labor officials, Disabled Veterans’ Outreach Program staff participation at DOD job fairs reduces the amount of time available for their primary duties, such as providing intensive services to program participants. A variety of officials from the states we reviewed also said that some employers were confused regarding which agency was leading the initiatives to employ veterans. Employment outcomes for veterans’ programs have generally not regained levels attained prior to the recent recession. (See appendix II for performance outcomes for each veterans’ program as well as veteran participants served by WIA Adult and ES programs over a 5-year period.) From program years 2007 to 2009—which spanned July 2007 to June 2010—most Labor veterans’ programs that have outcome measures saw a decline in their entered employment rate and a slight decline in their 6-month job retention rates. In program year 2010, all programs except VWIP had lower entered employment and employment retention rates than in program year 2006, prior to the recession. The number of VA Vocational Rehabilitation Program participants who were rehabilitated to employment has also declined from 9,225 participants in fiscal year 2006, to 7,975 participants in fiscal year 2011. Officials at both VA and Labor attributed the declines to various causes. For example, VA officials attribute some of the decline in the number of participants rehabilitated to the establishment of the Post-9/11 GI Bill Program. The Post-9/11 GI Bill Program is an education benefit administered by VA for individuals who served on active duty after September 10, 2001. According to VA officials, VA’s Vocational Rehabilitation Program lost some participants who had begun rehabilitation efforts but switched to the Post-9/11 GI Bill Program. They switched, according to VA officials, because the GI Bill Program provided a more generous living stipend than the Vocational Rehabilitation Program. At the same time, Labor officials identified national economic conditions as the primary reason for the drop in performance of its programs. In addition to the decline in outcomes for veterans’ programs, veterans participating in broader workforce programs also achieved somewhat lesser outcomes than those in the general population. (See app. II, figs. 7 and 8.) From program years 2007 to 2009, the WIA Adult and ES programs saw declines in measures for the percentage of participants who entered employment and the percentage who retained their employment for 6 months. These measures have generally rebounded slightly in 2010, although they have generally not regained levels attained prior to the recent recession. Since 2006, veterans have had slightly lower entered employment outcomes than those for all participants using the ES Program. In the WIA Adult Program, veterans’ employment and retention outcomes have been slightly lower than outcomes for all participants since 2009. Further, between 2006 and 2010, employment and retention outcomes were similar but slightly lower for veterans who worked with Disabled Veterans’ Outreach and Employment Representative program staff, in comparison with outcomes for veterans in the WIA Adult Program. According to Labor officials, some of these differences in outcomes may be explained by differences in characteristics of the populations served. They noted that veteran participants in the WIA Adult Program are more likely to be over the age of 55 than nonveteran participants, and historically, older workers have achieved lower outcomes in both the WIA Adult and ES programs. In addition, Labor officials stated that because the Disabled Veterans’ Outreach and Employment Representative programs serve veterans who face barriers to employment, their outcomes are likely to be lower than outcomes for veterans who are job- ready and nonveterans served by the WIA Adult or ES programs. While Labor reports some data on veterans’ program outcomes, it does not report the extent to which each of these programs is achieving its established performance goals. Labor provides Congress an annual veterans’ program report that provides certain performance information, such as the number of disabled and recently separated veterans who received intensive services. For this annual report, however, Labor is not required to report program outcomes in relation to performance goals. Labor sets annual performance goals for its veterans’ programs, but it is not reporting the results relative to those goals. In previous fiscal years, Labor included some of this information for the Disabled Veterans’ Outreach Program, Employment Representative Program, Homeless Veterans’ Reintegration Program, and VWIP in its agencywide performance report. However, in fiscal year 2011, it only reported aggregate goals for three programs, rather than the separate outcomes and goals it maintains for each of these veterans’ programs. In contrast, Labor’s website on general employment programs—WIA Adult and ES— includes both performance goals and outcomes. This information includes a national average for each measure comparing goals against performance, as well as each state’s negotiated goals and performance against those goals. Further, VA reports both an employment outcome and associated goal for the Vocational Rehabilitation Program. We have previously reported that relevant performance information should be reported both internally and externally in order to maintain accountability and transparency for achieving results. Without information on how the outcomes for each veterans’ program compare against their annual performance goals, Congress and other key stakeholders lack essential information needed to assess the performance of the program. Labor is working to implement new performance measures which have been mandated by the VOW to Hire Heroes Act of 2011 (VOW Act).Specifically, the act requires Labor to measure participants’ median earnings 90 and 180 days after a participant stops using a veterans’ program. Prior to the VOW Act, Labor only measured participants’ average earnings over 6 months after participants stop using a veterans’ program, for those who retained employment. The VOW Act also requires Labor to track the percentage of participants obtaining a certificate, degree, diploma, licensure, or industry-recognized credential after participating in its veterans’ programs. VA also plans to collect additional information about its programs’ outcomes. VA officials said that they decided to track the number, in addition to the rate, of veterans rehabilitated to employment, because the employment rehabilitation rate can fluctuate based on a number of factors. employment in fiscal year 2012. VA officials said that this is the first fiscal year this goal has been used. Consequently, VA has not yet reported its performance against this goal. VA has set a national goal to rehabilitate 9,000 veterans to In addition, the Vocational Rehabilitation Program has established a working group to develop new national performance measures. According to VA officials, the new measures will focus on the middle of the rehabilitation process, because a veteran can be in the program from 1 to 6 years, with an average of 4 years. The measures that already exist focus on the front-end (e.g., timeliness of services) and back-end (e.g., outcomes). Although the new measures have not been finalized, VA plans to implement them in fiscal year 2014, contingent on resources to make changes to the program’s database structure to capture data and report on new measures. For example, the rehabilitation rate can be negatively affected by veterans who choose to stop participating before completing a rehabilitation plan. participant outcomes, these studies can be difficult and potentially expensive to conduct. Impact evaluations can be designed in several ways, but fall into two basic design categories: experimental, using random assignment, and quasiexperimental. Quasiexperimental designs use a comparison group that is not created with random assignment. While Labor has not conducted impact evaluations, it has conducted research that examines veterans’ outcomes in relation to their characteristics and has other studies planned or under way (see table 2). These studies, though, have limitations. For example, Labor’s 2007 study of veterans’ outcomes covered five states, and its findings cannot be generalized to all states. In addition, in the study conducted on the Homeless Veterans’ Reintegration Program, researchers lacked access to participant-level data and consequently could not determine whether certain veterans’ characteristics were associated with positive or negative employment outcomes for the program as a whole. Labor is funding an evaluation of the pilot of the redesigned TAP, but has not conducted any studies or evaluations of VWIP in the last 10 years. While Labor has not conducted impact evaluations of its veterans’ employment and training programs, it is funding an impact evaluation of the WIA Adult and Dislocated Worker programs, which is planned to be completed in 2015. This study will include a supplemental study of veterans using the public workforce system, but this portion of the study, as described in the draft research plan for the study, is not an impact evaluation and cannot determine the extent to which veterans’ outcomes are due to the services they receive in the public workforce system. Similar to Labor, VA has not conducted evaluations that allow it to determine if veterans’ employment outcomes result from program services or if they are the result of other factors. As shown in table 3, VA has funded research that examines data related to the completion of veterans’ rehabilitation plans and participant outcomes. For example, VA is funding a longitudinal study of Vocational Rehabilitation Program participants and has issued two reports on the study. The most recent report begins to analyze VA administrative data to determine characteristics associated with completing rehabilitation or discontinuing the program within the first 2 years. However, the report states that its findings thus far are only descriptive and may have little or no predictive value. VA plans further study of emerging trends. VA also plans additional follow-up of program participants in its case management process. Specifically, the agency plans to send a questionnaire to collect information on whether former participants are employed and whether they need additional services. Given that the number of service members transitioning to civilian employment is expected to increase and the number of veterans with service-connected disabilities is on the rise, Labor’s Disabled Veterans’ Outreach Program is likely to see an increased demand for its services. Labor attempts to maximize the employment services for those veterans who need them most. However, we found that there is a need for clearer guidance to states on how to prioritize services and additional monitoring of their implementation of such guidance. Labor said it is developing such guidance but has not completed it, and has tested new monitoring protocols in six states but has not finalized them. It is encouraging that Labor has these efforts under way, and it will be important for the department to complete both efforts. Labor and VA both provide employment and training programs targeted to veterans. Although Labor and VA have a handbook governing their coordination with respect to employment and training for veterans, it has not been updated since 2008. Our work identified sections of the handbook that provided insufficient guidance, resulting in situations where the practices of one department presented difficulties for the other in meeting desired program outcomes. At the same time, DOD has begun expanding employment assistance initiatives to segments of the veteran population, such as National Guard and Reserve members, some of whom may also meet Labor and VA veterans’ programs eligibility requirements. However, Labor and VA’s agreement does not govern their coordination with DOD’s programs. Without an agreement that includes all three departments, efforts to help veterans find employment are at greater risk of being fragmented or overlapping, and may not leverage federal resources. Finally, the federal investment in veterans’ employment and training programs warrants greater transparency with regard to the extent to which these programs are meeting their performance goals and whether outcomes are attributable to program participation and not other factors. Labor reports substantial information on outcomes for these programs. However, Labor is not consistently reporting the extent to which outcomes for each of its veterans’ programs are achieving the specific performance goals that were established for these programs. This stands in contrast to the level of performance reporting by Labor for its WIA Adult and ES programs, which identifies the extent to which outcomes in these programs are achieving performance goals. In addition, while the federal government makes a substantial investment in Labor and VA programs to achieve employment outcomes for veterans, neither agency has conducted studies to see if these outcomes can be attributed to the programs’ services, instead of other factors. As a result, Congress and other stakeholders lack essential information to assess how well these programs are performing and hold federal agencies accountable for achieving results. We are making the following four recommendations based on our review: To increase the effectiveness of coordination efforts, the Secretaries of Labor and VA should incorporate additional guidance to address the two problem areas we identified into any update to the interagency handbook that governs their coordination for veterans’ employment and training programs. To ensure government resources are used efficiently, the Secretaries of Labor, VA, and DOD should incorporate DOD’s employment assistance initiatives into the agreements that guide interagency coordination. To enhance transparency and accountability for achieving results, the Secretary of Labor should consistently report both performance goals and associated performance outcomes for each of its veterans’ employment and training programs. To assess veterans’ employment programs’ effectiveness, Secretaries of Labor and VA should, to the extent possible, determine the extent to which veterans’ employment outcomes result from program participation or are the result of other factors. We provided a draft of this report to the Department of Labor, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and the Department of Defense for review and comment. Written comments from Labor, VA, and DOD appear in appendixes III, IV, and V, respectively. In addition to the comments discussed below, Labor, VA, and DOD provided technical comments that we incorporated where appropriate. All three agencies generally concurred with our recommendations. Both Labor and VA said they would work to enhance coordination with each other with respect to the guidance in their interagency handbook. All three agencies said they would work to ensure interagency coordination included DOD. In response to our recommendation on reporting program performance, Labor said it will explore ways to increase consistency and transparency of the information it reports. In response to our recommendation to Labor and VA regarding assessing program effectiveness, VA concurred and Labor did not specify whether or not it agreed. Labor said that it is committed to robust program evaluation and that each agency, including VETS, develops an annual evaluation agenda and sets priorities. Labor said it has a multi-component agenda for evaluating services to veterans and cited some current studies, such as a study of the TAP program and a statistical analysis of services received by veterans and their outcomes using the public workforce system. We think obtaining information about the effectiveness of veterans' programs is important because such information can assist Congress in assessing program results and identifying areas where adjustments may be needed. As Labor and VA conduct research on program outcomes, it will be important for them to consider approaches that would enable them to separate the impact of their programs from other factors that might influence participants’ outcomes. As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the report date. At that time, we will send copies of this report to appropriate congressional committees, the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, the Secretary of Defense, and other interested parties. In addition, this report will be available at no charge on GAO’s website at http://www.gao.gov. If you or your staff have any questions about this report, please contact me at (202) 512-7215 or sherrilla@gao.gov. Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. GAO staff who made key contributions to this report are listed in appendix VI. In a January 2011 report, we identified six employment and training programs administered by the Department of Labor (Labor) and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) targeted toward veterans as a part of a larger review of all federal employment and training programs. We defined an employment and training program as one specifically designed to enhance the specific job skills of individuals in order to increase their employability, identify job opportunities, or help job seekers obtain employment. Labor oversees five of these programs for veterans: (1) the Disabled Veterans’ Outreach Program, (2) the Homeless Veterans’ Reintegration Program, (3) the Local Veterans’ Employment Representative Program (Employment Representative Program), (4) the Transition Assistance Program (TAP), and (5) the Veterans’ Workforce Investment Program (VWIP). VA oversees the sixth program called the Vocational Rehabilitation & Employment Program (Vocational Rehabilitation Program).requirements, and outcome measures that these programs had in common. Our 2011 report identified services, eligibility For this report, we focused on the six programs identified in our January 2011 report in more detail and examined (1) the extent to which federal veterans’ employment and training programs vary in terms of the services they deliver and the veterans who receive them; (2) the extent to which federal agencies coordinate these programs; and (3) what is known about the performance of these programs. Our approach overall involved reviewing relevant literature, relevant federal laws and regulations, and analyzing Labor and VA data on veteran participants, services provided, and performance. We also interviewed federal Labor, VA, and Department of Defense (DOD) agency officials who govern agency policy at the national level and key stakeholder associations. To determine the extent to which these programs vary in terms of the services they deliver and the veterans receive them, we analyzed Labor and VA data on services provided and veteran participants, agency annual reports, budget justifications, and other agency policy documents. To assess the reliability of Labor’s data on services to veterans in one- stops, we reviewed available information about the data and conducted interviews with officials knowledgeable about the data. We determined that these data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes. We reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations to determine program eligibility requirements. We interviewed agency officials, veterans’ service organizations, and workforce associations to better understand why programs may serve similar populations with similar services. We reviewed state plans and interviewed state-level Labor, VA, and DOD staff for our case study states. In addition, we conducted six case studies at the state level. In each state, we reviewed state plans and interviewed Labor and VA officials assigned to the state or the region. We also interviewed the Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve (ESGR) chairperson operating in the state. These are federal representatives of DOD, but not federal employees, as they are volunteers. In addition, we interviewed the directors of state workforce agencies, which carry out veterans’ employment and training programs using federal funds. Finally, within three states, we interviewed the Director of Veterans Affairs in each state, a state government official responsible for veterans’ programs and services. To select states, for all 50 states, we determined whether each was high, medium, or low on the following characteristics: the percentage of veteran population, amount of program expenditures, program performance (veterans’ entered employment rate), and veterans’ unemployment rate. We selected one state from each of Labor’s six regions to achieve variation on the above characteristics, as well as diversity in terms of geography and state size. These states were Florida, Massachusetts, Ohio, Oregon, Texas, and Virginia. To determine the extent to which federal agencies coordinate these programs, we reviewed key agency agreements and guidance, and used the same six case studies at the state level, and interviewed federal and state agency officials and associations representing the interests of veterans. In examining coordination we included not only the five programs indicated above but also three Labor programs available to the general population: the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) Adult and Dislocated Worker and the Employment Service (ES) programs. We also included programs recently begun by DOD: the Yellow Ribbon and ESGR programs. We reviewed memoranda of understanding, agency guidance, and other policy documents related to collaborative efforts among federal agencies. We also interviewed National Veterans’ Training Institute officials to discuss the extent to which required training for outreach specialists and employment representatives includes instruction on how to foster inter- and intra-agency coordination. In our case studies in six states, we interviewed state-level officials from the Veterans’ Employment and Training Services, as well as VA officials. We also interviewed ESGR officials and Directors of State Offices of Veterans Affairs. To understand stakeholders’ views on coordination, we interviewed officials from workforce associations and veterans’ service organizations. We also used data from the Defense Manpower Data Center to determine the number of Guard and Reserve members that may meet the eligibility requirements for Labor veterans’ programs and VA’s Vocational Rehabilitation Program. We assessed the reliability of information on Guard and Reserve members’ length of service and disability status, and determined that these data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report. To determine what is known about program performance, we analyzed relevant federal laws and regulations, and agency documents, and interviewed agency officials and stakeholders. We reviewed agency reports on veterans’ programs containing information on program outcomes and agency goals established for these programs, such as Labor’s annual report to Congress on veterans’ programs and agencywide performance reports. We assessed Labor and V\n\n### Summary:\n\n", "answer": "In fiscal year 2011, the federal government spent an estimated $1.2 billion on six veterans' employment and training programs, serving about 880,000 participants. Labor administers five of these programs and VA administers one. Despite these efforts, the unemployment rate for veterans who have recently separated from the military is higher than that for the civilian population. The number of service members transitioning to the civilian workforce is expected to increase. In response to a request, this report examines (1) the extent to which federal veterans' employment and training programs vary in services they deliver and veterans who receive them; (2) the extent to which federal agencies coordinate programs; and (3) what is known about the performance of these programs. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed agency data, policy documents, and relevant federal laws and regulations, reports, and studies, and interviewed federal and regional officials and state officials in six states selected to achieve geographic and demographic diversity. In examining coordination, GAO included in its review employment assistance DOD provides to Guard and Reserve members. The six federal veterans' employment and training programs offer similar employment services, but largely target different groups. Among these programs, the Department of Labor's (Labor) Disabled Veterans' Outreach Program has the greatest potential for overlap with other veterans' programs and Labor's employment programs for the general population. Federal law governing the Disabled Veterans' Outreach Program makes all veterans who meet the broad definition of \"eligible veteran\" eligible for its services, but gives disabled veterans and economically and educationally disadvantaged veterans the highest priority for services. However, Labor's guidance does not provide states--who administer the program using federal funds--criteria for prioritizing services. The law also generally requires that program staff provide participants with intensive services (e.g., individual employment plans), but Labor's data indicate that nationally 28 percent of participants received such services in 2011. In explaining this statistic, Labor officials said one possible explanation was that staff are enrolling people who do not need intensive services. Labor said it plans to develop guidance on prioritizing services, and it also has a six-state pilot to improve monitoring, but neither of these efforts has been completed. In 2008, Labor and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) compiled a handbook intended to guide the roles of their respective staff in coordinating services to disabled veterans; however, they have not updated the handbook nor included related Department of Defense (DOD) employment initiatives in their interagency agreements. GAO's interviews with VA and Labor officials identified certain challenges with meeting desired program outcomes resulting, in part, from sections of the handbook that provide insufficient guidance or are subject to misunderstanding. For example, the handbook says Labor and VA are to coordinate to achieve \"suitable employment\"--employment that follows the veteran's rehabilitation plan and does not aggravate the disability. However, it does not explicitly say how staff should navigate situations where a veteran's financial need or preferences do not align with this goal. In such instances, program staff may work at cross purposes and veterans may accept jobs that do not count as suitable employment. Further, DOD is expanding its employment assistance, but does not have an interagency agreement to coordinate with Labor and VA efforts. Absent an updated handbook and integration of DOD into the coordination framework, there is increased risk for poor coordination and program overlap. While available performance information shows that most programs' outcomes are below pre-2007 levels, the information Labor reports and the research it has conducted make it difficult to know the extent to which each program is achieving its annual performance goals. Veterans' employment outcomes for programs administered by both Labor and VA have generally not regained levels seen before the recession that began in 2007, which is similar to employment programs for the general population. In reporting performance, Labor does not relate employment outcomes to individual program goals. In contrast, Labor reports outcomes and goals for its other workforce programs aimed at the general population. Moreover, while both agencies have studies completed or under way, neither has conducted impact evaluations that assess program effectiveness to determine whether outcomes are attributable to program participation and not other factors. As a result, Congress and other key stakeholders lack essential information needed to assess each program's performance. GAO is making four recommendations aimed at improving the guidance provided to staff in the coordination handbook, integrating DOD into the interagency coordination framework, improving agency reporting on achievement of program performance goals, and assessing program effectiveness. GAO is making four recommendations aimed at improving the guidance provided to staff in the coordination handbook, integrating DOD into the interagency coordination framework, improving agency reporting on achievement of program performance goals, and assessing program effectiveness."}

DOD recognizes that portions of its support structure are inefficient and continue to absorb a large share of the defense budget. To the extent support costs can be reduced, available future defense dollars could be used for modernization or other defense priorities. The Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) requested that DSB identify DOD activities that the private sector could do more efficiently and to determine the expected savings from outsourcing. DSB, a civilian advisory board to DOD, issued two reports in 1996 addressing outsourcing and other opportunities for substantially reducing DOD support services. The first focused solely on outsourcing and privatization issues. The second, incorporating findings from the earlier report, had a broader scope that included other methods for reducing infrastructure costs. In preparation for the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR), OSD’s Program Analysis and Evaluation (PA&E) directorate assessed the DSB’s savings estimates from the second report. Our analysis also focused on the second report’s findings and recommendations. The first DSB task force concluded that DOD could realize savings of 30 to 40 percent of logistics costs and achieve broad improvements in service delivery and responsiveness by outsourcing support services traditionally done by government personnel. The report cited evidence from the Center for Naval Analyses (CNA) public-private competition studies of commercial and depot maintenance activities. The Board also noted that an Outsourcing Institute study found that the private sector saved about 10 to 15 percent by outsourcing but that the public sector savings from outsourcing would be higher because of the inefficiency of government service organizations. The DSB task force stated that an aggressive DOD outsourcing initiative could generate savings ranging from $7 billion to $12 billion annually by fiscal year 2002. Building on the earlier study, DSB’s second task force report provided a new vision wherein DOD would only provide warfighting, direct battlefield support, policy- and decision-making, and oversight activities. All other activities would be done by the private sector. DSB said that DOD would need to make an investment of about $6 billion but would ultimately save about $30 billion annually by the year 2002, primarily through outsourcing support functions. Of these $30 billion in annual savings, $6 billion was to come from CONUS logistics infrastructure activities, which DSB defined as including inventory control points, distribution depots, maintenance depots, and installation supply and repair. About $4.2 billion of the savings would be achieved by outsourcing these activities; the remaining $1.8-billion savings would be achieved through improvements in inventory management practices and equipment reliability. Table 1 shows a breakout of the estimated logistics infrastructure savings. According to the DSB estimates, the $6-billion savings represents an approximate 40-percent reduction in the $14 billion the Board estimated DOD spends annually for CONUS logistics activities. According to a DSB task force member, estimates for the cost of installation supply and repair activities were unavailable. Therefore, the group used $14 billion as a rough estimate to approximate total CONUS logistics cost, not including activities already contracted out. Although we were unable to substantiate those numbers, the data that is available indicates that DSB’s estimate of $14 billion for CONUS logistics costs is conservative. For example, the Navy has reported that more than $8.5 billion of Navy resources was applied in fiscal year 1996 to maintenance programs in support of fleet ships and aircraft. The report also stated that to gain economies and achieve significant savings, DOD needs to consider dramatic changes in the way it does business. DSB said the Department must get out of the material management/distribution and repair business by expanding contractor logistics support to all fielded weapon systems and by expanding the use of “prime vendors” for all commodities. Contractor logistics support, which relies on a contractor to provide long-term, total life-cycle logistics support, combines depot-level maintenance with wholesale and selected retail material management functions. Under the “prime vendor” concept, DOD would rely on a single vendor to buy, warehouse, and distribute inventory to the customer as needed, thus removing the Defense Logistics Agency and the services from their present middleman role. Our reviews of best practices within the private sector and ongoing work at DOD indicate that DOD has significant opportunities for reducing logistics costs and improving performance by changing its business processes. This work also indicates that determining the most cost-effective processes to use requires an evaluation of costs and benefits of each situation. These findings are consistent with the general theme of the DSB’s reports that opportunities exist for savings in the operation of DOD’s logistics support activities. However, DSB focused on outsourcing, while our work has focused first on reengineering and streamlining, and outsourcing where appropriate and more cost-effective. Over the past several years, DOD has considered a number of actions to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of its logistics system. As with the private sector, such actions should include using highly accurate information systems, consolidating certain activities, employing various process streamlining methods, and outsourcing. For example, defense maintenance depots have about 40-percent excess capacity, and we have advocated consolidating workloads to take advantage of economies of scale and eliminate unnecessary duplication. Consolidating workloads from two closing depots would allow the Air Force, for instance, to achieve annual savings of over $200 million and reduce its excess capacity from 45 percent to about 8 percent. In addition, our work has pointed out the benefits of outsourcing when careful economic analysis indicates the private sector can provide required support at less cost than a DOD activity can. For example, the Defense Logistics Agency has successfully taken steps to use prime vendors to supply personnel items directly to military facilities. The consumable items under these vendor programs account for 2 percent of the consumable items DOD manages. DOD’s prime vendor program for medical supplies, along with other inventory reduction efforts, has resulted in savings that we estimate exceed $700 million. More importantly, this program has moved DOD out of the inventory storage and distribution function for these supplies, thus emptying warehouses, eliminating unnecessary layers of inventory, and reducing the overall size of the DOD supply system. Also, service is improved because DOD buys only the items that are currently needed and consumers can order and receive inventory within hours of the time the items are used. While DOD has achieved benefits from outsourcing, it has been shown that adequate competition has been key to achieving significant reductions. Public-private competition studies by CNA have stressed this point. In its 1993 review of the Navy’s Commercial Activities Program, CNA noted that about half the competitions were won by the in-house team and that when competitions with no savings were excluded, the savings from contracts awarded to the public sector were 50 percent and those to the private sector were 40 percent. CNA officials concluded that because of competition both sectors were spurred to increase efficiency and reduce costs and DOD achieved greater savings. CNA also concluded that savings would have been less had the public sector been excluded from competition. Likewise, our review of DOD’s public-private competition program for depot maintenance determined that such competitions resulted in reduced costs. Facing increasing pressures to maintain market competitiveness, private companies have been reevaluating their organization and processes to cut costs and improve customer service. The most successful improvements include (1) using highly accurate information systems that provide cost, tracking, and control data; (2) consolidating and/or centralizing certain activities; (3) employing various methods to streamline work processes; and (4) shifting certain activities to third-party providers. Each company’s overall business strategy and assessment of “core competencies” guide which tools to use and how to use them. Private companies use a variety of approaches to meet their logistics support needs. For example, Southwest Airlines contracts out almost all maintenance, thus avoiding costly investments in facilities, personnel, and inventory. However, in contrast, having already made a significant investment in building infrastructure and training personnel, British Airways reached a different decision about its support operations. While it has sold off and/or outsourced some activities (namely engine repair and parts supply) and improved remaining in-house repair operations, the airline now has become a third-party supplier of aircraft overhaul. Whether the organization decides to consolidate, reengineer, or outsource activities, or to do some combination thereof, the private firms and consultants with whom we met stressed that identifying and understanding the organization’s core activities and obtaining accurate cost data for all in-house operations are critical to making informed business decisions and assessing overall performance. Core activities are those that are essential for meeting an organization’s mission. Before making decisions on what cost-saving options should be used, an organization should develop a performance-based, risk-adjusted analysis of benefits and costs for each option to provide (1) the foundation for comparing the baseline benefits and costs with proposed options and (2) a basis for decisionmakers to use in selecting a feasible option that meets performance goals. The organization should also factor into the analysis the barriers and risks in implementing the options. Thus, the best practice would be to make an outsourcing decision only after a core assessment and comprehensive cost-benefit analysis have been performed rather than to take a blanket approach and outsource everything in a certain area. PA&E’s analysis of the DSB’s estimated $6 billion in annual logistics savings found that the estimate was overstated by about $1 billion and that another $3 billion in projected savings would be difficult to achieve or unlikely to be achieved. According to PA&E officials, DSB’s $6-billion savings estimate was overstated by about $1 billion because contract administration and oversight costs were understated and one-time inventory savings (spread over 6 years) was claimed as steady state savings. Further, in assessing the degree of difficulty in achieving the savings, PA&E concluded that about $1 billion would be difficult to achieve, but was possible if Congress changed the required 60/40 public-private split to 50-50, which has since occurred. PA&E also believed that another $2 billion was unlikely to be saved primarily because of timing and DOD’s culture. It did not believe that DOD could carry out the proposals within the DSB’s 6-year schedule, if at all. PA&E’s assessment concluded that the remaining $2 billion of the DSB’s $6-billion savings estimate was achievable or already identified in DOD’s future year defense program. PA&E officials defined as achievable those savings that they believed could be realized given DSB’s 25-percent savings assumption and the then-current legal restrictions on outsourcing depot maintenance activities. About $0.2 billion in savings would involve maximizing the use of outsourcing under legislative constraints as they existed at that time, such as the 60/40 rule. The remainder of the achievable savings have already been identified in DOD’s future year defense program. Table 2 shows PA&E’s revised estimate of the DSB’s logistics savings. Our analysis confirms PA&E’s conclusion that the DSB’s logistics savings estimates are not well supported and are unlikely to be as large as estimated. Specifically, we found that (1) the Board’s projected annual savings from reliability improvements are overstated by over $1 billion; (2) the DSB’s 25-percent savings rate from outsourcing appears to be overly optimistic; and (3) DSB, while recognizing it would be difficult to do so, assumed that DOD would overcome impediments that prevent the outsourcing of all logistics functions. We do not know by how much or whether these questions would change the $2 billion in savings that PA&E concluded were achievable. In addition to overstating inventory management savings noted by PA&E, the DSB task force overstated its estimate of annual savings from equipment reliability improvements. The Board’s estimate of $1.5 billion in annual savings by year 2002 (6 years from the year of DSB’s study) is overstated by at least $1.2 billion. DSB based its estimate on a Logistics Management Institute (LMI) study that assessed the reductions of operation and support costs that result from improved reliability and maintainability due to technological advancements. Such advancements may include using improved materials and fewer component parts; thus reducing the number of spare purchases and the need for scheduled and unscheduled maintenance. Accomplishing these advancements requires an investment that must be evaluated in light of the expected return on investment. For its study, LMI assumed an aggressive technology improvement program. For example, it assumed a 9 to 1 return on investment that would accrue over 20 years, with savings starting the second year. Further, it assumed that any given investment would generate a savings stream for at least 10 years. Based on these assumptions and its analysis, LMI concluded that with an annual investment starting at $100 million and leveling at $500 million within 5 years, DOD could achieve $300 million in savings in the sixth year. DOD would not achieve the $1.5-billion savings that DSB included in its savings estimate until the fourteenth year. Thus, even without questioning LMI’s aggressive assumptions, the DSB’s savings estimate is overstated by at least $1.2 billion. DSB assumed that outsourcing all logistics activities would reduce DOD’s logistics costs by 25 percent. The Board based this projection on public-private competition studies, industry studies by such companies as Caterpillar and Boeing, and anecdotal evidence. While we believe that savings can be achieved through appropriate outsourcing, these savings are a result of competition rather than from outsourcing itself. The studies DSB cited were primarily for commercial activities—such as base operations, real property maintenance, and food service. As we have reported, these activities generally have highly competitive markets. For some logistics activities, such as nonship depot maintenance, our recent work has shown that competitive markets do not currently exist. To the extent that competitive markets do not exist, the amount of savings that can be generated through outsourcing may be reduced. As we reported in 1996, 76 percent of the 240 open depot maintenance contracts we examined were awarded noncompetitively (i.e., sole source). More recently, we reported that the percentage of noncompetitive depot maintenance contracts had increased for activities other than shipyards. For the three services, about 91 percent of the 15,346 new depot maintenance contracts awarded from the beginning of fiscal year 1996 to date were sole source. Moreover, the DSB recommended contractor logistics support arrangements for new and modified weapon systems. Our past work demonstrates that most contractor logistics support depot work is sole sourced to the original equipment manufacturer, raising cost and future competition concerns. Furthermore, eliminating the public sector from competition, as advocated by DSB, could further decrease savings. In developing its savings estimates for CONUS logistics, DSB assumed that DOD would outsource all logistics activity. However, certain barriers, including legal and cultural impediments, must be overcome to fully implement DSB’s recommendations. While it may be possible to implement DSB’s recommendations, in some cases, implementation may require congressional action, and in others, implementation may take substantially longer than DSB’s 6-year estimate. We did not quantify how much these impediments will reduce DSB’s savings, but consistent with PA&E’s analysis, these factors will mitigate portions of the projected savings. Although it recommended that essentially all logistics—including material management and depot maintenance, distribution, and other activities—be outsourced, DSB recognized that outsourcing is limited or precluded by various laws and regulations. For example, fundamental to determining whether or not to outsource is the identification of core functions and activities. Section 2464 of title 10 U.S.C. states that DOD activities should maintain the government-owned and government-operated core logistics capability necessary to maintain and repair weapon systems and other military equipment needed to fulfill national strategic and contingency plans. The delineation of core activities has historically proven to be extremely difficult. For example, proponents of increased privatization have questioned the justification for retaining many support activities as core and have recommended revising the core logistics requirement. Section 311 of the 1996 DOD Authorization Act directed the Secretary of Defense to develop a comprehensive depot maintenance policy, including a definition of DOD’s required core depot maintenance capability. While DOD has identified a process for determining core depot maintenance capability requirements, it has not completed its evaluation. Moreover, DOD has not developed a process for identifying core requirements for other logistics functions and activities. Thus, core requirements in these areas are also unknown. The 1998 DOD Authorization Act again requires that the Department identify its core depot maintenance requirements, this time under the new provisions described above. Additionally, 10 U.S.C. 2466 states that no more than 50 percent of the depot maintenance funds made available in a given fiscal year may be spent for depot maintenance conducted by nonfederal personnel. This provision, along with other relevant provisions significantly affects DSB’s savings estimate because about 50 percent of depot maintenance would not be subject to outsourcing. Section 2469 of title 10 states that DOD-performed depot maintenance and repair workloads valued at not less than $3 million cannot be changed to contractor-performed work without using competitive procedures that include both public and private entities. This requirement for public-private competition affects the DSB savings estimate because DSB assumed the requirement would be eliminated. The 1998 DOD Authorization Act also added a new section 2469a to title 10 that affects public-private competitions for certain workloads from closed or realigned installations. Further, during the congressional deliberation on the 1997 DOD Authorization Act, DOD provided Congress a list of statutory encumbrances to outsourcing, including 10 U.S.C. 2461, which requires studies and reports before converting public workloads to a contractor; 10 U.S.C. 2465, which prohibits contracts for performance of fire-fighting and security guard functions; section 317 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1987 (P.L. 99-661), which prohibits the Secretary of Defense from contracting for the functions performed at Crane Army Ammunition Activity or McAllister Army Ammunition Plant; 10 U.S.C. 4532, which requires the Army to have supplies made by factories and arsenals if they can do so economically; and 10 U.S.C. 2305 (a)(1), which specifies that in preparing for the procurement of property or services, the Secretary of Defense shall specify the agency’s needs and solicit bids or proposals in a manner designed to achieve full and open competition. DOD officials have repeatedly recognized the importance of using resources for the highest priority operational and investment needs rather than maintaining unneeded property, facilities, and overhead. However, DOD has found that infrastructure reductions, whether through outsourcing or some other means, are difficult and painful because achieving significant cost savings may require up-front investments, the closure of installations, and the elimination of military and civilian jobs. In addition, according to DOD officials, the military services fear that savings achieved from outsourcing would be diverted to support other DOD requirements and may not be available to the outsourcing organization to fund service needs. DSB recognized DOD’s cultural resistance to outsourcing logistics activities and said that overcoming resistance may take some time. DOD has a tradition of remarkable military achievement but it also has an entrenched culture that resists dramatic changes from well-established patterns of behavior. In 1992, we reported that academic experts and business executives generally agreed that a culture change is a long-term effort that takes at least 5 to 10 years to complete. Although a change in DOD’s management culture is underway, continual support of its top managers is critical to successful completion of cultural change. We agree with DSB that there are many opportunities for significant reductions in logistics infrastructure costs. However, the Board’s projected savings are overly optimistic. Further, savings opportunities from consolidating and reengineering must be considered in addition to outsourcing. Even though the Board recognized that there are impediments to outsourcing, PA&E’s and our analyses show that because of such impediments, not all logistics activities can be outsourced. This is particularly true for the legislative barriers—principally, the legislated workload mix between the public and private sectors. Moreover, PA&E’s and our analyses show estimating errors of about $1 billion for contract administration and inventory reductions and another $1 billion for reliability improvements. These combined adjustments will further reduce the Board’s projected savings by another 30 percent. Notwithstanding the problems with DSB’s estimates, DOD’s effort to reduce costs and achieve savings is extremely important, and we encourage DOD to move forward as quickly as possible to develop a realistic and achievable cost-reduction program. As discussed in our high-risk infrastructure report, breaking down cultural resistance to change, overcoming service parochialism, and setting forth a clear framework for a reduced defense infrastructure are key to effectively implementing savings. To aid in achieving the most savings possible, we recommend that the Secretary of Defense require the development of a detailed implementation plan for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of DOD’s logistics infrastructure, including reengineering, consolidating, outsourcing logistics activities where appropriate, and reducing excess infrastructure. We recommend that the plan establish time frames for identifying and evaluating alternative support options and implementing the most cost-effective solutions and identify required resources, including personnel and funding, for accomplishing the cost-reduction initiatives. We also recommend that DOD present the plan to Congress in much the same way it presented its force structure reductions in the Base Force Plan and the bottom-up review. This would provide Congress a basis to oversee DOD’s plan and would allow the affected parties to see what is going to happen and when. In commenting on a draft of this report (see app. II), DOD said that DSB had considered legal barriers to outsourcing and had expressly sought to identify the savings that could result if they were lifted. As noted in the report, we believe it is unlikely that the legal barriers cited would be lifted within the time frame DSB envisioned. DOD said that actions consistent with our recommendation were underway and there was no need for the recommended plan. Specifically, DOD said that the Secretary of Defense was preparing a more detailed plan for implementing the strategy formulated by QDR. Subsequently, on November 12, 1997, the Secretary of Defense announced the publication of the Defense Reform Initiative Report. This report contained the results of the task force on defense reform established as a result of QDR. The task force, which was charged with identifying ways to improve DOD’s organization and procedures, defined a series of initiatives in four major areas: reengineering, by adopting modern business practices to achieve world-class standards of performance; consolidating, by streamlining organizations to remove redundancy and competing, by applying market mechanisms to improve quality, reduce costs, and respond to customer needs; and eliminating infrastructure, by reducing excess support structure to free resources and focus on competencies. This report is a step in the right direction and sets forth certain strategic goals and direction. However, the intent of our recommendation was that a detailed implementation plan be developed, and we have modified our final recommendations accordingly. Our scope and methodology are provided in appendix I. We are sending copies of this report to interested congressional committees; the Secretaries of Defense, the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force; the Director of the Office of Management and Budget; and interested congressional committees. Copies will be made available to others upon request. Please contact me at (202) 512-8412 if you or your staff have any questions concerning this report. Major contributors to this report were James Wiggins, Julia Denman, Hilary Sullivan, and Jeffrey Knott. John Brosnan from our Office of General Counsel provided the legal review. The scope of our review was limited to reviewing the Defense Science Board’s (DSB) projected $6 billion annual savings for the continental United States (CONUS) logistics. To determine the basis of DSB’s savings estimate and recommendations, we reviewed the two DSB reports that made savings estimates based on outsourcing: Report of the Defense Science Board Task Force on Outsourcing and Privatization, August 28, 1996, and Report of the Defense Science Board 1996 Summer Study on Achieving an Innovative Support Structure for 21st Century Military Superiority: Higher Performance at Lower Costs, November 1996. We discussed the assumptions with task force members and reviewed supporting data that was available to us. We requested DSB task force minutes pertaining to these studies; however, we did not receive them in time to include them in our review. We reviewed the Center for Naval Analyses (CNA) studies of public-private competitions cited by DSB as well as CNA’s more recent studies and discussed those studies with CNA officials. A CNA official said that CNA analysts performed limited testing of the computer-generated data they had used in analyzing the results from the commercial activity competitions. He said that the data was reasonably accurate for the purposes of their studies. We did not independently verify the data used in CNA’s studies because we did not rely solely on CNA’s studies for our conclusions. To further evaluate DSB’s savings estimates and recommendations we (1) reviewed Program Analysis and Evaluation’s (PA&E) analysis and discussed that analysis and conclusions with PA&E officials and (2) reviewed the Logistics Management Institute’s (LMI) study, Using Technology to Reduce Cost of Ownership, Volume 1: Annotated Briefing (LG404RD4, April 1996), and discussed the studies’ assumptions and conclusions with LMI officials. In addition, we reviewed our past reports and testimony on depot maintenance, public-private competitions, and infrastructure reductions. To determine other infrastructure savings opportunities for the Department of Defense (DOD), we relied on our past reports and testimony on commercial “best practices,” public-private competitions, and depot maintenance. In addition, we also drew on ongoing work on outsourcing practices within the private sector. We performed our review at the following locations: Logistics Management Institute, Arlington, Va.; DOD’s Office of Maintenance Policy, Office of Program Analysis and Evaluation; and the Defense Science Board, Washington, D.C. We also had discussions with officials from the Center for Naval Analyses, Alexandria, Va. We conducted our review in July and August 1997, and, except where noted, in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

GAO noted that: (1) GAO agrees with the DSB that DOD can reduce the costs of its logistics activities through outsourcing and other initiatives; (2) DOD has already achieved over $700 million in savings from the use of a prime vendor program and other inventory-related reduction efforts for defense medical supplies; (3) according to studies by the Center for Naval Analyses, competition for work, including competition between the public sector and the private sector--regardless of which one wins--can result in cost savings; (4) many private-sector firms have successfully used outsourcing to reduce their costs of operations; (5) the DOD Program Analysis and Evaluation (PA&E) directorate's analysis shows, however, that the DSB's estimated annual savings of $6 billion is overstated by about $4 billion because of errors in estimates, overly optimistic savings assumptions, and legal and cultural impediments; (6) according to PA&E's analysis, this $4 billion includes: (a) $1 billion in overstated contract administration and oversight savings and one-time inventory savings; and (b) $3 billion in savings that would be unlikely or would be difficult to achieve within the Board's 6-year time frame, given certain legislative requirements and DOD's resistance to outsourcing all logistics functions; (7) GAO's analysis confirmed PA&E's conclusion that the Board's estimated savings were overstated; (8) GAO's analysis also raised questions about the Board's projected savings, but GAO does not know by how much or whether these questions would change the $2 billion in savings that PA&E concluded were achievable; (9) GAO questioned whether DOD would achieve a 25-percent savings from outsourcing, as the Board assumed, because the savings were based primarily on studies of public-private competitions in highly competitive private-sector markets; (10) however, competitive markets may not exist in some areas; (11) notwithstanding GAO's concerns about the magnitude of savings, DOD can make significant reductions in logistics costs; (12) the Secretary of Defense recently issued a strategic plan for achieving such reductions; (13) this report is a step in the right direction; and (14) DOD now needs an implementation plan based on a realistic assessment of the savings potential of various cost-reduction alternatives and the time frames for accomplishing various activities required to identify and implement the most cost-effective solutions."}

In recent years, many public and private price transparency initiatives have been initiated to provide consumers with information about the price of their health care services. Determining the price of a health care service often involves coordination between providers, insurers, and consumers. Providers, such as hospitals or physicians, charge consumers fees for the services they receive, which are known as billed charges. Payers, such as insurance companies, often have contractual agreements with providers under which the payers negotiate lower payment rates for a service on behalf of their members or beneficiaries. These rates are known as negotiated rates. In the case of Medicare specifically, CMS sets the program’s payment rates for providers based on a formula that includes several factors, such as geographic location. For consumers with health insurance, their out-of-pocket costs for a health care service is determined by the amount of cost sharing specified in the benefits of their health insurance plan for services covered by the insurer. For consumers who lack health insurance, they are often billed for the full amount charged by the provider, such as a billed charge from a hospital. The estimated out-of-pocket cost for an uninsured consumer will typically be the billed charge for a health care service minus any charity care or discounts that may be applied by the provider. Providers and payers often price health care services using the various codes used by health care professionals. For example, physicians may bill for their services based on Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes developed by the American Medical Association. Individual health care services, such as those referred to by individual CPT codes, can be grouped or bundled together into an episode of care, which refers to a group of health care services associated with a patient’s condition over a defined period of time. An episode of care for a knee replacement, for example, includes multiple services such as those provided during the actual surgery, as well as preoperation and postoperation consultations. The episode of care would also include services provided by various providers who typically bill separately, such as a hospital, surgeon, and anesthesiologist. PPACA requires HHS to develop a national pilot program, which may include bundled payments for episodes of care surrounding certain hospitalizations, in order to improve the coordination, quality, and efficiency of health care services. According to researchers, it is important for consumers to have access to quality of care and other information to provide context to the price information and help consumers in their decision making. For example, according to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), appropriate quality of care information for consumers may include the mortality rates for a specific procedure, the percentage of patients with surgical complications or postoperative infections, or the average length of stay, among other measures. By combining quality and price information, some researchers argue that consumers can then use this information to choose providers with the highest quality and the lowest price—thereby obtaining the greatest value when purchasing care. Furthermore, some research suggests that information on volume (the number of services performed) may be used as an indication of quality for certain procedures. This assumes a positive association between the number of times a provider administers a service and the quality of the service provided. Information about previous patients’ satisfaction with a provider’s service can also help consumers make decisions about their health care. Public price transparency initiatives often began in response to laws or orders requiring an agency or organization to make price information available to consumers, while private sector initiatives started primarily through voluntary efforts. For example, in response to a 2006 federal executive order to promote quality and efficiency in federal health care programs, federal agencies that administer or sponsor a health care program were directed, among other things, to make available to enrollees the prices paid for health care services. In response, agencies including HHS (including its component agencies such as CMS and AHRQ) and OPM began to make health care price information available. Similarly, over 30 states have proposed or enacted some type of price transparency legislation, though what is actually required varies greatly across the states. For example, some states, such as Colorado and South Dakota, require hospitals to disclose, upon request, the expected or average price for the treatment requested. In contrast, some states, such as Maine and Minnesota, require that certain health care price information be made publicly available through an Internet website. While many public price transparency initiatives began as a result of legislation, private sector price transparency initiatives, such as insurance company initiatives, were established voluntarily for various reasons. For example, insurance officials that we spoke with said their price transparency initiatives started for reasons such as increased interest from employers to curb costs, to gain a competitive edge over other insurance companies without price transparency initiatives, and to help their members become better health care consumers. Other private price transparency initiatives, such as Health Care Blue Book and PriceDoc, were started to help consumers find and negotiate fair prices for health care services. Though both public and private price transparency initiatives have become more widespread in the last 5 years, some research suggests that even if consumers have access to price information, such as price information made available by these initiatives, they may not use such information in their decision making. For example, insured consumers may be less sensitive to prices, since the financial costs of selecting one provider over another may be borne by the insurer, not the consumer. Despite these concerns, some research indicates that consumers want access to price information before they receive health care services and have tried to use price information to some degree to inform their decision making. Furthermore, research states that incentives may be helpful to further consumers’ use of transparent price information. Specifically, financial incentives may include insurers providing lower out-of-pocket costs for their members if they select low-price, high-quality providers. Several health care and legal factors can make it difficult for consumers to obtain price information—in particular, estimates of their complete costs—for health care services before the services are provided. The health care factors include the difficulty of predicting in advance all the services that will be provided for an episode of care and billing services from multiple providers separately. In addition, according to researchers and officials we interviewed, legal factors, such as contractual obligations, may prevent insurers and providers from making available their negotiated rates, which can be used to estimate consumers’ complete costs. One factor that may make it difficult for consumers to obtain estimates of their complete costs for a health care service is that it may be difficult for providers to predict which services a patient will need in advance. Specifically, physicians often do not decide what services their patients will need until after examining them. Researchers and officials we spoke with commented that health care services are not standardized across all patients because of each patient’s unique circumstances, which influence the specific services a physician would recommend. For example, when we anonymously contacted 20 physicians’ offices to obtain information on the price of a diabetes screening, several representatives said the patient needs to be seen by a physician before the physician would know what tests the patient would need. In addition, even after identifying what health care service or services a patient may need, additional aspects associated with the delivery of a service may be difficult to predict in advance, such as the length of time a patient stays in a hospital. This factor can make it challenging for providers to estimate consumers’ complete costs in advance. For example, when we anonymously contacted 19 hospitals to obtain information on the price of a full knee replacement surgery, several hospital representatives quoted a range of prices, from about $33,000 to about $101,000. The representatives explained that the price for the procedure could vary based on a variety of factors, such as the time the patient will be in the operating room and the type of anesthetic the patient may receive, and some noted that they would need to know this information if they were to provide a more specific price estimate. Several hospital and physician office representatives we spoke with recommended that insured consumers contact their insurer for complete cost information; however, the inability to predict which health care services will be needed in advance also makes it challenging for insurers to provide complete cost estimates. Officials from an insurer association commented that, if asked by their members for cost estimates, insurance company representatives may require more information—such as the CPT codes for the services a patient will receive—before the insurers can provide a cost estimate. However, in the instances when providers cannot predict in advance the codes for which they will bill, consumers will be unable to provide the respective codes to insurers and obtain complete cost estimates from them. Another factor is that many services included in one episode of care may be provided by multiple providers, such as a hospital and surgeon, who bill for their services separately. This makes obtaining complete cost information challenging because, in these cases, consumers may have to contact multiple providers to obtain estimates of their complete costs. Many providers can only give price estimates in advance for the services that they provide, and are often unaware of the prices for services performed by other providers. For example, when we contacted hospitals anonymously for the price of a full knee replacement, none were able to provide information on the complete cost to consumers for this service. The hospital representatives we contacted who could provide price information were only able to provide us with the hospital’s estimated charges or a Medicare deductible amount for the service and could not provide us with the charges associated with the other providers involved in the service, such as a surgeon or anesthesiologist. Charges from these providers are typically billed separately from the hospital’s charges, even though some of these services are provided in the hospital. Similarly, when we called physicians’ offices to obtain information on the price of a diabetes screening, most representatives could not tell us how much the associated lab fees would cost and some noted that this was because the lab fees are billed separately. Several hospital and physician office representatives we spoke with suggested we contact the other providers, such as a surgeon or lab, separately in order to obtain information on the price of these services. However, officials from a provider association questioned how consumers would even know which providers to contact to get price information if the consumers do not know all of the different providers who are involved in an episode of care in advance. Lastly, consumers may have difficulty obtaining complete cost estimates from providers because providers are often unaware of these costs due to the variety of insured consumers’ health benefit structures. For example, according to officials from a provider association, physicians may have difficulty accessing insured consumers’ health benefit plan information, and thus may not be able to provide estimates of consumers’ out-of- pocket costs under their specific benefit plans. For example, officials stated that for physicians to inform a patient about the price of a health care service in advance they have to know the status of consumers’ cost sharing under their specific health benefit plan, such as how much consumers have spent in out-of-pocket costs or towards their deductible at any given time. Without this information, physicians may have difficulty providing accurate out-of-pocket estimates for insured consumers. In addition, different consumers may have out-of-pocket costs that vary within the same benefit plan, which adds to the variety of potential costs a patient could have, and creates complexity for providers in providing complete cost estimates to consumers. Officials from provider associations commented that insurers should be responsible for providing complete cost information to their insured customers because insurers can provide price information specific to insured consumers’ situations. However, insurers may also have difficulty estimating consumers’ complete costs. Specifically, according to a 2007 report by the Healthcare Financial Management Association, many insurers do not have data systems that are capable of calculating real- time estimates of complete costs for their members prior to receiving a service. As a result, insurers may have difficulty maintaining real-time data on how much their members have paid towards their deductibles, which could affect an estimate of the complete cost. Additionally, according to officials from an insurance company, it is difficult for insurers to estimate complete costs when insured customers receive services from providers that are outside of the insurer’s network. These estimates may be difficult to provide because insurers have not negotiated a rate with providers out of the insurer’s network, and thus may be unaware of these providers’ billed charges before a service is given. Officials from an insurance company explained that this concern is especially a problem for their members who go to an in-network hospital and are seen by a nonparticipating physician within that hospital during their visit. The officials explained that this can occur without the patient’s knowledge because patients often do not choose certain providers, such as radiologists or anesthesiologists, and consumers may be faced with significant out-of-pocket costs. Researchers and officials we interviewed identified several legal factors that may prevent providers and insurers from sharing negotiated rates, which can be used to estimate consumers’ complete costs. First, some officials stated that some contractual obligations between insurers and providers prohibit the disclosure of negotiated rates with anyone outside of the contracting entities, such as an insurer’s members. Specifically, most officials representing insurance companies have reported that some hospitals have included contractual obligations in their agreements with insurers that restrict insurers from disclosing negotiated rates to their members. For example, some insurance company officials we interviewed told us that these contractual obligations prohibited the sharing of specific information on negotiated rates between providers and insurers on their price transparency initiatives’ websites. Officials from one insurance company said that they generally accept these contractual obligations, particularly in the case of hospitals that have significant market leverage, because they do not want to exclude these hospitals from their networks. Second, some of the officials and researchers we spoke with reported that providers and insurers may be concerned with sharing their negotiated rates, considered proprietary information, which may be protected by law from unauthorized disclosure. Some officials and researchers we spoke with suggest that without these rates, it could be more difficult for consumers to obtain complete cost estimates. According to officials from an insurer association, proprietary information such as negotiated rates may be prohibited from being shared under the Uniform Trade Secrets Act, which many states have adopted to protect the competitive advantage of the entities involved. These laws are designed to protect against the wrongful disclosure or wrongful appropriation of trade secrets, which may include negotiated rates. For example, if a hospital was aware that another hospital negotiated a higher rate with the same insurance company, then the lower-priced hospital could seek out higher negotiated rates which may eliminate the first hospital’s competitive advantage. Conversely, if officials from an insurance company were aware that another insurer paid the same hospital a lower rate for a given service, the higher-paying insurer may try to negotiate lower payment rates with that hospital. Lastly, some researchers and officials noted that antitrust law concerns may discourage providers and insurers from making negotiated rates public. For example, some insurance company officials we spoke with expressed concerns that sharing negotiated rates publicly would give multiple competing providers access to each other’s rates, and therefore could lead to collusion in price negotiations between providers and insurers. According to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Department of Justice (DOJ)—the principal federal agencies enforcing the antitrust laws—antitrust laws aim to protect and promote competition by preventing businesses from acting together in ways that can limit competition. Joint guidance from FTC and DOJ indicates that without appropriate safeguards, exchanges of price information—which insurance company officials told us could include negotiated rates—among competing providers may present the risk that competing providers communicate with each other regarding a mutually acceptable level of prices for health care services or compensation for employees. Although some officials and researchers noted that antitrust laws may discourage making negotiated rates public, the FTC and DOJ guidance also identifies circumstances in which exchanges of health care price information—that could include negotiated rates—are unlikely to raise significant antitrust concerns. These circumstances require the collecting of price information by a third-party entity and ensuring that any information disseminated is aggregated such that it would not allow recipients to identify the prices charged by an individual provider. Under these circumstances, consumers may not be hindered in their ability to have information that will allow them to make informed decisions about their health care. The price information made available to consumers by the eight selected price transparency initiatives varies, in large part due to differences in the price data available to each initiative. Additionally, we found that few of the selected initiatives are able to provide estimates of consumers’ complete costs, primarily due to limitations of the price data that they use and other obstacles. The eight public and private price transparency initiatives that we examined vary in the price information they make available to consumers. (See table 2.) Three public initiatives in California, Florida, and Wisconsin make information available on hospitals’ billed charges, which are typically the amounts hospitals bill payers and patients for services before any negotiated or reduced payment discounts are applied. In general, hospitals’ billed charges do not reflect the amount most payers and patients ultimately pay for the service. Two private initiatives administered by Aetna and Anthem provide their members with price information based on their contracts with providers, and this information reflects the insurer’s negotiated discounts. Similarly, the federal initiative provides price information based on Medicare payment rates. Initiatives in Massachusetts and New Hampshire provide price information, based on payments made to providers, using claims data, and these prices reflect any negotiated discounts or other reductions off the billed charges. Despite differences in the types of price information they provide, the selected initiatives are generally similar in the types of services for which they provided price information, with most providing price information only for a limited set of hospital or surgical services that are common, comparable, or planned in advance, such as a knee replacement or a diagnostic test. Various factors help explain the differences in the types of price information made available by the selected initiatives. In some cases, the initiatives provide certain types of price information because of the price data available to them, generally through state law. For example, the Wisconsin initiative provides price information based on hospitals’ billed charges because the state contracted with the Wisconsin Hospital Association (WHA) to collect and disseminate hospital information, including hospitals’ billed charges, when the state privatized hospital data collection. WHA saw this as an opportunity to develop a price transparency initiative that reported billed charges for consumers. In both California and Florida, initiative officials said that state laws enabled the state to collect and make hospitals’ billed charges public and this gave the states the authority to make this information available to consumers. In Massachusetts, officials said that 2006 state health reform legislation provided the state with the necessary authority to collect claims data for the price transparency initiative. In other cases, the price information the initiatives provide reflects choices made by initiative officials regarding the types of information that they considered would be most helpful to consumers. For example, in developing Hospital Compare, CMS officials chose to provide price information based on Medicare payment rates to hospitals because, according to officials, this information would be more helpful than hospitals’ retrospective billed charges for Medicare patients. The officials explained that hospitals’ billed charges are too divergent from what Medicare and insurance companies actually pay for the same service, and CMS officials reasoned that Medicare rates could give consumers, particularly those without insurance, a point of comparison from which they may be able to negotiate lower prices with providers. In New Hampshire, officials said they successfully sought legislation to get access to claims data from all payers in the state to establish an All Payer Claims Database (APCD) for their initiative. Based on an earlier experience with posting billed charges and feedback from consumers, New Hampshire officials were convinced that billed charges were not useful for insured consumers. Additionally, some factors that may limit access to certain price data also limit how the price information is presented to consumers. For example, some of the selected initiatives, such as Florida and Anthem, present price information as a range, which avoids providing a specific price that providers may consider proprietary. Anthem officials further noted that the primary reason the initiative provides price information as a range is so that the price information can better reflect for consumers the billing variation and differences in treatment decisions that occur when health care services are delivered to different patients. In Massachusetts, the initiative combines the claims, or prices paid, by commercial insurers for that specific hospital service and reports a provider’s median price as well as a range of prices paid for that service. Officials explained that they present aggregated price information across all health plans to avoid disclosing prices that may raise proprietary concerns among providers and insurers. In another approach, the two initiatives by New Hampshire and Aetna bundle multiple services typically performed at the same time into the price presented, such as bundling all associated costs for a hip replacement surgery. By doing so, New Hampshire officials said that they are able to mask the specific rates paid for individual items, and avoid proprietary concerns, while providing an easily understandable estimate for the total health care service. Lastly, officials from the Aetna and Anthem initiatives cited provider resistance as limiting the extent to which they can make price information available to their members for all providers in the insurers’ networks—with provider-imposed contractual obligations requiring the Aetna and Anthem initiatives to omit price information for certain providers in the initiatives’ websites’ search results. In addition to providing the price of a service, most selected initiatives also provide a wide range of nonprice information, such as information on quality of care measures or patient volume. Five of the eight selected initiatives provide quality information for consumers to consider along with price when making decisions about a provider. (See table 3.) In addition to providing quality and volume measures, initiatives also shared information, such as resources for understanding and using price information, including explanations of the source and limitations of the price data, glossaries, and medical encyclopedias. Initiatives also provided a range of supplementary financial information to give context to the price information provided. For example, Massachusetts’ initiative presents symbols ($, $$, $$$) to indicate how the provider’s price compares to the state median for that service in an effort to provide what officials described as more easily understood price information for consumers who are familiar with graphical ratings systems. Additionally, Wisconsin’s initiative provides pie charts representing the percentage different payer types—such as private insurers, Medicare, and Medicaid—paid to a specific hospital in relation to the total billed charges, which indicates at an aggregate level the extent of discounts given by payer category. Some officials expressed reservations about how consumers may use price and quality information together. Insurance company officials we spoke with see linking price to quality information as a means for consumers to identify high-value providers and for the company to create more cost-efficient provider networks. In Hospital Compare, however, quality data and price data are not linked. CMS officials said that while quality data are featured prominently on Hospital Compare, price information is featured less prominently. CMS officials explained that promoting price information to consumers, in the absence of greater consumer education about how to understand price information in relation to quality, could lead consumers to select high-priced providers due to an assumption that price is indicative of quality. Due to similar concerns that consumers may assume that a higher price is a sign of higher quality, Aetna’s initiative provides information to educate consumers that high quality and low price are not mutually exclusive. Lastly, in addition to the variety of price and other information made available by the selected initiatives, the initiatives also vary in terms of who has access to the initiatives’ websites and in terms of their expected audiences. For example, the price information provided by the federal initiative we selected is available to all consumers through a publicly available website. CMS officials said the expected audience of this initiative includes insured and uninsured consumers, researchers, Medicare beneficiaries, and providers. Like the federal initiative, all of the selected state initiatives’ websites are publicly available, although they include price information only for their particular state. In contrast, the price information provided by the two selected insurance company initiatives’ websites are accessible to their members, but not to the general public. Few of the selected initiatives provide estimates of consumers’ complete costs, which is price information that incorporates any negotiated discounts; is inclusive of all costs associated with a particular health care service, such as hospital, physician, and lab fees; and identifies consumers’ out-of-pocket costs. (See table 4.) Specifically, of our eight selected initiatives, only the Aetna and New Hampshire initiatives provide estimates of a consumer’s complete cost. The two initiatives are able to provide this information in part because they have access to and use price data—negotiated rates and claims data, respectively—that allow them to provide consumers with a price for the service by each provider that is inclusive of any negotiated discounts or reduced payments made to the billed charge. Specifically, Aetna bases its price data on its contractual rates with providers, which include negotiated discounts. New Hampshire provides price information based on its records of closed claims of particular providers for particular services under a consumer’s specific health insurance plan. Both initiatives use claims data to identify all of the hospital, physician, and lab fees associated with the services for which they provide price information. For calculating estimated out-of- pocket costs, Aetna links member data to its price transparency website, which automatically updates and calculates the member’s estimated out- of-pocket costs in real-time based on the provider and service reported, and the member’s partially exhausted deductibles. In contrast, to calculate out-of-pocket costs, insured users of New Hampshire’s initiative’s website enter their insurance plan, their deductible amount, and their percentage rate of co-insurance. New Hampshire’s Health Cost website then uses that information to calculate an out-of-pocket cost, along with a total cost for the service by provider. Both initiatives demonstrate that while providing complete cost information presents challenges, it can be done—either as undertaken by Aetna for its members or as carried out by New Hampshire, which makes complete cost information available through publicly accessible means. As table 4 shows, six of the eight initiatives that we reviewed do not provide estimates of consumers’ complete costs. The reasons for this vary by initiative, but are primarily due to the limitations of the price data that each initiative uses. For example, initiatives in California, Florida, and Wisconsin provide price information based on billed charges from hospitals, which do not reflect discounts negotiated by payers and providers, all associated costs (such as physician fees), and out-of-pocket costs. An official representing Wisconsin’s initiative said that WHA commonly receives requests from consumers to include physician fees in the price estimate, but the initiative does not have access to these price data, as they are part of a separate billing process and the hospitals do not have these data to submit. California officials said that collecting claims data from insurers would require additional legal authority, raise proprietary concerns, and pose resource challenges. Florida officials acknowledged that providing a billed charge is not as meaningful for consumers as other types of price data, such as claims data. However, while Florida officials have the authority to collect claims data, they said that at this time they are limited from pursuing such information due to the expected financial costs of collecting and storing the data and the challenges of overcoming the proprietary concerns of providers and insurers. Florida officials characterized their initiative’s inability to report out-of-pocket costs as a major limitation. The federal initiative provides price information that reflects what Medicare pays to hospitals for a given service but does not reflect what consumers, including Medicare beneficiaries, would pay out-of-pocket. CMS officials said that providing out-of-pocket costs was too complicated to calculate in advance due to consumers’ medical variation and technological limitations. In contrast, other initiatives have access to data that may enable the initiatives to provide more complete cost estimates to consumers, but certain factors limit the extent to which this type of information is made available. For example, the Massachusetts initiative has access to claims data that could be used to provide more complete cost estimates to consumers, such as negotiated discounts for commercial insurers. However, it presents price information that aggregates the prices paid by commercial insurers for particular services, in part due to insurers’ and providers’ concerns about the initiative disclosing price information by insurer. As a result, consumers are unable to see an estimate for a particular provider that is specific to their insurance company or to calculate their out-of pocket costs based on their specific plan. The officials noted that providers’ and insurers’ resistance to publicly reporting payments made by insurers may also be a challenge for states seeking access to more meaningful price information for their initiatives, such as claims data. Lastly, Anthem’s initiative does provide a price inclusive of all associated fees and negotiated discounts, but currently does not use the specific details of consumers’ insurance plan benefits, such as their deductible, copayment, or coinsurance, to estimate consumers’ out-of- pocket costs. Transparent health care price information—especially estimates of consumers’ complete costs—can be difficult for consumers to obtain prior to receiving care. For example, when we contacted hospitals and physicians to obtain price information for two common services, we generally received only incomplete estimates, which are insufficient for helping consumers to anticipate all of the costs associated with these services or to make more informed decisions about their health care. Our review identified various health care and legal factors that can make it difficult for consumers to obtain meaningful health care price information, such as estimates of consumers’ complete costs, in advance of receiving services. This lack of health care price transparency presents a serious challenge for consumers who are increasingly being asked to pay a greater share of their health care costs. Despite the complexities of doing so, two of the eight price transparency initiatives we examined were able to make complete cost estimates available to consumers. Making meaningful health care price information available to consumers is important, and the fact that two initiatives have been able to do it suggests that this is an attainable goal. To promote health care price transparency, HHS is currently supporting various efforts to make price information available to consumers—including the CMS initiative in our review—and the agency is expected to do more in this area in the future. We note in our review, for example, that HHS provides price information on insurance plans through its healthcare.gov website. Similarly, CMS’s web-based Medicare Part D Plan Finder also provides information on prescription drug prices and CMS’s Health Care Consumer Initiatives provide information on the price Medicare pays for common health care services at the county and state levels. In the near future, HHS’s price transparency efforts are expected to expand. For example, PPACA requires HHS to provide oversight and guidance for the Exchanges that are expected to provide certain price information for consumers through participating insurers. PPACA also directs HHS to develop a pilot program which may include bundled payments, providing another possible opportunity for price transparency. In total, HHS has several opportunities to promote greater health care price transparency for consumers. As HHS implements its current and forthcoming efforts to make transparent price information available to consumers, we recommend that HHS take the following two actions:  Determine the feasibility of making estimates of complete costs of health care services available to consumers through any of these efforts.  Determine, as appropriate, the next steps for making estimates of complete costs of health care services available to consumers. HHS reviewed a draft of this report and provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate.

To obtain illustrative examples of factors that influence the availability of health care price information for consumers, we anonymously contacted hospitals and primary care physicians with zip codes located in the Denver, Colorado, health care market. We requested the price of a full knee replacement from hospitals and the price of a diabetes screening from primary care physicians. We requested these prices for patients without insurance and for patients with Medicare (without supplemental health insurance). Specifically, we called 19 hospitals and 20 primary care physicians between February 28 and March 10, 2011, and contacted each provider up to three times in an attempt to get a response. We determined that we obtained a response from representatives if they answered the phone or they transferred us to a price quote voice mail message that requested specific information from us about the requested service so representatives could call back with cost estimates. In cases where we were asked to provide more information, such as in the case of receiving a price quote voice mail, we did not provide such information in order to help maintain our anonymity. We considered hospitals and physicians nonresponsive if no one answered the phone, or if we received a voice mail message that did not indicate what we needed to provide in order to receive price information, in all three attempts. We received a response from representatives at 17 of the 19 hospitals we contacted. Of the 17 hospital representatives that responded, 10 did not provide any type of price information. None of the hospital representatives could provide a complete cost estimate for a full knee replacement, meaning the price given was not reflective of any negotiated discounts, was not inclusive of all associated costs, and did not identify consumers’ out-of-pocket costs. Almost all of the hospital representatives that responded (14 of 17) required more information from us to provide a complete cost estimate, such as current procedural terminology (CPT) codes, the length of time in the operating room, the model of knee used, or what kind of anesthetic would be provided, which we did not provide. Of the 7 hospital representatives that were able to provide some price information, 5 provided billed charges in either a range, such as between $32,974.73 and $100,676.50 or an average charge, such as $82,390, which is typically reflective of what an uninsured consumer would pay. (See table 5 for more information.) We received a response from 18 of the 20 representatives we contacted. Of the physician representatives that responded, most could provide some type of price information (14 of 18), but only 4 out of 18 representatives who responded could provide a complete cost estimate for a diabetes screening. Most representatives who responded (13 of 18) required more\n\n### Summary:\n\n", "answer": "In recent years, consumers have become responsible for a growing proportion of the costs of their health care. Health care price information that is transparent--available before consumers receive care--may help consumers anticipate these costs. Research identifies meaningful types of health care price information, such as estimates of what the complete cost will be to the consumer for a service. GAO defines an estimate of a consumer's complete health care cost as price information on a service that identifies a consumer's out-of-pocket cost, including any negotiated discounts, and all costs associated with a service or services. GAO examined (1) how various factors affect the availability of health care price information for consumers and (2) the information selected public and private health care price transparency initiatives make available to consumers. To do this work, GAO reviewed price transparency literature; interviewed experts; and examined a total of eight selected federal, state, and private insurance company health care price transparency initiatives. In addition, GAO anonymously contacted providers and requested the price of selected services to gain a consumer's perspective. Several health care and legal factors may make it difficult for consumers to obtain price information for the health care services they receive, particularly estimates of what their complete costs will be. The health care factors include the difficulty of predicting health care services in advance, billing from multiple providers, and the variety of insurance benefit structures. For example, when GAO contacted physicians' offices to obtain information on the price of a diabetes screening, several representatives said the patient needs to be seen by a physician before the physician could determine which screening tests the patient would need. According to provider association officials, consumers may have difficulty obtaining complete cost estimates from providers because providers have to know the status of insured consumers' cost sharing under health benefit plans, such as how much consumers have spent towards their deductible at any given time. In addition to the health care factors, researchers and officials identified several legal factors that may prevent the disclosure of negotiated rates between insurers and providers, which may be used to estimate consumers' complete costs. For example, several insurance company officials GAO interviewed said that contractual obligations with providers may prohibit the sharing of negotiated rates with the insurer's members on their price transparency initiatives' websites. Similarly, some officials and researchers told GAO that providers and insurers may be concerned with sharing negotiated rates due to the proprietary nature of the information and because of antitrust law concerns. The eight public and private price transparency initiatives GAO examined, selected in part because they provide price information on a specific health care service by provider, vary in the price information they make available to consumers. These initiatives include one administered by HHS, which is also expected to expand its price transparency efforts in the future. The price information made available by the selected initiatives ranges from hospitals' billed charges, which are the amounts hospitals bill for services before any discounts are applied, to prices based on insurance companies' contractually negotiated rates with providers, to prices based on claims data that report payments made to a provider for that service. The price information varies, in large part, due to limits reported by the initiatives in their access or authority to collect certain price data. In addition to price information, most of the selected initiatives also provide a variety of nonprice information, such as quality data on providers, for consumers to consider along with price when making decisions about a provider. Lastly, GAO found that two of the selected initiatives--one publicly available with information only for a particular state and one available to members of a health insurance plan--are able to provide an estimate of a consumer's complete cost. The two initiatives are able to provide this information in part because of the type of data to which they have access--claims data and negotiated rates, respectively. For the remaining initiatives, they either do not use more meaningful price data or are constrained by other factors, including concerns about disclosing what providers may consider proprietary information. As HHS continues and expands its price transparency efforts, it has opportunities to promote more complete cost estimates for consumers. GAO recommends that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) determine the feasibility of making estimates of complete costs of health care services available to consumers, and, as appropriate, identify next steps. HHS reviewed a draft of this report and provided technical comments, which GAO incorporated as appropriate."}
